DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been…forgetting things. Little things at first, but it's getting more noticeable, and it worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Forgetfulness can be caused by many things, and it’s always best to figure out what's going on. Don’t be embarrassed at all – we’re here to help. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about these “little things” you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm…okay. Well, like, I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll start a sentence and…the word just won’t come. It's not all the time, but enough that my sister pointed it out. She said I repeated a story twice at dinner last week, which I didn't even realize. It’s… frustrating, mostly. And a little scary, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand why that would be frustrating and a little scary. Repeating stories and forgetting why you went into a room are definitely things we want to explore. Just to get a complete picture, has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradually getting worse over time?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I think…gradually. It wasn’t like a switch flipped. It started maybe six months ago, with just occasionally misplacing things. Now…it’s more than that. It’s definitely gotten worse in the last couple of months, though. Like, noticeably worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, gradually worsening, with a noticeable increase in the last couple of months. That's helpful. Besides the memory issues and repeating stories, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. I’ve been a little more clumsy lately, I think. Dropping things, bumping into furniture. Nothing major, but my sister teased me about being all thumbs the other day. And… I don’t know if this is related, but I feel more tired than usual. Even after a good night’s sleep, I just feel… drained.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness and increased fatigue… okay. Those are good things to mention. Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was it. Otherwise, pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well, I walk most days, and I don’t smoke. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, otherwise healthy, regular exercise, and occasional wine. That’s good to know. The wine is good information, thank you. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if my joints are bothering me, I’ll take ibuprofen. But that’s it, really. I try to avoid medication whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin daily and ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My sister is allergic to peanuts, so we’re always careful around those, but I don’t have any allergies myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, to get a better understanding of your family history, are there any instances of memory loss or neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she got very confused towards the end of her life. We just assumed it was old age, but now I wonder… I don’t know if it was Alzheimer’s or something else. No one really talked about it much. My mother didn't mention anything specific, and she's passed away now. On my father's side, I don't really know much about their health history, to be honest. He wasn't very forthcoming about things.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible memory loss in your maternal grandmother, but no definitive diagnosis, and limited information about your father’s side of the family. That’s helpful, thank you. It's common for family medical histories to be incomplete. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you work?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I’m a dentist. General practice, mostly. It can be stressful, but I enjoy it. I've been doing it for about fifteen years now. Though, I've noticed it's getting harder to concentrate sometimes, which is… worrying, given my job.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, being a dentist requires a lot of concentration! Fifteen years is a good stretch of time. Now, thinking about your social life and habits, do you have a lot of social interaction, or are you more solitary?
PATIENT: I have a good group of friends, thankfully. We get together a couple of times a month for dinner or a movie. And I see my sister pretty regularly. I wouldn't say I'm a hermit, definitely. I think staying busy helps keep my mind sharp, but lately, even that doesn’t seem to be enough. It's a little unnerving.
DOCTOR: That's good, staying socially active is definitely beneficial. Okay, Ms. Heidenthal, thank you for answering those questions. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam to assess your reflexes, balance, coordination, and memory. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what's going on, if that's possible. Please let me know if anything feels… weird. I'm a little nervous, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly normal to be nervous. We’ll take it slow, and you can stop me anytime if you feel uncomfortable. First, I'm just going to check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we'll move onto some basic coordination tests - like touching your nose with your eyes closed, and walking a straight line. And finally, I'll ask you a few questions to assess your short-term and long-term memory. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. I think I can manage all that. Just… please be patient with me if I struggle. It's a little embarrassing, but… there you go. Let's get started.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take our time. Okay, everything looks good there. Now, let’s move onto the coordination tests. First, can you close your eyes and touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Okay. Oh, whoops. A little off. Sorry. I'm usually better at this. It feels… strange, like I don’t quite know where my nose is. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it happens. It's good you noticed. Let's try another one. Okay, a little better that time. Now, let’s move onto the next test. Can you stand up and walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Okay. Whoa… okay, that was harder than I thought. I almost fell. I'm usually pretty steady on my feet. It feels like my balance is… off. Sorry, am I making a fool of myself?
DOCTOR: No, you’re not making a fool of yourself at all. It’s important to me to know where your current baseline is. Okay, just one more test and then we’ll move onto the memory questions. Can you stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Okay. Whoa, this is… really difficult. I can't stand still for very long, I can feel myself wobbling. I'm afraid I’m going to fall. Do I need to sit down?
DOCTOR: Yes, please, let’s sit down. Okay, that’s alright. It’s good to know your limits. Let's move onto the memory questions. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your short-term and long-term memory. First, can you tell me the year?
PATIENT: It’s… 2025. August 2nd, 2025, right? Today is August 2nd, 2025.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s correct. Now, can you tell me the names of three objects that I place on the table?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… a pen… a key… and an orange. Is that right? I think so. It's a little hard to focus, everything feels… blurry. I apologize if I'm not making any sense. Is it okay if I ask you to repeat?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It’s perfectly fine to ask me to repeat. Now, I’m going to ask you a series of questions about your personal history. What city were you born in?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. I was born in… Munich. Yes, Munich, Germany.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you tell me what year you graduated from dental school?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… that was… 2010? No, 2008? I think it was 2008. Maybe 2011? I'm so sorry, I'm really struggling to remember. It's like it's… locked away. Is this bad?
DOCTOR: It's okay. It’s alright. Don’t worry. We’re just gathering information. It’s not a test. It's good you’re letting me know that this is difficult. Okay, Ms. Heidenthal, that's enough for now. Thank you for your patience and honesty. I think we have enough information for today. Let me review everything and then we can discuss our next steps. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being so patient with me. I'm… just really worried, to be honest. It’s frightening not being able to remember things.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s perfectly normal to feel frightened when experiencing memory loss. We’ll work together to figure out what’s going on. I'm going to step out now and review your chart. I’ll be back shortly to discuss the next steps. Please make yourself comfortable. .
