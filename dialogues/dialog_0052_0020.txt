DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. Is… is that how you say it? Very nice to meet you too. Well, I am here for this… this talk on the computer. My neighbor, she said I should do this. Something about checking things… from home? I am not so good with these new things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, "Shelly" is perfectly fine. And you are very welcome. It sounds like your neighbor was referring to a telehealth visit, or a virtual check-up. It’s a way for us to review your health information and discuss any concerns you may have, using the computer as a tool. Before we delve into that, I’d like to get a more complete picture of your current health. Would you mind if I ask you some questions about why you decided to schedule this appointment today, and generally how you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, telehealth… yes, that is what she said. It all sounds very… fast. And complicated. Yes, you can ask questions. I… I don't know how I am feeling, really. Just… old, I think. And a little tired. I used to work on cars, you know? But… my husband, he passed away two years ago, and I haven't been back to the garage since. It's just… hard. Maybe that is why I am tired.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Benites. Losing your husband must be incredibly difficult, and it’s perfectly normal to feel tired and overwhelmed after such a loss. Grief can have a very real impact on your physical and emotional well-being. Before we focus on that, though, I’d like to clarify a little about your tiredness. Could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: It is… not like I cannot do things, you understand? I still cook, I still clean. But… at the end of the day, I just… sit. I have no energy to do anything else. I used to garden, and fix things around the house, but now… now I just watch television. And sleep. I sleep a lot. Is that… normal? I do not know if it is the sadness, or… something else.
DOCTOR: That's a very helpful description, Ms. Benites. It sounds like you’re experiencing fatigue that doesn't necessarily prevent you from doing daily tasks, but leaves you with very little energy afterwards. It's certainly possible that your sadness is contributing to this, but it’s important to rule out any other potential causes. To help me understand better, could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My knees, they ache sometimes. Especially when it rains. And… oh! My hands, they are always cold. Even in summer. And I… I forget things. Not big things, you understand. Just… where I put my glasses, or what I was going to say. Is that what you mean by… symptoms? I take some pills for my blood pressure, the doctor gave them to me a long time ago. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, all of that matters. The aching knees, cold hands, and forgetfulness are all important pieces of the puzzle. And yes, please tell me about the pills you’re taking for your blood pressure. Knowing your medications is crucial. Could you tell me the name and dosage of the blood pressure medication, if you happen to know it?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s a mess in here, I apologize. I believe… this one? It says… “Lisinopril.” And the little number says 20. So, 20 milligrams, perhaps? I take one every morning. The doctor, Dr. Novak, he gave it to me many years ago. I have not seen him since… well, since my husband got sick. I just keep getting them refilled. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Benites. That’s very helpful. Yes, continuing to get refills is okay, but it’s good we’re reviewing everything now. Lisinopril 20mg daily is a common medication for high blood pressure. Now, regarding your other symptoms – the aching knees, cold hands, and forgetfulness – have these symptoms been gradual, or did they appear suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It has been… a long time. The knees, they ache more in the winter, of course. But they have been bothering me for maybe… five years? And the hands… always cold, but worse lately. The forgetting… I suppose that has gotten worse since my husband passed away. It’s… difficult to remember when things started, exactly. Everything feels… blurry now. I am sorry, I am not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Benites. It’s perfectly normal to have difficulty pinpointing exactly when symptoms started, especially when dealing with a gradual onset and recent emotional stress. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid problems, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. Dr. Novak, he always said I was very healthy. Just a little high blood pressure. And… he told me to lose weight, but I enjoy my cooking too much. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course. Measles, mumps… things like that. But nothing serious. And… I had a surgery on my appendix when I was young. But that was many, many years ago. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Benites. No other major medical conditions or surgeries, aside from the appendectomy. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had a bad heart. She passed away when I was young. And my father, he had… problems with his joints. Arthritis, I think. He walked with a cane for many years. And… my brother, he had diabetes. But he lived in the Czech Republic, so I do not know much about it. It has been a long time since I saw him. Is that helpful? I do not know very much about my family’s… illnesses. It was not something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Benites. A family history of heart disease, arthritis, and diabetes does provide some important information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My husband, he used to smoke, but I always told him it was bad for his health. And I… I do not like the taste of alcohol. Just tea, please. And… I used to walk a lot, with my husband. But since… since he passed away, I do not go out much. I prefer to stay home. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not "bad", Ms. Benites. It’s understandable that your activity level has decreased after losing your husband. It's a significant life change. Finally, just one more question. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I have never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, almost. I do not like mushrooms, but that is just a preference, not an allergy. I have never had problems with any pills, either. No, I do not think I have any allergies. I am very lucky, I think. Is that all the questions? I am getting a little tired now.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, those were all the questions. Thank you for being so patient and thorough. Now, based on what you've told me – the fatigue, aching knees, cold hands, forgetfulness, family history of heart disease, arthritis and diabetes, and your recent loss – I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… that is fine. I suppose that is what doctors do, yes? I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle, please. My knees are a little sore today. And… I get nervous, sometimes. Is it alright if I close my eyes?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Benites. Closing your eyes is perfectly alright. And I will be as gentle as possible. I will explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72, regular. That's a little elevated, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m going to take a look at your knees. Could you please bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that is… a little uncomfortable. They feel… stiff. And they make a… a cracking sound. Is that normal? I try to bend them as far as I can, but it is difficult. They do not feel… strong, anymore. Like they will give way. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: I'm noting some crepitus – that cracking sound you mentioned – and a limited range of motion in both knees. There is some tenderness upon palpation, particularly on the inner aspect of the knees. This is consistent with osteoarthritis, a common condition that causes the cartilage in your joints to break down. It explains the stiffness, aching, and limited movement. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I'll just quickly examine your hands. Your hands feel cool to the touch, and I don't notice any swelling or deformities. I do note some slight redness in your fingertips.
PATIENT: Yes, they are always cold. Even in the summer. My neighbor, she says it is because of my circulation. Is that… bad? And… osteoarthritis? That sounds… serious. Does that mean I will be in pain forever? I do not want to be stuck in a chair, unable to do anything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Benites. It’s natural to feel anxious when hearing a new diagnosis. Osteoarthritis is a chronic condition, meaning it doesn't go away completely, but it is very manageable. It doesn’t necessarily mean you will be in pain forever or stuck in a chair. Many people with osteoarthritis live full and active lives with appropriate treatment. The coolness in your hands could be related to your circulation, as your neighbor suggested, or it could be a symptom of the osteoarthritis affecting the smaller joints in your hands. Based on your history and physical exam, I suspect you are experiencing osteoarthritis in your knees and potentially in your hands, coupled with some fatigue likely related to your grief and potentially some underlying circulatory issues. To confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will help us assess your overall health, check for inflammation, rule out any thyroid issues, and evaluate your circulatory function. I also recommend an X-ray of your knees to get a better look at the cartilage and bone structure. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an X-ray? Yes, I suppose so. If it will help, then yes. But… will it hurt? And… how long will it take? I do not want to be stuck in a hospital all day. And… what if the news is bad?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Benites. The blood tests are a simple procedure, just a small sample taken from your arm. There will be a brief pinch, but it’s very quick. It should take no more than 15-20 minutes at the lab. As for the X-ray, it’s completely painless. You’ll simply stand or lie down while the machine takes a picture. It takes just a few seconds. You won’t be stuck in the hospital all day, I assure you. And regarding the news, we’ll discuss the results thoroughly. If the tests confirm osteoarthritis, we’ll develop a personalized treatment plan to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. This might include physical therapy, pain medication, lifestyle modifications, and potentially some assistive devices. We'll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be with you every step of the way. Before we proceed, do you have any other concerns or questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You have explained everything very well, Doctor. Physical therapy… that sounds good. And maybe some pills, if it will help. But… I do not want to be dependent on medication. I want to be able to… to do things on my own. I just want to… feel normal again. Is that too much to ask? And… thank you, Doctor. For being so patient. And for listening.
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely not too much to ask, Ms. Benites. Feeling normal again is a perfectly valid and achievable goal, and that’s exactly what we’re going to work towards. And you’re very welcome. My priority is to help you feel your best, and that starts with listening and understanding your concerns. Alright. So, I'm going to write you a referral for blood work and an X-ray of your knees. The lab and radiology center are both located near the clinic, and I’ll have the staff schedule those appointments for you. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you continue with gentle exercises to maintain your range of motion. Avoid activities that cause significant pain, and listen to your body. Do you have any questions about where to go for the blood work and X-ray, or about the process itself?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. The staff will help me, yes? They are very nice here. And… thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I feel… a little better, now. Knowing that there is a plan. And that I am not alone. I think that is all. I should go now, yes? Before I forget something.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Benites. Yes, let me have the staff schedule those appointments for you and go over everything before you leave. You are not alone in this, and we’ll work together every step of the way. It was a pleasure meeting you today. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember to take things one step at a time. Have a good day, Ms. Benites. And please, take care of yourself.
