DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have all day. It's… my stomach. Just won't stop. I've been to doctors about it already, they gave me pills, didn’t work. So here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds frustrating to have been dealing with this for a while and not finding relief. “Won’t stop” – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: What do you mean? It's diarrhea. Constant. Multiple times a day. It’s… unpleasant. And embarrassing, obviously. I don't need a detailed description of what diarrhea is, Doctor. I'm experiencing it.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. You're right to be frustrated. Constant diarrhea can be very disruptive. When did this start?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know exactly. A couple of weeks, maybe? It comes and goes, but lately it’s been… pretty much constant, like I said. I just want it to stop so I can get on with things. I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of weeks of mostly constant diarrhea. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: If I knew that, don't you think I would have told the other doctors? It just… happens. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes not. I haven't changed anything in my diet. It’s a mystery. A very inconvenient mystery.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s helpful to rule things out, even if it seems random. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever or chills with this?
PATIENT: Well… there was a little blood once. Not a lot. Just… a spot. And I felt a bit warm a couple of nights ago, but I figured it was just the weather. It’s been humid, you know? Honestly, I don't pay much attention to things like that. I just want a fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, a spot of blood once and feeling warm a couple of nights ago. Thank you for letting me know. Do you have any abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, nausea or vomiting alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: A little cramping, sometimes. Bloated, definitely. Who isn’t bloated, honestly? And… nauseous, yes, when it’s really bad. But no vomiting. I'm not throwing up, if that’s what you're asking. It’s just… a lot of running to the bathroom, that's all. It's exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping, bloating, and nausea with the diarrhea. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Look, I was married, my husband passed away a few years ago. Does that count? Otherwise… not much. I haven't really been sick. I eat okay, I try to stay active. I’m a painter, you know? It’s physical work. That’s about it. I really don't have time for a long medical history.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your loss, Ms. Woodring. That's certainly a significant life event. And it’s good to hear you’re generally healthy and active. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never had a surgery. I don't do hospitals. My husband... well, it's just not my thing. I avoid them if I can. Can we please get back to fixing this problem? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And I understand your hesitation about hospitals. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins, occasionally. Nothing regular. And I took those pills the other doctor gave me, but they didn't help, like I told you. I don't really believe in loading up on medication if I don’t have to. It just makes me feel worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional vitamins and the medication from your previous doctor, which didn’t provide relief. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I’m not allergic to anything. I’ve never been allergic to anything. Honestly, Doctor, are you going through a checklist or something? This is getting ridiculous. I just want to know what’s wrong and what I need to do to make it stop.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like a checklist, Ms. Woodring. I’m trying to gather all the necessary information to understand what’s going on and determine the best course of action. It’s important to rule things out. Now, a few questions about your family history… are your parents or siblings alive and healthy?
PATIENT: My mother is still alive, thankfully. She's… fine. Old, but fine. And I had a brother, but he… passed away a long time ago. It was a car accident. Look, I’m really not one for talking about all this. It’s… personal. And frankly, irrelevant to my stomach problem. Can we just skip this part?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Woodring. It's perfectly alright if you're not comfortable discussing it. We can skip that part. Finally, a couple of questions about your lifestyle… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Really? Are you serious right now? I’m a painter. I need a steady hand, a clear head. Do I look like someone who would… Never. Absolutely not. This is a complete waste of my time. I need something to stop this diarrhea, and I need it now.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying. I understand your frustration, and I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. Let me review your information… Okay, I see you've had this issue for at least a couple of weeks. You’ve already tried some medication without success, and you don't have any known allergies. Given your symptoms—constant diarrhea, occasional blood, cramping, bloating, nausea—and the fact that over-the-counter treatments haven’t worked, we need to investigate further. I'd like to do a physical exam, if you're willing, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. And I'm going to order some stool tests to look for bacteria, parasites, or other causes of your diarrhea. We might also need to do a blood test to rule out any underlying inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have a job to do. But don't expect me to come back if it’s a lot of poking and prodding. And I don’t do needles, Doctor. Don’t even think about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no needles unless absolutely necessary, and we'll take it as gently as possible. I promise. Okay, take a deep breath… and let it out slowly… Good. Now, does this hurt anywhere?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right there! That's… tender. Definitely tender. Stop pressing there! It's not comfortable. Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to cause me pain? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Oh, I apologize. I'm just trying to pinpoint the source of the discomfort. I noticed some tenderness in the lower left abdomen. That could indicate some inflammation in that area. I don’t feel any masses or significant distention. I'm going to order those stool and blood tests now. The stool tests will check for common infections and parasites. The blood test will check for inflammation and rule out other possibilities. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a bland diet—things like rice, bananas, applesauce, and toast—and plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Bland diet… Great. Just what I needed. Look, I don’t have time for special diets. But fine. Whatever. And don’t expect me to call if I have questions. I’ll just figure it out. Honestly. I just want this to be over with. When will I get the results? And how will you tell me? I don't do phone calls.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. We'll aim to get the results back within 3-5 business days. Given your preference, we can send the results to you through the patient portal. It’s a secure online system. I'll make sure your information is set up to receive notifications when your results are available. I want to emphasize, while we’re waiting for the results, if you experience any fever, severe abdominal pain, blood in your stool that is more than just a spot, or signs of dehydration—like dizziness or decreased urination—please go to the emergency room immediately. Those could indicate a more serious problem. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely none. Just send the results. And don't bother calling. I have work to do. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I understand. I’ve sent the orders for the tests and you’ll receive a notification when they’re ready. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you experience any concerning symptoms. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
