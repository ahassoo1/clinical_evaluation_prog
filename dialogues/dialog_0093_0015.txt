DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… my… sinuses. They are… not good. I have… a problem with them. It’s been… a while now, I think. It hurts… up here.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Boham. You've been experiencing sinus issues. That certainly sounds uncomfortable. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Pain… yes. It is… a pressure, mostly. Like… something is full. And sometimes… it aches. It is worse when I… bend over, I think. Or when it is cold. I do not… remember exactly when it started. Everything is… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pressure and aching sensation, worse with bending over or when it's cold. And you mentioned it’s been going on for a while, but the exact timing is unclear. That’s alright, we’ll try to piece it together. Do you have any other symptoms along with the sinus pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… symptoms… let me think. Sometimes… my nose feels stuffy. Not always. And… maybe I cough a little? But I cough anyway, you know? From… the work. It is dusty. I do not know if that is the sinus or… just the dust.
DOCTOR: I see. So nasal congestion at times, and a cough – which you suspect may be related to your work environment. That’s helpful to know. To clarify, when you say "dusty," could you describe your work?
PATIENT: Work… yes. I… operate a drill. A big drill. For oil. It goes into the ground. A lot of dirt and… rock. It makes a lot of dust. Very dusty. It is… a hard job. We wear… something on our faces, but… dust still gets in. I think. It has been… many years.
DOCTOR: Okay, you operate a drill for oil, a very physically demanding job with significant dust exposure. That certainly provides context. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches associated with this sinus issue?
PATIENT: Fever… no. I do not think so. I have not… checked. And… chills? No, it is not cold. Sometimes I feel… tired, but that is from the work. Body aches… sometimes, yes. But that is… the work too. Everything hurts from the work.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Boham. It sounds like it can be difficult to separate symptoms related to your work from those potentially related to your sinuses. Let’s move on to some other questions. Have you experienced any changes in your vision, any facial swelling, or any headaches along with the sinus pressure?
PATIENT: Vision… no. It is… okay. Sometimes blurry, but I always wear glasses. Swelling… no. My face feels… normal. Headaches… yes. Sometimes I get… a throbbing. Mostly in the front of my head. Like… where the sinuses are. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no changes in vision or facial swelling, but headaches are present, specifically a throbbing sensation in the front of your head, correlating with your sinus area. Now, have you tried anything to alleviate these symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: Alleviate… yes. I… drink a lot of water. And sometimes… I try to rest. But it is hard to rest when I have to work. And… my husband, he gives me… a hot towel. For my face. It helps… a little. But not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, water, rest when possible, and a warm towel. Those are good supportive measures. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as asthma, allergies, or any other chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Not that I know of. I… haven’t been to a doctor in a long time. I work. I don't get sick often. My husband… he says I have strong lungs. But… maybe allergies? I sometimes sneeze… when there are flowers. But everyone sneezes with flowers, no?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Boham. Many people haven’t been to a doctor recently. And occasional sneezing with flowers is quite common. We’ll explore that possibility further if needed. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Not that I remember. I had my… tonsils out when I was little. A long time ago. But no other surgeries. Hospitalizations… no. I have always been… healthy. Or tried to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, but no other surgeries or hospitalizations. And do you have any family history of allergies, sinus problems, or asthma?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she sneezed a lot. With everything. Flowers, dust, cats… everything. And my brother… he has… trouble breathing sometimes. But he smokes. A lot. So I don’t know if that is… asthma or the smoking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of allergies in your mother and breathing difficulties in your brother, potentially related to smoking. That’s helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Not right now. Sometimes, when the headache is very bad, my husband gives me… a pill. For the pain. But I don’t know what it is called. He buys it… at the store. A little white pill. It helps… a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, you occasionally take a small white pill for headaches, purchased over-the-counter. We'll try to identify that later, if possible. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or other substances?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I haven't… ever had a reaction. I eat… Salvadoran food. Spicy food. Everything. I have a strong stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Boham, that’s a very helpful overview. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination to better understand what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… good. If you think it will help, then… please. I want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’d please have a seat, I’ll begin by listening to your lungs and checking your sinuses. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. I did note some tenderness when I pressed on your maxillary sinuses - that's the area just below your cheekbones. I’ll also take a quick look inside your nose. Your nasal passages have some mild swelling, but no significant signs of infection at this point.
PATIENT: Swelling… yes, that sounds right. It feels… stuffy. But no infection… that is good to know. So… what does this mean, Doctor? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Boham. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical examination, it appears you are likely experiencing sinusitis – an inflammation of the sinuses. The tenderness in your maxillary sinuses and the nasal swelling support this. It doesn't appear to be a severe infection at this time, but it is causing you discomfort, and we need to address that. The fact that you work in a dusty environment is a significant contributing factor. To get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a simple X-ray of your sinuses. It will help us see the extent of the inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… yes, if you think it is necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… want to feel better. It is… hard to work when my head hurts. So… what will the X-ray show? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Boham. An X-ray is a quick and painless procedure. It uses a very small amount of radiation to create an image of your sinuses, allowing us to see if there’s any blockage or fluid buildup. It won’t hurt at all; you’ll simply stand or sit while the technician takes the images. It’s a helpful tool to guide our treatment plan. The X-ray will show us the extent of the inflammation, whether there's fluid buildup, and if there are any structural issues contributing to your symptoms. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, continuing the warm compresses, and avoiding any known irritants as much as possible. If possible, consider wearing a high-quality mask at work to minimize dust exposure. I'll write an order for the X-ray, and the receptionist will schedule it for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action, which may include nasal saline rinses, decongestants, or, if necessary, antibiotics. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A mask at work… I will try. It is hard, but I will try. And… the nasal rinses… what are those? I have never heard of them.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Boham. I appreciate your willingness to try these measures. Nasal saline rinses involve flushing your nasal passages with a salt water solution. It helps to clear out congestion, remove irritants, and soothe the inflamed nasal tissues. You can use a neti pot, a squeeze bottle, or a nasal spray specifically designed for saline rinses. It might feel a little strange at first, but it's a very effective way to relieve sinus congestion. I can provide you with a brochure explaining how to use a nasal rinse properly, and I'll show you a quick demonstration. The key is to use distilled or sterile water, not tap water, to prevent any potential infections. Once the X-ray results are available, we’ll have a clearer understanding of what’s going on and tailor a treatment plan specifically for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I understand. The X-ray, the rinses, the mask… I will try everything. Thank you for… explaining everything so clearly. I feel… better already, just knowing what is going on.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Boham. My pleasure entirely. Remember, if your symptoms worsen at any point – such as high fever, severe headache, facial swelling, or vision changes – please seek immediate medical attention. The receptionist will assist you with scheduling the X-ray. I’ll see you again once the results are in. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
