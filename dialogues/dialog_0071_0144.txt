DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Calvery. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Galena, was it? Hmm. Well, honestly? I just… thought I’d see what all the fuss is about. My daughter kept telling me I should get checked out, just to be sure. She worries too much, that one. But I feel fine, mostly. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you to come in, even if it's just for peace of mind. Daughters do worry, don't they?
PATIENT: Sensible? Please. More like… insistent. She practically dragged me here. And peace of mind? That's a bit much. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I’ve had peace of mind. It’s just… well, she said something about preventative things? I don't rightly recall. It all sounds like a bother, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Preventative care is important, even when you're feeling well. It helps us catch things early, if there is anything to catch. Hmm. Let’s see… to get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about those “usual aches and pains”?
PATIENT: Oh, aches and pains… it’s just… old age, really. My knees bother me when it rains, you know? And my back… well, I used to be a surgical tech, you see. Lots of bending and lifting. It catches sometimes. Nothing a little heat can't fix. Honestly, it’s probably just… what happens when you get old. I don’t know why she makes such a fuss.
DOCTOR: Surgical tech… that would explain some back discomfort. And the knees with the rain... interesting. Just to be thorough, are these aches and pains constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Constant? Oh, goodness no. Not constant. They… come and go. Like I said, the knees are mostly with the weather. The back… that depends. If I’ve been on my feet all day, it’ll bother me. Or if I bend over too much, picking something up. But it’s not… all the time. I can usually manage. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one to complain.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, dear. Let me see… Well, I get a bit… forgetful sometimes. But who doesn’t at my age? I sometimes misplace my glasses, even though they’re on my head. And I… I can’t quite recall what I had for breakfast this morning. But that’s just… normal, isn’t it? I wouldn't call those symptoms.
DOCTOR: A little forgetfulness is common, yes. But we should document it. Any other changes you've noticed?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, I seem to tire a bit more easily, I suppose. Used to be able to garden all day, but now I have to take breaks. And… oh, I don’t know. It’s hard to say. Things just… slow down when you get old, don't they? I'm not as spry as I used to be, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: You’re right, things do change. And it’s good you're noticing these changes. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh, dear. That’s a long story. Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. And… I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. And… well, my husband, bless his soul, he had a bad heart. I suppose I've had the usual check-ups over the years, but honestly, I don’t remember the details. It all blurs together after a while.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We can look through your records, if you don’t mind. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, no, I don’t take anything regularly. Just a little ibuprofen now and then for the aches and pains, but that’s it. I don’t believe in filling myself with pills unless I absolutely have to. My mother always said, “Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food.”
DOCTOR: That’s a good philosophy. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years. Shellfish, peanuts… never had a problem. Though, I did get a bit of a rash once from some sort of plant when I was gardening… but that wasn't a medication, was it? Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pretty healthy person. I’ve been lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to finish up with the basics, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my mother lived to be 92, so that’s good. She had arthritis, like I said. My father… he died young, from a bad flu, I think. And my brother… he had high blood pressure. My husband’s side… they were all fairly healthy, I believe. But honestly, Doctor, it’s been so long. I don’t remember all the details. People get sick, people die… it’s just the way of things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery. Well, everything you've told me is helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, if you have to. I suppose it can’t hurt. But don't expect much, Doctor. I'm not as spry as I used to be. And please, be gentle. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Calvery. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale slowly. Good. Now, I’ll check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Now, let's take a look at your eyes. Good reflexes there. Any vision problems you've noticed?
PATIENT: Vision problems? Not really. Things are a bit blurry sometimes, especially up close. I need my glasses, of course. But that’s just… old age, isn’t it? Everyone needs glasses when they get old. I haven't bothered getting a new prescription lately. It’s just not that important. Honestly, Doctor, I can still see well enough to get by.
DOCTOR: Alright, we can certainly address that if it becomes more bothersome. Now, I'll listen to your abdomen. Any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh! A little bit, yes. Not much, just… a little tenderness. It's probably just gas, Doctor. I had a bit too much cabbage at lunch, I think. It happens. Honestly, I wouldn’t worry about it. It'll probably pass.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your reflexes?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Oh dear. Are you going to hit my knees with that little hammer thing? I always hated that thing. My daughter used to make me go to the doctor, and I always dreaded the knee-hitting. It just feels… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: It won’t be unpleasant, Mrs. Calvery. It’s just a quick tap to see how your nerves are responding. Good. Both reflexes are present and equal. Now, let's check your feet. Any swelling or pain in your feet?
PATIENT: My feet? Oh, they ache sometimes, especially at the end of the day. And they swell up a little when it’s hot. But that’s just… what happens when you’re on your feet all day, isn’t it? I used to be a surgical tech, remember? Lots of standing and walking. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to my feet. They’re just… feet.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery. Well, everything seems to be within normal limits. You've got some mild swelling in your feet, which is consistent with being on your feet a lot, and your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Given your age and the fact that you feel relatively well, I think we can start with some lifestyle modifications.
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? Oh, good. I was hoping it wouldn't be anything too drastic. What kind of modifications? Less cabbage, perhaps? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not one for complicated diets or strenuous exercise. I just want to be able to garden in peace.
DOCTOR: No, nothing too drastic, I promise. Primarily, I'd like you to focus on a heart-healthy diet – plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. And some gentle exercise – even a short walk each day can make a big difference. We can also discuss getting a new glasses prescription, since you mentioned your vision is a bit blurry. And it might be a good idea to monitor your blood pressure at home, just to get a baseline. I'll write you a referral for a home blood pressure monitor. We can also talk about a low dose of a daily aspirin to help prevent heart issues, if you're okay with that. What do you think?
PATIENT: A low dose of what now? Aspirin? Oh dear. I don't like taking pills, Doctor. You know that. And monitoring my blood pressure at home? That sounds like a bother. I barely remember to take my vitamins, let alone check my blood pressure every day! As for the diet...well, I suppose I can try to eat more vegetables. But don't expect miracles. And gentle exercise? What does that even mean? Honestly, Doctor, it all sounds a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You're right, it does sound like a lot when you lay it all out. Let's take it one step at a time. The aspirin is just a suggestion, and we can absolutely skip that if you're not comfortable. And regarding the blood pressure monitoring, maybe we can start with just checking it once a week, and see how that goes. As for the exercise, even a 15-minute walk a few times a week is beneficial. We can also explore some gentle stretching exercises. The goal isn't to drastically change your life, Mrs. Calvery. It's just to make a few small adjustments to help you stay healthy and feel your best. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A little better, yes. Once a week sounds manageable. And a short walk...well, I suppose I can do that. As long as it's not too strenuous. And no pills, definitely no pills. Honestly, Doctor, you're very patient with me. I appreciate that. So... a weekly blood pressure check and a short walk. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Yes, for now, that’s all. I’ll write you a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor, and a referral to a local physical therapist who can recommend some gentle stretching exercises. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you’re doing and review your blood pressure readings. And if you experience any new symptoms or have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Honestly, I think I just need to… process it all. It’s a bit much to take in at once. But thank you for being so patient with an old woman. And thank you for not making me take any pills.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Calvery. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. Here are your prescriptions and referral information. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your gardening! .
PATIENT: .
