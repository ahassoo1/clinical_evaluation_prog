DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re with us today for a routine appointment. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Dr. Soodeen, is it? Lovely name. Routine… yes, well, it’s about my blood, you see. My… someone suggested I find out what type it is. It’s been on my mind, but honestly, I can’t quite recall why exactly. Something about… needing to know, for… well, things. It’s all a bit foggy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if the reason isn't entirely clear. Knowing your blood type can be helpful in certain situations, as you mentioned. To get a better understanding, perhaps we can start with a little bit of your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, history… yes. Goodness. I used to be quite strong, you know. A rigger, I was. Lots of lifting, climbing… Worked on the ships, mostly. It was… a long time ago now. I’ve had the usual aches and pains, I suppose, for someone my age. Nothing major, thankfully. I lost my husband, bless his soul, about ten years ago. And… that’s about all that comes to mind right away. Do you need specifics? I’m terrible with dates, I warn you.
DOCTOR: No worries at all about the dates, Ms. Nini. Just a general overview is helpful. You mentioned aches and pains. Where are those located, and have they been getting progressively worse, or staying about the same?
PATIENT: Oh, they come and go, really. Mostly in my back, lower back, from all the lifting, I expect. And my knees, a bit creaky. Not terrible, you understand. Just…old age. They’re worse when it’s damp, you know? Like today, actually. It feels a bit…stiff. But no, nothing suddenly worse. Just…always there, a little bit. I can still get around, thankfully. I don’t like being idle.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re still active. And yes, damp weather can certainly exacerbate joint pain. Have you tried anything for the pain currently – over-the-counter medications, creams, or perhaps any exercises?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, yes. My daughter, she's very good at looking things up on the computer. She got me some of those… creams, with the menthol, you know? They help a little, for a short while. And I take… Ibuprofen, is it? The little white pills. When it's really bad. But I don't like taking too many, if I can help it. Makes my stomach a bit upset sometimes. Mostly, I just try to keep moving, and not think about it too much. It’s probably just old age catching up with me, that's all.
DOCTOR: That’s a reasonable approach. We can certainly discuss some alternatives to manage the pain, and potentially protect your stomach. Before we do that, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. Nothing comes to mind, thankfully. As for conditions… well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but it’s usually fine. They put me on a little pill for it, I think. A tiny white one. I can’t quite remember the name, I’m afraid. And… that’s all I can think of right now. My memory is just dreadful. Does it matter if I can’t remember the name of the pill?
DOCTOR: It's alright if you don't remember the name, Ms. Nini. We can easily look that up in your records. That’s what we’re here for. Knowing you have a history of high blood pressure is helpful, though. And don't worry about the memory – it's common at your age. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Vitamins, yes. My daughter insists. A multi-vitamin, every morning. A little orange chewable one. And… I think that’s all. Unless… no, I definitely don’t take anything else. I used to take something for my arthritis, but the doctor said it wasn’t doing much good and told me to stop. It was a long time ago, though. I really don’t like taking a lot of pills, you know. It makes me feel…foggy.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Nini. It’s good to know about the multivitamin. Now, just a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any major medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother, she lived to be quite old, thankfully. But she had… something with her heart, I think. A weak heart, they said. And my father… he had problems with his stomach. Terrible stomach problems. Not a pleasant thing. As for other things… I honestly can’t recall. We weren’t a family that talked much about illnesses, you know. It was considered…bad luck, I suppose. And with so many cousins and aunts and uncles… I wouldn’t know where to begin. Does it really matter that much?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Nini. It's helpful to know about the heart problems and stomach issues in your family. That’s enough for now. Now, before we move on, I’d like to ask a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, he used to smoke a pipe, but I always made him go outside. Terrible habit, I always thought. And the smell… dreadful. I always preferred fresh air, you know? Especially by the sea. Do you need to know about drinking? I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, a small glass. Nothing more. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Nini. And yes, that’s helpful information. It sounds like you have very healthy habits. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall condition. It shouldn't take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s perfectly fine, dear. Whatever you need to do. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, you know. Worked on the ships for so long, had to have regular check-ups. Though those doctors were a bit…rougher, I must say. You seem very gentle. Go ahead, then. Do what you need to do. I’ll just sit here and try to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Nini, just relax your arm for me. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Let's listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Overall, everything seems relatively good, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur warrant further attention. Okay, Ms. Nini, that’s all for now. Everything seems generally good, but I do want to investigate the blood pressure and the murmur a little further. Would you mind if we do a few blood tests, and perhaps an EKG to check your heart rhythm?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests… and an EKG? That sounds… complicated. Is it something serious, dear? I just wanted to know my blood type, you know. It’s all gotten rather… involved. Is the murmur a problem? I feel perfectly fine, most of the time. Is it because of my age? Perhaps it’s nothing to worry about. I don't want to go through a lot of tests if it’s not necessary. It’s just that, someone mentioned something about needing to know my blood type, for… emergencies, I think. But now, everything seems so much more complicated. Perhaps we should just forget about it?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Nini. It has become a little more involved than just finding out your blood type, and I apologize for that. Let me assure you, we’re not jumping to conclusions here. The blood tests and EKG are simply to get a clearer picture of your overall health. The slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur are common findings, especially with age, but it's important to rule out any underlying causes. The blood tests will check your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. The EKG will check your heart rhythm and identify any abnormalities. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Knowing your blood type is still something we can do, and it can be helpful in emergencies, as you mentioned. We're not trying to scare you, Ms. Nini. We're simply being thorough. If everything comes back normal, then we can focus on managing your blood pressure and knowing your blood type. But it's always better to be safe than sorry. Would you like me to explain the procedures in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, if you think it’s necessary… I suppose it’s better to know, than not know. My daughter always says that. “Better to be prepared,” she always says. She’s a very sensible girl. Explain the procedures, yes, please. What exactly does the blood test involve? Do they take a lot? And the EKG… is it painful? I don’t like needles, you know. And I don't want to be lying around all day, hooked up to machines. I have my garden, you see. And the tomatoes are finally ripening. It's a busy time of year.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Nini. Your garden sounds lovely. We’ll try to make this as quick and painless as possible. The blood test involves a small amount of blood being drawn from your arm, usually just a few vials. It takes only a few minutes, and the nurse is very skilled. You might feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. We’ll put a bandage on afterward, and you can go about your day as usual. The EKG is even simpler. We’ll attach a few small, sticky pads to your chest, arms, and legs. These pads are connected to a machine that records your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t involve any needles, and it’s completely painless. You’ll lie on a comfortable bed for about five to ten minutes while the machine does its work. The whole process shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes to an hour. And we'll send you home with all the necessary instructions. Would you like me to order these tests for you now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It doesn't sound too terrible, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take all day. And no needles, if possible. Alright, dear. Yes, order the tests. But please, tell the nurse not to poke too hard. And if I start to feel dizzy, or anything, just stop, okay? I get a bit nervous, you see. My daughter can come with me, if that’s alright? She’s very good at asking questions, and keeping track of things. It would be a great comfort, having her there. Yes, please. If that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Nini. We’ll make sure the nurse is gentle and takes her time. And yes, your daughter is more than welcome to come with you. It’s always good to have someone there for support. I’ll make a note of that in your file. I'm ordering the blood tests and the EKG now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and explain the EKG procedure. She'll be able to answer any further questions you may have. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, dear. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… please, tell the nurse to be gentle. And thank you for being so patient with me. I get a bit… confused sometimes. It's getting old, you know. But I appreciate your kindness. And perhaps… after the tests, could we just confirm my blood type? That was the whole reason I came, after all. It would be nice to know, for peace of mind. Then maybe I can finally get back to my tomatoes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Nini. We will definitely confirm your blood type after the tests. That’s what we’re here for. And please, don’t worry about being confused – it’s perfectly normal. I’ll make sure the nurse knows to be gentle, and I’ll personally follow up with you after the results come back. I'm glad I could help. Just relax, and we’ll get through this together. The nurse should be in shortly. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, dear. That’s all. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind. I suppose I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse. .
