DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don't have time for a lot of pleasantries. I’m 51, perfectly healthy, and I want to be sure if I can…you know…have a baby without any problems. I’ve read things. I don’t want complications. Is that so difficult to understand?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand you want to assess your ability to carry a pregnancy to term safely. It’s...certainly a question many women your age have. Just to be thorough, though, could you tell me a bit more about why you’re considering this now?
PATIENT: Considering? Doctor, I am considering it. And why is none of your business, frankly. But since you insist… my divorce was final six months ago. And a family…a proper family…was always something I wanted. Is that enough detail for you? I really don't see what my personal life has to do with whether my womb still works.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteynberg. It's perfectly reasonable to want a family. Just trying to get a full picture. Have you had any children previously?
PATIENT: No. Never. And I find your tone rather…implying. Are you suggesting there’s something wrong with me because I haven't? I was focused on my career for a long time. I own a very successful bicycle repair shop, you know. It takes dedication. So, no, I haven’t had children. Now, can we please get to the tests? I have customers waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. No implications intended, I assure you. Your career is commendable. Okay, so no previous pregnancies. Let's start with a basic medical history, if you don’t mind. Any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s all rather…standard. Childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, rubella, all that. I broke my arm once falling off a bicycle, ironically enough – but it healed perfectly. Had my appendix out when I was 20. Other than that…nothing. I’m very careful about my health. I eat well, I exercise – I cycle, obviously. I don't smoke, barely drink. Do you really need a detailed account of every sniffle I’ve ever had?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. That’s helpful. Appendix removed, standard childhood illnesses. No significant medical problems otherwise. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Penicillin. Gives me a terrible rash. And I’m… mildly sensitive to cats, but that’s hardly a medical issue. I avoid cats. It’s quite simple. Now, are we getting anywhere closer to determining if my uterus is functioning, or are we going to spend the rest of the day discussing my feline preferences?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Shteynberg, we are getting there. Penicillin allergy noted. We will definitely ensure no penicillin-based medications are used. To assess your ability to carry a pregnancy, we will need to do a physical exam and some blood work. The blood work will check your hormone levels, and general health markers. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work and…whatever physical exam is necessary. But I trust you have a competent nurse? I don’t want some inexperienced student poking around. And I need it done quickly. The faster we know, the faster I can make a decision. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? And how long will this…process…take?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. A very experienced nurse will be assisting me. And we'll keep it as efficient as possible. For the blood work, just an overnight fast would be helpful - no food after midnight. As for the physical exam, it will be a standard pelvic exam, to assess the health of your reproductive organs. It should take approximately 20-30 minutes for everything, including drawing the blood. If you’ll follow me, we can get started.
PATIENT: Finally. Let’s just get it over with. And please, make sure the examination room is…clean. I have standards, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shteynberg. Everything is sterile and prepared. Right this way.
PATIENT: Hmmph. It will have to do, I suppose. Just… try not to dawdle. I have a very busy afternoon. And where is this nurse you promised? I don't intend to lie here any longer than absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Here’s Nurse Davies, Ms. Shteynberg. She’ll be assisting with the blood draw and will prep you for the exam. Nurse Davies is exceptionally efficient, I assure you. She’ll explain everything as she goes. I'll be right here to perform the exam once you’re ready.
PATIENT: Efficient, you say? Let's hope so. I haven't got all day. Please be precise. And don't bother with small talk. I find it… irritating. Now, just get on with it. What do you need?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. We'll just need a small sample of your blood for analysis. If you could sit on the examination table and extend your arm, that would be perfect. I will use a tourniquet to help locate a vein, and then perform the draw. It’s a very quick process, and you may feel a brief sting. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Brief, you say? Everything is “brief” until it isn’t. Just… hurry. And try to get it right the first time. I have a low tolerance for incompetence.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shteynberg, this will sting for a moment. Just try to relax your arm. Just a few more seconds... almost done. All finished. See?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Not bad. Though it feels a little…sore. I trust you didn't damage anything? Now, are we finally getting to the important part? This pelvic examination? Honestly, the waiting is the worst.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Shteynberg, we are. Just a standard examination to assess your uterus, cervix and ovaries. I’ll explain everything as I go. You’ll be lying on your back with your feet in stirrups. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Let me know if you feel any significant discomfort. Is that alright?
PATIENT: "Uncomfortable." That's what they all say. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve dealt with more discomfort from a flat tire. Just…get it over with quickly. And please, try to be gentle. I have standards, you know. . Don’t dawdle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. Just a brief external examination first… Feeling anything unusual?
PATIENT: It’s…cold. And frankly, Doctor, your hands are rather…shaky. I expect a certain level of professionalism, you know. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s…a little difficult to fully assess without a more internal examination. Just widening the speculum now... It will feel some pressure. Everything appears to be…normal externally. The cervix is intact, and there’s no visible inflammation. We'll now palpate the uterus and ovaries…Any discomfort there?
PATIENT: No! Stop. That is…unpleasant. And frankly, Doctor, your technique is…rough. Is this how you treat all your patients? I…I really don’t think I can continue. It’s too uncomfortable. Just…stop.
DOCTOR: I’m so sorry, Ms. Shteynberg! I didn't mean to cause any discomfort. Please, let me know if I'm doing anything that's causing you distress. Perhaps we can stop here for now and discuss the results we have, and consider other options?
PATIENT: “Other options”? What other options? I came here for a straight answer – can I have a baby without a fuss, or can't I? Not for a…a series of probing questions and uncomfortable examinations! Honestly, Doctor, this has been a complete waste of my time. I think I've heard enough. I need to go. Just send me the bill. .
