DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s these little spells I’ve been having. Confusing spells, you understand. My wife, she’s the one who really pushed me to come. Says I ask the same questions five times in an hour. Doesn’t think it’s right.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Spells” as in… moments of confusion, or feeling disoriented?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Disoriented is a good word. Like… I'll be in the kitchen, making tea, and suddenly… where am I? What was I doing? It passes, usually quick enough, but it's unsettling. And then I’ll ask my wife, “Have you seen my glasses?” even though they’re on my head. Little things, but… irritating, you know? And frankly, a bit frightening.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand why that would be unsettling, Mr. Lason. It's good your wife is paying attention and encouraging you to get it checked out. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's been… maybe six months, now? At first, it was just every now and then. I'd blame it on being tired, or not enough sleep. Old age, really. But it’s getting more frequent, that’s for sure. Last week, I forgot how to turn on the television. The television, Doctor. I've been watching television for sixty years!
DOCTOR: Six months…and increasing in frequency. That's important information. And forgetting something as familiar as operating the television… yes, that does warrant further investigation. Have you noticed any other changes along with this confusion?
PATIENT: Well… my appetite’s been a bit off. Not that I have a huge appetite to begin with, you understand. I’ve always been a small eater. But even less than usual, I suppose. And… my wife says I’ve been more… irritable. Snappish, she calls it. I just think she’s being sensitive. But she insists. Says I get annoyed easily, over nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Changes in appetite and increased irritability… okay. Those could be related, or something entirely separate. Let's try to get a clearer picture. Have you experienced any difficulties with your memory besides these moments of confusion?
PATIENT: Difficulties… well, I wouldn't say difficulties. I forget where I put things, naturally. Everyone does that. But remembering… names, dates… no, not really. I can recall things from my childhood perfectly, mind you. Every detail. But asking the same question twice… that's different. That’s… unsettling. I used to be so sharp. I knew everything about tile work, every measurement, every technique. Now…
DOCTOR: It sounds like it's more than just typical age-related forgetfulness, especially with the repetition of questions. Knowing details from your childhood is good—that suggests your long-term memory is intact. We’ll need to explore this further. Now, have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me see. I haven’t been feeling particularly well in the mornings, a little… unsteady on my feet, sometimes. Not enough to fall, mind you. Just a bit… wobbly. And my vision’s been a little blurry, though I put that down to needing new glasses. I’m due for an eye exam, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteadiness in the mornings and blurry vision… those are important pieces of the puzzle. Have you noticed any headaches accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: Headaches? Not really. A little tension now and then, but nothing a bit of rest won’t cure. No pounding headaches, no dizziness… just… a general feeling of being… not quite right. Like something's… off-kilter.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. This gives us a good starting point. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… years ago, back in the 80s, I had some trouble with my blood pressure. High blood pressure, they said. Put me on some medication for a while, but I haven't taken anything for it in years. Doctor said I could manage it with diet and exercise. And… arthritis, of course. In my hands, mostly. It flares up now and then. Other than that… nothing major.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in the past, now managed with diet and exercise, and arthritis. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes. Back in ‘98, I had my appendix out. Routine, really. No complications. And… I had a knee replacement about ten years ago. That was a bit rough, but I recovered well. Aside from those two, no, nothing else.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal and a knee replacement. Okay. Now, Mr. Lason, I’m going to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had… what do you call it… Alzheimer's. Towards the end of her life, she didn’t recognize anyone. Very sad, it was. My father, he had heart problems, but that was more from smoking, really. He wasn’t a healthy man. And my sister… she has diabetes, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alzheimer’s in your mother and diabetes in your sister… and heart problems in your father. Thank you. Now, before we move on, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis medication. It's naproxen, I think. I take it when my hands are particularly sore. And… a multivitamin, every morning. Just a standard one. Nothing else. I don't believe in taking a lot of pills unless I absolutely need them.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen as needed for arthritis and a multivitamin. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife is always warning me about shellfish, but I've never had a problem. I’ve never reacted to any medication either. I'm a pretty hardy fellow, you know.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, Mr. Lason, that’s a lot of helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I’m trusting you to figure this out. It's just… unsettling, not knowing what's going on with my head.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Lason. I'll do my best. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes and balance. It won’t be painful, just a series of simple tests. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My wife always tells me I'm no good at these things. She’s the practical one in the family.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Not alarmingly high, but something we should keep an eye on. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Always a good breather, I was. Played a bit of the clarinet in my younger days. Not much now, my arthritis gets in the way.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but there's a slight murmur. It's not particularly concerning, but we'll want to document it. Your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the edge of the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright. I hope I don't fall. My wife would never let me live it down.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason, please open your eyes. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, and your balance is slightly unsteady. This, combined with what you’ve told me about the moments of confusion and unsteadiness, is something we need to investigate further. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. And I also recommend an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI? Is that… is that serious, Doctor? I’ve heard things about those things. Claustrophobia and all… I don’t like being confined. But… if you think it’s necessary. I trust your judgment. Blood tests, yes, definitely. But the MRI… is there no other way?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about the MRI, Mr. Lason. It’s a common concern. It's not necessarily serious, but it gives us the most detailed information about your brain. We can discuss options to help with any anxiety, such as mild sedation. And if you are truly uncomfortable, we can explore alternative imaging options, though they won’t provide as much detail. However, given your symptoms - the confusion, memory issues, unsteadiness - an MRI would be very helpful in ruling out things like stroke, tumors, or other neurological conditions. Before we proceed, let’s focus on the blood tests. Those will give us a good starting point. I'll also send a referral to a neurologist. They are the specialists in brain disorders and can help us determine the best course of action. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes, that sounds sensible. And the blood tests, of course. I’d rather start with something… less invasive. I’ve never been one for poking and prodding. And if the neurologist thinks the MRI is truly necessary, then… then we’ll talk about it. So, blood tests and a referral to a neurologist. That sounds… manageable. When can I get these tests done? And where?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That sounds like a good plan, Mr. Lason. I’ll write you a prescription for the blood tests now. You can go to any lab – the one at Suburban General Hospital is convenient, but you’re free to choose whichever lab is easiest for you. The results should be back in a few days. I'm also faxing a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly recommended neurologist here in town. Her office will call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience any sudden weakness, difficulty speaking, or severe headache – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all sounds… clear enough. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening, and for not dismissing it as just old age. My wife would be very pleased. I suppose I should just… take it easy, and wait for the results? And try not to worry too much? Easier said than done, of course.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Try to focus on taking care of yourself, Mr. Lason. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns before your appointment with the neurologist. We're here to help. I'll make a note to follow up with you after you've seen Dr. Sharma. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Lason. I wish you all the best. And remember, it's good that you're getting this checked out. It's always better to be safe.
