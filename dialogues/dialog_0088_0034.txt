DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Emileigh. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, I just moved here. I think this is, like, a check-up? My husband said I needed to find a doctor when we got here, 'cause of my Medicare and stuff. I don't really remember why specifically, just that I needed to get things set up. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. A welcome to the area check-up and establishing care is a good start. I see here you recently moved to the area… and yes, getting everything set up with Medicare is important. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Um… I think so? It’s kinda fuzzy. I remember going when I was a kid, for shots and stuff. And… maybe when I broke my arm once? But not really, like, regularly as an adult. My husband usually handles all that stuff. I get a little… confused with all the details. Does that make sense? I don't mean to be difficult!
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It's perfectly common to not have all the details readily available. We’ll take it slow. Okay. And generally, would you say you’ve been feeling healthy?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, mostly. I get tired sometimes, but… I work, you know? I'm a mechanic, so it's kinda expected. Nothing really bad. My joints ache a little when it's cold, but… I figured that was just getting older. I'm… 21 now? Or 22? I always forget. Is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Alright. Being a mechanic is physically demanding work, so some fatigue is understandable. And joint aches at your age… let’s explore that a bit further. Just to be thorough. Do you notice the aches in specific joints?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, I think so. My knees, mostly. And my wrists, sometimes. Especially after a long day working on cars. It's kinda a dull ache, not like… a sharp pain. It just feels… worn out, I guess. And sometimes my fingers get kinda stiff in the mornings. I didn’t think it was a big deal, honestly. Just… old mechanic things.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees, wrists, and fingers, with stiffness in the mornings. That's good information. And you said it's worse after a long day of work. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Hmm… redness, no. I don't think so. Swelling… maybe a little, sometimes? It's hard to tell. My hands get dirty all the time, and they kinda puff up anyway from working with tools. So I’m not sure if it’s swelling, or just… dirty. I’m really bad at noticing things like that. Is that bad? Should I be looking closer?
DOCTOR: No, it's not bad at all. It's perfectly okay not to be a medical expert! It just helps me to get a clearer picture. Okay, so potentially some mild swelling, mostly after work. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a complete history. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever or chills, no. Not that I remember. Weight loss… maybe? I’ve been kinda busy with the move and work, so I haven’t been eating as much as usual. But I don’t know if that counts as unexplained weight loss, you know? I just haven't had much appetite. My husband keeps telling me I need to eat more, though. He worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially some decreased appetite and some weight loss related to the move and work stress. That makes sense. And, just to be thorough, have you noticed any skin rashes, or changes in your hair or nails?
PATIENT: Rashes… no, not that I've seen. My hands get kinda rough and cracked from working with grease and stuff, but that's normal. Changes in my hair or nails… uh… I don't really pay attention to that stuff. I usually just tie my hair back so it doesn't get in my face, and I keep my nails short so they don't break when I'm working. I don’t think anything’s different, but I’m not sure. Sorry. I’m not very observant.
DOCTOR: You're doing great. Don't apologize, you're providing me with helpful information. Okay. One last few questions before we move onto a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything, that I remember. My husband always asks me when he gets me medicine, but I usually just tell him "no." He gets frustrated with me, sometimes, 'cause I can’t remember. Does penicillin count as something? He said something about that once, but I don't really know.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll make a note to confirm any potential penicillin allergy with your husband. It's good to be cautious. Alright, Emileigh. Before we finish up, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, check your joints, and a quick look at your overall health. Is that okay with you?
