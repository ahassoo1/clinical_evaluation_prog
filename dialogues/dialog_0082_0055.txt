DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Though, frankly, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for... well, current circumstances. My daughter insisted. She says I should "explore all options" for my… discomfort. I'm here about getting one of those medical marijuana cards, I believe. Though I must say, the whole thing seems rather… unconventional.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Medical marijuana is becoming more common… more options are available these days. Your daughter sounds like a good advocate for your health. So, this discomfort… can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Advocate? She simply doesn't want me complaining so much, if I’m being honest. And it's not simply "discomfort," Doctor. It's a persistent ache, mostly in my joints. Old age, you see. Though I’ve always been quite active for my years. I used to be a very elegant dancer, you know. But now… well, it interferes with my daily routine. I can’t garden as long as I'd like. It's… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this ache been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… creeping up on me for a few years now, I suppose. At first, it was just a little stiffness in the mornings. Easily ignored. But it’s gotten progressively worse, especially this past winter. The cold really exacerbates it, you understand. It’s simply… unpleasant. And it’s not as if I’m getting any younger, is it?
DOCTOR: Right. So, it’s been worsening over the past few years, particularly in the winter. And it's primarily in your joints… which joints are most affected?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, almost all of them! My knees, certainly. My wrists are quite troublesome when I try to… arrange things, you see. And my lower back… it’s a constant reminder of my age. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… dull, persistent ache. Really, it’s quite bothersome. Though I've always prided myself on maintaining a certain… dignity, and complaining about aches and pains just doesn’t seem refined. But my daughter… well, she insisted I look into this marijuana option. Is it even proper for a woman of my age?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Ellan. And it’s becoming increasingly common for people of all ages to explore medical marijuana for various conditions. It’s certainly something we can discuss and see if it might be appropriate for you. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if anything relieves the ache?
PATIENT: Relieves it… hmm. Well, warmth helps, naturally. A hot bath, or a heating pad. And I take a mild over-the-counter pain reliever occasionally, but it doesn’t seem to do much good anymore. Honestly, Doctor, mostly just… resting. Which is simply unacceptable, you understand. I have a life to lead. And I refuse to spend it confined to a chair. My daughter suggested creams… but they smell dreadful. And I do so prefer a good, clean scent.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the ache?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my sleep hasn't been the best lately. I wake up several times during the night, and it's often difficult to fall back asleep. I suppose that could be related to the discomfort. And… my appetite isn’t what it used to be, but frankly, I’ve never been a particularly large eater. But yes, the sleep is… disrupted. Everything feels a bit… sluggish, generally. Is that relevant, Doctor? It’s quite unbecoming, feeling sluggish.
DOCTOR: Yes, those things are relevant, Ellan. It sounds like the discomfort might be affecting your overall well-being. Now, have you seen any other doctors for this recently?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I try to avoid doctors as much as possible. All those… examinations. Unnecessary, I always say. I did see Dr. Abernathy a few years ago—a very brusque man, if I recall correctly—but he simply told me it was “old age” and suggested I take glucosamine. It didn’t help, naturally. And I haven’t bothered with a doctor since. I prefer to… manage things myself. Though my daughter, as you know, has different ideas. Honestly, all the fuss!
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, besides the pain reliever you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small dose of something for my blood pressure, if I recall correctly. My husband handles all of that, you see. I honestly couldn’t tell you the name of it. Something with a “B,” perhaps? He’s quite meticulous about my health, bless his heart. But that’s all, really. Just that, and the occasional pain reliever. I do try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, you see. Lots of herbal tea, and fresh fruit… though my appetite has been rather poor lately. It’s all so tiresome, keeping track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve always been rather robust, you see. Though I do get a slight rash sometimes when I handle certain flowers… lilies, I believe. But that’s simply a skin irritation, not a true allergy. And I’ve never had any trouble with medications, to my knowledge. My husband always checks these things, you see. He's quite thorough. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for complications.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, goodness. That’s a rather long story, Doctor. My mother lived to be a very old age, though she suffered terribly from arthritis in her later years. And my father had… heart trouble, I believe. But honestly, I don’t pay much attention to family history. It’s all rather gloomy, if you ask me. Everyone gets something eventually, don’t they? I prefer to focus on the present. And right now, the present is rather uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, if you don’t mind me asking, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Really, Doctor? I’m not sure what that entails. I’m a married woman, as you know. I’ve lived in this town all my life. I used to be very active in the garden club, but my discomfort has made that rather difficult lately. I enjoy reading, and listening to classical music. I suppose that’s my social history. Is that sufficient? It all seems rather intrusive, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly sufficient, Ellan. And just one last question, have you ever used tobacco, alcohol, or any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not! What a dreadful question, Doctor! I’ve never touched a drop of alcohol in my life, and I certainly wouldn’t dream of using… recreational drugs! I’m a respectable woman, you see. And I find the implication quite… offensive. Honestly, Doctor, I think we’ve covered everything, haven’t we? I’m beginning to feel rather faint.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Ellan. I apologize if any of my questions were… insensitive. It’s simply standard procedure, you understand. Now, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please be quick about it. And I must insist on maintaining a certain… decorum. No unnecessary poking and prodding, if you please. I do have a luncheon engagement later, you see. And I wouldn’t want to arrive looking… disheveled. I trust you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. I’ll be as quick and respectful as possible. First, let’s just listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise sounds regular. Lungs are clear, but breathing appears slightly shallow. Now, could I just take a look at your joints?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be gentle. And do try to avoid any sudden movements. My joints are rather… sensitive, you see. And I must warn you, I do have a low tolerance for discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your knees have some crepitus and mild swelling. Wrists also exhibit some crepitus, with slight tenderness upon palpation. Lower back has muscle guarding and tenderness to touch. Range of motion is limited in all affected joints, with some discomfort noted throughout. Your reflexes appear normal, and strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No obvious signs of injury or inflammation, aside from the tenderness and limited range of motion.
PATIENT: There! See? I told you it was sensitive. Honestly, Doctor, I do wish you wouldn’t poke so much. It’s quite… uncomfortable. And it’s not as if you’ve discovered anything new, is it? I’ve been perfectly aware of my discomfort for quite some time. Is that all? May I get up now? I’m feeling rather lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now, Ellan. I apologize if the exam caused any discomfort. I just wanted to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I think I have enough information to formulate a plan. Based on your history and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing osteoarthritis, which is a common condition in older adults. It causes the cartilage in your joints to break down over time, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. Now, while medical marijuana is one option, there are other treatments we can explore as well.
PATIENT: Osteo… what did you say? Honestly, Doctor, all these medical terms are quite bewildering. And frankly, I'm not particularly fond of the idea of "treatments." I've always preferred a more natural approach. But if you insist… what exactly are these other options? And will they involve any… poking and prodding? I do hope not.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis, simply put, is wear and tear on your joints. As for treatments, there are several options. Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help reduce pain and inflammation. We can also explore other medications, like topical creams or injections, if needed. And, yes, some of these options may involve some gentle exercises or injections, but nothing overly invasive. We can start with the least invasive options and see how you respond. Would you be interested in trying physical therapy?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… hmm. I suppose that sounds… tolerable. As long as it doesn’t involve any strenuous activity. I wouldn’t want to exacerbate my discomfort, you see. And I must insist on a female therapist. I simply wouldn’t feel comfortable with a… gentleman. Is that possible? And how often would I need to go? I do have a rather busy social calendar, you see. Lunch with the garden club, bridge on Tuesdays… it all adds up.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can certainly arrange for a female therapist, and we can tailor the sessions to your comfort level and schedule. Typically, we recommend 2-3 sessions per week for a few weeks, then gradually decrease the frequency as you improve. The sessions would involve gentle exercises, stretching, and other modalities to help reduce pain and improve your range of motion. We can also discuss other options, like over-the-counter pain relievers or topical creams, to help manage your discomfort between sessions. Now, regarding the medical marijuana card… if you're interested, we can discuss the potential benefits and risks, and I can complete the necessary paperwork. However, given your preference for a more natural approach, I think it’s best to start with the more conservative treatments first. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Let's try this… physical therapy, you call it. But please be assured, if it proves too strenuous or uncomfortable, I will not hesitate to discontinue it. And as for that… marijuana option, let's hold off on that for now. Perhaps we can revisit it later, if these other treatments prove ineffective. Honestly, I'm simply hoping for a little relief. Is that too much to ask? And may I know when I can schedule my first session? My Tuesdays are booked solid, you see.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Ellan. I completely understand. We’ll start with gentle exercises and gradually increase the intensity as you tolerate it. And we can certainly work around your schedule. Let me see… We have an opening with Sarah Miller, a wonderful physical therapist, on Mondays and Wednesdays. Would either of those days work for you?
PATIENT: Mondays… hmm. That might work. As long as it doesn't interfere with my bridge game. I simply must have my bridge game. Is she a… punctual therapist? I do dislike waiting. And is the clinic conveniently located? I prefer not to travel too far. Honestly, Doctor, I do have certain… standards.
DOCTOR: Yes, Sarah is known for being very punctual, and the clinic is conveniently located on Main Street, just a few blocks from the town square. It’s a very easy commute. Let me schedule you for a session with Sarah on Monday at 2:00 PM. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Monday at 2:00 PM… very well. That should work. As long as it doesn’t run too long. I have a luncheon engagement afterward, you see. And please be assured, if I’m not satisfied with the session, I will not hesitate to voice my concerns. Honestly, Doctor, I do have a certain… discerning nature. Now, is there anything else I need to know? Perhaps a map to the clinic, or a list of appropriate attire? I wouldn’t want to arrive underdressed, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. Here’s a brochure with a map to the clinic and a list of what to expect during your first session. Comfortable clothing is recommended, and you may want to bring a water bottle. As for attire, anything you feel comfortable in is perfectly acceptable. And please, don’t hesitate to voice any concerns you may have during your session. Sarah and I are here to help you. Now, do you have any other questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: Hmm. Very well. No, I believe that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for your time. Though I must say, I’m still rather skeptical about this whole… physical therapy business. But I suppose it’s worth a try. Perhaps I’ll see some improvement. And please be assured, if this proves ineffective, I will not hesitate to explore other options. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a luncheon engagement to attend.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. I understand. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We’re here to support you. Have a pleasant luncheon, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next week.
