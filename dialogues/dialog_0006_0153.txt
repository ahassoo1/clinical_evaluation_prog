DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn, good to see you. Or, uh, good to meet you. You’re 69, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Sixty-nine. Though honestly, the years… they kind of blur together after a while, you know? I mostly just need this done so I can get back to work. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand, sir. We’ll try to be as quick as possible. Just need to figure out what's bringing you in today. What’s been going on?
PATIENT: Well, it's… a performance thing. They need me to get checked out. Some kind of… clearance? I work at the theater, you see. Ushering, mostly. Sometimes tickets. It’s mostly just standing, I think. Honestly, I don’t remember why they sent me. Something about being… safe to be around the public? Is that right? They just said I needed to come here.
DOCTOR: Right, a clearance… okay. So, are you experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. I get tired, of course. Being my age, and on my feet all day. But… that’s just normal, isn’t it? No coughs, no fevers… nothing sudden, anyway. My knees ache sometimes, but that’s been going on for years. Honestly, I feel pretty… average, for an old guy. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It does, a little. Average is good… or, well, not bad. Let’s just go through a quick checklist, just to be sure. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh, dear… I haven’t stepped on a scale in… well, a very long time. I think I'm about the same. Skinny, always have been. Probably haven't eaten enough, if I'm being honest with myself. I don't really keep track of that sort of thing. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It can be, yes. Alright. Any trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No, no trouble breathing. Not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes a little short of breath walking up the stairs at the theater, but… that’s just the stairs, isn’t it? It’s a very old building, you know. Lots of steps. I wouldn’t say it’s trouble breathing, exactly. Just… normal old-man puffing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. Okay. How about… any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. Not really. Sometimes a little… tightness, maybe? But that happens when I’m stressed, and the theater’s busy. It’s usually gone pretty quickly. Nothing serious, I don’t think. Mostly just indigestion. I eat a lot of… well, not enough good food, but still. No sharp pains or anything. I'd remember that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… now that’s a good question. Sometimes I feel a little… off-balance, especially when I stand up too quickly. But again, that could just be my age, you know? Or maybe not enough water. I forget to drink water. It’s not like a spinning room or anything. Just… a little wobbly sometimes. Does that count? I'm probably just old.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Krahn. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of things. Nothing too strenuous. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure… that sort of thing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… please be quick, if you could. I really need to get back to work. They're short-staffed, you see. And I don't want to keep anyone waiting. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here for me, please. Heart sounds are… regular. A little faint, but regular. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Not bad. Lungs are clear… a few scattered wheezes, but nothing significant. Pulse is 72, regular. A little weak. Alright. Just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Ears and throat, fine. Just… don't poke too hard. I'm a bit sensitive. Go ahead. I just hope this doesn't take too much longer. The manager gets upset if I'm gone for a while. He's a very… particular man.
DOCTOR: Ears look clear. Some wax buildup, but nothing obstructing the canal. Throat is a little dry, but no redness or swelling. Alright. Just a couple more things. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Standing up now. Be careful, I get a bit wobbly, you know. This floor is slippery too. Old building, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. One… two… three… four… five. Is that enough? I don't want to fall and cause a scene. This is all a bit much for an old man, you know? Just standing here makes me tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s enough. Thank you. You do seem a little unsteady on your feet. And a bit weak. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, it seems like you're generally healthy, but you do have some signs of mild frailty. Likely due to age and potentially some mild dehydration or insufficient nutrition. We need to check a few things to rule out anything serious. I'd like to order a CBC – that's a complete blood count – to check for anemia and infection. And a basic metabolic panel, to check your kidney function, electrolytes and blood sugar. Also, let’s get a Vitamin D level, as deficiency can cause weakness and unsteady gait.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Lots of tests? Is it serious? I just want to get back to work, you know. I don't like being poked and prodded. And I don't really understand all those words… CBC, metabolic… it’s all a bit much. Do I need to come back again? Will this take long? I really don't want to cause any trouble. Honestly, I’m probably just tired.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Krahn. It's just standard procedure to rule things out. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. The CBC checks your blood cells, the metabolic panel checks your kidney function and sugar levels, and the Vitamin D… well, that just checks if you have enough Vitamin D. We'll need to draw some blood. It will take about 15 minutes. I'll give you a requisition form. You can go to the lab across the street. Then, we’ll review the results when they come back, and we can discuss a plan. That'll be in a few days, probably. I can also give you a referral to a nutritionist, just to help with your diet. That might help with your energy levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a nutritionist… Oh dear. This is getting complicated. Alright. Fine. Blood tests and a nutritionist. But please, can you make it as quick as possible? I really don't like being away from work. And I’m not sure I can afford a nutritionist, if you don't mind me asking. Is it expensive? Just… as long as it doesn't take too much of my time. And as long as it doesn't cost too much. Honestly, I probably just need a good rest. But alright, I'll do the tests. Just get me the form. And the information about the nutritionist, if you could. Then, I can go. Please.
DOCTOR: Here’s the requisition form for the lab. It’s across the street, as I said. And here’s the information on the nutritionists. Some offer sliding scale fees, so it might be more affordable than you think. I'll also write down a note for your workplace, explaining you were here for a medical evaluation. It'll just say you were seen for a routine check-up, nothing specific. If you feel significantly worse, or develop any chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Emergency room… No, no questions. Just… thank you. For everything. For the form, for the note, for trying to understand. I'll go do the blood tests, then I'll look at the nutritionist information. I really hope it doesn't take too long. And I hope I can get back to work soon. Honestly, I just want to get back to normal. This has been… a lot. Alright. Thank you again. I'll… I'll see you when the results come back. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Take your time. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
