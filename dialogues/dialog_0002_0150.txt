DOCTOR: Hi Angelle, good morning! I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s get straight to it. I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be…easy. No problems. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I’ve heard stories. I don’t want to be a story.
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely understand. It’s smart to be proactive, and it’s good you’re thinking about this now. “Easy” is always the goal, right?
PATIENT: Right. Exactly. And frankly, I expect it to be easy. I take care of myself. I always have. I eat well, mostly. And I’m…sturdy. <She gestures to her height and build with a slight wave of her hand.> So what’s the first thing you need to know? I’m divorced, by the way. Not that it matters, but I figured you’d want to know the…background.
DOCTOR: Divorce doesn’t necessarily matter, but thanks for letting me know – it’s helpful to have a full picture. And yes, “sturdy” is a great way to put it! That’s often a good sign. Let’s start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been pregnant before?
PATIENT: No. Never. And honestly, I’m a bit surprised it hasn’t happened already. I wasn’t…careless, if that’s what you’re thinking. Just…never the right time, I suppose. And then…well, things changed. So now is the time. Are you going to ask about…everything? Because frankly, I find it a bit intrusive. I’m here because I want a baby, not a life review.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask, and I apologize if it feels intrusive. We just need some information to make sure everything is as healthy as possible. It’s not a life review, I promise, just a few key questions. We’ll focus on what’s relevant to getting pregnant. First, do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Perfectly healthy, as far as I know. I have Medicare, which means I get regular checkups, and they always say I’m…robust. That’s their word. Robust. I had a little trouble with my knees a few years back, but physical therapy fixed that. Does that count? Because I think that’s just…old age. I'm 51, you know. It happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Knee therapy is helpful to know, but doesn’t sound like it’ll be a problem. “Robust” is excellent! And it's smart to be aware of your age and what changes that might bring. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've always been…careful. I avoid risk. Surgeries…they're just…unnecessary, usually. I’d rather fix things myself, if possible. I can handle a lot, you know. I repair bicycles for a living. That takes strength and precision. It’s not sitting around being delicate. So, no. No surgeries. Are we getting closer to figuring out why this shouldn’t be simple? Because frankly, I’m starting to get annoyed.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Angelle. We're just trying to gather information to ensure it is simple. That’s the goal, right?
PATIENT: Precisely! That is the entire point. So, what’s next? Blood tests? Just get on with it. I have things to do. I don’t spend my days sitting in doctor’s offices, you know. I have a business to run. And frankly, waiting around is a waste of my time. Is that a problem? Because I’m not known for my patience.
DOCTOR: No, not a problem at all. Blood tests are a great next step. We'll check your hormone levels, make sure you're not deficient in any vitamins, and check for any underlying conditions that might affect fertility. It's pretty standard. <I hand her the form.> This lists everything they'll be testing. The lab is just down the hall. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before you go?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I'm Hungarian, you know. We’re…tough. Besides, I’ve been poked and prodded enough in my life. Just get it over with. And try to be quick about it, please. I really don’t have all day. I’m assuming this won’t take long? Because if it does, I might just leave. Honestly. I have a repair to finish by five. A vintage Peugeot. Very delicate work. <She taps the form impatiently.> So, what do I do with this? And when will I get results? I need to plan my schedule.
DOCTOR: Just take this form to the front desk and they'll direct you. The lab will draw the blood. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes total. As for results, it typically takes 2-3 business days for them to come back to us. We can call you with the results, or you can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in person, whichever you prefer. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable. As long as it doesn’t take longer than three days. And call me, please. I don’t want to sit around waiting for an appointment. I have a business to run. <She grabs the form and stands up.> Alright. Let’s get this over with. I hope you find everything is perfectly normal. Because frankly, it should be. <She turns and walks briskly towards the front desk.> .
