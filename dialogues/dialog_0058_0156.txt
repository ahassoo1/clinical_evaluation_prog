DOCTOR: Alright, Jase, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. I’ve been having… a lot of trouble with that, lately. Like, a lot of… going to the bathroom. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s really getting annoying. I don’t even really know why, honestly. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: “Annoying,” right. Well, we'll try to figure out why it's happening. "A lot of going to the bathroom"—can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, “annoying” is… putting it mildly. Okay, um… it's really watery, mostly. And often. Like, way more than usual. Several times a day, easily. Sometimes even wake up in the night. It’s… just constant, basically. I’m sorry, it's kinda gross to talk about. I just… I’m tired of it. I don’t really remember when it started exactly, just… gradually got worse.
DOCTOR: Watery and frequent… several times a day, including waking you up at night. Okay. And is it just more frequent, or is it also a larger volume each time?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… both, actually. More times and… more each time. Definitely more than normal. It’s hard to explain. Like, I feel like I can’t even… leave the house sometimes, because I'm worried I won’t be near a bathroom. Does that make sense? It’s not… painful, usually. Just really… inconvenient and exhausting.
DOCTOR: Exhausting, yes. Well, these things happen. Alright, so no pain. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Um… I don’t… I don’t think so. I haven’t really… looked, to be honest. I know, that sounds bad, right? I just… try to avoid thinking about it too much. Sorry. I usually just… hurry up and deal with it. I don’t actively look for anything… unusual. I'm not sure if that makes sense. It’s just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's not ideal to not check, but I understand. Have you noticed any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this?
PATIENT: No fever, definitely not. And… I haven’t been sick, like, throwing up. Nausea… sometimes, maybe? But it’s not… bad. It's more like a general feeling of… unwell-ness, I guess? Like I just don't feel great, but not necessarily sick sick. It's hard to explain. It’s just… everything feels off when this is happening. I'm really not good at describing things, am I?
DOCTOR: "General feeling of unwell-ness.” Right. And have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet… hmm. Not really, I don’t think so. I mean, nothing major. Maybe I’ve been eating more takeout lately, because I haven’t been feeling up to cooking. But the food itself is still… the same, basically. I haven’t tried anything new or anything. I eat pretty much the same things all the time. I’m not a very adventurous eater. Is that relevant? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: More takeout…okay. And any recent travel?
PATIENT: Travel? No, not recently. Not for a long time. I haven’t left the city in… well, I honestly can’t remember when I last went anywhere. A few years, probably? Definitely not this year. I mostly just… go to work and come home. I'm not really a traveler. I wish I was, but…nah. Not recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Um… I take a vitamin D supplement, that’s it. And… no allergies, not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to take… something for my… I think it was anxiety, a while back, but I stopped taking that ages ago. That was… a few years ago now. Just the vitamin D currently.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Jase, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I'll feel it gently as well. It's standard procedure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds… good. I mean, I don’t love the idea, but I understand it's necessary. Just… be gentle, okay? I’m a bit sensitive, generally. Also, just so you know, I’m married. I wasn’t sure if that was… relevant. It just felt weird not to mention it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just standard procedure. Please lie down on the examination table. Try to relax. And your marital status is not relevant to this exam. Now, breathe deeply for me. Okay. I’m not hearing anything overtly abnormal, but there is some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, on both sides. Nothing alarming, but it is worth noting. I don't feel any masses.
PATIENT: Okay… tenderness, you say? On both sides? That… doesn’t surprise me, really. It’s been hurting there a bit, on and off. I just assumed it was… gas or something. Is that bad? I’m getting a little worried now, to be honest. Is it something serious? Should I be… getting tests done? I really don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: “Something serious” is a broad term. It could be a number of things. Given the frequency and severity of your symptoms, and the tenderness I’ve detected, I think it's prudent to run some tests. A stool sample, to rule out any infection, and a blood test to check for inflammation. We can also consider a simple urine test. It's standard procedure for this type of complaint, and it will help us narrow down the possibilities. I understand you dislike hospitals, and these tests can be done right here in the clinic. It’s not a lengthy process, and it’s the most responsible course of action. We need to rule out anything more serious. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Tests… okay. Stool sample, blood test, urine test. Right. That sounds… a lot. But I guess if you think it’s necessary… I don’t really want to ignore it, obviously. It's just… everything feels so overwhelming. How will I… collect a stool sample? And the blood test… will it hurt a lot? I’m really scared of needles. And… what if it is something serious? What are we even looking for? Is it… is it anything like… IBD? My aunt had that, and she was really sick. Sorry, I’m probably being dramatic. I just… get anxious easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take this one step at a time. The stool sample is… straightforward. The clinic will provide you with a collection kit, with instructions. You collect a small sample at home, and bring it back to the clinic. It's not pleasant, but it's not difficult. The blood test is a standard draw. There will be a small prick, yes, but it’s brief. We can use a numbing cream if you’re particularly anxious. As for “what we're looking for,” we're assessing for infection, inflammation, and any signs of malabsorption. IBD is one possibility, but it's far too early to jump to conclusions. We need the test results to determine the cause of your symptoms. I understand your anxiety, but panicking won’t help. Let's focus on getting the tests done, and then we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. Do you want me to explain the process of collecting the stool sample in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain the stool sample thing. The more detail, the better, honestly. I get really stressed when I don't know what I'm doing. And… the numbing cream sounds good, actually. Can you definitely do that for the blood test? Sorry for all the questions. I just… I don't want to be surprised or anything. And what if the results are bad? Will you… explain everything to me? I really hate doctors. No offense, of course. You seem… efficient. It’s just… I’ve had bad experiences before.
DOCTOR: Here. This pamphlet details the stool sample collection procedure. Essentially, you'll collect a small sample – about the size of a walnut – in the provided container after a bowel movement. It’s crucial to avoid any contamination with urine. The container needs to be sealed tightly and brought to the lab within 24 hours. As for the numbing cream, yes, we can definitely apply that to your arm before the blood draw. It won’t eliminate the sensation entirely, but it will minimize discomfort. And regarding the results… I will explain them to you in detail, regardless of what they are. I understand your past experiences, and I assure you I will do my best to answer all your questions and address your concerns. It's my job. Now, do you have any specific questions about the stool sample collection process, or shall we proceed with scheduling the tests?
PATIENT: Okay… a walnut-sized sample, no urine contamination, sealed container, within 24 hours. Got it. That… actually sounds manageable. I think. No, I think I understand the stool sample thing. It's just… embarrassing to think about, honestly. But I can do it. Scheduling the tests… okay. Yes, let’s do that. I guess the sooner we get it over with, the better. What days are available? And… will I need to fast before the blood test? I’m really hungry right now. Also, what if I get nervous during the blood draw? I tend to… faint sometimes. Is there somewhere I can lie down? Sorry, I know I’m being a pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. We have availability tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM for the blood draw and you can drop off the stool sample whenever the lab is open. You do not need to fast, but it’s best to avoid any large meals beforehand. We have a reclining chair in the recovery room. If you feel faint, please inform the phlebotomist immediately, and we can have you lie down. It’s best to be cautious. And you are not being a pain. I simply want you to be prepared. Let’s schedule the appointment. Do you agree to 9:00 AM tomorrow?
PATIENT: Yes, 9:00 AM is fine. Tomorrow. Okay. Reclining chair, don’t fast, tell them if I feel faint. Got it. Thank you. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. I’m still really nervous, but… I guess I’m ready. As ready as I can be, anyway. So… what happens next? Do I just… show up tomorrow morning? And is there anything else I need to bring with me besides the stool sample? Insurance card, maybe? I really hate hospitals.
DOCTOR: Yes, simply show up tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Bring your insurance card and a valid photo ID. Also, bring the stool sample – ensure it is sealed tightly in the provided container. The pamphlet contains directions to the lab. As for “hating hospitals,” this is a clinic, not a hospital. It's a smaller, less intimidating environment. We'll do our best to make you comfortable. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you… for explaining everything, and for being patient. I really appreciate it. You’ve… made me feel a little less anxious, at least. I still don’t like it, but… I’m glad I came. I guess I’ll see you tomorrow then. .
DOCTOR: Alright. See you tomorrow, Jase. And remember, if you have any urgent concerns before then, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. .
