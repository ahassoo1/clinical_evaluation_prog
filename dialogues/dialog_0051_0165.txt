DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. Look, I ain't got a lot of time, so I'll get right to it. I keep getting fevers. Comes and goes, you know? It's been happening for a little while now. Just wanna get it figured out, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: Of course, Clide. We’ll do our best to figure it out. When you say "a little while," could you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. Probably...oh, about three months, give or take a week. Maybe a little longer. It's hard to say exactly, you know? They don't happen every day. More like once a week, sometimes not for two weeks at a time. It's just annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly three months. And about once a week, give or take. Do you happen to know what your temperature gets to when you have a fever?
PATIENT: Temperature? Honestly, Doc, I don't bother with all that. I just feel warm, kinda shaky. My wife, Elena, sometimes takes it when I'm really out of it, but I don't usually ask what it is. I just take some Tylenol and try to sleep it off. It usually breaks within a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you haven’t been specifically tracking the temperature, but you know you feel warm and shaky. And Tylenol seems to help. Besides the fever and feeling shaky, are you experiencing any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Let me think...sometimes I get a little tired, achy. Like I pulled something, but didn't. And...sometimes a headache. Nothing terrible, you know? Just a dull ache. No cough, no sniffles, no nothing like that. Just the fever, tiredness, and achey feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright, so fever, tiredness, and achiness with occasional headaches. No cough or cold symptoms. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes, or anything that makes them better besides the Tylenol?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm... that's a good question. I don't think so. It just…happens. Seems random. Nothing I've been able to pinpoint. Maybe when I'm really stressed? Elena says I get more of them when I'm working in the garden a lot, but I love my garden. Makes no sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be fairly random, potentially with a link to stress or physical exertion like gardening. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I mean, I got high blood pressure a few years back, but the doc put me on a little pill for it and it’s been fine ever since. Other than that, just the usual old man stuff, you know? A little arthritis in my knees. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension, well-managed, and some arthritis in your knees. And are you currently taking any medications for those conditions, or anything else?
PATIENT: Just the one pill for the blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes the Tylenol when I get these fevers, like I said. That’s it. I try to stay away from taking too much stuff, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Elena’s always telling me I should write this stuff down, but I just…haven’t gotten around to it. Never had a problem with anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, regarding your family…are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm...my father had diabetes, I think. And my mother…she had heart trouble when she got older. Elena's side…I don’t really know. We didn’t talk about that stuff much. Just the usual, you know? People getting sick, passing away. Nothing really stands out.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information, Clide. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Get it over with. I got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you wouldn't mind stepping over here, and we'll get started. Okay, your temperature is slightly elevated at 100.2. Now let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 140/85. Your throat is a little red, but nothing too concerning. Ears look clear as well. I don’t feel any swollen lymph nodes. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it does sound like you’ve been experiencing recurrent fevers, along with some fatigue and body aches. The slightly elevated temperature and mild throat redness could be indicative of a viral infection, but it's hard to say definitively without further investigation. Given the recurrent nature of these symptoms, and the fact that they've been going on for three months, I think it would be prudent to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would you be agreeable to that?
