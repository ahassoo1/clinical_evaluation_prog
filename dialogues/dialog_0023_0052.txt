DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye, Doctor. Well, it's this nausea, ye see. Been happenin' most mornings now, for… oh, I'd say a month or so. It's not terribly violent, just… uneasy, like. And it's worryin' me a wee bit, given my heart isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, roughly a month. Started gradual, a bit o' queasiness, then it settled into a pretty regular thing. Usually first thing, before I’ve even had my tea. It does seem to pass after a bit, once I get somethin' in my stomach, but it's a right unpleasant start to the day, ye ken? And, like I said, with the heart… I just want to make sure it’s not somethin’ serious. I was diagnosed with heart failure… oh, must be five years ago now, maybe six. Doctor MacLeod was lookin' after me then, but he retired, didn’t he?
DOCTOR: Heart failure, alright. And you said it occurs before breakfast, consistently for about a month. Does anything specific trigger it, or does it just happen?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question, Doctor. I’ve tried to think on it, but no, nothin’ I can put my finger on. Doesn’t seem to matter what I ate the night before. Not tied to any particular activity, not that I’m doin’ a great deal o’ activity these days, mind ye. Just… appears. Like a wee unwelcome visitor. I do sleep fairly sound, though. Not that I remember wakin’ up feelin’ poorly, it's just… there, when I get up.
DOCTOR: And you haven’t noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea?
PATIENT: Och, aye, I've been keepin' an eye oot. Let me think… well, I've been a bit more breathless than usual, I suppose. Just when I’m walkin’ up the hill to the shop, that sort o’ thing. Nothing drastic, mind ye, but I do need to stop for a breather more often than I used to. And my ankles… they swell up a bit at the end o’ the day. Again, it comes and goes. Not every day, but often enough to notice. Does that sound important, Doctor? I worry about fluid build-up, ye see.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness and ankle swelling… predictable, given your history. Let’s do a quick exam. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your ankles. Then we can discuss potential causes and, if necessary, further investigation. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Aye, sounds sensible, Doctor. I'm happy enough to do that. My bones aren't what they used to be, ye ken, a wee bit creaky. Hopefully, ye won't hear too much o' that when ye listen to my chest! Go ahead when ye're ready.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little fast, and I can hear a slight murmur, which isn't new, but it is a bit more pronounced. Your lungs are clear, thankfully, but there is some edema in your ankles, as you noted. Given your heart failure diagnosis, and the recent worsening of your symptoms, it's likely your condition is being less well controlled. We need to get a better handle on your fluid retention and possibly adjust your medications. Do you remember what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Aye, I do. Doctor MacLeod had me on a few things. Let me see… there’s ramipril, 5 milligrams every day for the blood pressure, I believe. And then furosemide, 40 milligrams in the morning, that’s the water tablet, right enough. Oh, and digoxin, 125 micrograms, that’s for the heart itself, I think he said. I’ve been takin’ them all regular, same time every day. No changes to the dosage, not that I’m aware o’. I think that's everything. Is there anything else I should be rememberin’, Doctor? I try to be diligent, but the memory isn't what it used to be, even for things I take every day.
DOCTOR: Ramipril, furosemide, and digoxin, correct dosages. It's good you're adhering to the regimen. While this isn’t unexpected, it indicates a need for intervention. I'm going to order a blood test to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and digoxin levels, and an ECG to assess your heart rhythm. We’ll also need a repeat chest X-ray to assess for any fluid accumulation in your lungs. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now. Depending on the results, we may need to increase your furosemide dosage or consider additional medications. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I think so, Doctor. Blood test, ECG, and another chest X-ray… to check the kidneys, the salts, and… the rhythm o’ the heart, ye said? And see if there’s fluid build-up. Right. It all sounds… thorough, which is good. Increased dosage o’ the water tablet, maybe… and other medicines if need be. I’m happy enough to do whatever ye think best. I just want to feel a bit better, if I can. Will the blood test take long? And will I know the results quickly? I've got a bit o' a tea-makin’ appointment with Mrs. Henderson tomorrow afternoon, and I wouldn't want to be feelin' poorly. She makes a lovely scones, ye see.
DOCTOR: The blood test itself will only take a few minutes. The results, however, will take a couple of days to process. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as they’re available. As for your appointment with Mrs. Henderson… I can’t guarantee you’ll be feeling optimal by tomorrow, but we’ll do our best. For now, let's get the blood drawn and schedule the ECG and chest X-ray. The nurse will explain everything. Do you have any further questions for me at this moment?
PATIENT: Och, no, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… the tests, and then wait for the results. I'm used to waitin' on these things, unfortunately. Thank ye for lookin' after me, and for bein' so thorough. I appreciate it, I do. And tell the nurse I'm not too bad with needles, so long as they’re quick about it!
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly. I’ll review the results as soon as they're available and contact you to discuss a plan. Try to maintain a low sodium diet in the meantime. It can exacerbate fluid retention. That will be all.
PATIENT: Aye, low sodium, right. I’ll keep that in mind. Thank ye again, Doctor. I’ll see ye when I hear back.
