DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. I’m Dr. Voytek. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been…well, concerning enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes it feels a little…off in the right one, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in the leg. That is good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I believe, about three weeks ago. It wasn’t constant at first, just a sort of…tingling, like my foot was falling asleep. But it’s become more frequent, and the sensation…it's not just tingling now. It feels genuinely numb, like I can’t really feel pressure very well. It tends to happen when I’ve been on my feet for a while, like after a long day working on a project. Though, to be honest, it's happened a couple of times when I was just sitting too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started with tingling, now it's more of a true numbness, and it seems to be aggravated by being on your feet, but also happens with prolonged sitting. Does it radiate anywhere – like up your leg, or down into your foot?
PATIENT: Yes, it does radiate. It typically starts in my calf, and then moves down into my foot, especially my toes. Sometimes it feels like it's going up my leg a bit too, towards my knee. Not a sharp pain, more of a…spreading sensation of numbness, if that makes sense. It's quite odd. And it isn't always consistent; some days it’s barely noticeable, and others it’s…quite prominent.
DOCTOR: Okay, radiating numbness from the calf down to the toes, and sometimes up towards the knee, with varying intensity. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Um…moving it around seems to help, a little. Not a full fix, but if I stretch my leg, or walk around for a bit, the sensation does lessen. And, strangely, if I’m concentrating really hard on something – like when I’m deeply involved in animation work – I often don’t notice it at all. It's almost as if being mentally focused distracts me from it. I haven't actively tried anything specific to make it better, though. Mostly just trying to avoid standing for too long when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, movement and mental focus seem to provide some temporary relief. Have you experienced any weakness in your leg, or any difficulty walking?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no weakness. Walking isn’t difficult at all. I haven’t noticed any problems with balance, either. The numbness is just…uncomfortable, and concerning, more than anything. It doesn’t feel like my leg is going to give out or anything like that. I’m a fairly active person, so I’m always on my feet or using my legs, and haven’t noticed any real limitations so far, other than the sensation itself.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No weakness or problems with walking. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Never been diagnosed with anything, to my knowledge. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I do have a family history of…arthritis, on my mother’s side, but it typically sets in much later in life. I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of, and I’m not currently taking any medications. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I had a broken wrist when I was younger, but that healed completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, no allergies, and no current medications. Broken wrist in the past, fully healed. Let's do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Just let me know if you need me to adjust in any way.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. I'll also feel your pulses. This will just take a few minutes. Okay, your reflexes are normal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in both legs. Now, I'm checking sensation... Can you tell me when you can feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It feels…normal, I think. Not diminished or anything like that. Although, I do notice it’s a bit less…pronounced on the outside of my left foot, compared to my right. It’s subtle, but there is a difference. Perhaps that's normal variation though, I don't really know.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight decrease in sensation on the outside of the left foot. I'm also going to check your pulses. Your pulses are normal and equal bilaterally. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it sounds like this could be nerve related – potentially some compression or irritation of a nerve in your leg or foot. It's not enough to say definitively yet. I'm going to order an MRI of your lower back and leg to get a better look at the nerves and rule out anything more serious. Does that sound okay with you?
PATIENT: An MRI sounds…reasonable. If that will help determine what’s going on, then yes, that’s perfectly alright with me. I’m a bit concerned, naturally, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know what I need to do to schedule it. Is there anything I should be doing – or not doing – in the meantime, before the MRI?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll have the radiology department contact you to schedule the MRI. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that significantly worsen the numbness. Continue doing things that provide relief, like stretching and walking around. Try not to ignore it and push through the pain. If the numbness becomes severe, or you develop any weakness or difficulty walking, please come back to the clinic immediately or go to the emergency room. I’m going to give you a referral for physical therapy as well. They can teach you some exercises to help strengthen your leg and improve your nerve function. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, actually. Physical therapy seems like a sensible step. So, to recap – avoid worsening activities, continue doing things that offer relief, and monitor for increased severity or weakness. And the radiology department will be contacting me to schedule the MRI. Is there anything else I need to know at this point, or any paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: No, that’s a perfect summary. I'll send the MRI order and the physical therapy referral electronically to your insurance company and the respective departments. You should receive confirmations soon. I'll also have the nurse print out a sheet with these instructions and a list of "red flag" symptoms to watch out for. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe I do. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel much more at ease knowing what the next steps are. Thank you for your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your MRI. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I will.
