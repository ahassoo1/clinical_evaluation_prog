DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon. Yeah, hi. Look, it’s… unpleasant. Been throwin’ up blood. Not a lot, thankfully, but enough to worry me. It started a couple days ago, just after… well, never you mind when. It’s the stomach, obviously. Feels… rough.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand. Vomiting blood is certainly concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the blood a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want to know, the shade of red? Look, it's… bright. Like, not dark and old, bright red. And… chunky sometimes. Bits in it, you know? Sorry to be graphic, but that’s what it is. It's not like a steady flow, more like… spurts when I heave. And it smells… well, it smells like blood, what does blood smell like? I don't spend my days sniffin’ this stuff, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. No need to apologize – it’s important to be as specific as possible, and you’re doing a good job describing it. Bright red blood suggests it's coming from somewhere higher up in the digestive tract, like the esophagus or stomach. The “chunky” bits are also important information. Have you been experiencing any abdominal pain along with the vomiting?
PATIENT: Pain? Yeah, some. Not like, crippling, but it's… gnawing. Right here. It gets worse after… well, after I eat. Or try to, anyway. Doesn’t matter what it is. Toast, soup, doesn’t make a difference. Feels like somethin’s twisted in there, ya know? And heartburn. Constant heartburn. I thought it was just… old age, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, heartburn and gnawing pain in your upper abdomen, especially after eating, is helpful information. It sounds like there may be some irritation or inflammation in your stomach or esophagus. I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain in any specific areas. I'll start here on the right side... and then move to the left.
PATIENT: Go ahead. Don’t be gentle too gentle. I’ve spent my life dealin’ with… things. A little poking ain’t gonna bother me. Oof. There. Right… there. That’s a bit tender, yeah. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Feels… swollen, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I see. Tenderness in that area is consistent with some inflammation. I’m going to listen to your abdomen now with my stethoscope. Your bowel sounds are present, but a little… diminished. Not severely, but quieter than I'd expect. Now, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Diminished, huh? What does that mean exactly? Look, I ain’t a doctor. Just tell me if it’s bad. As for other stuff… I’ve been tired. Really tired. More than usual, and I’m always tired. And… well, I haven’t been… regular, if you catch my drift. Haven’t had a proper… movement in days. Just feelin’ all… backed up, ya know? And thirsty. Constantly thirsty.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. “Diminished” means the sounds your bowels make are quieter than normal, which can suggest a blockage or slowing of the digestive process. We'll need to investigate further to determine the cause. The fatigue, constipation, and increased thirst are also important symptoms. Now, I’m going to ask some questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you had any previous medical conditions diagnosed?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fire away. Look, I had… let me think. Old age, mostly. Bad back for years, from… work. Had my appendix out when I was a kid, standard stuff. But nothin’ major. And… well, my wife… she passed a few years back. Heart problems. That's about it. No allergies that I know of. Don't go takin' any medications, either. Never been much of a pill-popper.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Gentz. That must have been very difficult. Okay, so no current medications and no known allergies. Regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like stomach problems, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father, he had… ulcers. Bad ones. Ended up in the hospital a few times for ‘em. And my mother… she had stomach cancer, actually. Years ago. That was… not a good time. My side of the family, we ain't exactly known for strong stomachs, if you catch my drift. It's always somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, that’s very important information. Given your symptoms, your family history, and the presence of blood in your vomit, I’m concerned about the possibility of a stomach ulcer or other gastrointestinal issue. I’m going to quickly check your electronic health record to see if there's any prior relevant information. One moment... Alright, I see a note from three years ago about heartburn, but nothing further. Given your history, I recommend we run some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your organ function, and a stool test to rule out any infection. I also think an upper endoscopy would be very helpful. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? What's that involve exactly? Stickin’ a camera down my throat? Sounds… unpleasant. Look, I ain't afraid of a little discomfort, but I'd like to know what I'm gettin’ myself into before you start shovin’ tubes down me. And how much is all this gonna cost? I ain’t insured, you see. It’s gotta be… reasonable.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Mr. Gentz. It’s important to be fully informed. An upper endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached down your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum – the first part of your small intestine. It allows us to directly visualize the lining of these organs and look for any abnormalities, such as ulcers, inflammation, or tumors. We can also take small tissue samples during the procedure for further examination. It is generally well-tolerated, and we use a local anesthetic to numb your throat to minimize discomfort. It usually takes about 15-30 minutes. Regarding the cost, because you are uninsured, it can be significant. The endoscopy itself will likely cost around $1500-$2500, and the lab tests will add another $300-$500. However, our billing department is very good at working with patients to create payment plans, and we may be able to offer a discount based on your financial situation. I can have them contact you directly to discuss your options. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the tests, and have the billing department reach out to you?
PATIENT: $2000? Just to look down my throat? Seems… excessive. But… I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? If you think it’s necessary… alright. Order the tests. And please have someone from billing contact me. I need to know what I’m gettin’ into financially. Don’t want any surprises. And… is there anything I need to do to prepare for this… endoscopy? Fastin’ or somethin’?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Gentz, and I assure you we’ll do everything we can to help. It’s a difficult situation, and I’m glad you’re willing to proceed with the tests. Okay, I’ve ordered the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and the upper endoscopy. You’ll receive a call from our scheduling department within the next 24 hours to arrange the endoscopy appointment. Yes, you'll need to prepare for the endoscopy. You’ll need to fast for at least eight hours before the procedure – that means no food or liquids. You'll also need to arrange for someone to drive you home, as you won't be able to drive yourself after the sedation. We’ll provide you with detailed written instructions with the appointment confirmation. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to avoid any irritating foods, such as spicy or acidic foods, and drink plenty of fluids. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as increased vomiting, blood in your stool, or severe abdominal pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it for now. Just… hope it ain't nothin' too serious. And again, thanks for workin' with me on the billin'. I appreciate it. I’ll be waitin’ for that call. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gentz. I understand your anxiety, and we’ll do our best to get you a diagnosis and treatment plan as quickly as possible. Please don’t hesitate to call our office if you have any concerns before your appointment. I wish you all the best, and we’ll be in touch soon.
