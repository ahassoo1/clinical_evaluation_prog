DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Shely. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about… trying to be more present, you know? I keep hearing about mindfulness and meditation and how helpful it can be. I thought maybe you could tell me a little about it, and if it might be something good for me to try. I just feel…scattered sometimes, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sugino. It's quite common to feel scattered in today’s world. You're seeking information about mindfulness and meditation and whether it might be beneficial for you. That’s a very proactive approach to your well-being. Before we delve into that, just to ensure I have a complete picture, could you describe what you mean by “scattered”?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It's not… anxiety, exactly. More like my mind is always jumping ahead, or replaying things that happened. It makes it hard to really focus on what I’m doing while I’m doing it. Like, I’m repairing a switch, and I’m thinking about lunch, or a problem on another track, or what I need to get at the store. It doesn't happen all the time, but enough to be… distracting. And sometimes a little frustrating. I want to be more… grounded, I suppose. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Sugino. It sounds like you’re experiencing a degree of difficulty with sustained attention and a tendency for your mind to wander – what some people refer to as “mind wandering.” It's not uncommon, and certainly doesn’t necessarily indicate a larger issue. The desire to be more “grounded” is a very valid goal. To help me understand this better, and to rule out any underlying factors contributing to this, could you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… That’s a tricky one. It’s not like it was a sudden thing. It’s probably… gradually gotten worse over the last few years? I'd say after my divorce, maybe? But honestly, work is pretty demanding, and it’s always been a bit of a chaotic job, so it's hard to pinpoint. I’ve always been able to manage, but lately, it feels like I’m dropping more balls, if you know what I mean. Forgetting things, being less efficient… little things, really. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Sugino. A gradual onset over several years, potentially correlated with the stress of the divorce and the demands of your profession. It sounds like this has been a subtle but noticeable change in your cognitive function. It’s good you’re recognizing it now. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Sleep. That's… not always the best. I don’t have trouble falling asleep, usually, but I wake up a lot during the night. Sometimes just once, sometimes… more. And then my mind starts racing again. It's usually something work-related, or just… things I need to remember. I don't usually have trouble getting back to sleep, but I don’t feel very rested in the morning. It’s not every night, but it happens often enough that I definitely feel it during the day.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sugino. Frequent awakenings with racing thoughts are certainly relevant. And it sounds like this impacts your daytime energy levels. Now, have you noticed any difficulties with your memory, beyond the occasional forgetting you mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not…major difficulties, no. It’s not like I’m forgetting important things, or getting lost. More like… misplacing my keys, or forgetting a name right after someone tells it to me. Small things, really. And I always remember them eventually. But it's happening more often, and it's… annoying. I used to have a very good memory for details about the tracks, about the switches, everything. It feels like that’s… not quite as sharp as it used to be. Is that making sense? I don’t want to sound like I’m complaining!
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Sugino. You’re not complaining at all. It's helpful to have a detailed understanding of what you're experiencing. So, subtle decline in recall, primarily affecting everyday things, but with some perceived impact on your professional memory. Before we discuss mindfulness and meditation further, I’d like to briefly ask about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think. Nothing major, no. I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. I've had a couple of surgeries, a knee replacement a few years ago and a gallbladder removal years before that, but those are all healed up. And I have Medicare, so they keep pretty good track of things, I imagine. Other than that… I'm pretty healthy, all things considered. I try to eat well, and I’m always moving around at work, even if it’s stressful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sugino. Managed hypertension, previous knee replacement and gallbladder removal. And you are covered by Medicare, which is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, just the one for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. A small dose, and it seems to keep things under control. My doctor checks it regularly. I also take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, because we don’t get much sun here. That’s it, really. No herbal remedies, or anything like that. I’m pretty cautious about taking things, unless my doctor tells me to.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sugino. Lisinopril and vitamin D. That's helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven't noticed any issues with pollen or dust or anything like that. I used to be around cats a lot as a child, and I was fine. So, no allergies that I’m aware of. Is there anything else you need to know about my medical history? I'm happy to answer whatever you need.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Sugino. No known allergies. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, I’d like to briefly ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, like me, and she also had some arthritis. My father… he died young, from a heart attack. He was a smoker, unfortunately. As far as anything neurological… not that I know of. No one in the family was ever diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer's, but my grandparents… they were both pretty old when they passed away, and I don't really remember much about their health. So, I don’t have a lot of information to go on, honestly. It’s a bit of a… mystery, really. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Sugino. Hypertension and heart disease in the family, with limited information regarding neurological conditions. Now, just a couple of final questions before we proceed with a brief physical exam. Could you describe your typical daily routine?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I usually wake up around 6:00 AM. I have a cup of coffee, and then get ready for work. I usually leave the house around 7:00 AM, and my workday starts around 7:30 AM. I work on the tracks until around 4:00 PM, and then I drive home. I usually have something simple for dinner, and then I relax for a bit. I like to read, or watch TV. Sometimes I see friends, but not as often as I’d like. I try to get to bed around 10:00 PM, but sometimes I stay up later if I’m reading a good book. It’s pretty routine, really. Nothing too exciting. A lot of driving, a lot of work, a lot of trying to stay focused! What about you? Do you have a busy day? I don’t mean to turn this around on you.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Sugino. No, my day isn’t nearly as demanding as yours. It sounds like you have a full and active life. Now, I want to ask about your social habits. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. Never smoked a day in my life, and I don’t drink alcohol, either. My father was a smoker, and I saw what it did to him, so I always stayed away from it. I don’t have any interest in recreational drugs, either. I've never really been tempted. I like a good cup of coffee, and a good book, and that’s enough for me. I find it’s best to keep things simple. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sugino, that’s exactly what I was looking for. It sounds like you maintain a very healthy lifestyle. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. This will include checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment to evaluate your memory and cognitive function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Go ahead. I understand it's just to get a better picture of things. I’m happy to cooperate however I can. Where should I start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat here, we'll begin with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but within an acceptable range given your history of hypertension and recent activity. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions and do a few simple tests to assess your memory and cognitive function. Please answer to the best of your ability. First, could you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today is August 2nd, 2025.
DOCTOR: Very good. And could you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: We are in your office, at the clinic. It's a nice, bright room. I noticed a picture of a cat on your desk. It’s very cute! Is that yours?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s my cat, Luna. Thank you for noticing. Now, I'm going to say three words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me after I finish. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please try to remember them. Now, can you repeat the three words for me?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards. Take your time.
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… d-l-r-o-w. Is that right? It's harder than it looks!
DOCTOR: That is correct! Very good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more questions. First, can you tell me the name of the current president?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… I always forget these things. Let me think… is it… Harris? No, wait. That’s the vice president. It's… Biden. Joe Biden. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, I’m going to ask you to count backwards from 100 by sevens. Take your time. This is just another assessment.
PATIENT: Okay… let's see. 100, 93, 86, 79, 72, 65, 58, 51, 44, 37, 30, 23, 16, 9, 2… Oh, I’m losing track. I think that’s enough? It’s harder than it sounds! I’m usually good with numbers, but my mind is a little scattered today.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Sugino. You did very well, especially considering you acknowledged feeling a bit scattered today. Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination is good. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. However, the slight difficulty with recall and the serial sevens test, coupled with your report of cognitive changes, suggest a mild degree of cognitive impairment. It’s important to note this doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but further investigation is warranted. Now, do you have any questions about the examination so far?
PATIENT: No, not yet. That makes sense. So, it’s not… alarming, but I should be looked at a bit more closely? What sort of things would that involve? Are we talking scans, or…? I admit, I'm a little nervous now. I just wanted to learn about mindfulness, not… this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Sugino. It's natural to feel a little nervous. Please be assured, we are taking a cautious approach. What I recommend are some basic blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your cognitive changes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. Additionally, I would like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. This will involve a series of tests designed to evaluate your memory, attention, language, and other cognitive functions. This isn't necessarily about scans at this stage; the neurologist will determine if any imaging is needed based on the results of the assessment. It's about gathering more information to get a clear understanding of what’s going on. In the meantime, we can absolutely discuss strategies for improving cognitive function, such as mindfulness and meditation, which you originally came in to learn about. Would you like to proceed with the blood tests and referral?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds… reasonable. Blood tests and a referral. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. And yes, I’d still like to talk about mindfulness. If it can help, even a little, I’m willing to try. It’s just… it's a lot to take in. I guess I was hoping for something simpler.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sugino. It’s completely okay to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take things one step at a time. I’m going to write an order for the blood tests now. They can be done at the lab across the hall. The results typically take a few days. Here’s the order. Once you’ve had the tests done, please let the lab know to send the results directly to this clinic. I will also schedule an appointment for you with Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist specializing in cognitive function. Would you prefer a morning or afternoon appointment?
PATIENT: Afternoon would be better, if possible. I work mornings. And thank you, Dr. Shely. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It does help, even if it’s a little… unsettling. This is just… a lot. Maybe we can talk about mindfulness while I wait for the results? Just to… take my mind off things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sugino. That’s a perfect idea. We’ll take things at your pace. Let’s focus on something positive for now. Mindfulness, at its core, is about paying attention to the present moment without judgment. It's a practice that can help you become more aware of your thoughts, feelings, and sensations, without getting carried away by them. It can be incredibly helpful for reducing stress, improving focus, and enhancing overall well-being. There are many different ways to practice mindfulness. One of the simplest techniques is to focus on your breath. Just pay attention to the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body. When your mind wanders, gently redirect your attention back to your breath. It's okay if your mind wanders – it’s a natural process. The key is to practice regularly and be patient with yourself. Have you ever tried any meditation techniques before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve… read about it, of course. And I’ve seen it on television, people sitting cross-legged and humming. It always seemed… difficult. And I don’t think I have the patience to sit still for that long. My mind is always racing. I just don’t know if I could quiet it enough to make it work. It feels… counterintuitive, somehow. If I try to not think about things, I just end up thinking about not thinking about things! Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Sugino. That's a very common experience! It's perfectly normal for your mind to wander, especially when you're first starting out. The goal isn't to stop your thoughts, but to observe them without getting carried away by them. It’s like watching clouds drift by in the sky. You notice them, but you don’t try to hold onto them. And you don’t necessarily need to sit cross-legged and hum! There are many different ways to practice mindfulness. You can practice while walking, eating, or even doing everyday tasks. We can start with a simple guided meditation exercise right now, if you’re comfortable with that. It will only be a few minutes long. Or, if you’d prefer, we can discuss some practical techniques you can try on your own. What would you feel more comfortable with?
PATIENT: Let’s talk about techniques first. A guided meditation feels a bit… intimidating right now. I’d rather have something I can try on my own, at my own pace. Something simple. Maybe something I can do while I’m working, if that’s possible? I spend a lot of time on the tracks, and I need to be focused, but… sometimes my mind just drifts.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a perfect starting point. Trying to integrate mindfulness into your daily routine is a great way to build the practice. Since you spend a lot of time on the tracks, let’s focus on a technique called “body scan awareness.” This involves paying attention to the physical sensations in your body. As you’re working, simply bring your awareness to your feet on the ground, the feeling of your hands on the controls, the temperature of the air on your skin. If you notice your mind wandering, gently redirect your attention back to your body. Don’t judge yourself for getting distracted – it’s a natural part of the process. The goal is to simply be present in your body, without getting carried away by your thoughts. Another technique is "five senses awareness." Pause briefly and notice five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help to anchor you in the present moment. Would you like me to provide you with some resources – perhaps a website or a guided audio – that offers more detailed instructions on these techniques?
PATIENT: Yes, please! That would be wonderful. A website would be great. Something I can refer back to when I have a quiet moment. And thank you, Dr. Shely. This is… helpful. I still feel a bit anxious about the tests and the neurologist, but… this gives me something to focus on. Something I can do while I wait. It’s nice to have a little bit of control, even if it’s just over my own thoughts.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. It's wonderful that you're taking a proactive approach to your well-being. Here, I recommend the website "Mindful.org." It has a wealth of resources on mindfulness, including guided meditations, articles, and practical techniques. The URL is mindful.org. They also have a section specifically on mindfulness for everyday life. I’m also going to give you this card with the contact information for Dr. Sharma, the neurologist. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions before your appointment. We've covered a lot today - your initial concerns, the plan for tests and referral, and strategies for integrating mindfulness into your life. Do you have any further questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. Shely. You’ve been very patient and understanding. And… thank you for not dismissing my concerns. It’s nice to feel like someone is listening. I guess I’ll try the website and see if I can quiet my mind a little. It might take some practice, but… I’m willing to try.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I'm glad I could help. Remember, it’s a journey, not a destination. Be kind to yourself, and don’t get discouraged if it takes time. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way. I wish you all the best. Have a good day, Ms. Sugino.
