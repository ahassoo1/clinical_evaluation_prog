DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Panjoj. Thank you for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. Been gettin' these fevers, keep comin' back. It’s been… well, a little over a week now, I guess. Feels like the flu, but it goes away for a day, then pops right back. It's a pain, honestly. Just wanna get rid of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. A recurring fever for over a week… that is bothersome. Can you tell me a bit more about these fevers?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts in the afternoon, kinda like a chill, you know? Then I get warm, real warm. I usually take my temperature, and it's around 101, 102. It hangs around for maybe six, eight hours, then breaks, and I feel okay for a bit. Like I said, it's not constant. It comes and goes. I haven't been able to pin down what sets it off, if anything does.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say you feel "okay" when the fever breaks, can you describe that?
PATIENT: Well, normal, mostly. A little tired, maybe a bit weak, but nothin' major. I can still get around, do my usual stuff. Just… not with as much pep, ya know? Like I said, I'm a chiropractor, so I'm used to being on my feet all day. When this hits, I gotta take it easy, but I haven't stopped workin' completely. Not yet, anyway. It just makes things harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're a chiropractor… that's good to know. And you’ve been able to continue working, although with some difficulty. Besides the fever and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me think. No cough, no sniffles. No sore throat. I did have a bit of a headache a couple of times when the fever was really bad, but that went away when the fever broke too. Oh! And my wife says I've been a little more grumpy than usual. She's probably right, to be honest. But that could just be from feelin' sick, ya know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Clide. No cough, no sore throat, occasional headache. And the grumpiness is understandable with a recurring fever! Have you experienced any chills before the fever starts, or any sweating during or after?
PATIENT: Yeah, like I said, it usually starts with the chills. Not a shiverin' kinda chill, more like just feelin' cold, like I need another layer of clothes. Then it warms up fast. And, yeah, I get sweaty when the fever breaks, real sweaty. Gotta change my shirt sometimes. Not like a drenchin' sweat, but enough to notice it, ya know? It's all just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so chills precede the fever, and you experience some sweating when it breaks. Have you noticed any muscle aches or joint pain with these episodes?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, a little. Not terrible, but my lower back has been achin' a bit when the fever’s at its worst. And my knees feel kinda stiff, especially in the mornin’. But I’m a chiropractor, Doc, I'm always feelin' somethin' in my back. It could just be my job. It’s hard to tell what’s normal and what’s not, ya know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to distinguish job-related aches from illness symptoms. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothin' like that. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. High blood pressure, the doc told me a few years back, but I watch my salt and it stays under control. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains of gettin' older, ya know? Never been in the hospital for nothin' serious, never had any major surgeries. I did break my arm when I was a kid, fallin' outta a tree, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic conditions, controlled high blood pressure, and a childhood broken arm. That's good to know. Have you had any surgeries, other than that childhood arm?
PATIENT: Nope, that was it. Just the arm. No other surgeries. I try to stay away from hospitals if I can, Doc. Not my favorite place, ya know? I prefer fixin' people, not bein' fixed.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Clide. Many people feel the same way. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the stuff for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Small dose, once a day. And sometimes, when my back's really botherin' me, I'll take some ibuprofen. But that's it. No vitamins, no special supplements, nothin' like that. Keep it simple, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin'. My wife's the one with allergies, she's got a whole list, but I'm pretty lucky that way. I can eat whatever I want, thank goodness. Makes life easier.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, nope, and nope. Never touched 'em. My father was a smoker, and I saw what it did to him, so I stayed away from cigarettes. Alcohol… never really liked the taste. And drugs… not my thing. I’m a pretty straight-laced kinda guy, Doc. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And finally, do you have any family history of serious illnesses, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had diabetes, late in life. And my father had heart problems, that’s why he had to stop smokin', eventually. My older brother has high blood pressure, like me. But other than that, nothin' major that I can think of. Both my grandparents lived into their eighties, so we seem to have good genes, for the most part. That's about it, Doc. I think I've told you everything. Can we figure out what's goin' on with this fever? It's really gettin' me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Clide. Thank you for providing all of that information. It sounds like you're generally a healthy 65-year-old male with controlled high blood pressure and a family history of diabetes and heart disease. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and temperature, and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sounds good, Doc. Anything to get this fever figured out. Go ahead. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale slowly. Good. Now another one. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or abnormal sounds that I can detect. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not significantly different from your usual, considering you mentioned controlling it with medication. Temperature is 101.3 Fahrenheit. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses that I can feel. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Everything seems within normal limits so far, Clide, but the recurring fever is concerning. Given your age and the persistence of the fever, we need to investigate this further. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a few tests to rule out any underlying infection or inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, blood work sounds good, Doc. Whatever it takes. I just wanna feel normal again. Is it gonna be a long process? I got patients waitin' on me, ya know? I don't wanna be stuck here all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Clide. The blood work shouldn't take long to draw, and the results usually come back within 24-48 hours. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend you get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. If the fever spikes above 103 or you develop any new symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe headache, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything, Doc. Just get those tests done as quick as you can, and let me know what you find out. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen. I’ll make sure to rest up and drink plenty of water. And I will head to the ER if things get worse, you have my word. Alright, let's get this blood work done. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Clide. I'm glad we have a plan. The phlebotomist will be right with you to draw the blood. They'll need about a vial or two. Once that's done, they’ll send it to the lab, and we'll get the results as soon as they’re available. My nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you before you leave. Thank you for your patience. I'll do my best to get to the bottom of this. .
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Thanks again. I'll see you when the results are back. .
