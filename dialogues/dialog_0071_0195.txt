DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Or… is it Janeth?
PATIENT: Yes, Janeth is right. Though, honestly, people get it wrong all the time. It’s not so hard, is it? Anyway, good morning to you too, Doctor… Galena, was it? I just… well, my daughter said I should come get a card. A “get well” card, she called it. Seems silly, really. I don’t need a card.
DOCTOR: Janeth, right. Yes, sometimes names get… jumbled. Galena is correct. And it's quite alright, don’t worry about it at all. A card… hmm. Your daughter’s concerned, that’s good. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, she just keeps fussing. Says I sound… “low.” Low! Like I’m a broken radio. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. I've been a bit tired, I suppose. Working in the factory… it’s tiring work, putting those little bits together all day. But everyone gets tired. It doesn’t mean I need a doctor and a… card. It's just… she worries too much. She always has. She says I should ask you for encouragement. Honestly, doctors are for sick people. Not for… low voices and worried daughters.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your daughter is very caring. And it’s good to have someone looking out for you. "Low" could mean a lot of things, though. Sometimes tiredness can affect your voice, yes. But it’s best to be sure, just to rule out anything else. We don't want to dismiss anything, especially if it's bothering your daughter. Perhaps we could just have a quick listen, just for peace of mind?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. A quick listen? You're going to listen to my voice? Like I’m a songbird? It’s just… a voice, Doctor. It goes up, it goes down. It's always a little different. And I’ve been working, like I said. My hands ache, not my throat. But… fine. If it’ll keep her quiet, I suppose. Just get it over with. But don’t tell me it’s anything serious. I have work to do. And a perfectly good evening planned.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just a quick listen. No need for dramatics. It’s just a routine check. If you could just take a deep breath for me… and say “ahhh” when I tell you. Nothing complicated. And please, don’t feel like you’re wasting my time—or yours. We’re just being thorough. Now, go ahead. Deep breath… ahhh.
PATIENT: Ahhh… There. Happy now? It's perfectly normal. I told you. It's just… work. Hard work. And maybe a little bit of dust. Though they should be cleaning that factory better, honestly. It's dreadful. You’ll hear nothing wrong. Absolutely nothing. Now, can I go? I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, you’re right, it does sound fairly normal. But… there's a slight… raspiness. Very subtle, but it's there. And I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. Could you take another deep breath for me, please?
PATIENT: There! Are you satisfied? Still just… normal. I’m telling you, Doctor, this is ridiculous. I’ve worked in that factory for twenty years. Twenty years! A little bit of dust and a tired voice is all it is. Diminished breath sounds… Honestly, you doctors and your fancy words. It’s just… life. Can I please go now? I have dinner plans, and my husband gets very cross if I’m late. He makes a lovely dal bhat, you know. Though, he does complain about my daughter fussing over me. It’s a whole situation.
DOCTOR: Janeth, I understand your frustration. But, while it might feel normal to you – and I respect that completely – these diminished breath sounds are something we need to investigate further. It could be a number of things, from a mild infection to… something more. Given your history of working in the factory, it's important to rule out any occupational lung issues. I want to be cautious. Would you be willing to get a chest X-ray?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Now you want to radiate me? For a little bit of tiredness and a daughter who worries too much? Absolutely not. I’ve never needed an X-ray in my life, and I’m not starting now. It’s just… nonsense. You’re making a mountain out of a molehill. I told you, I feel fine. My husband would have a fit if he knew you were suggesting… radiation! Honestly, I think I’ll just go home. Thank you for your time, Doctor, but I think I’ve wasted enough of it—and mine—already. And please, don’t send my daughter a bill for this. She'll never let it go. I think I’ll just… rest. And maybe tell my daughter to find a new hobby. This is preposterous.
DOCTOR: Janeth, please. I understand your hesitation, and I apologize if I’ve upset you. But I’m not trying to scare you, I’m trying to be thorough. An X-ray is a simple procedure, and it could give us valuable information. If it's negative, we’re all relieved. But if there is something going on, early detection is key. Given your age and your work history… and the fact that you’re uninsured… I strongly recommend we at least consider a referral to a pulmonologist. They specialize in lung health and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation. I can connect you with a local clinic that offers reduced-cost services. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Reduced-cost services… Honestly. You think I want to go to a special clinic? It’s humiliating, Doctor. You’re making me feel like an old, broken thing. I work hard. My husband works hard. We’ve always managed. We don’t need charity. But… a pulmonologist… My brother, he had… something with his lungs, a few years ago. It wasn’t good. And he did go to a specialist. So… maybe. Maybe a referral wouldn't hurt. But I’m not making any promises. And I absolutely refuse to be fussed over. Just… a referral. And don’t expect me to be grateful. It's just… being sensible, I suppose. For my daughter, mostly. But don’t tell her that. Just… get the referral. And be quick about it. I have dinner to get to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth. Of course. No fussing, I promise. This is for Dr. Sharma at the Rural Health Clinic. She's excellent, and they do offer a sliding scale for payment. Here’s also a number for the clinic’s financial assistance program. If you experience any worsening symptoms – increased shortness of breath, chest pain, a persistent cough – please go to the emergency room immediately. Don’t hesitate. And please, tell your daughter I said to encourage you to follow up. I'm glad you're willing to consider the referral. It's always better to be safe, especially when it comes to your health. Now, go enjoy your dinner. And give your husband my regards. I hope it’s a lovely dal bhat. And don’t worry about feeling like an “old, broken thing.” You’re not. You’re a sensible woman taking care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Thank you, Doctor. Though I still think you're overreacting. But… Dr. Sharma, you say? I'll… look into it. And tell my daughter you said hello. She’ll be pleased. And thank you for… not fussing too much. It is a lovely dal bhat. He makes it with a special spice blend. You wouldn’t understand.
