DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head... back of my head... it hurts. Been hurting for... oh, maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Feels like a tight band, maybe? I don't know the names for things. Just hurts back there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about three days, coming and going, and you describe it as a tight band at the back of your head. That’s helpful. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm... more when I stand up quick. Or... if I bend over. And... when I work. I still am working, you know. Rail yard. Lots of moving things. Not as much as before, but... it gets worse when I’m doing that. Not too bad sitting still. It's a dull ache, not... sharp. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So it's aggravated by activity, specifically standing quickly, bending over, and work, and it's a dull ache. Do you notice anything else that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well... resting helps. Sitting quiet. And... a cool cloth on the back of my neck. My wife... she always did that for me when my head hurt. She... she passed two years ago. But that helped. Not much else, really. No... no loud noises bother it, or bright lights. Just... moving.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Brum. It's good to know what helps, even small things. Okay, so resting and a cool cloth provide some relief. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this new?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Many times. Not this bad, maybe. But… headaches. When I was younger, working on the rails, lots of sun, lots of lifting… they were common. But not for a long time. Maybe… ten years? Fifteen? Since I had one this bad. It's been quiet, mostly. Until now.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you've had headaches in the past, especially when you were doing more physically demanding work, but this is more severe and has returned after a long period of being headache-free. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache – things like dizziness, vision changes, nausea, or weakness?
PATIENT: No dizziness. My eyes… maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I have old eyes, you know? I need glasses. I have glasses. And… no, not sick to my stomach. No weakness. Just… the head hurts. And… I feel tired. Old tired, maybe? I am ninety years old, Doctor. That comes with it. But the head hurt makes the tired worse, I think.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Mr. Brum. Tiredness at ninety is perfectly normal! And it sounds like the headache is exacerbating that. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. I can do that. Just a little slow, you understand? Old bones don't move like they used to. Is this okay? I hope I'm not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Brum, take your time. Okay, everything seems relatively normal, but the muscles at the back of your neck are definitely quite tense. Your reflexes are a bit slow, which isn't unusual for your age, and strength and sensation are intact. I don’t detect any obvious neurological deficits. Blood pressure is 140/85, and pulse is 72. Given your history and the exam findings, it sounds like a tension headache, likely aggravated by your work and muscle strain. However, because this is new or different, and you're 90, I want to be cautious.
PATIENT: Okay. Tension headache… that sounds… reasonable. Muscles… I do a lot of turning my head, you know? Watching for trains. And… lifting things, still. Even if it’s not as much. So… what does that mean? Do I need… medicine? And… is it dangerous? I don’t want to… fall apart, Doctor. That’s my biggest fear.
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable fear, Mr. Brum. It does not sound like you're about to fall apart. A tension headache, while uncomfortable, is rarely dangerous. To rule out anything more serious, and to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a simple blood test – just to check your basic blood counts and rule out any inflammation. And an X-ray of your neck, just to make sure there aren't any issues with your vertebrae. As for medicine, we can try some over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're able to take them. Otherwise, acetaminophen is a good option. We can also discuss some muscle relaxants if the pain is severe and doesn’t respond to other measures. Would you be comfortable with those tests, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Tests… I don’t mind tests. I've had enough of those in my life. Blood… yes, I can do blood. And… X-ray. That’s… pictures, right? I don’t like radiation, but… if you think it’s important… yes. Medicine… I try to avoid medicine, if I can. But… if it helps… okay. What about… the ibuprofen? Is that strong? I don’t want to be… sleepy all the time. And… who pays for all this? I don’t have insurance, you see. That’s… a problem.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the ibuprofen and the cost. Ibuprofen is a mild anti-inflammatory and pain reliever, and while it can sometimes cause drowsiness, it's not common. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it makes you too sleepy, we can switch to acetaminophen. Regarding the cost, I know not having insurance can be a significant burden. The lab tests and X-ray will cost approximately $200-$300 total. I can connect you with the hospital's financial assistance program; they often have options for patients who are uninsured or have limited income. We can also discuss generic options, which are typically less expensive. Let’s start with the blood tests and X-ray. I’ll write you a referral to the lab and imaging center. Then, we can schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results and create a more comprehensive plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… a week sounds good. A little worried about the money, but… if there’s help, that’s good. Financial assistance… yes, please. I don’t want to be a burden. And… ibuprofen. I'll try that first. Low dose, you said? I remember my wife… she always said, “Start small, Mitchell.” She was a smart woman. Okay. Tests and a week. And… help with the money. Thank you, Doctor. You seem… kind. That makes a difference. I get nervous around doctors sometimes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. It's completely understandable to feel nervous, and I'm glad I can put your mind at ease. And your wife sounds like a very wise woman – excellent advice! I'll print out the referrals and a summary of our discussion for you. The lab will draw the blood, and the imaging center will take the X-ray. Both are located near the hospital, and the staff there are very friendly. I will also have my nurse, Maria, reach out to you with information about the financial assistance program. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You've been very helpful. Thank you for listening. And… for being kind. It’s… nice to feel listened to. I suppose… I should get going? My daughter… she's expecting me for lunch. I don't want to keep her waiting. Thank you again, Doctor. And… tell Maria I appreciate her help too. .
