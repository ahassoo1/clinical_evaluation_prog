DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Annesley, is it? Yes, well… honestly, I’m not entirely sure. My daughter just thought I should, you know, get checked. She worries too much, that girl. I feel fine, mostly. Just… old, I suppose. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s always good to get things checked, even if it’s just a general feeling of not being quite yourself. And it’s wonderful that your daughter is so attentive. “Old” is a very valid symptom, and we can definitely explore that. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by not feeling quite yourself?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s hard to explain. Things just… aren't as sharp as they used to be, you know? I used to be so quick with everything at the hospital… remembering instruments, anticipating the surgeon’s needs… Now, I sometimes… well, I forget where I put my glasses, even though they’re on my head! It’s embarrassing, really. And everything feels a bit… slower. I don’t have the energy I used to. Is that making sense? I’m probably rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like you're noticing some changes in your memory and energy levels. That’s very helpful information. It’s not rambling at all. Now, when did you start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It wasn’t a sudden thing, you see. It sort of… crept up on me. Probably… oh, a couple of years, maybe? After I retired, I think. It’s hard to say for sure. Things were busy at the hospital, always something happening. Time just… blurred together. My husband, bless his soul, he noticed it before I did, probably. He always had a good memory.
DOCTOR: A couple of years, gradually worsening… and noticed more by your husband. That's helpful. Now, Ms. Calvery, are you experiencing any difficulty with things like finding the right words when you speak, or understanding what people are saying?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes. Not all the time, thankfully. But there are moments… you know, when a word is right there, on the tip of my tongue, but I just can't grasp it. It’s frustrating! And sometimes, with the television… if people are talking fast, or with a lot of background noise, I have to ask my daughter to repeat things. She says I need to get my hearing checked, but I think it’s just everyone mumbling these days!
DOCTOR: That's understandable. It can be frustrating when words are difficult to find or conversations are hard to follow. We'll certainly look into both possibilities – potential hearing changes and any cognitive difficulties. Now, Ms. Calvery, have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my mood? Well… I get irritated easily, I suppose. Things just bother me more than they used to. Little things! Like… the way my daughter arranges the flowers. Or when the grocery store is crowded. My husband used to say I was a bit of a perfectionist, and I guess that hasn’t changed. I don’t think I’m more sad than usual, just… more easily annoyed. And I definitely don’t have the patience I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased irritability and decreased patience… that's good to know. Have you been experiencing any trouble with sleep, Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Sleep? Oh, that’s a whole thing. I used to sleep like a log. Now? I wake up several times a night. Sometimes it’s just…nothing. I just wake up. Other times, I'm thinking about… things. Old patients, things that happened at the hospital… worries. It’s hard to get back to sleep after that. And I definitely don't sleep as deeply as I used to. My daughter keeps telling me to try chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea is a good start. Frequent awakenings and difficulty with deep sleep… Okay. Now, Ms. Calvery, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. And… high blood pressure, I think. The doctor put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them a while back. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t like the side effects. And… arthritis in my hands, of course. Every old woman gets that, doesn't she? Nothing major, though.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, history of hypertension – although currently off medication – and arthritis in the hands. Thank you. Have you had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Oh! Yes. A hysterectomy, many years ago. And… a knee replacement, about ten years ago. That was a whole ordeal! But it healed well, thankfully. I can still walk, although it bothers me sometimes, especially when the weather is cold.
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy and a knee replacement. Good to know. Now, Ms. Calvery, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a bit of a mess, honestly. My mother had… I think it was diabetes. And… my father had something with his heart. He died when I was quite young, so I don't remember much about it. And… my brother, he had some trouble with his memory towards the end of his life, but we never really knew what it was.
DOCTOR: Diabetes in your mother, heart issues in your father, and memory problems in your brother. That’s helpful to know, Ms. Calvery. Now, I'm going to ask about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, he used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but I never cared for it myself. And… recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I was a surgical technician, for goodness sake! We had standards to uphold! I do enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, though. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Just the morning coffee. Now, Ms. Calvery, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’ve had plenty of medications over the years, being in the hospital and all, but never any problems. Sometimes the anesthesia makes me a little nauseous, but that’s about it. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, even occasionally?
PATIENT: Just… some ibuprofen for my arthritis, when it flares up. And sometimes a little something for sleep, but it doesn’t really work, so I don’t bother much anymore. Oh, and vitamins. A multivitamin, I suppose. My daughter makes sure I take those. That’s about it. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed, a multivitamin, and occasionally something for sleep that isn’t very effective. Thank you, Ms. Calvery. That gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. It will just involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… try not to poke too much. My skin is rather sensitive these days. A little neurological assessment? Is that… will that be difficult? I’m not very good at puzzles, you know. But go ahead, whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. No poking, I promise. And the neurological assessment is very simple – just a few basic tests to check your reflexes and coordination. Nothing complicated at all. Let’s start with your vital signs. I’m just going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 78 and regular. A bit elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Just look at my finger and follow it as I move it. Eye movements are full and smooth. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds… thorough. A slight murmur, you say? Is that bad? My husband always had a strong heart, I remember that. And my lungs… always felt quite good, actually. I used to sing in the church choir, you know. Oh! That tickles! Are we done now? I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Ms. Calvery. Just a few more quick tests. The slight murmur is often harmless, especially with your history of singing – it can be normal in people with strong voices. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me, if you’re able. Gait is steady, with no noticeable imbalance. Now, can you stand on one foot for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A bit wobbly, I must admit. It’s been a while since anyone asked me to do that. Oh dear! See? I told you I wasn’t very good at puzzles. It’s my balance, I think. Gets worse with the weather. Is that… is that a bad sign, Doctor? I’m starting to worry now.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Calvery, no need to worry. A little wobble is perfectly normal, especially with a history of arthritis and changes in the weather. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. Now, let’s sit back down. Alright, Ms. Calvery, that concludes the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings, it sounds like you're experiencing a combination of age-related changes, possibly some early cognitive decline, and some balance issues likely related to arthritis and potentially medication side effects. I want to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I’d also like to schedule you for a cognitive assessment with a specialist to get a more detailed evaluation of your memory and thinking skills. And finally, I’m going to refer you to a physical therapist for an evaluation and treatment plan to improve your balance and strength. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a lot. Cognitive decline? That sounds rather frightening, Doctor. And a specialist? I don’t like specialists. They always want to do more tests and… poke and prod. Blood work, I suppose that’s alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And physical therapy… well, I suppose it’s worth a try. If it helps my balance. But no poking, please. My daughter will be pleased you’re taking it seriously, I suppose. She’s always worried about my memory. Is it… is it serious, Doctor? Be honest with me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, it's understandable to be concerned. Based on what we’ve discussed, it’s too early to definitively say whether you have a serious condition like dementia. The changes you’re experiencing could be due to a variety of factors, including normal aging, medication side effects, or underlying medical conditions. That’s why it’s important to get a more thorough evaluation. The cognitive assessment will help us determine the extent of any cognitive decline and identify potential causes. Early detection and intervention can often help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. As for the tests, I will make sure the specialist is gentle and explains everything thoroughly. We'll take things at your pace. To summarize, I am ordering blood work to rule out any underlying medical issues. I'm also referring you to a cognitive specialist for a more detailed evaluation and to a physical therapist for balance training. I’ll also review your current medications and consider if any adjustments are needed. Does that sound like a reasonable plan, Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A reasonable plan, I suppose. As long as you promise no unnecessary poking. And… gentle specialists. My daughter will be relieved, I think. She's been urging me to get checked for ages. The blood work first, then the specialists? And you'll look at my medications? That’s good. I don’t like taking pills if I don’t need them. And… how long will all this take, Doctor? I don’t want to spend all my time in waiting rooms. I have a book club meeting next month, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. Blood work first, then we'll schedule appointments with the specialists after we have the results. I’ll also review your medication list and discuss potential adjustments. As for the timing, the blood work usually takes a few days to come back. Scheduling the specialist appointments may take a week or two, depending on their availability. I’ll do my best to expedite the process and minimize your time in waiting rooms. I understand you have a book club meeting to attend! We’ll work around your schedule as much as possible. I’ll have my nurse draw your blood today, and she’ll give you instructions on how to prepare. I'll also send the referral orders to the specialist and physical therapist. We'll follow up in a week or two once we have the blood work results to discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don’t think so. Just… try to remember my name, Doctor. I always feel like the doctors just see a chart number, not a person. Lilly Calvery. And… thank you. For being gentle. And not poking too much. My daughter will be so pleased you’re taking this seriously. She worries too much, that girl. But… it’s nice to know someone is looking out for me.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Ms. Calvery. And I promise I will remember your name. Lilly Calvery. I’m glad you feel comfortable with the plan, and I assure you, I see you as a person, not just a chart number. We’re a team in this, and I’m here to help you every step of the way. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a good day, Ms. Calvery, and enjoy your book club meeting next month.
