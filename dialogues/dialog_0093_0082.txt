DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Tayar is fine. I... I need to go somewhere. For work. Lots of flying. That’s it. I think. My wife... she always did the planning. Now... now I just need to make sure I don't get sick there.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're preparing for some work travel that involves a lot of flying, and you'd like to ensure you remain healthy while you're away. That’s very proactive of you. To best advise you, could you tell me a little more about this travel?
PATIENT: Travel? It's... far. Very far. Lots of heat, I think. And... bugs. Big bugs. Not nice bugs. I build things on the planes. Very important things. That's all I know, really. They just told me where to go. Not much else. They don't tell me details. Just… go fix.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it sounds like this is a work assignment to a warm climate with insects, and the specifics haven't been fully disclosed to you. That makes things a little more challenging, but we can certainly prepare as best we can. Before we focus on preventative measures, let’s talk a little about you. Have you experienced any health issues recently – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Health… uh. Not really. I mean… my wife… she took care of everything. She knew if I was sick. She’d give me… pills. Lots of pills sometimes. Now… I just feel… tired. Old, maybe? It’s been a few months since… well. I haven't been to a doctor since she was here. Everything felt different then.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely natural to feel that way after a significant loss, and it takes time to adjust to new routines, including managing your health. Thank you for sharing that with me. To get a clearer picture of your current health status, could you tell me if you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, insects, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. She always asked about that. Bees, I think. I got stung once, when I was little. Swelled up real bad. Had to go to the… the healer. That’s all I remember. Everything else… she took care of. Food… no, I don't think so. I eat everything. Mostly rice. And lentils. It's what we always ate.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bee sting allergy in the past. That’s good to know. And no known food allergies currently. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Not now. She had… a box. Lots of little bottles. I used to take something for my… my back. It hurt sometimes, from building. But… after she… I stopped. Didn’t see the point. Everything just hurts now, anyway. I just ignore it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to change routines after a loss. So, no current medications, and you previously took something for back pain. Mr. Tayar, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past…? Hmm. I… I broke my arm once, when I was a boy. Climbing a tree. Stupid thing to do. She was very angry. Aside from that… not much. I’ve always been strong. Worked hard. Didn’t have time to get sick. She made sure of that. Everything was… checked. Every year. Now… I don't even remember what they checked for.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, and regular check-ups in the past, though you don’t recall the specifics. That’s alright; we can focus on the present. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? No. Never. She wouldn't allow it. Too risky, she said. Hospital…? Just when I broke my arm. A quick visit. They put it in a cast. That was it. I just… I don’t like doctors. She always said they ask too many questions. And now… well, now I’m answering them. It feels strange.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Tayar. It’s perfectly natural to feel uncomfortable discussing your health, especially after having someone else manage it for so long. I assure you, I’m only asking these questions to get a complete understanding of your health and ensure you’re well-prepared for your trip. Could you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family…? My… my parents were strong. Worked in the fields. They… they died when I was young. Old age, mostly. My wife’s family… they were farmers too. Lots of… stomach problems, I think. She mentioned it sometimes. Nothing serious. Just… discomfort. That’s all I remember. It was a long time ago. She did most of the remembering, always.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Tayar. It sounds like there may be some history of gastrointestinal issues in your wife’s family. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? I work. A lot. Building planes. That's it. I eat rice. I sleep. Sometimes I walk. Not much else. I used to… go to the market with my wife. But now… it's just work. And sleep. It's a quiet life. A lonely life.
DOCTOR: I understand. A quiet and focused life. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke…? No. Never. My wife… she hated it. Alcohol… sometimes. A little bit. When we celebrated. Not much. Just… a small glass. Drugs…? No. Never. She would never allow it. She kept me… safe. Healthy. Everything was controlled. Everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Tayar. It sounds like your wife played a very important role in managing your health and well-being. Now, to get a better understanding of your current physical condition, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. This will help me assess your overall health and identify any potential issues before your trip. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Is that alright?
PATIENT: … Fine. Whatever you need to do. I… I guess it’s okay. But I don’t like being touched. She always did it gently. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Tayar. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. I will explain each step before I perform it, and you can tell me to stop at any time. First, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: … Okay. Done. Hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. Your heart rate and rhythm are within normal limits. However, I do hear some slight crackling in your left lung. It’s subtle, but it could indicate some congestion. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure. This might feel a little tight, but it won't hurt.
PATIENT: … Hurry. It feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is a little higher than ideal, 140/90. We'll need to monitor that. Now, I’d like to take your temperature and pulse.
PATIENT: … Done. Can we be finished now? I need to get back to work. They’re waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. Your temperature is normal, and your pulse is a bit elevated, which could be due to anxiety or stress. Now, I’d like to briefly examine your throat and listen to your abdomen. This will just take a moment. Your throat looks clear. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower left quadrant. Do you experience any pain there regularly?
PATIENT: … No. Not really. Just… sometimes. A little discomfort. Like… something’s not right. But it goes away. She said it was just… gas. She gave me something for it.
DOCTOR: I see. And you haven't experienced any recent changes in your bowel habits - any diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: … No. Everything is… normal. Mostly. Sometimes it's a little… slow. But nothing serious. She always knew what to do. Now… I just try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief physical exam, it seems you may have some mild congestion in your lungs, slightly elevated blood pressure and pulse, and some possible tenderness in your abdomen. Given your upcoming travel to a warm climate with potential insect exposure, and the congestion I'm hearing, I recommend some further investigation. First, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs. This will help us determine the cause of the congestion and ensure it’s not something serious. I’d also like to order some blood work – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel – to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: … More tests? She always said tests were… unnecessary. But… if you think it’s important… Fine. Do whatever you need to do. But hurry. I really need to get back to work. They’re expecting me. And I don’t want to be… a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tayar. We’ll make this as quick and efficient as possible. I've ordered the chest X-ray and blood work. The lab is just down the hall, and they can take the blood samples right away. Once the results are back, we’ll discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a mild cough suppressant to help with any congestion you may be experiencing. And given your travel to an area with potential insect exposure, I recommend taking an over-the-counter insect repellent containing DEET. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: … No. No allergies. She always checked. Everything. I… I don’t think so. But… if it makes me tired, I don’t want it. I need to be awake for work.
DOCTOR: I’ll prescribe a non-drowsy cough suppressant, then. We'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. Mr. Tayar, given the limited information about your destination and your recent loss, and the subtle findings from the exam, I also recommend consulting with a travel medicine specialist before you depart. They can provide specific recommendations based on your travel itinerary and ensure you’re adequately prepared for any potential health risks. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: … A specialist? What’s the point? I just need to go fix things. That’s all. More doctors… more tests… It’s too much. She always said I was healthy. Strong. I don’t need anyone else telling me what to do. No. No specialist. Just… let me go. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Tayar. However, given the potential health risks associated with travel to a remote location, especially with limited access to medical care, I strongly recommend reconsidering the referral. It’s always better to be prepared, and a travel medicine specialist can provide valuable insights and recommendations tailored to your specific destination. However, I respect your decision. In that case, I’ll provide you with a written list of preventative measures you can take, including insect repellent use, hydration, and food safety. I’ll also give you a list of symptoms to watch out for while you’re away, and instructions on what to do if you experience any of them. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: … No. No questions. Just… where do I go for the tests? And… can I get a note for work? They’ll want to know why I was gone so long.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here’s the slip for the lab. They’re just down the hall, room 203. And here’s the note for your work. It explains that you were undergoing a medical evaluation. I also have a handout here with information about preventing traveler's diarrhea and managing mosquito-borne illnesses. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms while you’re away. We’re here to help. And Mr. Tayar, please take care of yourself. Remember to stay hydrated, protect yourself from insects, and listen to your body. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: … No. That’s all. Thank you… I think. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Tayar. Safe travels. .
