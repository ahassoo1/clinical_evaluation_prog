DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr… Alzoubi, you said? Honestly, I barely remember why I even came here. Something about… not wanting things done? My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. She worries too much, always has. I just… don't like folks poking around, you know? Especially my feet. They're very sensitive.
DOCTOR: Yes, Wynell Gunasekera, age 83. It looks like your daughter, Melodie, scheduled this appointment for a general check-up and to discuss some concerns about potential podiatry needs. Is that right – she mentioned something about your feet being sensitive?
PATIENT: Sensitive is putting it mildly! They ache, mostly. And they swell up something awful if I'm on them too long. But I've lived this long without a fuss, haven’t I? I don't need anyone telling me what to do with my feet. My first husband, God rest his soul, he was a carpenter, you see. Always on his feet. He’d tell me stories… though where was I? Oh yes, the feet. I just… don't trust these modern doctors. All wanting to slice and dice.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Wynell. It’s perfectly reasonable to be cautious. And it sounds like your feet have been through a lot, especially with your husband’s work. We don’t have to do anything you’re not comfortable with. Let's start with just talking about the aching and swelling. When did you first start noticing it, and what makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… that’s a hard one. Years, dear. Years, I suppose. After… well, after the divorce, mostly. A lot of things started hurting after the divorce. He didn’t understand a woman’s needs, that man. As for what makes it worse… standing, definitely standing. And heat. Hot weather just swells them right up. Sitting helps, putting my feet up… though even that doesn’t always do the trick. It’s just old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the aching and swelling have been going on for years, seem to have worsened after the divorce, and are aggravated by standing and heat, and relieved somewhat by sitting and elevating your feet. And you feel it's likely related to age. Do you notice any redness, cuts, or sores on your feet, Wynell?
PATIENT: Redness… sometimes. Not always, though. It's hard to see, you know? I can barely bend over these days. Cuts… I might get a little nick here or there, clipping my toenails. I do it myself, of course. I don't trust anyone near my feet with sharp objects. And sores… no, not really. Maybe a little blister if I wear the wrong shoes. Though, honestly, they all feel wrong these days. Everything pinches. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant redness, occasional small cuts from toenail trimming, and no sores. Just general discomfort and pinching with most shoes. I think it would be helpful to take a quick look at your feet, Wynell, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. We can take it very slow, and if at any point you're uncomfortable, we’ll stop immediately. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now, hold on just a minute. I told you, I don't like folks poking around! You're going to tell me I need all sorts of procedures, and I'm not having it. My daughter will be wanting me to get some fancy operation, and I’ve seen what those do to people. No, thank you. I appreciate you trying, dear, but I’m quite alright. I’ve lived with aching feet for a long time, and I'll continue to do so. Just… write down 'aching feet' and be done with it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Wynell. My intention is not to push you into any procedures you're not comfortable with. I simply wanted to rule out anything serious. We can absolutely just document "aching feet" as you wish. However, given the swelling and your history, I do want to make sure we're not missing a potential circulation issue, especially as these things can sometimes be serious. Would you be open to me checking your pulses in your feet?
PATIENT: Pulses? What for? I'm still alive, aren't I? My circulation is fine. My daughter probably told you to ask that. She worries about everything. I've had feet my whole life, and they’ve carried me this far. I don't need anyone checking my pulses! It's just… a waste of time, dear. Truly. Just put down "old lady with aching feet" and let me go home. I have a bingo game to get to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. I respect your wishes. We will document "83-year-old female with chronic aching feet, no acute concerns noted." I strongly recommend that if you notice any changes in the color or temperature of your feet, any new sores or blisters, or increased pain, that you contact my office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. It's always best to be cautious. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think I’ve made myself perfectly clear. Just… thank you for your time. And tell your assistant to tell Melodie to stop worrying so much! I need to go win some bingo money. And don’t you go telling Melodie I didn't let you look at my feet, either. She’d never let it go. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Wynell. I won't mention it to Melodie. You have a wonderful day, and good luck with your bingo game! And please, don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. .
