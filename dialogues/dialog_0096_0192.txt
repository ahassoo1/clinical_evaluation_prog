DOCTOR: Alright then, Mr. Hartness. So, tell me… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s the army, see? They want me to take this… exam. Before they let me sign up proper. Gotta make sure I’m fit enough, I guess. Though I feel fit enough. Been workin’ with engines my whole life. Keeps a man strong, that does.
DOCTOR: An army exam, yes. Right. Well, we’ll certainly see about that, won’t we?
PATIENT: See? That’s what I’m sayin’. I’m strong. Never been sick much, neither. Just a little sniffle now and then. My wife, Ingrid, she worries, but I tell her, a little cold never hurt anyone. Mostly just hard work, that’s what I do. What kinda exam is it, anyway? Is it like… runnin’ a lot? 'Cause I can do a bit of runnin'.
DOCTOR: It's a standard physical, Mr. Hartness. We need to check everything – blood pressure, heart, lungs, reflexes... the usual. And yes, there is a portion involving physical exertion. We need to make sure your cardiovascular system is up to… well, the demands. Now, let’s start with some basic questions. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No, never. Not once. Ingrid, she had her gallbladder out a few years back, but I haven’t been inside a hospital for anything more than visitin'. Maybe a broken bone when I was a lad, fallin’ outta a tree, but that was… ages ago. Old man Svensson set it himself. Good bonesetter, that Svensson. Never needed no fancy doctors for that. What kinda “serious” are we talkin’ here? Just a bit of flu now and then, like everyone gets.
DOCTOR: Right, right. We're talking anything that required more than a bit of self-treatment. No serious injuries, no chronic conditions like diabetes or heart trouble. Any surgeries at all, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Ingrid keeps tellin’ me about her gallbladder, like I forget. But I haven’t had nothin’ cut open, no. Not once. Like I said, Old man Svensson, he fixed me right up when I was a boy. Set the bone, wrapped it tight. Good as new, I was. What's a "chronic condition" even mean? Sounds complicated. I just fix things, I don’t have things. Engines, mostly.
DOCTOR: A chronic condition, Mr. Hartness, is something long-lasting, like ongoing pain or a disease you have to manage. Never mind. Let’s move on. What about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my father, he was a strong man. Worked in the shipyard all his life. Good lungs, even when he was old. Smoked like a chimney, mind you, but never got nothin’ bad. Mother, she… she died old, mostly just wore out, I think. And my brother, he's fine, works a desk job, never been much of an outdoorsman. What kinda family history are we lookin' for? Like… bad bones? 'Cause like I said, mine are good. Really good.
DOCTOR: We’re looking for things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer… anything serious that runs in your family. Did anyone in your family have those kinds of problems?
PATIENT: Heart disease… hmm. Old Uncle Bjorn, he had a bit of trouble with his chest when he got on in years, but he ate too much herring, Ingrid always said. And Grandpa… well, he was a bit of a drinker, so who knows what was goin’ on with him. Cancer… no, not that I remember. My wife keeps track of these things, she worries, but I don't recall anyone dyin' of… that. It’s all a bit morbid, innit? I’m a healthy man, I tell ya. Good engine, strong body. What's the point of askin' all this anyway? Just check me, I’ll pass, I know I will.
DOCTOR: The point, Mr. Hartness, is to get a complete medical picture. Even if you feel healthy, there could be underlying issues we need to identify. Now, let’s move on to social history. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Drink? A bit, now and then. Mostly with dinner, a glass of beer. Maybe a schnapps on a special occasion. Nothing fancy. Keeps the chill away, that’s what my father always said. Ingrid doesn't much like it, says it's bad for the liver, but a man needs a little somethin' after a long day workin’ with engines, don't ya think? I don’t get drunk, never. Just… relax a bit. Not like I'm sittin' in a pub every night, mind you. It’s sensible drinkin’, that’s what it is. What's that got to do with bein' fit for the army, anyway? A bit of beer never hurt anyone.
DOCTOR: Right. “Sensible drinking.” And do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Not me. Ingrid, she used to, back when she was a girl, but she quit years ago. Smart woman, she is. Bad for the lungs, she said. Like I said, I'm a healthy man. Never needed a cigarette in my life. Good air, that’s what I need. Breathin’ in fumes all day from the engines is enough smokin' for anyone, innit? What are you writin' down anyway? Just makin' sure I’m not a complete wreck, are ya? 'Cause I’m tellin' ya, I'm a good specimen. Strong, fit, sensible. That’s me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not a one. Ingrid, she takes somethin’ for her knees, old age gettin’ to her, but I don't need nothin’. I fix myself, see? A bit of liniment for my back now and then, after liftin’ heavy things, but that’s it. Vitamins… no. Good food, that’s what I eat. Plenty of meat and potatoes. Supplements… what even are supplements? Sounds like somethin’ for weak people. I get all I need from workin' hard and eatin’ proper. You makin' a list of everything I don't take now? What's this all about, eh? I'm a simple man. Strong, fit, sensible. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Let’s just get on with the physical exam then. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I'm tellin' ya, this is a waste of time. You'll see, I'm a perfectly healthy specimen. Just wait 'til I lift somethin’ heavy, then you'll see. There. Done. How much do I weigh? Probably not enough, workin’ hard keeps a man lean.
DOCTOR: Fifty-three kilograms, Mr. Hartness. And your height is one-point-eight-seven meters. That puts your BMI at… rather low. Now, if you’ll just step over here, I’ll take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Fifty-three? That can't be right. I'm a solid man! Always been lean, but fifty-three? Ingrid’ll have a laugh at that. Probably lost some weight workin’ so hard, that’s it. Fine, do whatever ya gotta do. But I’m tellin’ ya, that scale’s broken. Blood pressure… what’s that even mean? Just check me, I’m fit as a fiddle, I know I am.
DOCTOR: It’s a measurement of the pressure in your arteries, Mr. Hartness. And the scale is calibrated. Now, remain still. 110 over 70. Slightly low. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Low? What's low? I'm a man of action, not sittin’ still! Hear that? Strong lungs. Always been strong. Used to swim in the lake when I was a boy, built 'em up, see? Get on with it, then. I haven't got all day. Ingrid's makin' stew, and I don't want it to get cold. What are ya lookin' for? Anythin' broken? 'Cause I'm tellin' ya, there's nothin' broken here. A good engine, that’s what I am.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds…regular, but somewhat faint. Lungs are clear, though your breathing is a bit shallow. Now, if you’ll just lie down on the examination table, I’d like to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Faint? What’s faint? I just told ya, I’ve got strong lungs! Shallow breathin’ is sensible breathin’, saves energy, see? Fine. But this is ridiculous. I’m a perfectly functional man. What are you lookin’ for, exactly? A missing limb? ‘Cause I assure ya, all my limbs are present and accounted for. Get it over with, then. The stew's gettin' colder by the minute.
DOCTOR: Right here. And the other side… Your reflexes are… diminished. A bit sluggish. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Diminished? Sluggish? What does that even mean? I just lifted a heavy engine block yesterday! There. Followin’ your finger. Perfectly fine. See? No problem. Stop pokin’ me about. I’m a perfectly capable man, I don't need all this… fussin’. Get on with it. I’m starting to feel ridiculous layin’ here like some sort of… broken machine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. That's enough for now. Please sit up. Based on this preliminary exam, your weight is significantly low, your blood pressure is slightly low, your reflexes are diminished, and there appears to be some weakness. I'm concerned about possible malnutrition and dehydration. We need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Malnutrition? Dehydration? That's absurd! I eat a hearty breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Meat and potatoes, mostly. Ingrid makes a lovely stew. I work hard all day, that’s all. Weakness? I can lift an engine block! Ask anyone! What kind of blood tests? What are you lookin’ for? Somethin’ broken? 'Cause I’m tellin’ ya, there’s nothin’ broken here. This is a waste of time and money, and I’ve got better things to do than lay around in a doctor's office gettin’ poked and prodded. I need to get back to work. And I need my stew.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand you feel healthy. However, these are objective findings, not just your perception. The blood tests will help us determine if there’s an underlying cause for your low weight, blood pressure, and weakness. We’ll check your electrolytes, protein levels, and thyroid function, among other things. I’m also concerned about possible cardiac issues, given your faint heart sounds. We may need to consider an EKG. I will write the orders for the lab work and an EKG. The lab technician will draw some blood, and the EKG technician will place electrodes on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. It's important to rule out any serious conditions. We need to get this done, regardless of how you feel. I want you to come back in two days to discuss the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: EKG? Electrodes? This is gettin’ ridiculous! Look, I appreciate your concern, but I'm tellin’ ya, this is a waste of time and money. I don't need fancy tests. I need to get back to work. Fine. Alright. Blood tests, EKG… whatever. But I’m not makin’ any promises about comin’ back in two days. I’ve got work to do, and I’ve got a stew waitin’ for me. Just… get it over with. And make it quick. I've got things to do. And I still think that scale is broken.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. The lab technician is just down the hall, and the EKG technician is in room three. They will explain the procedures to you. I strongly advise you to follow through with these tests. It’s important for your health. And please, try to get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. I'll see you in two days, hopefully with a clearer picture of what's going on. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. I get it. Rest, fluids, emergency room… Look, I appreciate the concern, but I'm a practical man. I'll go do the tests, but I'm not makin' any promises about what they'll show. I'm perfectly healthy, and I'll likely just waste your time and money. Alright then. I’ll go find these technicians. Don’t expect me back in two days. And tell Ingrid not to wait up.
