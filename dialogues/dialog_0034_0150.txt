DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. I suppose you can call me Angelle. Look, I don’t have all day. I want to have a baby. And I want to make absolutely certain there won’t be… problems. I’m not young anymore, you understand. Let’s just get straight to it, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Angelle. I understand your concerns, and we will absolutely get straight to it. Planning a pregnancy at any age requires careful consideration, and even more so with your experience. To best assist you, let's gather some information. First, may I confirm your date of birth, please?
PATIENT: Really? You need my date of birth? You’re a doctor! But fine. It’s February 14th, 1974. Honestly, the things you ask people… It's practically public record. Now, can we move on? I don't see how knowing when I was born helps anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Angelle. You are correct, it is often public record. It’s standard procedure to verify identity and access your medical history accurately within the electronic health record, ensuring I have a complete picture. Now, have you been trying to conceive already, and if so, for how long?
PATIENT: No! That’s precisely why I’m here. I don't want to start trying and then discover some… unfortunate issue. I want a full assessment before anything happens. Honestly, it's a little insulting you even asked that. Do you always ask patients if they've already failed before you offer help?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to want a thorough assessment beforehand, and I apologize if my previous question came across as insensitive. It was not my intention to imply any prior failure. I’m simply gathering information to determine the best course of action for you. Let's start with your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No. I am perfectly healthy. Always have been. I watch my diet, I exercise – when I have the time, of course. I take a multivitamin. Honestly, if I had some terrible medical condition, I wouldn't be wasting my time here. Do you take notes on everything everyone says, or just the obvious? This is ridiculous. Now, are you going to actually do something, or are we just going to continue this pointless interrogation?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Angelle, and I assure you I am taking everything you say seriously. Detailed information is vital for planning a healthy pregnancy. To continue, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Divorced husbands don't count as hospitalization, if that's what you're thinking. No surgeries. One appendix removal when I was eight, a very long time ago. Otherwise, no. Perfectly sound. And I'd like to know – what sort of tests are you even planning? Are we talking blood work? Ultrasound? I have a schedule, you know. I can’t spend all day here.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Angelle. An appendectomy is good to know. Given your age and desire to conceive, I would recommend a comprehensive evaluation. This would include a thorough physical exam, blood work to assess your overall health, hormone levels, and check for any potential infections. We would also consider a pelvic ultrasound to examine your uterus and ovaries. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work, ultrasound… whatever it takes to get this done quickly. But I want the results expedited. I don’t have months to waste waiting for a report. And I want a detailed explanation of everything. Not some vague mumbling about “hormone levels.” I want specifics. Are we talking about the quality of the eggs? The lining of the uterus? I want to know everything. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Angelle. I understand your desire for thoroughness and expediency, and I will ensure your tests are prioritized and the results are explained to you in detail. We will discuss everything – egg quality, uterine lining, hormone levels, and any other relevant findings. I can certainly provide you with a copy of the lab results as well. Before we proceed with the physical exam, let's briefly discuss your family medical history. Are there any significant health conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any reproductive issues?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. My mother had high blood pressure, eventually. And my aunt had…something. Cancer, I think. Lung cancer. She smoked. A lot. My father was perfectly healthy, if you can believe it. Honestly, is this even relevant? Most people have something wrong with their families. Now, can we please just get to the tests? I have a hair appointment at three. It's very important. I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon here.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Angelle. That information is helpful. Family history can sometimes provide clues, even if it's not definitive. Alright, let's move on to the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then perform a pelvic exam. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable at any time. Would you like me to explain each step as I go?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. Quickly. I’d prefer not to have a running commentary while you’re… examining me. And please be gentle. I haven't been… through this in a long time. Now, hurry up. The faster we do this, the faster I can go. Really. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Angelle. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please disrobe from the waist down, and I'll leave you with a gown and a sheet. Let me know when you are ready, and I will return. I will also ensure complete privacy throughout the exam.
