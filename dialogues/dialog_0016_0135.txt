DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is good to meet you also. I am here... because of my ear. It is… leaking. A little bit of liquid comes from it. It started, I think, three days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, leaking from your ear for about three days now. That's good to know. Can you tell me a little more about the liquid?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… not much. Clear, mostly. Sometimes a little… yellow, but not much. It does not smell bad. And it does not hurt, exactly. More… uncomfortable. Like something is… full inside. Do you understand? It feels… blocked.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. Clear or slightly yellow discharge, no bad smell, and a feeling of fullness or blockage. That gives me a good starting point. Have you noticed any hearing loss or ringing in your ear along with that blockage?
PATIENT: Yes. A little bit of hearing loss. Not much, but… quieter. Especially with people speaking quickly. I must ask them to repeat. And… sometimes a very faint ringing. Like… a very quiet whistle. It comes and goes. Not all the time. I do not know if this is important.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, thank you. The hearing loss and the ringing are important pieces of information. Now, have you had any fever, pain in your ear, or any recent illness like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. And no pain. Not even a little. I did… have a small cold, maybe two weeks ago? But it was very small. Just a little sniffle for a few days. Nothing serious. I took some medicine, and it went away quickly. I do not think this is connected, but you asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild cold about two weeks ago that resolved quickly. We'll certainly keep that in mind. Have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, tubes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. As a young boy, maybe some wax build up. But the doctor, he cleaned it, and it was fine. Never an infection, or tubes, or… anything like that. My ears were always good. Until now, of course. This is new.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know there's no history of ear problems. And just to get a full picture, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. None. And… no allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I eat everything. Sometimes I eat very spicy food, but that is not an allergy. My wife… she had allergies. But I do not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or known allergies. That's good. Now, I’d like to take a look in your ear to see what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Please look. I trust your judgement. What will you do, exactly? Will it hurt? I do not like things being put in my ear. It makes me… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Radillo. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious about having something put in your ear. I'm going to use a small lighted instrument called an otoscope. It doesn't go in your ear, exactly – it just lets me look at your ear canal and eardrum. It shouldn't hurt at all, but if you feel any discomfort, just let me know and I'll stop immediately. It will be very quick. I'm just going to gently pull your ear back and up a little to get a better view. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes. Pull back and up. That sounds… alright. As long as it does not go in. And please, tell me if it is uncomfortable. I will tell you. I do not want to be silent if something is wrong. I trust you, Doctor, but I also trust my body to tell me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I appreciate you telling me that. Your comfort is my priority, and I'll explain everything as I go. Okay, I’m looking now… I see some slight redness inside your ear canal, and there is some fluid present. Your eardrum looks a little cloudy, but I don’t see any perforations or obvious signs of a major infection. It appears you have a mild inflammation of the ear canal and some fluid buildup, likely related to the cold you had a couple of weeks ago. It could be a bit of fluid trapped behind the eardrum, or a mild outer ear infection, but it doesn’t look severe.
PATIENT: Inflammation… and fluid. That is not good, yes? Is this… dangerous? Will I go deaf? My grandson, he had an ear infection when he was small, and he could not hear for a week. I do not want that.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Mr. Radillo. It's not typically dangerous, and it's unlikely you’ll experience any permanent hearing loss. It’s much less severe than what your grandson went through. Often, these things clear up on their own, or with simple treatment. The slight cloudiness of your eardrum suggests a little inflammation, which is causing the fluid buildup. To be on the safe side, I’d like to prescribe you some ear drops with a mild antibiotic and anti-inflammatory. They'll help clear up the infection and reduce the swelling. I also recommend avoiding getting any water in your ear for the next few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to check your progress. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Ear drops… and no water. Yes, that sounds… reasonable. What are the ear drops? Will they sting? And how many times must I put them in? I am not good at remembering things. My wife… she always remembered.
DOCTOR: They're called Cipro HC, a combination of an antibiotic and a steroid to help reduce inflammation and fight any possible infection. They come in a small bottle with a dropper. You'll put two drops in your affected ear three times a day for seven days. It’s important to complete the full course, even if you start feeling better. Now, most people don't experience any stinging, but some may feel a slight coolness or temporary discomfort. If you do experience any pain or irritation, stop using the drops and call the office immediately. To make it easier to remember, you can set an alarm on your phone three times a day, or ask a family member to remind you. We can also write down a schedule if you'd prefer. Do you have any questions about how to use the drops, or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: An alarm… yes, that is a good idea. My grandson, he can help me set it on my phone. Two drops, three times a day, for seven days. And no water. What if… it does not get better? What if it gets worse? And what if I forget to put the drops in? Will that make it… worse also? I do not want to cause problems. I just want my ear to be normal again.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Mr. Radillo. If it doesn’t get better after seven days, or if it gets worse – meaning increased pain, fever, or a significant decrease in hearing – please call the office immediately and we’ll schedule another appointment. We may need to consider a different course of treatment or refer you to an ear, nose, and throat specialist. And yes, forgetting to put the drops in could slow down the healing process. That’s why setting that alarm is so important. If you miss a dose, just take the next one as soon as you remember, but don’t double up on doses. I’m confident these drops will help, but we’ll monitor your progress closely. I’m also going to give you a prescription for a mild pain reliever, just in case you experience any discomfort. It's always best to be prepared. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You have answered everything. The alarm is good, and I will ask my grandson. And the pain reliever… that is very kind. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very patient with me. I suppose… I just need to go to the pharmacy and pick up the medicine? And then come back in one week? Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. Yes, just take this summary to the pharmacy to pick up your prescriptions. And then please schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist before you leave, for one week from today. That will allow us to check your progress and ensure everything is healing properly. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I want to make sure you’re feeling better as quickly as possible. Have a good day, Mr. Radillo, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You also have a good day. .
