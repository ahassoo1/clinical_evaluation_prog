DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Avril. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. I… how you say… telehealth visit, yes? My… friend, she make appointment for me. I not so good with computer, so she help. I have some… trouble, but not sure what.
DOCTOR: Ah, okay. A telehealth visit scheduled by a friend. That’s perfectly alright! It sounds like you're not quite sure what's going on, and that's why you're here, and that's good. No worries at all. Let's try to figure it out together. Could you tell me a little bit more about what kind of trouble you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. Well… my hands. They… shake sometimes. Not all the time, but more now than before. And my back… it hurts when I bend over, like when I fix car. I am mechanic, you know? For many years. It is… difficult now. Not like before. I also… feel tired. Very tired, even when I sleep. Is that… trouble?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely sounds like trouble, Avril. It's good you're telling me about all of this. Shaky hands, back pain with bending, and fatigue… those can all be connected, or they could be separate things. Let's start with the shaking in your hands. When did you first notice that, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… rough… maybe… two, three years ago? Small shake then. I think it was when my husband… when he was sick. I was very worried, maybe that is why. Now… it is more. When I hold something… like wrench, or cup… it shake a little bit. Sometimes more than a little. It make me… nervous. I drop things sometimes. Not often, but… it happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about two or three years ago, coinciding with your husband’s illness, and it’s been gradually getting worse. And it's noticeable when you're holding things, like tools or a cup. That's helpful to know. Now, about your back pain. Where exactly does it hurt?
PATIENT: It hurt… low on my back. Here. When I bend to pick something up… or when I look down to work on car… it is bad. Sometimes… it go down my leg a little bit. Not all the way, but… down the back of my leg. It is… sharp pain. Not all the time, but when I move wrong. And it is sore, even when it is not sharp. Like… old injury, maybe? I have been mechanic long time. Lots of bending and lifting.
DOCTOR: Okay, low back pain, radiating down the back of your leg, and it’s worse with bending and movement. And you suspect it might be from years of working as a mechanic. That makes sense. Now, let’s talk about the fatigue. You said you feel very tired even after sleeping. Can you describe what that tiredness feels like?
PATIENT: It is… hard to explain. Like… heavy. Everything feel heavy. My arms, my legs, even my eyes. I sleep… eight hours, sometimes more. But I wake up… still tired. Not like… sleepy tired. But… worn out. Like I run marathon, but I just sit. I have no energy to do things. Even things I like. I used to like garden. Now… I look at garden, but I no have strength to work in it. It is… frustrating. My friend, she say maybe is vitamin? But I eat good food.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly draining, Avril. It’s not just being sleepy, it’s a heavy, worn-out feeling that doesn’t go away with sleep. And it's affecting things you enjoy. It’s good you’re eating well, so it might not be a simple vitamin deficiency. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… Let me think. Sometimes… I feel a little dizzy. Not fall down dizzy, but… light head. And… my hands, they feel cold. Even when it is warm. And… I forget things sometimes. Not important things, but… names. Or… what I was going to say. Like now! My friend, she say maybe is old age? But I not so old! Just… tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness, cold hands, and some forgetfulness. It's perfectly normal to have some forgetfulness as we get older, but combined with the other symptoms, it's good you're mentioning it. And don't worry about age, Avril. We're just trying to figure out what's going on. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Medical history… hmm. When my husband was sick, I went to doctor a lot. But… for me? Not much. I had… high blood pressure, maybe ten years ago? Doctor put me on pills. I take them for a few years, then he said I okay, so I stop. And… I had surgery on my knee, long time ago. When I was young. Fall skiing. That is… all I think. I do not go to doctor much. Prefer to fix things myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were diagnosed with high blood pressure about ten years ago, treated with medication for a few years and then it resolved. And you had knee surgery when you were younger. That's helpful to know. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. No medications now. I stopped the blood pressure pills long time ago. And I do not take vitamins or supplements. I eat good food, like my mother taught me. Maybe I should take vitamin? My friend, she say it helps. But I do not know which one. There is so many!
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be overwhelmed with all the different options. We can discuss that later if we think it might be beneficial, but let's focus on getting a clearer picture of what’s going on first. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I eat everything. My mother, she make very good soup. All kinds of vegetables. And I do not have allergy to… anything. Never been sick with allergies. I do not have problem with… what you call it… pollen? My friend, she sneeze a lot in spring. But I okay. Never sneeze.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Avril. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… My mother, she had… arthritis, I think. In her hands. They were very sore. And my father… he had heart problem. He was sick for long time. And… my sister, she had diabetes. But that is… all I remember. It was long time ago. We do not talk about… sickness much. Is sad thing, to talk about sickness.
DOCTOR: It is a sad thing to talk about sickness, I understand. Arthritis, heart problems, and diabetes in the family. That’s helpful information. Now, lastly, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. I live alone, since my husband… passed away. I keep busy. I fix cars, like I always do. I have small garage. People bring cars to me. I like to garden, when I have energy. I used to like walk, but now… too tired. I do not smoke. Never smoked. And I drink… little bit of wine with dinner, sometimes. Not every day. Maybe two, three times a week. I try to eat healthy. But sometimes… I eat too much cake. My friend, she make very good cake.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a full life, Avril, even with the challenges. You keep busy, you enjoy your hobbies, and you try to stay healthy. Okay, I think I have a good understanding of your situation now. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, okay. Physical exam is fine. I do not mind. Just… be gentle, please. My old bones, they are not so strong anymore.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Avril. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Deep breath in… and out… Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let's check your blood pressure. 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Next, I’ll check your reflexes. Reflexes are present and equal. And finally, I’ll do a quick neurological exam. Follow my finger with your eyes… good. Now look to the left… and to the right… good. All seems relatively normal at first glance, but the elevated blood pressure and the reports of shaking, fatigue and forgetfulness warrant some further investigation. Would you be okay with getting a blood test?
PATIENT: Blood test… hmm. Is not nice. But… okay. If you think it will help, yes. I do not like needles, but… I trust you, Doctor. Just… be quick, please. And… tell me what you are looking for? What will the blood test tell you? I do not want to worry about nothing.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Avril. I understand your apprehension. It won't be a very pleasant experience, but it's important to get a clearer picture of what's going on. The blood test will help us check a few things. We'll look at your thyroid levels, to see if your thyroid is functioning properly, as that can cause fatigue and shakiness. We'll also check your vitamin levels, especially vitamin B12 and vitamin D, as deficiencies can cause similar symptoms. We'll also check your blood sugar, to rule out diabetes, and do a general check of your kidney and liver function. It's just a routine screening to help us identify any potential issues. I’ll write the order now, and the nurse will come in and draw the blood. It should only take a few minutes. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Thyroid… vitamin… sugar… is many things. So… you think I have something bad? Is that why you want so many tests? My friend, she say sometimes doctors just… want to make money. I do not want to waste money on tests I do not need. I just want to know what is wrong. If something is wrong. And how to fix it. I am mechanic, you know? I fix things. I want to fix myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Avril, and I want to assure you that I’m not ordering these tests to simply make money. That’s not how I practice medicine. I’m ordering these tests because you're experiencing a combination of symptoms – the shaking, fatigue, forgetfulness, and elevated blood pressure – and it's important to rule out any potential underlying causes. Think of it like diagnosing a car problem. If a car is making a strange noise, you don't just fix one thing without checking everything else. You check the engine, the tires, the fluids – everything – to make sure you're addressing the root of the problem. It's the same with your health. We need to gather more information before we can determine what's causing your symptoms and how to fix them. These tests will give us a clearer picture, and we'll only proceed with further investigations if necessary. I want to help you fix yourself, just like you fix cars, but we need to understand the problem first. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes. Like car. You are right. I understand. Check everything. Like I do. Okay. So… you check everything. And then… you tell me what is wrong? And how to fix it? You do not think is something… bad? Like… very bad? I just… want to feel normal again. I miss my garden. And… I do not want to forget things.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Avril. I'll check everything. And then I'll explain the results to you in plain language, so you understand what's going on. It's impossible to say for sure right now what's causing your symptoms, but based on what you've told me, I don't think it's anything very bad. The symptoms you're experiencing can be caused by a lot of different things, many of which are easily treatable. We'll take things one step at a time. First, we'll get the blood test results. Then, we'll discuss them and decide what to do next. And I promise to be with you every step of the way. I'm hopeful that we can figure out what's going on and get you back to enjoying your garden and feeling like yourself again. Now, let’s get the nurse in here to draw your blood, and then we’ll talk about what to expect next. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. That sound alright. Blood test… then talk. One step at a time. I like that. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. And you explain things very well. Like car mechanic, yes? I appreciate that. Let’s get the blood test done. I want to feel normal again. Sooner the better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Avril. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. I’ll just go and get the nurse now. She’ll be right in to take your blood. And please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns while you’re waiting. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
