DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I'm Dr. Chora. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think. My cough… it’s been bothering me. A dry cough. Just… keeps going and going. Seems worse lately. I don’t… I don’t really know why it’s happening. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that’s been bothering you, and it’s gotten worse recently. A dry cough, you said. And you're not sure what's causing it. Alright. How long has this cough been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. A long time. Maybe… a few months, at least? Hard to say exactly. Things… they all kinda blend together after a while, you know? I mostly just try to ignore it, but it's getting harder to do. My wife… she would always tell me to get it checked out. She always knew best.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovic. It's common for things to feel a bit blurred with time. A few months, okay. And your wife wanted you to get it checked out, that’s good she looked out for you. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, besides just being a dry cough, is there anything else you've noticed about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It doesn’t… bring anything up, if you know what I mean. No phlegm, nothing. Mostly just… a tickle, then a cough. And… sometimes it feels a little tight in my chest. Not bad, just… uncomfortable. I don’t get short of breath, though. I still do my… things. Not as much as I used to, but I still get around. I used to fix cars, you know. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no phlegm, just a dry, tickly cough, and some chest tightness. Good to know you're not short of breath. And you used to fix cars – that's interesting! Alright. Have you had a fever, chills, or night sweats with this cough at all?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I’ve noticed. I don’t really check. Chills… maybe a little cold sometimes, but that’s just the house, you know? It gets drafty. Night sweats… I sleep pretty soundly, don't remember anything like that. My wife used to say I snore too loud, though. Does that count as sweating? I don’t know… I mostly just try to stay warm.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or night sweats. We can rule those out for now. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a long list. I had… something with my heart a long time ago. They gave me some pills for it. And my knees… they bother me something awful when it rains. And… I think I had the flu, maybe, a few times. I don’t really remember all the details. Old age, you know? Things slip your mind. Did they tell me what was wrong with my heart? I don't recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart trouble in the past, knee pain, and the flu. It's understandable things aren't always clear with time. Let’s see if we can narrow down the heart issue. Do you remember what they said about your heart?
PATIENT: No, I really don't. Something about… a valve? Or maybe it was the rhythm. I just remember taking pills, and trying to stay out of the cold. It was a long time ago, Doctor. Before… before my wife passed. They sent me to a specialist, I think. In the city. But… I don't remember much else. It’s all a bit of a blur. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright, it sounds like you saw a cardiologist at some point for a heart condition. We may be able to look up some records, but for now, let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My wife, she was the picky eater. I don't think I ever had a reaction to anything. Maybe… a little itchy sometimes when I’m around certain plants. But that’s just hay fever, I think. It's probably just the dust. Everything's dusty around here.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you’re not currently taking any medications, is that right?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not right now. I stopped taking those heart pills… a long time ago. The doctor said I didn't need them anymore. Or maybe it was a different doctor… I don't really remember. I just try to take it easy these days. Not much energy for anything else.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your oxygen levels. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. My chest feels… a little tight sometimes, like I said. Maybe you can tell what's going on. I hope it’s nothing serious. My wife always worried about my health.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me, Mr. Pavlovic… and again… Alright. Your lungs sound a little… diminished, a little quieter than I’d like on both sides. And I do hear a slight… murmur with your heart, which isn't entirely surprising given your history. Your heart rate is a little fast, but your rhythm is regular. Oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but not critically so. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles.
PATIENT: Swelling in my ankles? Oh, yes, now that you mention it. They do ache a little, especially at the end of the day. I just thought it was… old age. I don't go out much anymore, so I don't really pay attention. It’s all a bit… much, you know? What does it mean, Doctor? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve heard and seen, it sounds like you may have some underlying heart failure, contributing to the ankle swelling and reduced oxygen levels. The diminished lung sounds could also be related to fluid buildup. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s severe, but it's something we need to investigate further. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better look at your heart and lungs. We'll also need some bloodwork, including a BNP level, which can help us assess the extent of any heart failure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… EKG… bloodwork… Oh, goodness. That sounds… complicated. My wife always handled all this. I never understood any of it. Will it hurt? Is it expensive? I don't have much money, Doctor. I haven’t been working since… well, a long time ago. And I don’t have insurance. Is it… necessary? I just want my cough to go away.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Pavlovic. It is a lot, and I apologize if it feels overwhelming. The X-ray and EKG are relatively simple and painless – just quick pictures and a tracing of your heart's electrical activity. The bloodwork involves a simple blood draw. Regarding the cost, I know you mentioned not having insurance. I'll speak with our financial counselor to see what options are available to help reduce the expenses. We can explore assistance programs and payment plans. It is important to get this checked out, though. Knowing what's causing your cough and any potential heart issues will help us determine the best treatment plan to improve your breathing and overall health. We’ll start with the basics, and we can take it one step at a time. Would you be willing to proceed with the testing, and I'll have someone from the financial office speak with you after our visit?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, I suppose. If it will help my cough… and if you can help me with the money… then yes. I’ll do the tests. But please… please don’t make me come back too often. It's… hard for me to get around. And please… tell me what everything means. I want to understand what’s happening. My wife… she always explained everything so clearly. Just… don’t let me be alone in this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Pavlovic. I promise I won't leave you alone. We’ll go through everything step-by-step, and I will explain everything in plain language. I’ll make sure you understand what each test means and what the results show. And we'll schedule the tests as efficiently as possible to minimize the number of visits. I’m going to order the X-ray, EKG, and bloodwork now. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will explain everything before they start. After the tests are done, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. I'll also have a nurse come in to review your medications and any other health concerns you may have. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. It’s… it’s a relief to finally talk to someone about this. My wife… I miss her so much. But thank you. Just… please don't use big words. I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. It's my job to help, and I'm glad you feel comfortable talking to me. And I promise, no big words. We'll keep things simple and clear. I’ll have the nurse come in to assist you, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. If you have any questions before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. .
