DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit awkward to discuss, honestly. I’ve been going to the bathroom much more often lately. It’s… disruptive, to say the least. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, but it’s been a few weeks, I think?
DOCTOR: Okay. A few weeks of increased frequency… I understand it can be disruptive. Let's try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. When you say "much more often," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It’s… difficult. Before, I’d say… normal? Like, maybe four or five times a day? Now… it feels like every couple of hours. Sometimes even more often than that, especially if I drink anything. Or even if I think about drinking something! It’s quite… unsettling. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It’s just… hard to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. MacVittie. It is often difficult to be precise with these things. So, significantly increased frequency, and it seems to be worse with fluid intake. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Hmm… pain, no, not exactly. It’s not painful, but… sometimes there’s a little discomfort. A sort of… stinging sensation, perhaps? It doesn’t last long, and it’s not severe, but it’s definitely noticeable. It doesn't happen every time, though. And I wouldn't call it burning, precisely. It's more… irritating, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, irritation rather than pain, and intermittent. Do you notice any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear… I don’t think so. I haven't noticed anything… obvious, at least. I haven't really… looked closely, to be perfectly honest. I suppose I should have, but… it’s a bit unpleasant, isn't it? I’m sorry, Doctor. Is that something I should be checking for? I feel rather foolish admitting this.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. MacVittie. No need to apologize. It’s good you’re asking. It’s always best to be thorough. Yes, it would be good to pay attention to that. We'll do a quick urinalysis in the office today, which will check for blood and other things. Aside from the increased frequency and irritation, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: A urinalysis… yes, that sounds sensible. Other changes… let me think. I have been feeling… quite tired lately, now that you mention it. More tired than usual, anyway. And… I’ve been thirstier, I suppose. Drinking more fluids, which probably isn't helping with the bathroom situation. But, no, that’s really all I can think of. I’m terribly sorry if I’m not being very helpful. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, you're being very helpful. Fatigue and increased thirst along with the frequent urination… Alright. Let’s take a quick look at your medical history. I see you haven't had a lot of prior medical care. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s correct. I haven’t really… needed to see a doctor much. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. I used to garden quite a bit, and I sometimes got a little itchy from the plants, but that wasn't an allergy, just… irritation, I think. No medication allergies, as far as I know. I'm divorced, if that’s relevant. And… not insured, unfortunately. It’s a long story.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for letting me know about the insurance situation as well; we’ll keep that in mind. And the gardening is good to know, but likely not relevant here. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to avoid medication if I can, honestly. Just a bit of chamomile tea sometimes, if I’m feeling anxious. But that’s it. No prescriptions, no vitamins, no anything. I really do try to stay as natural as possible, if that makes sense. I’m terribly sorry, I feel like I’m rambling. I get nervous at the doctor.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. MacVittie. No need to apologize; it’s perfectly normal to be nervous. So, no medications or supplements. Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your abdomen and a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I'll just… try to relax. I do apologize in advance if I’m a bit fidgety. I haven't had a physical in… well, I can’t even remember the last time.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths in and out… Good. Everything sounds clear. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright… not yet. A little pressure, perhaps, but no pain. Just… normal pressure, I suppose. Hmm… yes, there. Just a little bit… sensitive, right there. Not painful, exactly, but… noticeable. It feels… a little full, perhaps? It’s difficult to describe. It’s not sharp, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness in your lower abdomen. I don't feel any masses or anything concerning. Your abdomen is soft. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This might be a little startling. Good. Everything seems normal there as well. I’m going to order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel. The urinalysis will check for infection, blood, and glucose, and the basic metabolic panel will give us a snapshot of your kidney function and electrolytes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. A urinalysis and a metabolic panel… yes, that sounds perfectly alright. I trust your judgment completely. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I need to do anything special before or after? I always worry about these things.
DOCTOR: The lab is right downstairs, so it shouldn't be too long. I anticipate we’ll have the results back within a couple of hours. You don’t need to do anything special before or after. Just drink normally, as you have been. We'll review the results together, and then we can discuss a plan. In the meantime, I'm going to ask the nurse to take your blood pressure and weight. We'll take it from there.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Thank you. Blood pressure and weight… yes, that makes sense. I suppose I should have remembered those things. I get so flustered at the doctor. I appreciate your patience. A couple of hours… I can manage that. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MacVittie. We'll get those tests done, and then we’ll figure things out. Please have a seat, and the nurse will be in shortly. I’ll be back to discuss the results with you as soon as they’re available.
