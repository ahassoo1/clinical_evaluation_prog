DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Hmm… let me think. My wife, she said something about… paperwork? For work, I think. Something about needing time off… or maybe not being able to work for a bit. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I'm Ronnald, by the way. She handles most of these things, my wife does. It's probably for that, this paperwork. Is that what you do here?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Limtiaco, that's certainly something I can help with. We do provide medical documentation for work, whether it’s for time off, restrictions, or other needs. It sounds like your wife is proactive in getting things sorted. To start, could you tell me a little more about why she thinks you might need documentation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. See, this is where it gets tricky. It’s… well, I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately. Just tired, mostly. Very tired. And a little… off-balance sometimes. It’s hard to explain. Not sick, exactly, just… worn out. I’ve been trying to keep up with my duties at the church, you know, directing things, but it's been harder. It started a few months ago, I reckon. Not sure exactly when. My wife noticed it first, said I wasn't… as sharp as usual. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s very common for family members to notice changes before we do ourselves. It's good your wife is observant. So, tiredness and feeling off-balance, starting a few months ago. Can you describe the tiredness for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just being sleepy, you know? It’s… deep. Like my bones are tired. Even after a full night’s sleep, I wake up feeling like I haven’t rested at all. And it’s not just physical. It's… mental fatigue, too. Hard to concentrate, hard to remember things. That's probably why my wife noticed, she says I repeat myself sometimes. And the off-balance thing… it’s not constant. Comes and goes. Sometimes I just feel a little unsteady on my feet. Nothing major, but enough to worry her. I try to brush it off, but… I suppose it's been getting worse lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a deep fatigue – both physical and mental – that isn’t relieved by sleep, and intermittent unsteadiness. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside these, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I have been a bit more… forgetful, I suppose. Not just the usual senior moments, you know? It’s like… words escape me sometimes. And my wife said I’ve been a little more irritable. Not angry, exactly, just… less patient. I get frustrated easily. Oh! And my vision… it’s been a little blurry sometimes. I thought it was just my glasses needing cleaning, but maybe it’s something more? I haven't had my eyes checked in a while. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what’s going on. I just know I don’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased forgetfulness, irritability, and some blurry vision. It’s good you’re noticing these changes and bringing them to my attention. It sounds like there are several things we should explore. Before we proceed, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. Let me see. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was a long time ago. And I had a bit of a scare with my heart a while back, but the doctor said it was nothing serious. Just palpitations, he said. Nothing they needed to treat. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy, I think. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in years. My wife always takes care of all that. I'm not sure what else… I take a little something for my knees, arthritis, you know, but that’s about it. Is that helpful? I really don't remember much about doctor visits.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Gallbladder removal in the past, palpitations that didn’t require treatment, and medication for arthritis. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you've got me. It's a little white pill… no, maybe it's a little yellow one. I take it every morning with my breakfast. My wife fills the prescription, so I don't really pay attention to the name. I just know it helps with the pain in my knees. She keeps everything organized. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. I'm sorry I can't remember the name. It starts with a… well, I can't even remember that! It’s terrible. I’m usually pretty good with names, but medical things… they just don't stick with me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's very common to not remember medication names, especially when someone else manages the prescriptions. We can certainly look it up in our system or your wife could let us know. To continue, have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I recall. No, I’m pretty sure it was just the gallbladder. A long time ago, as I said. Nothing else. I haven’t been in the hospital much in my life, thankfully. A few bumps and bruises over the years, but nothing that required surgery. My wife would know for sure, though. She remembers everything. I'm drawing a blank. Honestly, I feel a little silly not being able to recall these things. Is it alright if we just… skip this part for now? I’m afraid I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. We can certainly come back to it if needed. It’s more important to focus on what you do remember, and we can always verify information with your wife. Next, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… now that's a tough one. My mother, she passed away when I was young, from… well, I think it was just old age. She wasn’t very healthy towards the end. My father, he lived a long life, but he had a weak heart. I remember him being tired a lot, like me. And my sister… she had some problems with her memory in her later years, but I don’t know exactly what it was. I wasn’t very close to her. It was a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. We didn’t really talk about these things. It wasn’t something we did. Is that helpful at all? I'm sorry I can't provide more information. I really am trying to remember.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s helpful to know what you do recall, even if it’s limited. So, your mother passed away at a young age, your father had heart problems, and your sister experienced some memory issues later in life. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all! Never smoked a day in my life. And I only drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, just a glass or two. My wife and I, we don’t really drink much. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a church elder, Doctor. That wouldn’t be appropriate! I try to live a clean life, as much as I can. I used to be very active, but my knees have been bothering me lately, so I don't get around as much. I still try to stay busy with my duties at the church, though. I’m the director of religious activities, you know. I just get tired easily now. Is that helpful? I hope I’m not boring you with all this. I'm trying to be as thorough as possible.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Limtiaco. You’re not boring me at all. It’s very helpful to have this information. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drugs. You're actively involved in your church, despite some limitations with your knees. One last question for now. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me see. Not that I know of. I haven’t had any allergic reactions in the past. My wife always checks when she fills my prescriptions, though. She’s very careful. I’ve never had any trouble with food allergies, either. I can eat just about anything. I think. I’m drawing a blank again. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I’m just rambling. Is this information even helpful? I'm afraid I’m not very good at this. I just want to figure out what's going on and get back to my duties at the church. I feel like I'm letting people down.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Limtiaco, and you're not letting anyone down. You're providing me with valuable information, and I appreciate your honesty. It’s perfectly normal to not remember every detail, especially when it comes to medical history. Based on what you’ve told me – the fatigue, unsteadiness, forgetfulness, irritability, and blurry vision – it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. It could be related to a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid issue, or something else entirely. I’d like to do a physical exam and order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam and blood tests. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel like myself again. I want to be able to focus and remember things. And I want to be able to continue my work at the church. If blood tests and an exam can help with that, then absolutely. When can we do that? And… will it take long? I have a meeting with the choir director later this week, and I wouldn’t want to miss it. I'm sorry for all the trouble. I really am.
DOCTOR: Not a trouble at all, Mr. Limtiaco. We’ll take things at your pace. The physical exam will just involve checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a basic neurological assessment—testing your reflexes and balance. The blood tests will give us a lot of information. The exam shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes, and the blood draw will be quick. We can get those ordered right away, and the results usually take a few days. Would you like to change into a gown, or are you comfortable with the exam with your clothes on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A gown… well, I suppose a gown would be best. If that's what you recommend, Doctor. I'm not very particular. I just want to get this over with and figure out what's going on. I'm happy to do whatever you need me to do. Where would I change? And… is there anywhere I can sit while we wait for the results? I'm a bit worried about… well, about forgetting things. I hope I can remember everything you tell me. I'm sorry to be such a worry.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. The changing room is just down the hall to your left. There's a comfortable chair inside. Feel free to take your time. Once you’re ready, I'll be right here to begin the exam. And don't worry about forgetting things. I'll make sure to document everything thoroughly, and we can always review it together. We can also arrange for your wife to join us for the results if you'd like, so she can help you remember details. We’ll take things one step at a time. Just let me know when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. I appreciate your patience. I think I can manage. It's just… everything feels a little foggy lately. I'll go change now.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s see what we can find.
