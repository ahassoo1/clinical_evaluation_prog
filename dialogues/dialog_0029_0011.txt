DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Honcoop. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get this over with. I need somethin' signed. A paper, for... a procedure. A cosmetic one. My nephew said I needed clearance from a doctor before doin' it. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you need a form signed for a procedure. Just to be clear, and for my records, what kind of procedure are you referring to?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don't rightly recall all the fancy details. It's… somethin' with my face. Makes me look younger, I think. My nephew handled all that. I just need you to say I'm okay to do it. Is that too much to ask? It’s… a lift, maybe? Or somethin'. They used a lot of words I didn’t understand.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you said your nephew arranged this… procedure?
PATIENT: That's right. Smart boy, that nephew. Always lookin' out for me. He said it was a good deal, a good clinic. I trust him. Don't see the point in worryin' about the particulars, long as it makes me look… presentable. Now, can we just get this signed? I got appointments later.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I appreciate your trust in your nephew. However, as your doctor, I need to ensure any procedure you undergo is safe and appropriate for your health. I’m concerned about signing off on something without knowing exactly what it entails, your medical history, and if you're a suitable candidate. Do you have any allergies, any current medications you take, or any pre-existing conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I've lived 64 years! I'd know if I had allergies. And medications... just a little somethin' for my joints now and then, when they bother me. Old age, you know? As for conditions... what kinda conditions are we talkin' about? I ain't been seriously sick in… well, I don't recall. Look, this is gettin' ridiculous. I just want a signature! What’s the holdup?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I have a professional responsibility to ensure your well-being. "A little something for your joints" could be important. What is the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Doctor, honestly! It’s… somethin’ in a little orange bottle. I get it from the drugstore. Starts with a 'C', I think. Can’t recall the rest. Just a pain reliever. Ain't that enough? I really don't have time for a twenty-minute interrogation about a little bottle! This is holdin' up my whole day!
DOCTOR: Alright. We're going to take a moment. I'm going to ask a few more questions, and I need you to try your best to recall the details. What other medical conditions have you been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don’t recall. It was a long time ago. Maybe somethin’ with my blood pressure once? The doctor gave me pills for it, but I stopped takin’ 'em. Made me feel… funny. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. I ain't a complicated man! I just want a signature so I can get this done and get on with my life. Are you gonna help me or not? I don’t understand why this is so difficult!
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're frustrated, but stopping blood pressure medication can be very dangerous. And I need to know what specifically this procedure involves before I can sign anything. Is it surgery?
PATIENT: Surgery?! Doctor, I haven't the faintest idea! My nephew said somethin' about… injections. And a laser, maybe? Look, I'm tellin' you, I don’t know! I just want to look a little less… tired! Is that too much to ask? This is ridiculous! I'm startin' to think I should just go somewhere else. You’re makin’ this way harder than it needs to be! I need a signature, or I'm leavin'. Now, are you gonna sign it or not? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I cannot ethically sign a form for a procedure I don't understand and haven't assessed your suitability for. Given your lack of detailed medical information and your inability to provide specifics about the procedure, I strongly recommend you consult with your primary care physician for a full evaluation before proceeding. I'm not going to sign this form. I'm concerned about your safety. Here’s a list of local primary care physicians. I suggest you schedule an appointment with one of them as soon as possible.
