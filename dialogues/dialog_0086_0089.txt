DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, I suppose. Lower part. It’s been hurting, quite badly at times. It’s… difficult to explain precisely. It comes and goes, you see, and honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. But it’s concerning, naturally. I believe my records mention… something about lupus? Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, diagnosed approximately 15 years ago. And you're right to bring that up; it absolutely could be related. But let's focus on this stomach pain for now. “Comes and goes” is helpful, but can you tell me a little more about how it hurts?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Fifteen years… time does fly, doesn't it? As for the pain… it's not a constant ache, you understand. It feels… like a cramping, sometimes. A very deep cramping. And other times, it’s more… a sharp, twisting sensation. It's hard to describe. It’s not like anything I’ve experienced before the lupus, I don’t believe. Does that make any sense? I apologize for being so vague. It truly comes in waves.
DOCTOR: No, no apology necessary, Ms. Glymph. It's helpful to hear how you experience it. “Deep cramping” and “sharp, twisting” are good descriptions. And the fact that it’s different than pain you’ve experienced before is important. Is there anything that seems to trigger these waves of pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… a trigger. That's a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, to be honest. I try to eat regularly, and I don’t think any particular food seems to cause it. Stress, perhaps? I've been a bit preoccupied lately with… ship maintenance, it’s quite demanding work. But I wouldn’t say it’s always after a stressful day. It just… happens. I wish I could be more helpful in identifying a pattern. It's frustrating, not knowing what sets it off.
DOCTOR: Ship maintenance... right. Well, stress can certainly exacerbate things, even if it’s not the sole cause. Okay. And how about after you eat?
PATIENT: After eating… that’s… another difficult one. Sometimes it feels a bit worse shortly after a meal, yes. But not always! And it doesn’t seem to matter what I eat, as I said. It’s not like certain foods reliably bring it on. Perhaps it’s more related to… how much I eat? Large meals sometimes feel heavier, naturally. But even then, it’s not a guarantee. Oh dear, I’m making this terribly complicated, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: You're not making it complicated, Ms. Glymph, you're giving me information. It’s my job to sort through it. “Heavier after large meals” is helpful. Now, let’s move on. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. I have been rather fatigued lately, more so than usual. But then, I am sixty-two, and ship engineering is… tiring work. I also seem to be… constipated, if you don’t mind my saying so. It’s not constant, but it’s been more frequent. And… oh, now that I think of it, I’ve had a bit of a low-grade fever a few times, but nothing alarming. Just… slightly warmer than normal. Is that all relevant, do you think?
DOCTOR: Fatigue, constipation, occasional low-grade fever… yes, those are all potentially relevant, especially given your history. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh my. No, Doctor, I don’t think so. I haven’t noticed anything like that. I… I do try to be attentive to such things, naturally. It’s a rather unpleasant thought. I haven't seen anything in the toilet, or… well, you understand. No, thankfully, I haven’t noticed any blood. That sounds… serious. Is that a concern?
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you haven't seen any blood. However, it’s important to ask. Now, I'm going to need to do a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I’ll gently press on it to check for tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, do whatever you need to. I trust your judgment entirely. I’m rather used to examinations, given the lupus and all. Just… be gentle, if you would. My insides aren’t quite as robust as they once were, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Now, if you could just lie back for me, please. I’m going to start by listening to your bowel sounds. Okay. Bowel sounds are present, but a bit sluggish. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I’ll start on the right side. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. This is… a bit tender, actually. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. Right… about here. It feels… a bit sensitive, yes. More so than other areas. It's not a sharp pain, just… discomfort when you press. Perhaps I’m just being overly sensitive. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. And what about here, on the left side?
PATIENT: Ooh. Yes, that’s… a bit uncomfortable as well. Not as bad as the right side, but… definitely noticeable. It’s a… dull ache, rather than a sharp pain. And… it seems to radiate a bit towards my back, perhaps? I'm not entirely sure. It's a bit difficult to pinpoint, honestly. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness in both lower quadrants, radiating towards the back… Given your history of Lupus, and the symptoms you've described – the cramping, the fatigue, the constipation, the occasional fever – and what I'm finding on the examination, I'm concerned about a possible flare-up of your Lupus affecting your gastrointestinal system. It’s also possible we’re dealing with diverticulitis, although the location of the tenderness is slightly atypical. To be certain, we need to run some tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a C-reactive protein, and a stool sample to rule out infection. I will also order a CT scan of your abdomen to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A flare-up… yes, that would make sense, I suppose. It’s been… quiet for a while, but it’s always a possibility. Diverticulitis… that sounds… unpleasant. Tests… yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. A CT scan… is that… safe? I’ve heard things. But if you think it’s necessary, then please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. When… when do you think I’ll get the results? I do have a ship to maintain, you see. It's rather important.
DOCTOR: The CT scan uses a small amount of radiation, but the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis far outweigh the risks in this case. We’ll take all necessary precautions to minimize your exposure. The lab work should be back within 24-48 hours, and the CT scan results usually take a bit longer, maybe up to 72 hours, depending on how busy the radiology department is. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild anti-inflammatory medication and a stool softener to help with the constipation. If you develop a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I understand you have a ship to maintain, but your health is the priority. I'll need to see you for a follow-up appointment once we have the test results to discuss the next steps. We'll schedule that for next week. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. A mild anti-inflammatory and a stool softener… good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. And you are quite right, of course. My health is paramount. What if… what if it is a flare-up? What are the next steps then? I do get rather anxious about these things. And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any foods to avoid? Anything to help manage the… discomfort?
DOCTOR: If it is a flare-up, the treatment will depend on the severity. Mild flare-ups can often be managed with oral medications, like corticosteroids and immune suppressants. More severe cases may require hospitalization and intravenous therapy. In the meantime, avoid foods that are known to irritate the digestive system – spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and fatty foods. Stick to a bland diet – rice, toast, bananas, applesauce. And try to stay well-hydrated. Stress management is also important, but I suspect that's easier said than done with a ship to maintain. Honestly, Ms. Glymph, worrying about it won’t help. Let’s get the test results first, then we can formulate a proper plan. We'll call you as soon as they are available. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I suppose not. You’ve answered everything, Doctor. Bland diet… no stress… easier said than done, indeed. Thank you for your time. And for… trying to reassure me. I appreciate it. I suppose I’ll… see you next week, then. .
DOCTOR: Yes, next week. Good day, Ms. Glymph.
