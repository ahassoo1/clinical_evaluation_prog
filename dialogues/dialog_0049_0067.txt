DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, doctor. Hmm… well, it’s my chest. Hurts when I… when I take a big breath. It’s been… a while, I think. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy, you say. Right. And it's specifically when you inhale deeply that you experience this chest pain?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that's it. Deep breath… ouch. Not all the time, you understand. Just when I really… fill my lungs up. It's a… sharp pain. Not a constant thing, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything… changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Changed… hmm. That's a good question. I… well, my daughter helped me move some boxes last week. Heavy boxes. Maybe that… aggravated something? It's hard to say. Things just… ache more, generally, these days. I’m an old man, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. And you mentioned a general aching. Where exactly are you feeling this aching besides the chest?
PATIENT: Mostly my back. Lower back, really. And my shoulders. Just… stiff. I used to be able to do a lot more work, you know. Construction… built things. Now… not so much. Everything creaks, including me.
DOCTOR: Right. So lower back and shoulders as well. Any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Just… ache. Dull ache. Sometimes it feels like… well, like I’ve been carrying a lot of weight. Which I have, I suppose. Both physically and… other ways.
DOCTOR: And what about your medical history, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Medical… history. Oh, dear. That’s a long time ago. I… I’ve had the usual things, I guess. Old age problems. I remember something about my blood pressure being high, years back. They gave me pills. I think. Honestly, it all blurs together. I’m divorced, if that matters. Don’t have insurance, either.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure… Alright. Do you recall what medication you were taking for your blood pressure, or for how long?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t. It was… a small white pill, maybe? I took it for a while, and then… I don't know. It felt like a lot of appointments, and I just... stopped going. It was a long time ago. And my memory isn’t what it used to be, doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: I see here there's limited information regarding your past medications, Mr. Ruocco. No recent blood pressure readings either. Now, let’s talk about your family. Any history of heart problems, lung disease, or cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she lived a long time. Pretty healthy, I think. My father… he worked hard, died young. Something with… his heart, maybe? It was a long time ago, before I really paid attention to things like that. My sister… she had some trouble breathing towards the end, but I don’t remember what it was.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about smoking or alcohol use, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Smoking? Oh, yes. I used to smoke. Years ago, though. Stopped… well, a long time ago. Maybe… twenty years? Alcohol… I have a drink sometimes. A beer with dinner, occasionally. Nothing serious. I’m not a… a drinker, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Mr. Ruocco, I'm going to need to examine your chest. It would be helpful if you could take deep breaths for me, even if it causes some discomfort. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, alright. Just… try to be quick, please? This is… tiring, trying to remember everything. And frankly, it hurts a bit just thinking about breathing deeply.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit up straight, and take a deep breath in… and out… Very good. Listen closely… Okay… and again. Deeper breath, if you can. Hmm… I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes, bilaterally. And a slight dullness to percussion as well. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch… yes. There. A little. Not terrible, but… yes. It's… a heavy pain. Like a weight. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Mr. Ruocco, but it's certainly something we need to investigate further. Your pain is reproducible with palpation, and combined with the diminished breath sounds and dullness, it could indicate some fluid buildup in your lungs. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart as well.
PATIENT: Fluid buildup? Oh, dear. That doesn’t sound good. Is it… serious? I just want to get this sorted and get home. I have… things to do. Please be quick, doctor. This is making me anxious.
DOCTOR: I’m hearing a slightly muffled heart sound… not alarming, but again, something we should explore. Mr. Ruocco, I’m going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We also need to check your oxygen saturation. And given your history of high blood pressure, I want to get a baseline EKG. Given your limited insurance, the costs might be… a concern. Are you able to manage those expenses?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, oh dear. X-rays, EKGs… costs… No. No, I can’t. I’m on a fixed income. I can barely pay the rent as it is. What does it even mean if there's fluid? Is it… pneumonia? I don't have the money for all of this, doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. We have a problem. Given your financial situation and the possible need for further testing, I recommend a referral to the city hospital. They have financial assistance programs and can provide more comprehensive care. They also have specialists who can better assess your condition. I will document my findings – diminished breath sounds, dullness to percussion, and reproducible pain – and provide a referral note. I cannot definitively diagnose you without further testing, but based on my initial assessment, it could be pneumonia, fluid buildup related to heart failure, or another respiratory issue. It is important to get this checked out promptly. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hospital… oh. Well, I suppose that’s… something. I understand. As much as I can, anyway. Pneumonia… that sounds bad. And heart trouble. My father… he had heart trouble. Okay, city hospital. Can you… can you write everything down for me? I tend to forget things, you know. Just… write it down clearly, so I don’t get lost. And thank you, doctor. I appreciate you trying to help.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Ruocco. I will clearly document my findings and the referral information. Here you go. It includes the hospital’s address and phone number, as well as a brief summary of my assessment. It states diminished breath sounds, dullness to percussion, reproducible chest pain, and a possible diagnosis of pneumonia or fluid buildup. I strongly advise you to go to the hospital as soon as possible. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Thank you. Yes… this is a lot of… medical words. Okay, diminished… percussion… I’ll… I'll just take it to the hospital, and they can figure it out. No, I don't think I have any questions. Just… tired. And anxious. Thank you again, doctor. I appreciate your help. I should probably go now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Ruocco. I wish you the best of luck. Do take care of yourself and go to the hospital right away. .
