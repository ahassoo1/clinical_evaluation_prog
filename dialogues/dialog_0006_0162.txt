DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s my stomach, okay? It’s…bloated. Just feels full all the time, even when I haven’t eaten much. It's been happening for a bit now, honestly. Not sure why it's happening, which is why I’m here, I guess.
DOCTOR: Bloated, okay. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Ugh. Look, I’m not good with dates. Maybe…a few weeks? A month? Something like that. It comes and goes, you know? Not constant. Honestly, it's just annoying. It feels like I ate a whole Thanksgiving dinner after a small sandwich.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few weeks to a month, intermittent. And anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. I don’t know…certain foods maybe? I eat a lot of…well, I eat. I don't really pay attention to which foods. Probably something greasy, if I had to guess. But it happens even when I'm being careful, honestly. It's just... random. Look, I'm a pile driver operator, I eat when I can, not when it's 'ideal,' alright?
DOCTOR: Okay. And any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…what kind of symptoms? I’m not sick, I just feel…full. No fever, no…I don't know. Maybe a little tired, but that’s just the job, alright? It’s hard work. I don't do…diarrhea or anything like that, if that’s what you're asking. Just…bloated. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no diarrhea, just the bloating and some fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements besides diarrhea?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Now we're talking about…that? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to, alright? What do you want me to say? It hasn't been…different, not really. Maybe a little harder sometimes, but again, I told you, I'm a pile driver. Probably just what I eat. Can we move on? This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No. Look, I haven't thrown up in…years. I don’t get sick, alright? I’m a tough guy. Just bloated. And tired. Is there a test you can just…give me to fix this? I haven't got all day for a stomach quiz.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and feel it gently. Nothing to worry about, just need to rule a few things out. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…be quick about it, alright? I’ve got a job to get back to. And don’t poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could lie down on your back, please. I'll start by listening to your abdomen. Take deep breaths for me. Okay…bowel sounds are present, but a little…hypoactive. Not drastically so, but worth noting. Now I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ugh, that's…cold. And a little uncomfortable, alright? Look, I'm not used to people poking around. That…feels a little tender, right there. Not painful, just…sensitive. It's always been a little tender there, honestly. I've had a lot of rough jobs, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower left quadrant. And any pain radiating anywhere else?
PATIENT: Radiating? Look, I don't have a lot of medical terms in my vocabulary, alright? It doesn't shoot pain anywhere. It just…feels a little off there. Like a dull ache sometimes, but not constantly. It’s just…uncomfortable, alright? Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms – bloating, intermittent fatigue, tenderness in the lower left quadrant – and the fact that you haven’t had any fever or vomiting, it could be a number of things. Could be something as simple as dietary changes, stress…or it could be something a little more involved. To be safe, I'd like to order some blood work – just a basic CBC and metabolic panel – and a stool sample to rule out any infection. And, honestly, I think a CT scan of your abdomen would be a good idea, just to get a better look at what’s going on in there. Do you have any allergies I need to be aware of?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Look, I told you, I don’t have time for this. A CT scan? That sounds…serious. Allergies? No, not really. I’m pretty tough, alright? Maybe a little reaction to bee stings when I was a kid, but nothing major. And…I’m widowed. If something is wrong, I don't have anyone to...well, you get it. Can we at least try changing my diet first? Before we start doing all this…invasive stuff?
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concerns, Mr. Kristofik. It’s good you mentioned the widowhood - that's important to know. And yes, we can absolutely try dietary changes first. I recommend starting with a low-FODMAP diet - that means reducing foods high in fermentable carbohydrates, which can cause bloating and gas. I can give you a handout with a list of foods to avoid. However, given your symptoms and the tenderness you described, I strongly recommend the stool sample and the CT scan. It's better to be safe, especially since you don't have a significant medical history that can explain these symptoms. I need to rule out anything serious, like diverticulitis, inflammation, or any other underlying issues. If something is wrong, we can catch it early and get you treated quickly. Would you be willing to at least consider the tests?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But if it's just going to tell me to eat less beans, I’m going to be very unhappy, alright? Diverti…what-itis? Look, doc, I'm a pile driver. I don’t need fancy medical terms, I need answers. And I need to get back to work. So…fine. Stool sample, CT scan, whatever. Just…make it quick, alright? And no poking. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology. The lab will send you instructions for the stool sample collection. Radiology will call you to schedule the CT scan. It doesn't take long, usually about 20-30 minutes. And no promises about poking, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. Here's a handout on the low-FODMAP diet. Start implementing that now. I'll also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist, just in case we need more specialized testing. We can discuss the results when they come back. And please, call my office if your symptoms worsen – severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool – don't hesitate. Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Hopefully, this will give us some answers. Get the tests done as soon as possible, and we'll follow up in a week to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
