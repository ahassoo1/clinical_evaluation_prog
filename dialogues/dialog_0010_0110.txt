DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, to put it plainly, I feel like I need a bit of a… reset, I suppose. A jumpstart. I’m getting on in years, you see, and things just aren’t working quite as smoothly as they used to. I’d like to feel more… vital, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. McNabb. It's very common to feel that way as we get older. "Reset" is a good way to put it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more specifically what "not working quite as smoothly" means?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, my energy isn’t what it used to be, of course. I get tired just puttering around the garden. And my joints… they ache, especially in the mornings. Not terrible pain, mind you, just… stiff and uncomfortable. And I’ve been having a bit of trouble remembering things lately – small things, mostly, like where I put my glasses or what I went into the kitchen for. It’s frustrating, more than anything. I don’t want to become… helpless, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That sounds like a lot to be dealing with. Let’s try to break it down. You mentioned fatigue, joint stiffness, and some memory issues. Let’s start with the fatigue and the joint stiffness. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It wasn't a sudden thing, you see. It’s been… gradual. I suppose it started maybe six months ago? It began with just feeling a bit more tired than usual after doing things. Then the stiffness in my knees and hands started creeping in around the same time. I thought it was just the weather at first, honestly. We had a particularly damp spring. But it hasn’t really gone away, even with the warmer weather. I’ve been trying to stay active, but it's getting harder and harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of gradual onset fatigue and joint stiffness, worse in the mornings, and affecting your ability to stay active. Now, regarding the memory issues, you said small things, like misplacing objects or forgetting why you went to a room. Can you give me an example of something that happened recently that concerned you?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… just yesterday, actually. I was making a cup of tea, and I went into the kitchen… and completely forgot why I went in there. I stood there for a good minute, looking around, trying to remember. It finally came to me, but it was a little unsettling. And just last week, I spent twenty minutes looking for my reading glasses, and they were on top of my head the whole time! It’s little things like that, mostly. Not forgetting who people are, thankfully, but just… little lapses. It’s enough to make me feel a bit foolish, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those kinds of lapses can be frustrating and a little worrying. Now, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had a bit of trouble with high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for quite some time now. Other than that… no, not really. I’ve been very fortunate, actually. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I had a hysterectomy many years ago, but that’s about it. My doctor always said I had a strong constitution. I suppose we’ll see if that’s still true!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Well-controlled hypertension is excellent. And a hysterectomy many years ago – thank you for letting me know. Do you take any other medications currently, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, just a daily vitamin D supplement. My doctor suggested it a few years back, said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. And occasionally, if my arthritis flares up, I take some over-the-counter ibuprofen. Nothing else, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if you understand. I always worry about side effects.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s always best to be mindful of what you’re taking. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to help my mother with her gardening, and she grew all sorts of things. I think I built up a resistance to just about everything! No, I can’t think of anything I’m allergic to.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's, or any types of cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother lived to be 92, but she didn’t really talk about her family much. She came from a large family in the Philippines, and things were… different back then. I know my grandfather on my father’s side had heart trouble, I believe. And my aunt, my mother's sister, developed some memory problems in her later years, but I’m not sure if it was Alzheimer’s or just… old age. It wasn’t really discussed openly. It’s hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. History of heart trouble in the grandfather and possible memory issues in the aunt. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, as I mentioned, I do enjoy gardening. It keeps me moving, though it's getting harder, as we've said. I try to eat a healthy diet – lots of fruits and vegetables. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I used to be very active in the church, but it's been difficult getting out as much lately. I live alone, you see, since my husband passed away ten years ago. Mostly I keep myself busy with reading and watching the news. It's a quiet life, but it’s a good life.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Gardening, healthy diet, no smoking or excessive alcohol, and a generally quiet lifestyle. Before we move on, let's quickly review any recent changes to your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My vision isn't what it used to be, of course. I wear glasses for reading, as I said, and for distance now too. I had my eyes checked about a year ago, and the doctor said it's just age-related. Nothing serious. My hearing is a little bit diminished as well, especially in the higher frequencies. I don't have any trouble hearing most people, but sometimes I have trouble with softer voices or if there's a lot of background noise. I don't wear a hearing aid, though. I haven't gotten used to the idea yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, age-related changes to both vision and hearing, but nothing that’s significantly impacting your daily life currently. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please proceed. I understand that’s part of figuring things out. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Your heart sounds regular, but a slight murmur is present. This is not uncommon in individuals your age and doesn't seem to be causing any issues at the moment. Your lungs sound clear, with good air entry bilaterally. Next, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/72, and your pulse is 78, regular. Now, let's check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is also normal for someone your age. Finally, I’ll take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your ears are clear, with some wax buildup, but nothing significant. Your throat looks clear as well. Everything appears within normal limits for your age, but the slightly diminished reflexes and wax buildup in the ears are worth noting.
PATIENT: That’s good to know, Doctor. Thank you for the thorough examination. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. The wax buildup… I suppose I should probably get that taken care of. It has been getting harder to hear, as I mentioned. So, what do you think is going on? What's the next step?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McNabb. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of age-related changes, potentially with some contribution from wax buildup affecting your hearing. The fatigue, joint stiffness, and memory lapses are common symptoms as we get older. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will help us check for things like vitamin deficiencies , thyroid problems, inflammation, and anemia, which can all cause similar symptoms. I also want to do a basic cognitive assessment – just a short questionnaire to get a better baseline of your memory and thinking skills. To address the hearing issue, I recommend we schedule an appointment with the audiology department to have the wax removed and have your hearing formally tested. Do that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests and a cognitive assessment… I’m happy to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of things. And yes, I definitely want to get that wax removed! It's been bothering me more and more. So, what’s the next step? Do I need to schedule the appointments myself, or will your office do that for me?
DOCTOR: Excellent. My office will schedule the appointments for you. We’ll get the blood tests done first, and then we’ll schedule the cognitive assessment and audiology appointment. The lab results usually take a few days to come back, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once we have them. In the meantime, try to stay as active as you can, even if it's just for short periods. Maintaining a healthy diet and staying socially engaged are also very important. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for not dismissing my concerns. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kind manner. I’ll wait to hear from your office about the appointments.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McNabb. I’m glad I could help. It’s my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Here’s a summary of our plan for you to take with you: Blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and inflammation. Basic cognitive assessment. Audiology appointment for wax removal and hearing test. We will contact you to schedule those appointments. Have a good day, Ms. McNabb. And please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well. I appreciate everything.
