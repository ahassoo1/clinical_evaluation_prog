DOCTOR: Well, hello there Jinnie, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, actually. I don’t usually bother doctors with… these sorts of things. But it’s been going on for a bit now, and my niece suggested I come. It's about… a discharge. A penile discharge, as the receptionist put it. Honestly, it’s quite undignified.
DOCTOR: Oh, I understand. It can be uncomfortable talking about things like this, but you did the right thing coming in. We’re here to help, no judgement at all. You said a penile discharge… just to clarify, are you experiencing this discharge from your penis, Jinnie?
PATIENT: Well, of course from my penis, Doctor! What other… organ would it be coming from? Really. I find your questions rather… direct. Though, I suppose it's good you’re being thorough. Yes, it's from there. It's… yellowish, and it sometimes smells. Not all the time, thankfully. It's been happening, oh, I'd say, about three weeks now. Perhaps a little longer. It's hard to keep track, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to point that out, my apologies. It's been a long day. Three weeks, okay. And yellowish, with a sometimes noticeable odor… Is it causing you any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: No, no pain, not exactly. A slight discomfort, perhaps. It’s more… irritating. And yes, there is some itching. Not constant, mind you, but it flares up, especially when I've been… active. And the smell! That’s the most bothersome part, honestly. It makes me feel rather… unclean. It’s simply dreadful. I've been using more soap, but it doesn't seem to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And the increased soap use… have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? Let me see… No, not really. Perhaps a little more frequent, but I’ve been drinking more water lately, with the heat, you understand. And it doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… a little bit of a stinging sensation sometimes, at the very end. It’s quite mild, though. It’s hard to say if it’s related to… all this, or just my age. Things don’t work as well when you get older, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s very true, things do change as we get older. And you're right to ask if it's related. So, frequent urination, a little stinging at the end… Have you noticed any blood in your urine at all?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness no! Not that I’ve seen. I would certainly notice that, wouldn't I? That sounds… alarming. No, no blood. I pride myself on my hygiene, you know. I check things regularly. And no, no fever, no chills, no aches… just the discharge, the itching, the smell, and the… slight discomfort when urinating. Honestly, Doctor, it’s terribly embarrassing to discuss. I feel like I’m speaking a different language.
DOCTOR: You're not at all, and please don't feel embarrassed. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things. Okay, no fever, chills, or aches. And you've been meticulous about hygiene. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs?
PATIENT: Excuse me? Doctor, I find that question rather… forward. I assure you, I have led a very respectable life. I've never had anything of the sort, and I resent the implication. I've been a single woman for many years, and I have always been… careful. I do not appreciate you suggesting… otherwise. Honestly, it’s quite rude.
DOCTOR: Oh, my deepest apologies, Jinnie! That was incredibly insensitive of me, and I sincerely apologize. It's standard procedure to ask about medical history, but I phrased that terribly. It was not my intention to imply anything at all. Please disregard that question. Let's move on. Have you had any other medical problems recently?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose I do have a bit of arthritis in my hands, which makes things difficult sometimes. And my blood pressure has been a little high lately, according to the nurse at the pharmacy. She suggested I watch my salt intake. Other than that… no, not really. I've always been quite healthy, despite my age. And I do try to take care of myself. It's just… this discharge is so upsetting. It’s simply not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and slightly elevated blood pressure. That’s good to know. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just a standard check to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. But I would prefer it be as quick as possible. And I would appreciate a clear explanation of what you are doing at each step. I don't like surprises, you understand. And please, be gentle. I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything as I go, and I'll be as gentle as possible. It won't take long, I promise. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll just take a look at the area. I’ll need you to lie down on the exam table, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Would you like me to provide a gown?
PATIENT: A gown? Oh, goodness no. I’m perfectly dressed, thank you. I can simply… lower my trousers a bit. I don’t see the need for all that fuss. Honestly, I’ve had medical examinations before, and I’ve never had to undress completely. Just listen to my heart and lungs, please. And try not to put the stethoscope directly on my skin. It’s rather cold, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, of course. I apologize for the inconvenience. Just take a deep breath for me… and another… Excellent. Your heart sounds strong, lungs are clear. Now, if you'll permit, I'd like to examine the area… just a quick look. Could you lie back on the exam table?
PATIENT: Very well. But be quick, please. And I would appreciate it if you didn't make any unnecessary comments. This is already quite embarrassing enough. And I do have an appointment to get my hair done this afternoon, you know. I can’t be late.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and respectful as possible. Now, if you could just relax… I’m going to take a look at the area now. Alright… I see some redness and a yellowish discharge. There doesn’t appear to be any swelling or obvious sores. It’s a little tender to the touch, as you mentioned. I’m going to need to collect a small sample of the discharge for testing, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help us determine the cause of the infection. It’s a quick and painless procedure.
PATIENT: An infection? You think it’s an infection? Oh, goodness. I haven’t… I haven’t been with anyone in years. How could I have contracted an infection? This is dreadful! A sample? What will you do with it? And will it hurt? I don’t like the sound of this at all. Honestly, Doctor, this is getting worse and worse. Perhaps I should just go home and try some herbal remedies. My niece recommended chamomile tea…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jinnie. It's not necessarily sexually transmitted; infections can happen for other reasons too. The sample will be sent to a lab for analysis to determine the cause of the discharge. It's a quick and painless procedure, I promise. We use a sterile swab, it’s similar to a cotton swab, and it shouldn’t cause any discomfort. It’s important to rule out all possibilities, and the testing will help us determine the best course of treatment. Would you be comfortable with me collecting the sample now?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But be very gentle, please. And hurry up. Honestly, this is the most undignified experience of my life. Just get it over with. But no sudden movements, you understand? And explain everything you are doing beforehand. I don’t like surprises. I really, really don’t. What exactly will you do with the sample afterwards? Will I get the results quickly? I have a hair appointment this afternoon, you know. I can’t be sick.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll explain everything step-by-step. I'm going to use a sterile cotton swab to gently collect a small sample of the discharge. It will only take a moment. It may feel slightly cool, but it shouldn't be painful. Then I'll place the swab in a sterile container and send it to the lab for analysis. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best treatment options. Alright, all done. That wasn't bad, was it?
PATIENT: Well… it wasn’t pleasant. And honestly, I’m not sure I like you touching me. But it’s over now, thank goodness. Now, can I get dressed? I need to go wash my hands. And I think I need a cup of tea. A very strong cup of tea. This whole experience has been utterly dreadful. Are you absolutely certain you can’t just give me some antibiotics without all this fuss? My niece said antibiotics cure everything… </stage>
DOCTOR: Of course. You can get dressed now. I understand your discomfort and I'm sorry if I've made you feel uneasy. It’s always best to determine the cause of the infection before prescribing antibiotics. Giving antibiotics unnecessarily can lead to resistance and other complications. While antibiotics can be effective, it's important to know what we’re treating. We need to wait for the lab results before determining the best course of action. You can go ahead and get dressed, and I’ll leave you a moment to freshen up. We'll discuss the results and next steps once they are available. Does that sound alright?
