DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. It’s… well, it’s this fever. Keeps comin’ back. It’s been a bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. A recurring fever, you say. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts with just feelin’ kinda chilly, you know? Then I get hot, real hot. Lasts a day, maybe two, then it breaks and I feel alright for a week or so. Then it starts again. Happens maybe… three times now in the last couple months. Not fun, let me tell ya. I’m 65, Doctor, not built for this anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, three times in the last couple of months, starting with chills then a high fever lasting a day or two. And then you feel better for about a week before it returns. That does sound frustrating, especially at 65. Do you happen to know what your temperature gets to when you’re running a fever?
PATIENT: Temperature… honestly, no. I don't own one of those fancy thermometers anymore. My wife, Elena, she used to check when I was really bad, but… I don’t remember the number exactly. Just felt hot, real hot. Like a hundred and something, I guess? Higher than normal, for sure. I haven’t bothered checkin' lately. What difference does it make, really? It feels bad, that’s what matters.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to know it feels high. Knowing the actual number can help us track things and see if it's getting worse or responding to any treatment, but feeling unwell is definitely the most important thing right now. Besides the fever, are you experiencing any other symptoms when it comes on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I get a bit of a headache, not a terrible one, just kinda… dull. And I feel tired, real tired. Like I could sleep for a week. No cough, no sniffles, nothin’ like a cold. Just… weak and achy. And thirsty. I drink a lot of water when it hits, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Elena makes me soup, that helps a little, but not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, headache, fatigue, and feeling achy, along with increased thirst. No cough or cold symptoms, that’s good to know. And the soup helps a little. Have you noticed any sweating, particularly at night?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, actually. Elena says I soak the sheets sometimes. I don't really notice it myself 'cause I'm usually out cold, but she complains about havin' to change 'em. She’s a good woman, Elena. Always lookin' after me. But no, I don’t wake up drippin', just… she says they’re damp in the mornin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Damp sheets at night. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits or had any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting with these fevers?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Everything’s… regular, you know? No stomach trouble at all. I eat pretty much the same as always. Elena's cookin' is too good to mess with! I haven't thrown up or felt sick to my stomach even once. Just the fever, the aches, and the tiredness. It’s really all there is to it. Honestly, Doctor, I just want it to stop. It’s wearin’ me down.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. No changes in bowel habits, no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. Just the recurring fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and night sweats. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let’s see… well, the doctor told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high. Put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped takin’ ‘em. Didn’t like how they made me feel. Been okay since, I think. And my knees, they bother me somethin’ awful, arthritis, the doctor said. But that’s it, really. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin’ serious. I try to stay active, walk a little when my knees allow. Elena worries, though. She says I should see a specialist about the knees. But I just don’t have the patience for all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that you’re no longer treating with medication, and arthritis in your knees. Do you remember what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... honestly, no. It was a long time ago, Doctor. A little white pill, I think. Can’t recall the name for the life of me. Elena might remember, she kept track of all that stuff. But me? My memory ain’t what it used to be. I just know it made me feel kinda dizzy sometimes, so I stopped takin’ it. I figured a little high blood pressure was better than feelin’ like I was gonna fall over all the time. Probably wasn’t the smartest thing to do, but… that was years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we don't have the specific name of the medication. And you stopped taking it due to dizziness. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than your knees?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital for anything serious. Broke my arm when I was a kid, fell outta a tree tryin’ to get a mango. But that was it. Just the broken arm, a long, long time ago. Mostly just stay outta trouble, you know? Elena says I’m too stubborn to get sick. But this fever… this fever’s somethin’ else. It just won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations other than the broken arm as a child. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had diabetes. She was sick for a long time before she passed. And my father, he had heart trouble, ended up havin’ a stroke. My sister, she’s got high blood pressure, takin’ pills for it. So, yeah, there's a bit of that runnin’ in the family, I guess. Not much else, really. Mostly just the usual old age stuff. My cousins, they're all pretty healthy as far as I know. Elena says I worry too much about all this family history stuff. But it’s hard not to, you know? When you see your folks sufferin', it makes you nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand, it’s natural to be concerned when you see family members struggle with health issues. So, a family history of diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Elena wouldn’t allow it. And I drink… maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on a special occasion. Nothing heavy. And drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Just good food, good company, and tryin’ to stay outta trouble. That’s about it. I get enough excitement just dealin’ with this fever, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. Elena always checks when she makes me somethin' new, just to be safe. But I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, thankfully. Elena's a great cook, and I like to try everything she makes. So, no, no allergies. Just this fever, botherin’ me somethin’ awful. Is it somethin’ serious, Doctor? I’m gettin’ a little worried now, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for answering all those questions, Clide. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature and blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn’t take too long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Sounds good. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. I got things to do, you know? Elena's expectin' me home for lunch. But yeah, go ahead. Do what you gotta do. Just be gentle with my knees, alright? They ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very gentle with your knees. First, let’s take your temperature. Your temperature is 101.3 Fahrenheit. Okay, a bit elevated. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a bit fast, and your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. And I'm checking your blood pressure now. Your blood pressure is 148/90. It's a little high. Everything seems alright for now, but given your recurring fevers, night sweats, family history, and elevated temperature and blood pressure, I’m a little concerned about a possible infection or underlying inflammatory process. I think it would be prudent to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, boy. Elena’s gonna be mad, havin’ to drive me all over again. But… alright, Doc. If you think it’s necessary. Just try to keep it simple, alright? I ain’t good with needles, never have been. What exactly are you lookin' for? And how long is this gonna take? I really gotta get home for lunch. Elena makes a mean arroz con gandules. You ever had it? It's Puerto Rican. Best in the world, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the blood tests, and I’ll do my best to make it as quick and painless as possible. And yes, I’ve had arroz con gandules! It is delicious. We'll be checking a complete blood count – that tells us about your red and white blood cells, which can indicate infection or inflammation. We’ll also check your electrolytes, kidney and liver function, and do a basic metabolic panel. And I’d like to do a test for inflammatory markers, like your ESR and CRP, to see if there’s any inflammation in your body. It's a pretty standard set of tests. It should take about 15-20 minutes to draw the blood, and the results usually come back within 24-48 hours. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood now. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Twenty-four to forty-eight hours… that’s a long time to be worryin’. Alright, alright. Fine. Let’s get it over with. Just tell the nurse to be gentle, alright? And try not to dig too deep. My veins ain't what they used to be either. This is all a bit much, Doc. All I wanted was to get rid of this fever. You sure these tests are necessary? Maybe it's just a bug goin’ around? Elena keeps tellin’ me I shoulda stayed home and rested. She’s probably right, always is. But alright, let’s get the tests done. I trust you, Doc. You seem like a smart fella. Just… hurry up, alright? My lunch is gettin’ cold.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Clide, and I want to assure you that we're doing this to get to the bottom of things and make sure you're healthy. While it could be a simple bug, your recurring symptoms and family history warrant further investigation. We want to rule out anything more serious. I’ll speak to the nurse and make sure she’s as gentle as possible. She’s very experienced and will do her best to make it quick and painless. I’ll also write a note for your wife, Elena, explaining the tests and why we’re doing them. I’ll let you know as soon as the results are back. Let me call the nurse now. And in the meantime, try to relax. We'll figure this out together. "Nurse Ramirez, could you please come in and draw some blood for Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Alright. Nurse Ramirez, huh? Hope she’s got a steady hand. Just… try not to poke too much, alright? I don’t handle needles well. And tell Elena I said hi. She's probably worryin’ herself sick right now. This is a mess, Doc, a real mess. I just wanna feel normal again. You think they'll find somethin' wrong? I don't like bein' poked and prodded for nothin'.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Clide. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about blood tests, especially if you don't enjoy needles. Nurse Ramirez is excellent, and she’ll do everything she can to make it as comfortable as possible. And don't worry, we're not necessarily expecting to find something wrong. These tests are simply a way for us to gather information and get a clearer picture of your overall health. It’s better to be thorough and rule things out than to worry about what might be happening. I'll let Nurse Ramirez know you're feeling anxious, and I’ll be right here throughout the process. She'll be in shortly. And I'll be sure to tell Elena you said hi. She’s a wonderful wife for looking out for you. Just try to take some deep breaths and focus on your arroz con gandules. Think about how good it’s going to taste. That's a much better thought, right?
PATIENT: Arroz con gandules… yeah, you’re right. Elena’s is the best. Best in the whole world, I tell ya. Slow-cooked with just the right amount of sofrito. And a little bit of smoked ham… mmm. Okay, okay. Focus on the arroz con gandules. That’s a good thought. Better than needles, that’s for sure. Still, this whole thing is makin’ me nervous. What if it’s somethin’ serious, Doc? What if… Never mind. Arroz con gandules. Gotta focus on the arroz con gandules. Where is that nurse, anyway? This wait is killin’ me.
DOCTOR: It's good to focus on positive thoughts, Clide, and your arroz con gandules sounds absolutely delicious. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious, but try not to jump to conclusions. We’re just gathering information at this point, and we won’t know anything until the results are back. And don't worry, Nurse Ramirez is just around the corner. She was assisting another patient, but she’ll be here shortly. She is very efficient and gentle. In the meantime, I’m going to write a few notes for your chart, and I'll be right here if you need anything at all. Just try to relax and take some deep breaths. We’re doing everything we can to get you feeling better. And I'm confident we will figure out what's going on. Just think about Elena’s wonderful cooking. And maybe plan what you'll have for dessert! That always helps take my mind off things.
PATIENT: Dessert, huh? Elena makes a flan that’s… heavenly. Creamy, smooth, with just the right amount of caramel. Oh, that flan… I could eat a whole pan of it by myself. But Elena wouldn’t allow it. She says too much sugar is bad for my blood pressure. She’s always lookin’ out for me. Still, this wait is killin’ me. What if it is my blood pressure? What if I need to be on medication again? I hate those pills, Doc. They make me feel dizzy and tired. Alright, alright. Focus on the flan. And the arroz con gandules. And Elena’s wonderful cookin’. Just gotta stay positive, right? But it’s hard, Doc, really hard. I just wanna feel normal again. Where is that nurse, anyway?
DOCTOR: I understand, Clide. It's perfectly natural to feel worried, especially when you've had negative experiences with medication in the past. And you’re right, it’s hard to stay positive when you’re feeling anxious. But let’s not jump to conclusions. There are many possible reasons for your symptoms, and high blood pressure is just one of them. We’ll get the results of the blood tests, and then we can discuss them thoroughly and come up with a plan that’s right for you. And if medication is necessary, we can explore different options to find one that doesn’t make you feel dizzy or tired. Ah, here she is now. Nurse Ramirez is very efficient. I’m confident she’ll make this as quick and painless as possible. Just relax and take some deep breaths, Clide. And remember to focus on Elena’s wonderful cooking. I promise we’ll figure this out together. Nurse Ramirez: “Good morning, Mr. Brege. Dr. Auelua has asked me to draw some blood for a few tests. It will just take a few minutes.”
PATIENT: Alright. Just… be gentle, alright? My veins ain’t what they used to be. And try not to poke too much. I don’t like needles, never have. Just get it over with quickly, alright? And maybe… maybe tell me about the flan while you’re doin’ it? Elena makes a really good flan. Helps take my mind off things. Just… hurry up, alright?
DOCTOR: Nurse Ramirez: "Of course, Mr. Brege. I will be very gentle, and I'll do my best to make this as quick and painless as possible. I understand your anxiety, and I promise to be mindful of your veins. And I'd be happy to hear about Elena's flan! It sounds delicious. Tell me all about it while I get set up. It's a wonderful distraction." Nurse Ramirez: "So, what makes Elena's flan so special?
PATIENT: Well… she uses just the right amount of vanilla, you see? Not too much, not too little. And she slow-cooks it, over low heat, for hours. That's the secret, I think. And she makes her own caramel, from scratch. None of that store-bought stuff. It's… creamy, smooth, with a hint of citrus. And the caramel… oh, the caramel is perfect. Not too hard, not too soft. Just the right consistency. And she always adds a little bit of cinnamon. That’s what makes it special, I think. A little bit of cinnamon. Are you gonna poke me now? I’m gettin’ nervous again…
DOCTOR: Nurse Ramirez: "That sounds absolutely heavenly, Mr. Brege. Your wife sounds like a wonderful cook! And yes, a little bit of cinnamon can make all the difference. And don’t worry, we're almost ready. I'm going to find a good vein, and then it will just be a quick pinch. I promise to be as gentle as possible. Take a deep breath for me, and try to focus on that delicious flan." Nurse Ramirez: "Alright, almost done. Just a few more seconds…"
PATIENT: Ouch… that’s a little cold. And… it stings a bit. Just… hurry up, alright? I don’t like needles. Never have. Think about the flan… think about the flan… creamy, smooth, cinnamon… Oh, Elena… she’s the best. Are you almost done yet?
DOCTOR: Nurse Ramirez: "Alright, all done, Mr. Brege. You did great! Just hold that cotton ball firmly for a few minutes to stop any bleeding. And if you feel any discomfort, just let me know. Here’s a bandage to cover it up. And I'll take these samples to the lab right away. The results should be available within 24-48 hours." Nurse Ramirez: “There you go. All done! And honestly, you hardly flinched. You were very brave. And I’m so glad I got to hear about Elena’s flan. I might have to ask her for the recipe!” Nurse Ramirez: "All finished, Dr. Auelua. Samples are on their way to the lab."
PATIENT: Finally… that was awful. I hate needles. Never have. Just glad it’s over. So… what happens now, Doc? When will we get the results? And… what if it’s somethin’ bad? I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded for nothin’. Just wanna feel normal again, Doc. That’s all I want. Is it gonna be alright?
DOCTOR: “It’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious after that, Clide. And you were very brave, getting through that. As for what happens now, the lab will analyze the samples and send us the results within 24-48 hours, like Nurse Ramirez said. Once we have them, we’ll review them together, and I’ll explain everything to you in detail. And I understand your concern about finding something ‘bad.’ But let’s not jump to conclusions. These tests are simply a way for us to gather information and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Most likely, it’s nothing serious. But we want to be thorough and rule out any potential issues. And I assure you, we’ll take things one step at a time. If anything further is needed, we’ll discuss it together and make a plan that’s right for you. You’re not alone in this, Clide. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. In the meantime, try to relax and focus on taking care of yourself. And maybe enjoy a slice of Elena’s flan. That always helps.” “Do you have any questions for me right now, Clide?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. One step at a time. That sounds… good. I guess… I guess I’m just worried about Elena. She gets so stressed out when I’m sick. She worries herself sick, you know? And… what if it is somethin’ serious, Doc? What if I need… I don’t know… what if I need a lot of treatment? I just wanna feel normal again, Doc. I just wanna be able to spend time with Elena, without worryin’ about bein’ sick all the time. I guess… I guess I just wanna know… is it gonna be alright? Is everything gonna be alright?
DOCTOR: “I understand your concern for Elena, Clide. It’s wonderful that you’re so considerate of her feelings. And it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about the possibility of needing treatment. Let me assure you, we’ll do everything we can to take care of you, no matter what the results show. If treatment is necessary, we’ll explore all available options and choose the best course of action for your specific situation. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable and well-informed every step of the way. And while I can’t guarantee what the results will be, I want to assure you that we’ll approach this with optimism and a commitment to providing you with the best possible care. We have excellent resources available, and we’ll work together to create a plan that helps you feel better and enjoy spending time with Elena. Right now, it's important to stay positive and focus on taking care of yourself. And remember, we’ll have answers soon, and we’ll face this together. In the meantime, I'm going to write a note to Elena, letting her know that we've taken the tests and are awaiting the results. I'll also include my contact information, in case she has any questions.” “Do you have any other questions or concerns right now, Clide?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. A note to Elena… that’s good. She’ll worry less if she knows what’s goin’ on. I guess… I guess I just wanna know… what are we lookin’ for, Doc? What kind of things are these tests gonna show? Are we lookin’ for… somethin’ serious? And… if it is somethin’ serious… what kind of treatment would I need? Would I have to go to the hospital? I don’t like hospitals, Doc. Never have. Just wanna feel normal again, Doc. That’s all I want. I guess… just tell me the truth, Doc. What are we lookin’ for? Please.
DOCTOR: “I understand your need for honesty, Clide, and I’ll do my best to answer your questions as clearly as possible. These tests are looking at a few different things. We're checking your complete blood count to see if your white blood cell count is elevated, which could indicate an infection or inflammation. We’re also checking your electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function to make sure those organs are working properly. And we’re checking for inflammatory markers to see if there’s any underlying inflammation in your body. We're also checking for some basic signs of common infections. To be frank, we’re trying to rule out things like a bacterial infection, a viral illness, or an autoimmune condition. It's also possible the fever could be related to your blood pressure, though that's less common. If it turns out to be something serious, like a bacterial infection, treatment would likely involve antibiotics. If it’s a viral illness, we’d focus on supportive care – rest, fluids, and managing your symptoms. If it's an autoimmune condition, we might need to refer you to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment. And yes, in some cases, hospitalization might be necessary, but that's not usually the case. Most of the time, these conditions can be managed on an outpatient basis. Right now, let's not jump to conclusions. We need to wait for the results before we can determine what's going on. And I promise, we’ll explore all available options and make a plan that’s right for you. Is there anything else I can clarify for you right now, Clide?
PATIENT: Autoimmune condition… that sounds… scary. And a specialist… I don’t like specialists. Never have. So… if it is an autoimmune condition… what does that even mean? And… what if I need a lot of tests? What if I need… I don’t know… surgery? I don’t like surgery. Never have. Just wanna feel normal again, Doc. That’s all I want. I guess… just tell me the truth, Doc. Is it gonna be alright? Please.
DOCTOR: “I understand your anxiety, Clide. The term ‘autoimmune condition’ can sound scary, but it’s important to remember that it’s not always serious. It simply means that your immune system is attacking your own body instead of fighting off infections. There are many different types of autoimmune conditions, and some are much more manageable than others. Many can be controlled with medication and lifestyle changes. And a specialist would simply be someone who has expertise in that specific area. We’d only refer you to a specialist if it turned out to be necessary. As for needing a lot of tests or surgery, that’s not always the case. It depends on the specific condition. If it does require further testing, we’ll explain everything to you in detail before proceeding. And we’ll only consider surgery as a last resort. Right now, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We need to wait for the results before we can determine what’s going on. And I promise, we’ll explore all available options and make a plan that’s right for you. I want to assure you that you’re not alone in this. We’ll work together to get to the bottom of this and find the best possible solution. And I’ll be here every step of the way to answer your questions and provide support. Is there anything else I can clarify for you right now, Clide?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Work together… that sounds… good. I guess… I guess I just wanna know… what’s the worst thing that could happen, Doc? If it is somethin’ serious… what’s the worst-case scenario? I know I’m askin’ a lot, and I know you don’t want to scare me… but I just wanna be prepared. I just wanna know… what’s the worst that could happen? Please, Doc. Just tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: “I understand your need for honesty, Clide. It’s important to be prepared, even if it means facing difficult truths. And I want to assure you that I won’t sugarcoat anything. The worst-case scenario, depending on the cause of your fever, could involve a serious infection that requires hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. In rare cases, it could lead to organ damage or even death. However, I want to emphasize that this is extremely unlikely. If it turns out to be an autoimmune condition, the worst-case scenario could involve chronic pain, fatigue, and disability. However, many autoimmune conditions can be effectively managed with medication and lifestyle changes, and many people live full and productive lives. I want to reiterate that these are just worst-case scenarios, and it’s highly unlikely that any of them will happen. The most likely scenario is that your fever is caused by a common infection that can be easily treated with antibiotics. I understand that this is a lot to take in, and I want to assure you that I’m here to support you every step of the way. We’ll explore all available options and make a plan that’s right for you. And I’ll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. Is there anything else I can clarify for you right now, Clide?
PATIENT: Organ damage… chronic pain… death… Oh, Elena… I don’t wanna die, Doc. I just wanna spend time with Elena. I just wanna live… I guess… I guess I just need a minute. I just wanna feel normal again, Doc. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: “It’s okay to feel scared, Clide. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed when facing difficult truths. And it’s okay to cry. Let it out. I want to reassure you that the chances of any of those worst-case scenarios happening are extremely low. And I promise, we’ll do everything we can to help you feel better and live a long and full life. Right now, let’s just focus on taking things one step at a time. We’ll wait for the results, and then we’ll explore all available options. And I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. And you’re not alone in this, Clide. I’m here for you. And Elena is here for you. You have people who care about you, and we’ll face this together. Take a deep breath. It’s okay. I’ll give you a moment to compose yourself. There’s no rush. I’m here to listen when you’re ready to talk.”
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Thank you, Doc. You’ve been… very kind. I guess… I guess I just need to focus on Elena. She’s the one who keeps me goin’. I just wanna spend as much time with her as possible. I guess… I guess I’m ready to talk now. What happens next, Doc? What do we do now?
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Clide. It’s my job to be here for you, and I’m glad I could offer some comfort. And you’re right, focusing on Elena is a wonderful idea. She sounds like a remarkable woman. As for what happens next, we’ll wait for the lab results. They should be available within 24 to 48 hours. Once we have them, I’ll call you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment. During that appointment, we’ll review the results together and discuss the best course of action. If the results are concerning, we may need to refer you to a specialist for further evaluation. But let’s not jump ahead. Let’s just focus on getting the results first. In the meantime, try to rest and take care of yourself. And spend some quality time with Elena. That’s the most important thing right now. Do you have any questions for me before we end the consultation, Clide?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Rest and spend time with Elena… I can do that. No… I think that’s all for now, Doc. Thank you… for everything. I guess… I’ll see you when the results come back. Thank you again… for everything. And Doc… Please… call me as soon as you get the results. I just wanna know… one way or the other. Thank you again… for everything.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Clide. And you can count on me. I’ll call you as soon as the results come back, no matter what. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care of yourself, and spend some quality time with Elena. And remember, we’ll face this together. Goodbye, Clide.”
