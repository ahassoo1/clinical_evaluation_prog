DOCTOR: Hi Kiwane, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Yes, good to meet you also. I am here for… the check-up before the insurance starts. A physical, you call it? My friend, he said I need this before they will pay for anything. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-insurance physical. Yes, that’s very common, and your friend is right – insurance companies usually require a baseline physical before covering more extensive care. Alright, well, we can definitely get that done for you today. It'll just be a pretty standard exam – checking your vitals, listening to your heart and lungs, looking at your ears, throat, and so on. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to get insurance now?
PATIENT: Insurance...well. It is… responsible, I suppose. My family, they worry too much. They say a man my age should have this. I work at the… the food place. It is safe work, mostly. But things can happen, yes? A cut, a strain… My mother, she keeps telling me stories. It is better to be careful. And now, with the insurance, she will be happy.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you, Kiwane, and it's great that you're thinking ahead. It’s always good to have peace of mind, and a happy mother is a bonus! The "food place," okay. And yes, even in seemingly safe work environments, things can happen. We want to make sure you’re starting from a good baseline. Just to get a clearer picture, when you say “cut” or “strain,” have you had any recent injuries like that, or are you just mentioning potential things that could happen?
PATIENT: No, no injuries recently. Thank goodness. I mean… I cut my finger once, small cut, last year. But nothing serious. Just a bandage, all done. I am speaking of… what could happen. A man must be prepared. It is foolish to walk through life without thinking of danger. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Very wise. It's good to be proactive. Okay, no recent injuries to worry about. That's helpful. Let’s move on to your medical history then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. No conditions. My health is… good. Always been good. I eat… mostly healthy. My mother, she makes sure of that. She makes many vegetables. And I drink water. Not the sugary drinks. I do not like sugary drinks.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent! Healthy eating and staying hydrated are fantastic. So, no known medical conditions and a generally healthy lifestyle – that’s a great starting point. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. No surgeries. And no… hospital. I am not a fan of hospitals. Too many sick people. And the smells… not pleasant. I stay away from hospitals if I can.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Hospitals aren't usually anyone's favorite place. Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Let’s talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has any significant medical conditions – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, things like that?
PATIENT: My family...well. My grandfather, he had problems with his heart. A long time ago. He smoked too many cigarettes. My aunt, she has something with her… the sugar. Diabetes, I think you call it. And my mother, she worries about everything, so she says everyone could have something. But I do not know for sure. They live far away, in Yemen, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Heart problems with your grandfather and diabetes with your aunt. And your mother's concerns are understandable. It’s good to be aware of family history, even if the information isn't complete. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I eat everything. Except… snails. I do not like snails. But that is a preference, not an allergy. I have never been sick from food. And I have never taken much medicine. Just for a headache, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No allergies and minimal medication use – that's excellent. Let’s see… just a couple more questions before we do the physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, doctor. No pills. Only water. And sometimes… tea. My mother sends me tea from Yemen. It is good for… everything, she says. But it is not medicine. Just tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, just tea – that sounds lovely. Alright, Kiwane, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline reading. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Fine. I am ready, I suppose. As long as it is quick. I have things to do later.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we'll keep it as quick and efficient as possible. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look in your ears, throat, and eyes. It'll be pretty straightforward. Okay, blood pressure is 120/80 – that's within the normal range. Pulse is 72 – also good. Temperature is 98.6 – normal. Respiratory rate is 16 – that’s good too. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Very well. Just... try to be quick, yes? This is… strange. I do not usually have people listen to my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular – no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Lungs are clear – I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Can you say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Ah... Ah. It is uncomfortable, this cold thing in my ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, your ears look clear – no signs of infection or wax buildup. Throat looks healthy – no redness or swelling. Everything appears normal. One last thing – I’m going to briefly check your reflexes and strength. Reflexes are normal and strength is good in all limbs. Okay, that concludes the physical exam. Everything appears to be in good working order.
PATIENT: Good. Just...good. So I am healthy? That is all I needed to know. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Kiwane, based on this exam, you appear to be in good health. That’s great news! Everything checked out normally. To be thorough, I’m going to document everything, of course. I'll include your vitals, the clear lung and heart sounds, normal reflexes, and the fact that you have no known allergies or medical conditions. I'm also going to recommend a basic blood panel just as a precaution – to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. It's standard practice and will give us a more complete baseline picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood? You want blood now? No. No blood. I do not like needles. I am fine. I am healthy. I do not need this… blood.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're understandably hesitant about the blood draw. It's not everyone's favorite thing. It's just a precaution, Kiwane – a way to get a more complete baseline reading, especially since you’re starting insurance coverage. However, if you are strongly opposed to it, that is completely your decision. We can proceed without it. It won’t invalidate the physical exam findings. Just be aware that if any health concerns arise in the future, your insurance company might require this basic blood work at that time. So, to recap, I’ve documented your good health, based on the physical exam. You don't have any known allergies or medical conditions, and everything checked out normally. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No questions. I just... want to leave now. I have things to do. So, I am finished? Can I go? And will this… physical be enough for the insurance?
DOCTOR: Yes, Kiwane, you are finished. And yes, this physical exam should be sufficient for the insurance. I’ll print out a summary of my findings for you to submit to them. It includes all the important information – your vitals, the exam findings, and a statement that you’re in good health with no known allergies or medical conditions. I'll also make a note in your chart that you declined the blood work. Thank you for coming in today, and I hope you have a good day! Please don't hesitate to reach out if any health concerns arise in the future. .
PATIENT: Good day to you also, Doctor.
