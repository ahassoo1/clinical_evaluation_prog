DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Benites, have a seat. Fifty-seven, eh?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Fifty-seven years old. It is nice to meet you, Doctor... Batara, yes? I am here for this… telehealth visit. My insurance, Medicare, told me to come.
DOCTOR: Medicare. Of course. Alright. So, this “telehealth visit” as you call it… they sent you here for what, exactly?
PATIENT: They did not say what, exactly. Just… a check-up. A general look-see. I think it is because I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Since my husband… passed. It is all a bit confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A “general look-see” initiated by Medicare. Wonderful. Well, we’ll have to make it specific, then, won’t we?
PATIENT: Yes, I suppose so. What do you need to know? I feel… alright, mostly. A little tired, perhaps. Is that important?
DOCTOR: "A little tired." Right. Well, everyone is a little tired these days. But we need details. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Maybe… six months ago? After the winter, I think. It was a very hard winter. Lots of snow. I had to shovel a lot… my husband always did that, you see. Now I do it myself.
DOCTOR: Shoveling snow. Right. So, six months of fatigue, coinciding with taking on extra physical labor. And is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days I feel… okay. Like I can do things. Other days… I just want to sit. And sleep. It is not a good tiredness, if that makes sense. Not like after a long day’s work. It is… inside. Like I have no energy.
DOCTOR: "Inside." You describe your symptoms with a remarkable lack of precision, Ms. Benites. But alright. Any other symptoms accompanying this… "inside tiredness"?
PATIENT: Let me see… Sometimes my joints ache. My knees, mostly. And my back. But I am old! Old people ache, yes? I do not think that is important. Is it?
DOCTOR: "Old people ache," you say. A convenient generalization. But we're not here to discuss the inevitability of aging, Ms. Benites. When do the aches occur?
PATIENT: Mostly in the morning. When I wake up. And… after I have been sitting for a long time. Or… after I shovel the snow. I am sorry. I do not explain things very well. I am not used to talking about… this.
DOCTOR: Morning stiffness, exacerbated by activity. Yes, yes. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your joints?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… I do not think so. Sometimes they feel a little… puffy, maybe? But I do not know if that is swelling. I have always had… big hands. It is hard to say.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now that you mention it… my clothes are a little loose. But I haven’t been weighing myself. I used to, but… after my husband… it just didn’t seem important anymore. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Unintentional weight loss, Ms. Benites. We are building a rather concerning picture here. Now, any fever, chills, night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven't had a fever. Not that I know of. No chills, either. And… night sweats? No. I sleep quite warmly, actually. Why are you asking about this? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, your lack of specificity is… frustrating. We have fatigue, joint pain, unintentional weight loss. These symptoms, combined with your age, require investigation. I'm going to need a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a rheumatoid factor test. And, frankly, I think we should get a chest X-ray, just to be thorough. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: A… a blood test? And an X-ray? Oh dear. I… I don’t know. I haven’t been to a doctor in so long. Allergies… I don't think so. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, after some creams, but nothing serious. What are you looking for? Is it something bad? I just wanted a check-up… Medicare sent me.
DOCTOR: Medicare initiates a lot of unnecessary procedures, Ms. Benites. But we are doing this to rule things out. Now, any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No. No medications. Just… sometimes I take a little something for my knees. A cream. But it doesn't really help. It's… … Arnica, I think? It's a herbal thing. My friend brought it from… Czechoslovakia. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Alright. We will get those blood tests ordered immediately. And I'm scheduling that chest X-ray for tomorrow morning. Now, I need to do a quick physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh… lie down? But… everything is happening so fast. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: Just get changed, Ms. Benites. It won't be pleasant, but it won't be torture. We need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. And, unfortunately, I'll need to examine your knees.
PATIENT: Oh… right. It's been a long time since I… since anyone touched me like that. I… I hope it doesn’t take long. .
DOCTOR: Please lie flat on your back with your arms at your sides. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. Murmur absent. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but decreased breath sounds at the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with mild guarding. No masses palpated. Moderate crepitus in both knees with range of motion. Pain reported with flexion and extension. Mild effusion present in the right knee. Alright. That's enough for now. Please get dressed.
