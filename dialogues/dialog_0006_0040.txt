DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, good day to you too, Doctor Gorga. Well, it's this pain in my side again, you see. Comes and goes, mostly on my right. And… I seem to be getting those water infections quite often now. It’s a bit bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, right side pain and frequent water infections… hmm. Let's start with the pain. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: It's… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, thankfully. Sometimes it feels like a pressure, a heavy feeling. It doesn’t come on suddenly, it just builds up over a day or so. And then it fades away, slowly. It’s not constant, you understand. Just… comes and goes. I don’t really have anything specific that causes it, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull, building ache on the right side, comes and goes... and nothing specific seems to trigger it. Okay. And when you say "water infections," how often are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It used to be just once or twice a year. But lately… maybe every six to eight weeks? Sometimes a little sooner. It’s enough to make you tired, you know? And a bit uncomfortable, of course. The doctor before, he just kept giving me pills for it, but it keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Frequent UTIs… right. And you said the previous doctor was just treating the symptoms with antibiotics?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Just the usual course of antibiotics. They help while I’m taking them, but as soon as I finish, it seems to be creeping back again. He didn’t really explain why it kept happening, just said these things sometimes do. I thought perhaps… well, I thought I’d see if you could have a better look.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick run-through of your medical history, just to get a clearer picture. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… yes. About ten years ago now, a specialist told me I have something with my kidneys. Polycystic Kidney Disease, he called it. It’s… something to do with little bubbles growing on them. He said it’s something I’d just have to keep an eye on. I haven’t seen that specialist since, though. I mostly just see my regular GP for check-ups. He knows about it, of course.
DOCTOR: Polycystic Kidney Disease… Okay, that's important. Do you remember anything else he said about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. He said it runs in families, apparently. My mother had something similar, though she didn’t live very long. He said… oh, and he said it could cause high blood pressure, but so far, mine's been alright. And, of course, he said it could cause problems with infections, which now… well, now it seems to be doing. It's all a bit confusing, really. I don't remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, any family history of other medical problems besides the kidney disease?
PATIENT: Well… my brother had diabetes, type two, I believe. And my father… he had heart trouble. Passed away when he was quite young, actually. That was many years ago. I try to eat healthy, you see, to keep everything in order. But you know, these things… they just happen sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in a brother, heart trouble in a father… and you try to maintain a healthy diet. That's good to know. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. Never had any problems with allergies. I can take most pills without any fuss. I don’t take a lot of medication regularly, just a bit for my joints now and then, the usual aches and pains of getting older, you understand. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what medications are you taking for your joints?
PATIENT: Just some paracetamol, when I need it. And sometimes, if it's really bothering me, I’ll take ibuprofen. But not often, maybe a couple of times a month. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I don’t like feeling… sluggish, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. No problem at all. There we go… is this alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax. I’m going to press gently on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Starting here, on the right side… Any pain there?
PATIENT: A little bit, yes. Not sharp, just… a dull ache, like I was describing. It's not terrible, but I can definitely feel something when you press. A bit uncomfortable, you see. It’s about the same level as it usually is, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here, slightly higher up?
PATIENT: That… feels a little bit more tender, yes. Still not sharp, but definitely more noticeable. It's hard to explain… it's like a heavy feeling, more than pain. And… it seems to radiate around a bit, to my back. Not a lot, but I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lungs sound clear. Now, just a quick listen to your abdomen... Everything sounds normal there. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the exam, the right-sided pain and frequent UTIs, combined with the Polycystic Kidney Disease, I think we need to investigate a bit further. I want to order a urine sample, a blood test to check your kidney function, and a kidney ultrasound. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible indeed. Anything to get to the bottom of it. A urine sample, blood test, and an ultrasound… yes, perfectly alright. Will you be arranging those here, at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can arrange those here at the clinic. I’ll write the requisitions now. The nurse will come in and take a urine sample, and we can book you in for the blood test and ultrasound. It should be fairly quick. .
PATIENT: Ah, excellent. Thank you very much, Doctor. That’s a relief to hear. I appreciate you looking into this. I’ll just wait here, then, for the nurse. Thank you again. .
