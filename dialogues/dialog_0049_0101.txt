DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been botherin’ me for a bit now. Not constant, but it comes and goes, and when it does come, it’s a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a headache at the back of your head…and it's intermittent. Can you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Well now, let me think. It’s not a sharp pain, not like a throbbing either. More of a… a dull ache, really. Like someone’s tightened a band around my head. Sometimes it feels like pressure, other times just… heavy. Does that make any sense? It doesn’t stop me from doin’ things, but it’s definitely there, makin’ it hard to concentrate sometimes. Especially when I’m leanin’ over folks’ feet, you know, doin’ a pedicure. Makes my eyes feel funny too.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, with pressure…and it’s worse when you're bending over. And you mentioned it affects your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Not a constant blurry vision or anything, but sometimes when I’m really focused on the small details, like trimmin’ cuticles, my eyes feel strained. Like they need a rest. And it seems to happen more when the headache is bad. It’s hard to explain… it's just a feelin', really. I've been doin' nails for sixty years, you know, so I'm used to lookin' close, but this feels different.
DOCTOR: Sixty years… that's quite a long time. And you haven’t noticed any other symptoms with these headaches?
PATIENT: No, not really. No dizziness, no nausea, nothin' like that. No fever, no stiffness in my neck. Just the headache and the… the eye strain when I’m workin’. And sometimes, just a little bit tired, but who isn’t at my age, eh? I sleep alright, eat alright. My wife keeps a close eye on me, you know. She'd tell me if I was lookin' poorly. She's a good woman, that one.
DOCTOR: No fever, no dizziness… alright. And your wife hasn't noticed anything unusual?
PATIENT: No, she hasn’t. She says I’m just gettin’ old and need to slow down, haha! But I like workin’. Keeps me busy, keeps my mind sharp. She worries, of course. Always has. But no, she hasn’t seen me clutchin’ my head or anything dramatic like that. It's just… persistent. And lately, it’s been happenin’ a little more often, you know? That’s why I thought I should come see someone. Better safe than sorry, that’s what I always say.
DOCTOR: Persistent and increasing… alright. Now, let's go over some medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me think now... I had high blood pressure years ago, maybe twenty years back. The doctor put me on some pills for it, but I stopped takin' them after a while. Felt better, and the doctor said I could try comin' off of 'em. Haven't had any trouble with it since. Apart from that... nothin' much. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin' older, you know? A bit of arthritis in my hands, but I can still do my work. No major illnesses or surgeries, thankfully. And I’m up to date with all my vaccinations, my wife makes sure of that!
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in the past, currently off medication… and some arthritis. Do you recall the name of the blood pressure medication you were taking?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a good question. My memory isn't what it used to be. Let me see... it was a small white pill… I think it started with an ‘A’? Or maybe a ‘B’? I really can't say for sure. It was years ago, and my wife always handled the refills. I just took them as she gave them to me. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. I remember the doctor tellin' me it was to help with the pressure, but the name escapes me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications, even over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin’ at all. I try to avoid pills if I can. A bit of liniment for my hands when the arthritis flares up, but that’s it. My wife always says I’m too stubborn for my own good. I believe in lettin’ things heal naturally, if possible. I eat a good diet, plenty of fish and vegetables, and I try to get enough rest. That’s my medicine, you see. Although, lately, it doesn’t seem to be doin’ the trick with this headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always checks when I’m gettin’ a flu shot, and they always say I’m clear. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, travelled to different places… never had any trouble with allergies. I’m a pretty hardy sort, you see. Jamaican blood, strong stuff! Haha. Though, I do try to avoid shellfish, just don’t particularly care for the taste. But that's not an allergy, just a preference.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and just take a look at your eyes and neurological function. Do you mind if I do that now?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm used to folks lookin' at my hands all day, haha! And I trust your professional opinion. Do what you need to do. I'm ready when you are. Just tell me if it's gonna be uncomfortable, alright? Old bones aren’t as forgiving as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm… good. 160 over 90. A bit elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Pupils are equal and reactive to light… some mild age-related changes in the lenses, as expected. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Reflexes are normal, balance is slightly unsteady but within normal limits for your age. Alright. Everything seems relatively normal, but your blood pressure is definitely something we need to address.
PATIENT: Well now, that doesn't sound too good, does it? High blood pressure, you say? Just like old times, I suppose. I should probably get back on those pills, shouldn’t I? My wife will be glad to hear I finally came in. She’s been naggin’ me about it for months. What do you recommend, Doctor? Do you think it’s somethin’ serious? And could this headache be related to the blood pressure, do you think?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, and yes, it could absolutely be contributing to your headaches. It's not an emergency at this moment, but it is something we need to manage to prevent further complications. And given your age and past history, it's important to be proactive. We'll need to start you on medication again, likely a low dose to begin with. I'm going to order some blood work and a urine test just to get a better overall picture of your health, and to rule out any other potential causes for your headaches. I also recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you're responding to the medication and to discuss the results of your tests. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work and tests… good idea to be thorough. And medication… well, I'm not thrilled about it, but if it helps my blood pressure and gets rid of this headache, I suppose I can't complain. Two weeks for a follow-up… that’s alright. Will I need to make an appointment, or will the nurse call me? And what about this headache in the meantime? Is there anything I can do to ease the pain while I’m waitin’ for the medication to kick in? A little liniment for my head, perhaps? Haha.
DOCTOR: The nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. As for your headache, I wouldn’t recommend liniment for your head. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help in the meantime, but don't exceed the recommended dosage. Stay hydrated, get enough rest, and try to manage your stress. I’m also going to write a prescription for a low dose of Lisinopril. It’s an ACE inhibitor commonly used for high blood pressure. You can start taking it tonight. Here’s the prescription. Take it as directed, and let the nurse know if you experience any side effects, such as dizziness or a persistent cough. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, you say? I'll ask my wife to read up on it, she’s the medical expert in the family, haha. Acetaminophen… that’s Tylenol, right? Yes, I think we have some of that at home. And I’ll try to stay hydrated and get some rest, though it's hard when I’m busy with work. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old man’s woes. Hopefully, this medication will do the trick. I suppose I’ll be seein’ you in two weeks, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll see you in two weeks. And remember, if you experience any concerning symptoms before then, don’t hesitate to call the office. Take care, Mr. Popova, and try to relax. The nurse will escort you to the checkout desk. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
