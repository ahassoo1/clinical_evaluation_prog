DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Sucich, is it?
PATIENT: That’s right, dear. Mirriam Sucich. Though most folks just call me Mirriam. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Sink, is it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sink. Dr. Sink. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re 86, if I’m reading this correctly. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… goodness, I don’t know exactly. A few days now, at least. Just keep coming and going. It’s a bit of a bother, really. Not painful, just… persistent. Like a little jump inside me every so often.
DOCTOR: Hiccups. Right. And have you tried… anything for them?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens yes! All sorts of things. Holding my breath, of course. Drinking water upside down – made a mess, that did! My grandson told me to eat a spoonful of sugar, but that didn’t do a thing except give me a bit of a sweet tooth for a while. I’ve really been trying everything I can think of.
DOCTOR: And… is there anything else going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’m aware of. My appetite’s been a little off, maybe? But that happens, you know, at my age. I sleep alright, though. And I’ve been keeping up with my walks – not as long as I used to, but still getting out there most days. Oh! And my knees… they ache a bit in the mornings, but that’s nothing new either. Really, it’s just these hiccups that are bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any nausea?
PATIENT: Nausea? Oh, no, dear, not at all. Just the hiccups. No feeling sick, no throwing up, nothing like that. Just… hic …this! See? It comes on without any warning.
DOCTOR: And you’re taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just the one, dear. For my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Been on it for years, though. Same dose, no changes. And I take it every morning, like clockwork.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, foods, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything – though I try to watch the salt, you know, with the blood pressure. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick listen to your lungs. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, dear. I'm happy to do whatever helps.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. No obvious signs of congestion. Blood pressure is… acceptable, given your age and medication. Now, are you having any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: No trouble swallowing at all, dear. I enjoy my food too much to have trouble with that! I can eat a full meal without a problem. Soups, stews, everything. No choking, no difficulty… nothing like that. It’s really just these pesky hiccups.
DOCTOR: Any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, no. I’ve been eating pretty much the same things for the past few weeks. My grandson brought me some mangoes last week, which was lovely, but I’ve been eating mangoes for years. Nothing new that I can think of, no. Just the usual, healthy things.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s… likely just a benign irritation of the diaphragm. Sometimes these things happen. I’ll prescribe you something to try. It won’t necessarily fix it, but it may offer some relief.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… complicated. The diaphragm? Is that serious? And what will this… prescription do? I just want to be able to enjoy my tea without hic …this happening every few minutes.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not serious. It’s a muscle. It spasms. The medication is Baclofen, a muscle relaxant. It's a low dose. Try it for a week. If it doesn’t help, we can… discuss other options. But honestly, these things often resolve on their own.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Baclofen, you say? A muscle relaxant… And how often do I take it? And are there any side effects I should be aware of? I don't want to feel all drowsy, you know. I like to be alert for my grandson's visits.
DOCTOR: The instructions are on the slip. Usual side effects are drowsiness, dizziness. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you feel affected. And if it doesn’t help, call the office. Next!
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, dear. So, just… try it for a week, and see what happens. Well, I suppose that's all I can do. Thank you again, Doctor. .
