DOCTOR: Right. Candice Engelhaupt, 79 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s… a social visit, I believe. My husband and I just moved here, you see. New area. Medicare required it, something about establishing care. Honestly, all this paperwork… it’s terribly confusing. I don’t feel ill, if that’s what you’re asking. Just trying to get it over with, really.
DOCTOR: Right. A “social visit” for Medicare. Yes, I see. Well, even if you feel perfectly fine, it’s still important to go through a basic check-up to establish a baseline. We need to know what "normal" is for you before anything else happens. It makes things easier later on, should something actually come up. So, let’s start with a little history. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Regularly? Not… particularly. My health has been quite stable, you see. Always been rather… robust. A bit of this and that, naturally, at my age, but nothing a good lie-down and a cup of tea couldn't fix. I suppose I had a doctor back home, but it was years ago. Honestly, I can’t recall his name. Such a blur, all of it. Is this terribly important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mrs. Engelhaupt. Even if you feel robust, a lack of recent medical history makes things… difficult. We need to know if there's anything lurking in the background. Alright. Let's try this. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness gracious. Significant… well, I had a touch of… the arthritis, I suppose, years ago. But it wasn't serious. Just a bit of stiffness in the joints. And… I think my husband mentioned something about my blood pressure being a little high once, but it went right down with a change in diet. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those sorts of things. My husband handles all that. Is it absolutely necessary to recall every little ache and pain?
DOCTOR: It’s not about every ache and pain, Mrs. Engelhaupt. It’s about identifying potential issues. “A touch of arthritis” and “a little high blood pressure” are still relevant. Do you know when you were told about the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, really, I haven't the foggiest. Years ago, I’m sure. Perhaps… ten years? Fifteen? It was before we moved to Florida, definitely. Honestly, all the dates just… run together. My husband kept all the records. He was very organized. He’s… not here at the moment. It’s rather difficult to recall specifics. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, without a timeframe or records, it makes things… challenging. Let’s move on. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Oh, let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. That was… ages ago. And… I think I had a small growth removed from my arm once, but it was very minor. Just a little bump. Nothing serious at all. Honestly, I don’t recall the details. It was… a long time ago, and I was quite young. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It is, Mrs. Engelhaupt. It’s important to have a complete picture. Alright. Family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. They passed away… a very long time ago. My mother… she had a weak heart, I believe. And my father… he had something with his lungs, but I don’t recall the specifics. Honestly, it was so long ago, and I wasn’t terribly close to either of them. They weren’t… very communicative people. Is this really going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Engelhaupt, I understand this is… tedious for you. However, establishing a baseline health history is crucial. It helps us understand your risk factors and provide appropriate care. Now, let’s try this. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit, if you ask me. My husband smoked, briefly, when he was younger, but he gave it up years ago. A very sensible man, my husband. Honestly, I’m not sure why I’m even here. This is all rather… pointless, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is not pointless, Mrs. Engelhaupt. We are trying to gather information. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, occasionally. A small glass of sherry with dinner, perhaps. Very rarely. Mostly on special occasions. My husband enjoys a brandy, but he's… not here at the moment, as I mentioned. Honestly, I don't see what this has to do with anything. I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: It’s about assessing your overall lifestyle, Mrs. Engelhaupt. Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a good question. I don’t think so. But honestly, I haven’t taken many medications in my life. Just a little something for my arthritis, years ago. And perhaps a pain reliever for a headache now and then. I can’t recall the names of anything. My husband always handled the medications. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, this is… difficult. Let's move on to a brief physical exam, then. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Please sit back.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Another examination? Honestly, I feel quite alright as I am. Is this absolutely necessary? I haven't the energy for all of this.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Engelhaupt, with all due respect, it is necessary. It’s standard procedure when establishing care with a new patient, even one who claims to be in perfect health. It takes five minutes. Please, sit on the examination table. We can proceed from there. It would be immensely helpful if you would cooperate.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Honestly, the fuss and bother. Get it over with, then. But don't expect me to remember any of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, please. And exhale slowly. Deep breath… and exhale. Blood pressure is… elevated. 160 over 95. That's higher than it should be. And… your heart rate is a little irregular. I'm going to listen again.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Is that bad? Honestly, I don't feel a thing. My husband always said my heart was strong. He knew everything. Perhaps it's just the excitement of moving. All this fuss and bother… it's enough to raise anyone's blood pressure.
DOCTOR: It’s not ideal, Mrs. Engelhaupt. An irregular heartbeat and elevated blood pressure require further investigation. I'm going to order some blood work and an EKG to get a clearer picture of what's going on. We’ll also need to discuss potential lifestyle changes and, potentially, medication. But first, we need those tests. Do you have any difficulty breathing, chest pain, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I breathe just fine, thank you very much. No chest pain, no dizziness. Just… a bit tired, perhaps. All this moving and the endless paperwork… it's exhausting. Honestly, I don't understand why all this is necessary. My husband always said I was perfectly healthy. He was a very sensible man.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Engelhaupt, with all due respect, I understand you relied heavily on your husband’s assessment of your health. However, I am the physician here, and my responsibility is to ensure you receive appropriate care. The tests will help us rule out any underlying conditions causing the irregular heartbeat and elevated blood pressure. I'm going to have the nurse draw some blood and schedule you for an EKG. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low dose of medication to help control your blood pressure. It’s important to start this medication even before we have the full results. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness gracious. I truly haven't the slightest idea. As I said before, I haven't taken many medications in my life. Perhaps… a reaction to something when I was a child, but I can't recall what it was. My husband always handled all of that. Honestly, this is all so overwhelming. Is there anything I can do to make this process easier?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. In the absence of any known allergies, I’m going to prescribe a low dose of Lisinopril. It’s a common blood pressure medication. The nurse will explain the dosage and potential side effects. It’s crucial you take this medication as prescribed and follow up with me in two weeks for a repeat blood pressure check. The lab results should be back by then as well. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… Lisinopril. Very well. Two weeks, you say? And follow up with you? Honestly, I don’t even know where I am half the time. I suppose I’ll try to remember. But don’t expect miracles. This is all so… confusing. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you may go now. The nurse will escort you to the lab for your blood work and schedule your EKG. She’ll also provide you with detailed instructions. Please, take care of yourself, Mrs. Engelhaupt. And try to remember to take the medication. It’s important.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Thank you, I suppose. Good day.
