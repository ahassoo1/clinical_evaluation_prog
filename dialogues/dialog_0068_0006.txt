DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a little embarrassing to talk about, but I have been coughing up some blood. It happened a few times now. Not a lot, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood… right. And this has occurred a few times now, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Maybe… four or five times in the last week? It is always with a regular cough, not… a bad one. And it is not a huge amount, like in a movie. Just… streaks. It worries me because… well, it’s blood.
DOCTOR: Streaks of blood with a regular cough…Okay. And can you tell me, Ms. Weichers, roughly how much would you say each time?
PATIENT: That is… difficult to say, Doctor. Maybe… a teaspoon? Less than a tablespoon, for sure. It’s hard to measure when you are… coughing! I try not to panic and look at it too closely. It just makes me more scared.
DOCTOR: Understandable. A teaspoon… okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of. My life is… quite quiet, Doctor. I work, I come home, I take care of my garden. I lost my husband two years ago, so it’s just me now. No new travel, no new… hobbies. I haven’t been sick with a cold or anything, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, Ms. Weichers, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else that I have noticed. No fever, no pain in my chest, no… shortness of breath. I feel a little tired, but that is normal for me. I am still grieving, you see. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Weichers. I’m sorry for your loss. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and check a few things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here, and I'll listen to your lungs with the stethoscope. Then I'll just take your blood pressure and check your pulse.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will try to be very still.
DOCTOR: Deep breath… and again… Okay. Your lungs sound… clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can hear right now. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Pulse is 72 and regular. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That does not hurt. It feels… normal. I do not feel any pain at all. Is something wrong? I am worrying now.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively, Ms. Weichers. Your exam doesn't reveal anything immediately concerning, but coughing up blood, even a small amount, warrants further investigation. Just to be safe, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. The X-ray will help us visualize your lungs, and the blood count will give us a better understanding of your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it will help figure out what is happening, then yes, please. An X-ray and blood test. Will it take long to get the results?
DOCTOR: The lab should be able to get the blood work done fairly quickly, results usually within a few hours. The X-ray… depends on the facility’s workload, but typically within 24-48 hours. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you cough up a significant amount of blood, or develop any chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That… that all makes sense. I understand. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. 24 to 48 hours for the X-ray, and I will go to the emergency room if anything changes. I… I think that is everything. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I'll have the nurse draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Try to stay calm, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Bye bye to you too. .
