DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, my. It’s…it’s these pains. Down low, in my abdomen. They come and go, but when they do come…well, they’re quite something. It’s been happening for a little while now, I believe. Though, truthfully, keeping track of time…it’s not always easy. I do know it’s related to…the lupus, I think? The other doctors have mentioned it.
DOCTOR: Lupus, yes. It’s good you’ve already had some discussion about it. “Down low,” you say… can you be more specific about the location of the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific…that's difficult. It feels…all around, really. Lower belly, I suppose. And sometimes it radiates…down my legs, a little? It’s not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a…a heavy ache. And it’s…uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable, at times. I wish I could be more precise. It just…comes and goes.
DOCTOR: “All around” isn’t particularly helpful, Ms. Glymph. Is it constant, or does it come in waves?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I apologize. It’s not constant, no. It definitely comes in waves. Like…cramps, perhaps? Though I’ve never had a child, so I wouldn’t know for certain. It’ll be quite mild for a day or two, and then…suddenly, it’s much worse. It seems to come on without warning. Then it fades again. Is that…more helpful? I try to remember what triggers it, but…it eludes me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when these “waves” occur, do you notice anything else happening at the same time?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. Sometimes…I feel quite tired. Much more so than usual. And…a little nauseous, perhaps. Not enough to…well, to be sick, but a queasy feeling. And my…bowels. They act up a bit. Either…too much, or not enough, if you understand. It’s all rather unpleasant. It’s hard to pinpoint a pattern, you see. Everything feels so…disconnected.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this been happening for a long period of time, or is it a recent development?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's…difficult to say precisely. I believe it's been worsening over the past few months, certainly. But…the lupus itself has had its ups and downs for years, you see. So it’s hard to distinguish what’s new and what’s just…part of the usual course. Perhaps six months? Or has it been longer? I truly cannot recall.
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, it's important for me to get a clear timeline. Six months is significantly different than, say, a year or more. Do you have any family who might be able to offer some insight into when these symptoms began?
PATIENT: Oh, my. You're quite right, Doctor. I do apologize for my…vagueness. A timeline…yes, that is important. Family…well, no. I don’t have any close family nearby. I’ve been…rather independent for a long time. I haven’t spoken to anyone regularly in…years, I’m afraid. Perhaps a distant cousin, but I haven’t seen her since I was a child. She wouldn’t remember anything about my health, I assure you. I really wish I could be more help with this.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll work with what we have. Let’s move on to your past medical history. You mentioned lupus, obviously. Are you currently seeing any other specialists for it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Dr. Aris Thorne, a rheumatologist. He's been managing my lupus for…well, a long time now. I see him every…six months, I believe. Or is it four? It varies, depending on how I’m feeling. And…Dr. Chen, a nephrologist. She monitors my kidneys, as lupus can sometimes affect them. I see her…less frequently. Perhaps once a year? It’s all a bit…hazy. I do take medication, of course. A few different things. I…I have a list somewhere, if that would be helpful?
DOCTOR: A list would be extremely helpful, Ms. Glymph. Please. Do you recall what those medications are for, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me see… There’s… hydroxychloroquine, I believe. Dr. Thorne prescribed that. He said it helps with the…inflammation. And…a blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And…a vitamin D supplement. My levels were low, apparently. Oh, and…sometimes I take a pain reliever. Ibuprofen, when things get particularly bad. I…I apologize. I should be more organized. I really should write these things down. It’s just…everything gets so muddled.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Allergies…Let me think carefully. No, I don't believe so. I've never had a particularly strong reaction to anything, thankfully. I recall a slight rash once, many years ago, but it wasn’t serious. It went away on its own. No, I don't have any known allergies. I'm generally…quite resilient, I suppose. Although, this pain…that's certainly something new.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your abdomen, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds…perfectly acceptable. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment completely. I just…hope it doesn’t take too long. I have…a small appointment later this afternoon. Though, it’s not terribly important.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't. Just lie on your back, and I’ll begin. Now, tell me if you feel any tenderness in any specific areas. And please, be honest. I’m checking for any masses or areas of discomfort.
PATIENT: Ooh… Yes, that’s…tender. Right…there. Not terribly painful, just…uncomfortable. And…a little bit here too. It's…difficult to pinpoint exactly. It feels…diffuse. Like a general ache, rather than a sharp pain. And…when you press…it feels…tight. Like there’s…something there. Is that…normal?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "normal," Ms. Glymph, but it’s not immediately alarming. There is some tenderness in your lower abdomen, as you pointed out, and some slight guarding. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. They’re…present, but a little quiet. Your heart rate is normal, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 130/80. Given your history of lupus, and the symptoms you're describing, this could be a flare-up. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. I also want to get a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis.
PATIENT: A CT scan…Oh. That sounds…serious. But I understand. It's best to be thorough. And blood work…yes, of course. Anything you need. A flare-up…that would explain a lot. Though, I haven't experienced anything quite like this before. How long will it take to get the results? And…will the CT scan require any special preparation? I really do appreciate you taking the time to investigate this, Doctor. I haven't been feeling myself lately.
DOCTOR: The blood work should be available within 24-48 hours. The CT scan will require you to drink a contrast dye, so it's important to stay hydrated beforehand. You'll receive detailed instructions from the radiology department when they schedule your appointment. As for the “special preparation,” you will need to fast for four hours before the scan. And inform the technician if you have any allergies, especially to iodine. We’ll review the results together once they’re available. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever – ibuprofen 600mg three times a day as needed. Continue taking your other medications as prescribed. If your pain becomes unbearable, or you develop a fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen…yes, I’m already taking that, occasionally. Four hours fasting…and no iodine allergies. I understand. Emergency room…Yes, I understand. Pain, fever, chills… I will keep a close eye on things. Will the CT scan…will it show everything? Will it tell us what’s causing the pain? I just…I'm worried it's something serious. It's silly, I know. But I can’t help but worry.
DOCTOR: The CT scan will provide a detailed image of your abdomen and pelvis, allowing us to assess your organs and identify any abnormalities. However, it’s not always definitive. It may reveal inflammation, masses, or other issues, but it won’t necessarily tell us the exact cause of your pain. Further testing may be required. Frankly, Ms. Glymph, anxiety won’t help. We're ruling things out. Lupus can cause a wide range of symptoms, and this could very well be a flare-up. But we need to be thorough. I'm going to have the nurse print out the lab orders and schedule the CT scan for you. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I…I think that’s all. The nurse will explain everything about the scan and the blood work? Yes. Thank you for your time, and for…being thorough. I appreciate it. I…I’ll try not to worry. It's just…difficult sometimes. Knowing something is wrong, but not knowing what. But I understand. We'll do the tests, and we'll find out.
