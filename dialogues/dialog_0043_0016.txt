DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… it’s my patient, Mrs. Gable. She’s been on that blood thinner, you know, the one for her heart… and she’s bruising. A lot. It's… concerning. Frankly, she shouldn't be bruising this much. I’ve been a pathologist for thirty years, Doctor, I usually have a good handle on these things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. It’s certainly wise to seek further evaluation when you observe something unexpected, especially with a medication like a blood thinner. And thirty years of experience is invaluable – I appreciate your diligence. Just to clarify, you are a pathologist and are bringing your patient, Mrs. Gable, in for evaluation of excessive bruising related to her blood thinner medication?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. I am her pathologist, and she is the patient. It's just… she insisted I bring her in. Said she wanted a “second opinion.” Honestly, it's a waste of both our time, but… she has money. And you know how those patients are.
DOCTOR: I see. While I appreciate your perspective, Mr. Farson, I believe every patient is entitled to a thorough evaluation and the peace of mind that comes with it. We will, of course, give Mrs. Gable our full attention. Could you tell me more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, it's everywhere. Arms, legs… she bumped into a chair yesterday and practically exploded with purple. It's not normal, Doctor. Not for a stable dose. She’s been on warfarin for… well, a long time. At least a year, maybe more. I haven’t been keeping strict track of her medications personally, you understand. That’s her primary care’s job. But the bruising… it’s just… unsightly. And concerning, I maintain.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Exploded with purple” is a very descriptive way to put it, and certainly raises a flag. You mentioned she's been on warfarin for at least a year. Has there been any recent change in her warfarin dosage?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I don’t handle the adjustments, you see. Her primary care physician manages that. I just… analyze the samples. Blood work, you know. I haven’t seen any dramatic changes in her INR levels recently, but… truthfully, it's been a few weeks since I last checked. I mostly look for the big things. Has she started any new medications lately? I wouldn't know. She doesn't usually tell me about that.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Farson. It sounds like obtaining a detailed medication list and recent INR values from her primary care physician will be crucial. Let’s focus on Mrs. Gable herself for a moment. Besides the bruising, has she experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, she complains, of course. Old people always complain. Mostly aches and pains. Said she felt a little dizzy the other day, but she’s prone to exaggeration. Honestly, Doctor, she’s a hypochondriac. But… no, nothing major. No bleeding, no nosebleeds, no… unusual anything. Just the bruising. And the complaining. It’s really quite tiresome, if I'm being frank.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to have that context. While we don't want to dismiss her concerns, it’s important to gather all the information. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination of Mrs. Gable. Just to assess the extent of the bruising and look for any other potential signs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Really? Doctor, with all due respect, I’m a pathologist. I examine things under a microscope. I don’t do physicals. And frankly, she’s rather… sensitive about being touched. It’s unnecessary. If you must, but I foresee complications. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Farson, and I appreciate your expertise as a pathologist. However, a physical exam is a standard part of a medical evaluation, even when a patient has undergone extensive laboratory testing. It allows me to correlate the clinical findings with the lab results and make the most accurate assessment. I assure you, I will be gentle and respectful throughout the examination. I will also explain everything I am doing beforehand. If Mrs. Gable expresses discomfort or wishes to stop at any point, we will immediately stop. I will document the extent and location of the bruising, check her vital signs, and listen to her heart and lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you must. But don't be surprised if she protests. And please, be quick about it. I have other patients waiting. And I really don't see what good it will do. It’s all in the blood work, Doctor. It always is. Just… try not to bother her too much. She gets… agitated easily. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Farson. I will be as efficient and considerate as possible. Thank you for your patience. Could you please bring Mrs. Gable in when she’s ready?
