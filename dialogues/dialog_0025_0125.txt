DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. So, you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. I, uh, wanted to get tested for HIV. Just… wanted to get it checked, you know? Better safe than sorry, I always say. Though, honestly, I doubt it’ll be anything. I’m a pretty careful guy.
DOCTOR: “Careful” is good, I suppose. Still, regular testing is responsible. Okay. Have you ever been tested before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is… a first for me. Honestly, I always figured if I needed a test, something would be… obvious. You know? Not just coming in for a check-up.
DOCTOR: That's... a common misconception. Often, there aren't obvious symptoms, especially early on. That’s why proactive testing is important. Alright. Have you had any recent… risky behaviors?
PATIENT: Risky behaviors? What do you mean by that? Look, I’m married. Been with my wife for… ten years now. Very happily, I might add. So no. No risky behaviors. I mean, unless you count trying new recipes – sometimes they don’t turn out so well.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "risky behaviors" encompasses more than just… marital activity. Any unprotected sexual contact with anyone ever?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… before my wife, yeah. A few things. Back in my early twenties. But that was ages ago. Seriously, like… fifteen years ago. And it was just…casual. Nothing serious. We always… used protection. Usually. Look, I was young and stupid, okay? It’s not like I was deliberately trying to be reckless. It was a different time.
DOCTOR: "Usually" isn’t very reassuring, Mr. Belan. And fifteen years is… not irrelevant. It's good you're finally getting this done. We'll proceed with the testing. It’s a standard blood draw. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials we might use?
PATIENT: No latex allergies, no. I'm pretty tough, really. I work in compliance, you gotta be able to handle anything. Though, I did once have a bad reaction to a certain kind of disinfectant... made my skin all itchy. But nothing serious. Just… annoying. Is this going to hurt much? I’m not a fan of needles, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A little pinch. You handle compliance, you can handle a small needle prick. It’s standard procedure. I’ll need to draw two vials of blood – one for the initial screening, and another for confirmation if the first one is positive. And we’ll also run a complete blood count while we're at it. Good to have a baseline, you know. Let's get this over with. Nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: Baseline, right. Always good to have a baseline. Fine. Just… try to be quick, okay? I’ve got things to do. Important things. And honestly, I don't understand why two vials. Is the first one not enough? Seems a bit… excessive.
DOCTOR: It's protocol, Mr. Belan. HIV tests have evolved, but confirmation is crucial to avoid false positives and unnecessary anxiety. We don't rely on a single result. Think of it as… thoroughness. It’s a standard procedure, and frankly, questioning it isn’t productive. Nurse Ramirez will explain the process when she comes in. I’ll be back to discuss the results once they are available – usually takes a few days.
PATIENT: A few days?! A few days? That seems… a long time. Can’t you speed it up? I’ve got responsibilities. And frankly, the waiting will just be…stressful. It’s not like I’m going around exposing anyone. It's just a precaution, you said yourself. Is there anything you can do to get it done faster?
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand you're anxious. However, lab processing times are not within my control. Accuracy is paramount, and that takes time. We are not a rapid testing facility, and I will not compromise quality for expediency. It’s a few days. It's not the end of the world. If you're that concerned, perhaps you should have considered this sooner. Nurse Ramirez will be in momentarily. We'll proceed with the draw now.
PATIENT: Okay, okay! Fine! Do whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, alright? And honestly, the attitude is a bit much. I'm the patient here, you’d think a little bit of…courtesy would be standard procedure. Just… get it over with. I’m ready. Or as ready as I’ll ever be. .
DOCTOR: Nurse Ramirez will be with you shortly.
