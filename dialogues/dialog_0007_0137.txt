DOCTOR: Hi Lindra, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Valerie Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is good to meet you too. My husband, he say I need... paper for the place. The senior place? He do all the talking, usually. I just... come with him. He say for make sure I am okay to go there.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. So, it sounds like your husband is helping you get settled into a senior living community and they requested a check-up to make sure you're healthy enough to move in?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That is right. He worry so much. I am okay, Doctor. I feel... old, but okay. Just a little slow sometimes, you know? My memory... not so good as before. But I can still make coffee! I am very good bartender, for many years.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! Making coffee and being a good bartender – those are important skills! It's completely normal for things to slow down a bit as we get older, and memory changes are common too. We'll just do a quick check-up to get a good picture of your overall health. It sounds like you’re still very capable. Let’s start with a little bit about your medical history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor for a while now?
PATIENT: Yes, I have doctor. But... he retire last year. Doctor Ramirez. Very nice man. I see him... many years. Now, I go to... the clinic near the market. Sometimes. My husband take me. I forget the doctor’s name... the new one.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. It can be a little disruptive when doctors retire or you switch to a new practice. Don’t worry about remembering the new doctor's name right now. We can look that up later if needed. Do you have any major health problems that you know of – like problems with your heart, lungs, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. My blood pressure, sometimes high. Doctor Ramirez, he give me a little white pill for that. I take it every morning. And... my knees. They hurt when it rains. Or when I walk too much. Other than that… I think I am okay. I eat my vegetables! My husband make sure of that.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear! High blood pressure is very common, and it's good you're taking care of it. And achy knees are also common as we get older. Just to be thorough, can you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don't think so. Never had any trouble with food. Or... medicine. I take the blood pressure pill every day, like I said. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I take... the white one. I forget the name. But no... no allergies. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. That’s helpful. And you said you take a white pill for your blood pressure and another white pill for headaches?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. The blood pressure one, I take every morning with my coffee. And the headache one… only when my head hurt. My husband, he keep them for me. He know what I need before I do!
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a wonderful husband! Okay, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I just want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need. My husband say I need to listen to you. He worry so much about everything. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, a little bit of a murmur, but that's not uncommon with age. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not unexpected. And your pulse is 72, regular. Finally, let’s take a look at those knees. Can you bend them for me, gently, and let me know where it hurts?
PATIENT: Okay. Here. Right here, on both sides. It's worse when it's cold. And when I walk too much. Like when I go to the market with my husband. He always carry the bags, though! He say I need to save my knees.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some mild tenderness on the front of both knees. There's some crepitus, which is a bit of a grinding sensation – that's also common with age and wear and tear. No significant swelling or redness. Alright, Lindra. Everything seems pretty stable. Your heart and lungs sound good, your blood pressure is a little high but within a reasonable range, and your knees show some typical signs of wear and tear. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. You check everything very good. Is just... my husband worry. He always worry. He want me to be strong for the senior place. He say they do a lot of activities.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear he’s thinking ahead and wants you to be comfortable. It sounds like the senior living community will be a good fit if you're up for activities. Just to be thorough, and since your husband is concerned, I think it would be a good idea to do some basic bloodwork to check your kidney function, thyroid, and vitamin levels. It will give us a better baseline and make sure there aren't any underlying issues contributing to any fatigue or weakness you might be experiencing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? Oh. I don't like needles, Doctor. But... if my husband think is good... then okay. He always know best. Is just... it make me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Needles aren't fun for anyone! We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. It's just a small amount of blood taken from your arm. The lab technician is very good and will explain everything beforehand. It will help us make sure you’re in the best shape possible for starting at the senior living community and address any potential concerns. Do you have any questions about the bloodwork itself?
PATIENT: No... I think is okay. Just... quick, you say? And not too deep? My husband, he come with me for the bloodwork? He worry if I get faint.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We'll make it as quick and painless as possible. The technician is very skilled and will only take what's needed. And yes, your husband is more than welcome to come with you for the bloodwork. Having him there will be great support, and it's always good to have someone with you, especially if you're feeling anxious. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning at the lab just down the street from the clinic. Does that work for you and your husband?
PATIENT: Tomorrow is good. Yes. My husband, he can take me. He always drive. He say I should not worry about driving. Is good. Schedule it for tomorrow, please. And... tell the technician to be very gentle?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll make a note in your chart requesting a gentle touch from the technician. I'll also include your husband’s name so they know he’ll be accompanying you. Okay, Lindra, that’s all set. Bloodwork tomorrow morning. We’ll call you with the results in a few days. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think is all. Thank you for checking me. And thank you for being so nice. My husband will be very happy.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindra. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’m glad I could help ease your husband’s worries and give you a clean bill of health. Have a wonderful day, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. It was lovely meeting you both.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Come on, husband. Let's go home. He is waiting.
