DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Tosca. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking lately about… trying to be more present, I guess. I heard good things about mindfulness and meditation, and I was hoping to learn a bit more about it, maybe see if it's something that could help me. I'm Liza, by the way.
DOCTOR: It’s good to meet you too, Liza. That’s a great question, and a very valid reason to come in. Many people are interested in exploring mindfulness and meditation these days. It’s wonderful you’re proactive about your well-being. Just to clarify, when you say "more present," could you tell me a little more about what that means for you?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. It’s hard to explain perfectly. I feel like my mind is often… somewhere else. Thinking about things that happened, or worrying about things that might happen. It makes it hard to really enjoy the now, you know? Like, I was walking in the park yesterday, a beautiful day, and I was already planning my grocery list! It just feels… disconnected, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That sounds frustrating – to be missing out on enjoyable moments because your mind is elsewhere. It’s very common, actually. So, it sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with focus and being fully engaged in the present moment. Has this been going on for a long time, or is it more recent?
PATIENT: Oh, it's definitely not new. It's been… well, probably most of my adult life, to be honest. It comes and goes, but it's always there, lurking in the background. I just figured it was… me. But lately, it’s been more noticeable, and I thought maybe there was something I could do about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. It’s good you’re recognizing it and wanting to address it. It’s definitely not just “you,” and there are many strategies we can explore. Before we talk about specific techniques, I’d like to ask a few more questions to get a fuller picture. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this difficulty focusing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Not really, not that I've noticed. I sleep okay, eat reasonably well. Sometimes I feel a bit… restless, I suppose. Like I need to be doing something, even when I don’t really need to be. But I wouldn’t call it anxiety, exactly. Just… fidgety, sometimes. And maybe a little bit forgetful, but honestly, who isn’t at my age?
DOCTOR: That’s fair! It’s common for memory to shift as we age. Okay, so restless and occasionally forgetful, but nothing that significantly impacts your daily life. And you sleep and eat well, which is great. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was…oh, goodness, 2005 maybe? Other than that, just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older. I'm on Medicare, if that helps. No major health issues, thankfully. I see my primary care doctor regularly for check-ups, and everything is always… fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in 2005, and otherwise regular check-ups with your primary care physician. That’s good to know. Medicare is helpful information, thank you. I see a few notes here from your primary care doctor, all within normal limits. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. And sometimes ibuprofen for my knees, if they're bothering me. Nothing regular, just when I need it. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible, honestly. I prefer a cup of tea!
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. That's good to know. I appreciate your preference for natural remedies. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had arthritis, I think. Both of them lived to be pretty old, though, into their eighties. No history of any major mental health issues, as far as I know. My brother is fine, as far as I can tell. We don't talk much anymore, unfortunately. But everyone on both sides of the family was pretty… stoic, if that makes sense. Not much talk about feelings.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of hypertension and arthritis in your parents, and no known history of significant mental health issues. And a family tendency towards… reserved emotional expression. That’s helpful information. Before we delve into potential strategies for mindfulness, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any underlying physical causes that could be contributing to your feelings. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I figured you’d want to do that. I always appreciate a thorough check-up.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your vital signs. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then we’ll do a quick neurological assessment. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal and balanced. No signs of any neurological deficits. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. This doesn't necessarily explain what you're experiencing, but it helps to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, I suppose. It’s reassuring that it’s not something… obvious. So, where do we go from here with the mindfulness then? I'm really curious to learn more about it, and if it might help me just… be more present, like I said.
DOCTOR: That’s great. Since the physical exam didn't reveal any immediate concerns, we can certainly explore mindfulness techniques. It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms that could potentially benefit from approaches like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or mindful movement. Based on what you’ve described, it doesn't sound like a major mental health condition is at play, but it’s also important to understand that these techniques aren’t a “quick fix.” It takes practice and consistency to see results. I can suggest a few resources to get you started, including guided meditation apps and local mindfulness classes. Would you be interested in learning about those?
PATIENT: Yes, please! That would be wonderful. I'm not very tech-savvy, to be honest, so something easy to use would be best. And local classes sound nice too, if there's anything nearby. I think having a group would be helpful, to keep me motivated.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. For apps, I often recommend “Headspace” and “Calm.” They both have beginner-friendly guided meditations, and you can start with very short sessions – even just five minutes a day. Headspace is known for its animations that explain the concepts, and Calm has a lot of relaxing soundscapes. I can print you out some information about both. As for local classes, let me see… There’s a mindfulness workshop at the community center starting next week, on Tuesdays. It’s geared towards beginners, and it’s a six-week course. I can give you the website address and phone number. Would you like me to also give you some handouts on the benefits of mindfulness and some simple breathing exercises you can try at home?
PATIENT: Oh, that's fantastic! Yes, please, handouts would be wonderful. Breathing exercises sound particularly good, something I can do right away. Thank you so much, Dr. Tosca. You've been very helpful. I feel much more optimistic about this now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. I'm glad I could help. Remember, consistency is key. Start small, be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to experiment to find what works best for you. I'll also make a note in your chart about our discussion and the resources we talked about. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve covered everything so well. I’m really looking forward to trying these things out. Thank you again for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if you have any questions or concerns as you begin practicing mindfulness. It’s often helpful to check in and discuss your progress. Here's my card with the clinic's contact information. Have a wonderful day, and I hope you find some peace and presence!
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Tosca. You too.
