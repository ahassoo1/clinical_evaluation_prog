DOCTOR: Right. Mr. AlCorta, yes. Well, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, Doctor… it’s my sight. It’s just… not what it used to be. It’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. Things aren’t as sharp as they once were, if you follow. And it’s been… gradual, I suppose. Not like a sudden thing.
DOCTOR: “Not sharp,” right. Gradual onset… how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s hard to pinpoint. Probably… six months, maybe longer? It's not something I actively noticed until things started becoming… inconvenient. Reading the newspaper, that sort of thing. Small print, you understand. I used to be able to read anything. It's probably just age, honestly. Though I do find that rather insulting at my age.
DOCTOR: Six months… and it’s affecting your daily activities now. Right. And you say small print is the primary issue?
PATIENT: Precisely. Small print, road signs at a distance… things like that. It's not a complete blackout, Doctor. I can still see, it’s just… diminished. And it’s… well, frustrating. I've always prided myself on my clarity, my attention to detail. It’s rather… unbecoming, to be struggling with something so basic.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me consider. No… not that I’ve noticed. No pain, no… floaters, or… spots. No double vision. Just… a lessening. A general fuzziness, perhaps. And truthfully, Doctor, a great deal of annoyance. It’s just… inconvenient, as I said. I don’t understand why things have to deteriorate with time. It seems terribly inefficient.
DOCTOR: No pain, no floaters, no double vision… Okay. And are you diabetic, Mr. AlCorta?
PATIENT: Diabetic? Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. I maintain a very… sensible diet. Mostly lean proteins and vegetables. Though I do enjoy a good biscuit with my coffee on occasion. But diabetic? No, Doctor, I assure you. My family has no history of such things.
DOCTOR: Right. Any family history of glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: Now you're asking things I haven’t the slightest idea about. Macular… what now? I’m afraid my family history isn't something I’ve ever… cataloged, if you will. I know my grandmother had cataracts, and my uncle had something with his eyes, but I haven’t the faintest idea what it was. It was a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a practical man, not a medical historian.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick visual acuity test, then. Just to get a baseline. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I suspect it won't be a pleasant experience. I can tell you now, my sight isn’t what it used to be. Lead on, Doctor. Let’s get this over with. I have a rather important meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Starting with the top line. Read me what you see, please. Just read the letters as you see them. Don’t strain.
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, this is… underwhelming. Let me see… It’s… blurry. Very blurry. I can make out shapes, but the letters themselves are… indistinct. Is this the best you have, Doctor? It's rather poorly lit, you know. I believe… I think that’s an F… no, a P? It’s incredibly difficult to say. I’m not accustomed to straining my eyes like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try this line. What can you read here?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is rather frustrating. They’re all just… smudges. I can detect there are letters there, but differentiating them is… impossible. I can perhaps make out a… V? Is that a V? I truly can’t be certain. This is a waste of time, if you ask me. I should have just gotten a new pair of reading glasses.
DOCTOR: Alright. And the next line?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I'm beginning to feel rather foolish. They're just… blobs. Indistinguishable shapes. I can't tell you a single letter. This is… deeply unsatisfactory. I pride myself on my intellect, you see. Being unable to perform such a simple task is… humiliating. I believe I've made my point. My sight is clearly deteriorating. What sort of solution do you propose?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, based on this… cursory examination, it seems you have significant vision loss. I’m not equipped to perform a full ophthalmic exam here, Mr. AlCorta. I recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive evaluation. They can determine the exact cause and recommend appropriate treatment. It could be anything, really. Cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration… it requires specialist investigation.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… helpful. Specialist investigation. Of course. More appointments, more waiting, more… inconvenience. Frankly, Doctor, I had hoped for a more definitive answer. A simple solution, perhaps. A stronger prescription, a different lens coating… something. Very well. A referral, then. Do you have any recommendations? And how long will that take? I have a rather busy schedule, you understand. I can’t simply drop everything to accommodate… blurry vision. .
DOCTOR: Dr. Evelyn Reed. She’s… competent. As for the wait time, that’s up to her office. I suggest you call them immediately. And frankly, Mr. AlCorta, delaying this will only make things worse. It’s a simple referral; I can’t control their scheduling. Is there anything else?
