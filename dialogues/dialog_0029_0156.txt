DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Chora. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not great. I’ve had diarrhea for a while now, and it just won’t stop. It’s been going on and off, but mostly on lately. Honestly, I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, diarrhea… and you said it’s been going on for a while, difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started. Can you describe what the diarrhea is like?
PATIENT: Um… how to describe it… it’s… watery, mostly. And a lot of it. I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot. Sometimes there’s… stuff in it, but not always. I haven’t really been paying attention, if that sounds bad. It just… happens. It’s just really tiring, having to keep running to the bathroom all the time.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound bad at all. It’s helpful to know it’s watery and frequent. And you’re right, being constantly in the bathroom is tiring. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in the stool at all?
PATIENT: Blood? I… I don’t think so. Maybe? It’s hard to say. I really haven’t been looking, to be honest. Mucus… maybe a little sometimes? Like, a clear, slimy thing? But I’m not sure if that's normal, or if I'm just imagining it. It’s been happening for so long, I kind of just… zone out when I go. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense. It's understandable you wouldn't be focusing on the details after a while. Okay. Besides the diarrhea, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been feeling really tired, like, more tired than usual. And a little bit of cramping in my stomach, but it comes and goes. Not awful pain, just… uncomfortable. I haven't really had much of an appetite either, but I just figured that was from… not feeling well. Oh! And I've been losing weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, intermittent cramping, decreased appetite, and some unintentional weight loss. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And I haven’t thrown up or felt nauseous, thankfully. Just… the constant bathroom trips and feeling generally awful. It's just really dragging me down. I'm married, you know, and it's hard to do things when you're stuck inside all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Um… I take a daily vitamin, that’s about it. And no allergies that I know of. I haven't had any reactions to anything. Oh! And I have Medicare, if that matters. I don’t really get sick often, so I haven’t had to deal with much medicine or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a daily vitamin, no known allergies, and you're covered by Medicare. Good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions?
PATIENT: That's a good question… Honestly, I can’t really remember. I think… when I was younger, a doctor said something about my stomach not working right? Something about… IBD or celiac? It was a long time ago, and my memory is really bad. I was told to watch what I eat, but I don't really remember all the details. I think my husband might know more about it. He usually handles all the doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. So a possible history of IBD or celiac disease, though details are unclear. We can certainly look into that further. Do you know if you've ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I mean, I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else that I can remember. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, until this. It's just frustrating, not knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant surgeries or hospitalizations besides tonsillectomy. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like digestive issues, autoimmune diseases, or anything else significant?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom had some stomach problems when she was older, but I don’t know what exactly. She just said it was a “sensitive stomach.” And my grandfather, on my dad’s side, had… something with his immune system? I think my husband mentioned it once. He’s better at remembering all that stuff. I wish I could be more helpful. I really don’t keep track of these things. It all just feels like a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of digestive issues in your mother and an autoimmune condition in your grandfather. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine at Christmas, and I definitely don’t do any drugs. I work in sales, mostly on the phone, so I try to stay healthy. It’s hard to do that when you're feeling sick though. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no drug use. Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I'll gently press on your stomach to check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I hope you can figure out what’s wrong. It’s just… been going on so long.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax and take some deep breaths. I'm listening for bowel sounds now. Bowel sounds are… hyperactive. And there's some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, mostly on your left side. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Okay. It doesn’t seem to be anything acutely serious, but the hyperactive bowel sounds and tenderness suggest some inflammation or irritation in your digestive tract. Now, I’d like to order a stool sample to rule out any infection and also check for inflammation. Also, given your possible history of IBD, I'm going to order a complete blood count and a celiac panel. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. A stool sample and blood tests… okay. I just want to know what’s causing all this. And I want it to stop. Will the blood tests tell us if it’s the IBD thing? Is that what you're checking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, the blood tests will help us look for signs of inflammation and rule out other potential causes. The celiac panel will specifically check for celiac disease, and the complete blood count can give us clues about overall inflammation levels and potential nutrient deficiencies. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend sticking to a bland diet—things like rice, toast, bananas, and applesauce—and staying well-hydrated. I’m also going to give you a prescription for an anti-diarrheal medication to help manage the symptoms while we wait for the results. It’s not a cure, but it should provide some relief. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… helpful. Bland diet, stay hydrated, anti-diarrheal… I can do that. Thank you, Dr. Chora. It’s nice to finally have a plan. I feel a little better just knowing what we're doing. Do I need to make another appointment to talk about the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, please schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today to discuss the results. The nurse will help you with that before you leave. We’ll go over everything in detail and decide on the next steps based on what the tests show. Here’s your prescription for the anti-diarrheal medication, and here’s the requisition form for the lab tests. The lab is located at [provides address]. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Chora. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s wrong soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re very welcome, Jase. I hope you feel better soon. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
