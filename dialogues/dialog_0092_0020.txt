DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is... is Giganti, yes? Nice to meet you too. Well, I am here for... the talking to the computer? My daughter, she make appointment for me. She say is... a check-up, but on the screen. I am not so good with computers, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, Giganti is correct. And yes, your daughter scheduled a comprehensive health assessment for you, which will involve some questions and a physical examination. Don't worry about the computer aspect; we'll take it one step at a time, and I'm here to help guide you through everything. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about why your daughter thought it would be good to have this check-up now?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, she worry. I am... how you say... getting older. And I feel a little tired, sometimes. Not always, but... more than before. Also, my back, it is not so good. Working with cars, it is hard work, you know? I am mechanic for many years. She say I should see doctor, make sure everything is okay. Is that... good enough answer?
DOCTOR: That is a very good answer, Ms. Benites. It’s always wise to be proactive about your health, and it's excellent that your daughter is looking out for you. Feeling tired and having back pain are certainly things we should investigate. So, let’s start with the tiredness. Could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm. Is... not like sick tired. Is more like... heavy. Like I have weights on my body. I sleep, maybe eight hours, but I still feel... slow. When I wake up, I need... long time to get going. And sometimes, in afternoon, I just want to sit. Not work, just… sit. Is that make sense? I used to be... more energy. I work all day, no problem. Now... not so much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Benites. It sounds like you're experiencing some fatigue that’s impacting your daily life. It's helpful to know it's not a sudden illness feeling, but more of a gradual onset. Now, you mentioned your back pain. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. Is... low back, mostly. When I bend over, it is... ouch. And when I lift something... even not so heavy... I feel it. Also, when I sit for long time, is not so good. I have chair in shop, but still. Sometimes, I wake up in morning, and is... stiff. I try to stretch, is help little, but not much. Is not always bad, but... almost every day, something. I put cream on, sometimes, the blue kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you're having fairly consistent low back pain, that’s worse with certain activities, and somewhat relieved with stretching and the topical cream. Do you experience any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiating? You mean... going down? No. Not really. Sometimes, a little… feeling in my hip, but not down my legs. Mostly just in my back, low part. And sometimes, when I twist, is… sharp pain, for a moment. Then is gone. But I don't like that feeling, you understand? Is... scary.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Benites. Sharp pain is certainly concerning, and it's good you're paying attention to that. No pain down your legs is good to know. Let's move on to a few other questions, just to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Weight? Hmm. I think… maybe a little. Not much. I not weigh myself very often. My daughter, she sometimes say I should. But I eat… normal, I think. Maybe a little more sweets than before, but not much. I like cookies. Is bad? I try to not eat too many, but... sometimes. I not sick, so I don’t worry too much about weight.
DOCTOR: It's fine to enjoy cookies, Ms. Benites. We just want to be aware of any changes. Now, have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Not that I know. I not feel hot, no. Chills? No. Night sweats? I… maybe a little. Sometimes, I wake up, and my shirt is… damp. But I have warm blankets, so maybe that. I not feel sick, like cold or flu. Just… tired, and back pain. Is that make sense? I don’t want to worry you, Doctor. Is just… old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Benites, and you’re not worrying me at all. We're just gathering information. Occasional night sweats with warm blankets aren't necessarily cause for concern. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you’re aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My husband, he have high blood pressure, but I not. The doctor, many years ago, say I have… something with my stomach. Ulcer, maybe? I take pills for a while, then is okay. I not see doctor much after that. Just for check-ups. And… oh! My knee. I hurt my knee, many years ago, working on car. They fix it, but sometimes it is… achy. Is that important? I don't want to forget anything. Is hard to remember all these things.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Benites, and don't worry about forgetting – that’s perfectly normal. You mentioned a past history of a stomach ulcer and a knee injury. Do you remember what medication you took for the ulcer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don’t. It was… a long time ago. Little white pill, maybe? I remember taking it with food. My husband, he help me remember things. But he… he is gone now. I not good with names of pills, sorry. I just remember the doctor say take this, take that. Is not very helpful, I know. Is like… a blur. Many years.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Benites. It’s understandable that you wouldn’t remember the specific name after so many years. We'll make a note of the past history of a stomach ulcer treated with medication. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… no. I don't think so. Not that I remember. Maybe when I was little, for my tonsils, but I don't really remember. Is very long ago. Nothing big. I never have surgery on my back, or my knee. Just… the tonsils, maybe. I am not sure. I hope I not forget anything important, Doctor. Is hard to remember all these old things. I worry I not telling you everything you need to know.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Ms. Benites. It’s perfectly alright if things are a little hazy, and we're getting a good picture of your history. No known surgeries, other than possibly tonsillectomy as a child. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother, she have… something with her heart. Not sure what. She was sick for a long time. My father, he was healthy, I think. Never sick. My brother, he have high blood pressure, like my husband. And… my sister, she have… cancer, I think. Breast cancer, maybe? She is gone now. Is… sad to think about. Is hard to remember all the details. Everything is… blurry. I hope I not forgetting something important, Doctor. Is just… so much happened.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Benites. It's understandable that it's difficult to recall details. So, we have a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, and breast cancer. Now, let’s talk about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don’t like smoking. My husband, he used to smoke, but he stop many years ago. Is… bad for you, you know? Is good you ask. I always tell people, don't smoke. Is bad for your health. Is important to be healthy, you know? I try to eat good, and I walk sometimes. Is… good for me. I hope. I want to stay healthy for my grandchildren. Is important.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Benites. It’s great that you’ve never smoked and that you prioritize your health for your grandchildren. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes. Just… a little wine, with dinner. Not every night. Maybe… a glass, two glasses. Never much. I don’t like to get drunk. Just… relax. My husband, he like beer, but he is gone now. I don't drink much anymore, to be honest. Is not very good for you, you know? So, just sometimes, a little wine. Is that okay, Doctor? I hope I not doing something bad. I try to be careful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Ms. Benites. A glass or two of wine occasionally is generally not a concern. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe… a little itchy sometimes, with some plants, but not bad. I never had a serious allergy. I’m lucky, I think. My daughter, she is allergic to… cats, I think. But I am not allergic to anything. I hope. I never had any trouble. Is good, yes? I always eat everything, and I never worry. Is good to not have allergies, Doctor. Is a good thing. I hope.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is excellent. No known allergies are great. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No, not really. I take… sometimes, a little pill for my stomach, when it bother me. But not every day. And… I take vitamin D, sometimes, in the winter. But not right now. I don’t take anything regular. Just… when I need it. My daughter, she give me some pills for my knee, but I don’t like them. They make me… sleepy. So, I don’t take them. I try to not take too many pills, Doctor. Is not good for you, you know? So, just a little pill for my stomach, sometimes. Is that okay? I hope I not forgetting anything important. Is hard to remember all these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Benites. It sounds like you are only taking occasional medication for your stomach and sometimes Vitamin D. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, lungs, and abdomen. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Blood pressure… I think my daughter check it sometimes, with her little machine. Lungs… that is okay. Abdomen… is my stomach? Yes, that is okay. Just… be gentle, please? My back is… not so good. But yes, that is okay. I trust you, Doctor. You seem… nice. Just be gentle. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Benites. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at this time. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness or pain in any particular areas?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… a little uncomfortable. Is… normal, maybe? I eat… sometimes, too much. Just… little bit uncomfortable. Not pain. Just… full feeling. Oh! There… little bit. That is where my stomach bother me sometimes. But not right now. Is… just little bit uncomfortable. Is that okay, Doctor? I hope I not making things difficult. I try to be good patient, but sometimes… is hard. Is just… old body, maybe?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Benites. A little tenderness in that area is not surprising, and it sounds like it’s related to your occasional stomach discomfort. Your reflexes are normal, and your neurological function appears to be intact. Finally, I'm going to check your back. Can you tell me where exactly it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Here. Right here, mostly. And sometimes, on the side. Is… achy. Not sharp. Just… achy. And when I bend over, is… ouch. Is… not good, Doctor. I used to be able to bend over easily. But now… is difficult. And sometimes, when I twist… oh! That is not good. Is… scary feeling. Just… achy, mostly. But sometimes… is more. Is that okay, Doctor? I hope I not complaining too much. I just… want to know what is wrong. Is it old age? Is it something serious? Is it something you can fix?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Benites. It's certainly not complaining at all, and you're right to want to know what's going on. I feel some muscle tenderness in your lower back. There doesn't seem to be any radiating pain or numbness, which is good. Based on my exam, it sounds like you have a muscle strain or sprain in your lower back. This is common, especially with your line of work. However, to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: X-ray? Is… safe? I not like… radiation. My daughter, she say… is not good for you. But if you think is important… yes, that is okay. If you think it will help… yes. I trust you, Doctor. Just… is it going to hurt? And how long will it take? I have to get back to the shop… maybe? I have cars to fix. Is important to know… what is wrong. Is it serious? Is it something I need to worry about? Is it something you can fix, Doctor? I just… want to be able to work again. And to play with my grandchildren. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Benites. The amount of radiation from a single X-ray is very small – it's about the same as you'd receive from a few days of natural background radiation. We always take precautions to minimize your exposure. The X-ray will help us to rule out any fractures or other structural problems in your spine. It doesn't usually cause any discomfort – you’ll just need to stand still for a few moments. Based on my exam, I don't believe it's anything serious, but the X-ray will give us more information. I can order the X-ray for you right now, and we can schedule it for this afternoon or tomorrow morning, depending on availability. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief – ibuprofen or naproxen – and some gentle stretching exercises. I can also provide you with some information about proper lifting techniques. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Ibuprofen… I have that at home, I think. Stretching exercises… yes, good. I try to stretch, but maybe I do it wrong. And lifting techniques… yes, that is important. I sometimes… forget. Is hard when you work fast. So, X-ray… this afternoon or tomorrow. Whatever is easier for you. And ibuprofen, and stretching exercises… and lifting techniques. Yes, that sounds good. Is it… expensive? I not have much money, you know. And how long will it take to get the results? I have to get back to the shop, you know. I have cars to fix. And I want to play with my grandchildren. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: The X-ray should be covered by Medicare, Ms. Benites, so you shouldn't have any out-of-pocket expenses. The results typically come back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have the receptionist call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. Use heat or ice on your back to help manage the pain, and take the ibuprofen as directed. I’m going to print out some information about proper lifting techniques and some gentle stretching exercises for you. I want to assure you, Ms. Benites, most muscle strains heal with rest, pain relief, and proper care. We’ll get this sorted out. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… that is all, Doctor. Thank you. You very nice. And patient. Is good to know you care. I hope… I not bothering you too much. I just… want to be able to work again. And to play with my grandchildren. Is that too much to ask? They are my treasures. And I want to be able to… lift them. Without hurting my back. Is that okay, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is absolutely not too much to ask, Ms. Benites. And looking at this lovely photograph, I understand exactly why you want to be able to lift your grandchildren without pain. That’s a wonderful goal, and we'll work together to help you achieve it. I’ll get the order for the X-ray sent over to radiology. The receptionist will contact you to schedule it. If you experience any worsening pain, or if you develop any numbness or weakness in your legs, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. And please, don’t hesitate to call with any questions you may have in the meantime. I’m happy to have met you, Ms. Benites, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Take care, and please get some rest. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. Thank you. You very kind. And patient. I hope… I not wasting your time. I will… get some rest. And I will… call if I need anything. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye. And… God bless you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. It was my pleasure meeting you. Don’t worry about wasting my time – that’s what I’m here for. And you take care now. And you have a wonderful day, and please give your grandchildren a big hug from me.
