DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day. It’s this… tiredness. Just dragging all the time. And… something weird with eating. It's not like I want to, but I… I gotta have dirt. Sounds crazy, I know. Don’t ask me why. Just… do you have anything for it?
DOCTOR: Dirt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Like… earth. Clay. Not… not like garden dirt with fertilizer, just… plain. I find it, you know… around. It sounds dumb, even to me. And it makes my stomach hurt after, but then I… need more. It's just... a feeling.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Cantoran, this is… unusual. We need to get to the bottom of this. Have you experienced this… urge for an extended period of time, or is it a recent development?
PATIENT: Recent. Well, maybe a couple months. Hard to say, honestly. Things kinda blur together these days. It started small, just a little taste… then it got worse. And the tiredness… that’s been going on longer. Months and months. I just thought it was… getting old.
DOCTOR: And this tiredness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Like a weight. I used to be able to work all day, program those machines… now I can barely get through the morning. It’s… frustrating. My husband… he always said I was a hard worker. But he’s gone now.
DOCTOR: I see. And prior to this… tiredness and the… soil ingestion, were you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms? I don’t know… maybe a little dizzy sometimes. And my stomach… it's always upset. But I eat weird things, so what do you expect? I don’t know, honestly. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Ugh. Don’t remind me. I’ve… put some on. Not a lot, but enough. Clothes are tighter. It's probably from being too tired to… you know. Exercise. It's not like I'm running marathons anymore. Everything hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Never been much of a pill person. My husband… he always took a bunch of stuff. Vitamins, something for his blood pressure… I don't even remember. I just… don't bother with it. Waste of money, mostly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Cantoran, I'm going to need to conduct a brief physical exam. It's standard procedure, and will help me determine the cause of your symptoms. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do, you know. This is taking too long already.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. We'll start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. Pulse is 88, regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. A little elevated, but within acceptable parameters. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly… muffled. Abdomen is soft, but tender in the lower quadrants. No obvious masses. Mild distention noted.
PATIENT: Muffled? What’s that mean? And tender? I told you, I eat dirt! It’s gonna be tender! Look, are you gonna fix me or not? I don’t have time for… mumbling and poking.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I am attempting to gather information to determine the cause of your symptoms. “Muffled” simply indicates a slight reduction in sound, which could be due to a number of factors. As for the tenderness, I am simply documenting my findings. Lymph nodes are… slightly enlarged. Not alarmingly, but worth noting. Now, I'm going to need to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and iron studies. These will help us identify any underlying deficiencies or abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Iron studies? What for? I eat dirt! It’s got iron in it, doesn’t it? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just give me something for the tiredness. A pill, a shot, I don't care. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, while the dirt may contain iron, it also contains a myriad of other substances that could be harmful. We need to assess your iron levels accurately, along with other vital signs, to determine the appropriate course of action. Here is the order for the blood work. You can take this to the lab just down the hall. They will draw a sample. I also recommend a stool sample, to rule out any parasitic infections. It's standard procedure, given your… unusual dietary habits. Once the results are back, we can discuss treatment options. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you consult with a gastroenterologist. They can better evaluate your digestive system.
PATIENT: Ugh. More doctors? More poking and prodding? Look, I don’t even know what a gastroenterologist is. And I don't have time for stool samples! This is getting out of hand. Just... can't you just give me something now? Something for the tiredness?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your frustration, but I am ethically obligated to provide you with the best possible care. That involves a thorough evaluation, not simply prescribing medication without knowing the underlying cause of your symptoms. Giving you something “now” would be irresponsible. It could mask the problem, delay proper diagnosis, and potentially cause more harm than good. I can prescribe a low dose multivitamin, to address any potential deficiencies, but that is the extent of what I can do at this point. I strongly urge you to follow through with the blood work and the gastroenterology referral. Here is the prescription. And I reiterate: a comprehensive evaluation is crucial. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. A multivitamin. It's not much, but... better than nothing, I guess. Look, I really need to get going. I got things to do. So, no. No more questions. Just... thanks, I guess. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I will have my nurse provide you with discharge instructions and information regarding the lab and referral. Have a good day, Ms. Cantoran. .
