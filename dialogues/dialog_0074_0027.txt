DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s this heartburn. It’s been…well, it’s been a nuisance, alright? Food just comes back up. Not violently, mind you, just…regurgitation. It’s embarrassing, honestly. And it's getting old. Can we just figure out what pills I need and be done with it? I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It is unpleasant to deal with persistent heartburn and regurgitation, and I want to help you find relief. While I appreciate you wanting a quick solution, to ensure I prescribe the most appropriate medication – and to rule out anything more serious – I do need to ask a few questions first. Let's start with the heartburn itself. When did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright. Questions. Fine. Let me think… it started, hmm… probably around… March, maybe? Around when Agnes started making that spicy sausage. That’s probably it, honestly. She insists it’s “authentic Polish,” but I think it’s just making me sick. It wasn't constant then, just after the sausage. Now… now it's more often. Even with blander stuff. And it's worse when I lie down. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. So, it began around March, coinciding with the introduction of spicy sausage into your diet, and has gradually worsened, now occurring even with less spicy foods and exacerbated by lying down. Can you describe the sensation of the heartburn itself?
PATIENT: It’s… a burning, obviously. Right here. Not a sharp burn, more of a… warmth that creeps up. And then, well, then the food just… comes back. Like a little wave. Not a lot, thankfully. It’s not like I’m throwing up, just… unpleasant. And it leaves a bad taste. Like… vinegar, maybe? Honestly, it’s just… not dignified. I haven’t had a decent night’s sleep in weeks. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. A burning sensation in the middle of your chest, with regurgitation and a vinegar-like taste. And it’s affecting your sleep. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the heartburn, such as difficulty swallowing, pain when swallowing, or a feeling of food getting stuck in your throat?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes I feel a little…full, even if I haven't eaten much. Like something's just… sitting there. And occasionally, yes, swallowing is a bit…uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just…effortful. Like it takes a bit more work. Food doesn't get stuck, no. It just…doesn’t go down as smoothly as it used to. I mostly notice it with dry things, like crackers. Does that make sense? Honestly, I’m not one for complaining, Doctor, but it's getting to be a bit much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Altine. A feeling of fullness even after eating small amounts, and some difficulty with swallowing, particularly with dry foods. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no. I’m a perfectly healthy man, mostly. A bit of a bad back, but that’s from years of… well, never mind. Agnes worries about my cholesterol, but I ignore her. I take a daily aspirin, the doctor told me to after… a little scare a few years back. Nothing serious, just a bit of chest discomfort. And that's it. I don't go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. Waste of time, if you ask me. Do I have to list every little ache and pain?
DOCTOR: No, you don't have to list every little ache and pain, Mr. Altine. Just the significant things. The aspirin is good to know, and thank you for mentioning the chest discomfort you experienced previously. Do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just the aspirin. And… Agnes makes me take a fish oil pill every morning. Says it’s good for my heart. I mostly just swallow it with my coffee and forget about it. She’s very insistent on these things. I don’t really see the point, but it keeps her happy. So, yeah, fish oil. That’s it. Are we still on this? I thought we were supposed to be talking about the heartburn.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting there, Mr. Altine. It’s important to get a complete picture. The fish oil is noted. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I eat everything. Polish people are practical, you know? We don't have time for allergies. Though Agnes says I shouldn't have shellfish, but I ignore her on that one too. It's good with horseradish. Really. No allergies, Doctor. Promise. Can we please move on to the actual problem? This is taking up my whole morning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I appreciate your patience. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also palpate your abdomen. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. The quicker we do this, the quicker I can get home. I haven’t got all day, you know. And be gentle, alright? My back’s been acting up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I will be as gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the epigastric region – that’s the upper central part of your abdomen, right under your sternum. No masses or significant distention are palpable. Do you feel any pain when I press there?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. It’s not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s the same spot where the heartburn feels the worst, actually. Don’t press too hard, alright? You’re making it worse. So, what does this all mean? Is it something serious? I really don’t have time for a complicated illness.
DOCTOR: Alright, I won’t press any further. Based on your history and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. That means stomach acid is flowing back up into your esophagus, causing the heartburn, regurgitation, and discomfort you’ve been describing. The tenderness in your upper abdomen is consistent with that. However, to be certain and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. A simple upper endoscopy would allow us to visualize your esophagus and stomach directly. We could also do a pH monitoring test to measure the amount of acid reflux. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Look, Doctor, I told you, I don’t do tests. I’ve lived a long life without poking and prodding, and I’d like to keep it that way. Can't you just give me something for the heartburn? A pill, anything? I’m a simple man with a simple problem. I eat too much spicy sausage, I get heartburn. Give me something to neutralize the acid and let me get on with my life. I don't need fancy machines and tubes and… whatever an endoscopy is. Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine, and I respect your wishes. However, while medication can certainly provide relief from your symptoms, it’s important to understand why you’re experiencing them. Long-term, uncontrolled acid reflux can sometimes lead to complications, such as esophagitis or even Barrett’s esophagus. Given your aversion to testing, and the fact that your symptoms are relatively mild at this point, we could try a trial of medication – a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI – to see if it provides adequate relief. However, I want to be clear that without further investigation, we won’t be able to rule out other potential causes, and it's important to be aware of the warning signs that would warrant further evaluation. Would you be willing to try a PPI, with the understanding that we may need to revisit testing if your symptoms don't improve, or if they worsen?
PATIENT: Fine. A pill. Just a pill. But if it doesn't work, I'm not doing any of those… endo-whatever things. And I'm not coming back for more tests. Understand? Just a pill. What kind of pill is it, anyway? And what are these "warning signs" you keep talking about? I haven’t got time to be worrying about warning signs. I’ve got a garden to tend, you know.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Altine. I’m prescribing you omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor. It works by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. You’ll take one pill each morning, about 30 minutes before breakfast, for two weeks. As for warning signs, you should seek immediate medical attention if you experience difficulty swallowing, persistent vomiting, unexplained weight loss, or blood in your stool or vomit. These could indicate a more serious problem. Now, regarding your gardening, the omeprazole shouldn't interfere with your activities. However, it can sometimes cause side effects such as headache or diarrhea. If you experience any significant side effects, please let us know. Do you have any questions about the medication or the warning signs before we finish up?
PATIENT: No. Just… give me the prescription. And hurry up. I’ve got things to do. Hopefully this pill works. I really don’t want to come back here. And tell Agnes I said it's probably a waste of time, but I took it to keep her happy. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. Here’s your prescription. And I’ll make a note in your chart about your conversation with Agnes. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss how you're feeling. If your symptoms don't improve, or if you experience any concerning side effects, don’t hesitate to call the office sooner. Thank you for coming in today, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, and enjoy your gardening. .
