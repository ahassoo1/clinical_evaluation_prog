DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think... It’s about… going to the bathroom. It’s hard now, you see? Not like before. Takes a bit of… effort. That’s right, hard to start going.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s becoming difficult to initiate urination, or to start the stream of urine. And you’ve noticed this is different than it used to be?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Hard to start. And… yes. It used to just… happen. Now I have to… push a little. Or wait a bit. It’s… annoying, mostly. Not painful, just… takes time. My husband, he doesn't mind too much, but it bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. So, not painful, just more effort and a delay in starting. And it's been a gradual change, not something sudden?
PATIENT: Gradual… yes, I think so. It didn’t just poof happen one day. It’s been… longer than a week, for sure. Maybe a month? Oh dear, time goes so fast these days. I can’t really remember exactly. Everything blurs together.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. A month is a good estimate. Now, besides the difficulty starting, have you noticed any other changes in your bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes? Let me think… I get up at night sometimes, to go. More than I used to, maybe? It’s not every night, but… a couple times a week, at least. My husband says I drink too much water before bed! He's probably right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so getting up a couple times a week to urinate at night as well. That's called nocturia. And you said your husband thinks you drink a lot of water before bed?
PATIENT: Noct… what-ia? Oh, that’s a fancy word. Yes, that's it! Going at night. And yes, my husband, he worries. I like a glass of water before bed. It makes me feel… settled. But maybe he’s right, I should try to drink less.
DOCTOR: Alright, nocturia. We can definitely talk about that. Now, let me ask about other symptoms. Have you noticed any urgency – a sudden, strong need to go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Urgency… like I have to go right now? Hmm… not really. It’s not like that. I feel it when I need to go, sure, but it's not a rushing feeling. Just… a bit of effort to start, that's all. Not a panic, never a panic.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No sense of urgency. And have you noticed any burning or discomfort while you’re urinating?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Not at all. It doesn’t hurt to go, once I get it started. It's just… getting it going is the tricky part. Like a… rusty engine, maybe? That’s the best way I can explain it.
DOCTOR: A rusty engine, that’s a good description! Alright, no burning, no urgency, just difficulty initiating the stream. Now, do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear, medical conditions… Let me think. I see Dr. Chen for my heart, but he says it’s… old age, mostly. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, but it's not much. And… I think I had a touch of diabetes years ago, but they said it went away. It was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you see Dr. Chen for your heart, take a medication for blood pressure, and had diabetes in the past. Do you recall the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names… they just slip my mind. It’s a little white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. My husband handles the refills, he remembers all that. He’s very good with things like that. I wish I could be more help, but… the names are gone.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. We can look it up in your records. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just the little white pill for my blood pressure, I think. Sometimes I take a little something for my knees, when they’re acting up. It’s a cream, I rub it on. That’s all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication and a cream for your knees. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. I used to get stung by bees when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago! Not a medication allergy, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medication allergies. Now, before we do a quick exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family had problems with their kidneys, bladder, or prostate?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a hard one. My family, we didn’t talk much about… those things. My brothers, they all passed away a long time ago. My sister… she had some trouble with her knees, I think. But kidneys and bladders… I don't recall anyone having problems with those.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can move on if you don't have that information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to do a quick abdominal exam and check your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. I’m an old woman, my bones aren't what they used to be! But I'm happy to help however I can.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be very gentle. Alright, everything sounds clear with your heart and lungs. Your abdomen is soft, but I did note some mild fullness in your lower abdomen. And your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common at your age. I’m going to do a quick neurological exam to assess sensation in your lower extremities. Then, I’d like to get a urine sample to check for infection or other abnormalities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Fullness… hmm. Maybe that's why it’s hard to go? Like a little… blockage? And diminished reflexes… that explains why I sometimes trip over things! My husband says I need to watch my step. A urine sample sounds good. Where do I… do that?
DOCTOR: You’re very observant, Ms. Stoffregen. Fullness could certainly be contributing. And yes, diminished reflexes can affect your balance. I'll give you a sterile cup and some instructions, and you can go to the restroom. Just try to collect a midstream sample - that means start urinating, then collect a sample about halfway through. Don't worry, there's a private restroom right down the hall. I'll be right here when you're finished.
PATIENT: Oh, midstream… that sounds fancy. Okay, I’ll try. It’s been a while since I had to do something… special like that. Down the hall, you say? Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Stoffregen. And please let me know if you need any assistance. I'll be here.
