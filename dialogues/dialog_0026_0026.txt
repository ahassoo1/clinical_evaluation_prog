DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, dear. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness, you see. Just… exhausting. I don’t have the energy I used to. And the young man at the lab said something about… numbers being off? I barely listen to these things, honestly. It’s probably just old age catching up with me. Though, I was a commercial diver, you know. Strong work, that was.
DOCTOR: Tiredness… and some lab results that you weren’t quite sure about. I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out. It’s never a bad idea, and it's good you mentioned being a commercial diver – that's quite a physically demanding job! Could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not just a little tiredness, dear. It’s… draining. Like someone pulled the plug. I used to be able to do anything. Garden all day, walk for miles… now, I get winded just going to the mailbox. And it’s been going on for… well, I don’t rightly know how long. Weeks, maybe? Months? Time just… slips away, doesn't it? My husband, Tenzin, he mostly handles things now. He keeps telling me to rest, but resting doesn’t fix it.
DOCTOR: It certainly does sound draining, Ardelle. And it's understandable that resting isn't enough if there's something else going on. Weeks or months of this… that’s definitely something we need to investigate. Just to be clear, is this tiredness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… mostly constant, I suppose. Though some days are worse than others. Like a weight on my chest, you see? And… sometimes my muscles ache. Not all over, just… here and there. Mostly in my legs, I think. Though I can't always tell. Everything feels… fuzzy these days. It's hard to pinpoint anything, really. Honestly, I just wish I could get my strength back. I miss being useful.
DOCTOR: A constant weight, with some muscle aches… and feeling generally fuzzy. That gives me a better picture. And I completely understand wanting to feel useful again. It’s frustrating when your body doesn’t cooperate. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and muscle aches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Well, I’ve been a bit… clumsy lately. Dropping things, bumping into furniture. Tenzin says I’m more forgetful than usual, but he says that every year, bless his heart. And… sometimes I feel a bit… off in my head. Not dizzy, exactly. Just… not quite right. Like a cloud over my thinking. I haven't been eating as well either, I suppose. Everything just tastes… bland.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness, increased forgetfulness, feeling “off” in your head, and a loss of appetite… thank you for sharing all of that, Ardelle. It’s very helpful. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… medical conditions… Let me see. I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but nothing serious. And my knees ache sometimes, the doctor said it was just old age again. Oh! And I had my gallbladder out, goodness, must be twenty years ago now. That was unpleasant. Other than that… not much, I don't think. Tenzin handles all the doctor appointments and paperwork, so I mostly just show up when he tells me to. I really don’t bother with remembering all those medical things.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and some knee pain. That’s good to know. And it’s perfectly alright that Tenzin handles the paperwork – many people prefer that. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A little white pill. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take something for the pain. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called? But that doesn’t really help much anymore. Other than that… no, I don’t take a lot of pills. I prefer natural remedies, if possible, but Tenzin insists on the blood pressure medicine. He worries, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and ibuprofen as needed. We’ll get a complete list from the pharmacy to be sure. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty robust, you see. Never had any trouble with food. Though, I don't eat much spicy food. It upsets my stomach. And… I think I got a rash once from some sort of plant when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. Tenzin will probably know more about this, he remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, and Tenzin is quite helpful with remembering things. That's good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and a few other things. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, go ahead, dear. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Though, don't expect much. I'm a bit… creaky, you see. And I don't like having my legs poked and prodded. But do what you have to.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll take it slow and gently. I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. Deep breaths, please… good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from just talking. Lungs sound… slightly diminished, but nothing immediately concerning. Now, let's check your reflexes… Right leg… good. Left leg… slightly diminished. That’s not necessarily a cause for alarm, but we'll make a note of it. Your skin feels a little dry, and I notice some mild swelling in your ankles. And your muscle strength… a little weak in your legs, as you mentioned. Alright, Ardelle. Thank you for letting me examine you. Everything seems to be within normal limits for your age, but the diminished reflexes, muscle weakness, and swelling in your ankles warrant a bit more investigation. I would like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. And perhaps a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh my. All that… blood work? It sounds… complicated. I just want to feel better, you see. Is it going to be painful? And will it take long? I have a garden to tend to, you know. Tenzin will probably want to know all the details, too. He likes to be informed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ardelle. It does sound complicated, but it’s a routine procedure, and it will help us figure out what’s going on. The blood draw itself isn’t usually painful – just a quick pinch. And it shouldn’t take long – maybe 15-20 minutes at the lab. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. And yes, Tenzin is more than welcome to come with you, or I can explain the results to both of you at a later appointment. We'll get a complete report and discuss everything thoroughly. The goal is to get you back to tending your garden as soon as possible. Would tomorrow morning work, or would another day be better?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… hmm. I suppose that would be alright. As long as it doesn't interfere with Tenzin's schedule. He has his… his club meetings, you see. But I can rearrange things, I suppose. Just… don't make it too early. I need my morning tea. And tell me, dear, what are we looking for, exactly? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Of course, we'll work around Tenzin's schedule. Let's say 9:30 tomorrow morning?
PATIENT: 9:30… yes, that should do nicely. As long as Tenzin doesn't need me for anything before then. And you said something about looking for something? Is it… is it my heart? I've always had a strong heart, you know. Commercial diving wasn't for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No, we're not necessarily looking for anything specifically with your heart at this point, although the blood work will give us a baseline. We're going to check a few things—your thyroid levels, vitamin D, and a basic blood count—to rule out common causes of fatigue and muscle weakness. Sometimes, a simple vitamin deficiency can cause these symptoms. Or, in some cases, it could be related to your thyroid function. We just want to get a complete picture so we can figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s always best to rule things out. Do you have any questions about the blood work or anything else before we schedule the appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that sounds… reasonable, I suppose. Vitamin deficiency… yes, that's possible. I haven't been eating as well lately. And my knees have been bothering me so much, I haven't been getting much sunshine. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. Just… please make it quick. And be gentle. I bruise easily, you see. So, 9:30 tomorrow morning? And you'll explain everything to Tenzin and me later?
DOCTOR: Yes, 9:30 tomorrow morning. I'll make a note to tell the phlebotomist to be gentle, and I’ll be sure to explain everything thoroughly to both you and Tenzin afterwards. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results and create a plan. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that's all. Thank you for being so patient with an old woman like me. And thank you for listening. It's nice to finally have someone take this tiredness seriously. I suppose I'll see you tomorrow then. 9:30… I better remind Tenzin. He gets quite flustered when he forgets things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ardelle. It was my pleasure. And don't worry about being an old woman—you're a valued patient, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. Yes, 9:30 tomorrow morning. I look forward to seeing you and Tenzin then. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before our appointment. Have a good afternoon, and get some rest.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You too. .
