DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my breathing. It’s been giving me trouble when I try to lie flat. It feels like…like something is pressing on me. I don’t know if that makes sense. I’d like to get it sorted out if possible, quickly if we could.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Maribeth. Feeling like something is pressing on you when you lie flat is a good way to describe it. We'll definitely try to get this sorted out as quickly as we can. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…It started, oh, about three weeks ago, I believe. Maybe a little longer. It wasn’t sudden, it just…gradually got worse. At first, I just needed an extra pillow. Now, I can’t really lie flat at all without feeling…well, uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I’ve been sleeping in my chair mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening over about three weeks. And now you're mostly sleeping in a chair because of it. I appreciate you telling me that. Besides the difficulty lying flat and the discomfort, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well…let me see. I do get a bit more tired than usual, yes. And sometimes, my ankles feel…swollen. Not terribly, but noticeable. I thought it was just the heat, honestly. We’ve had a very warm summer. Oh, and a little bit of coughing, but that's been on and off for a while now. Old age, probably. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful, Maribeth. Fatigue, some ankle swelling, and a bit of cough – those are all things we should consider. Now, regarding the cough, is it a dry cough, or do you bring anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly dry. Sometimes a little bit of…phlegm, I suppose. White, usually. Not much, though. It’s not a productive cough, if that makes sense. Just a little tickle in my throat that turns into a cough now and then. Nothing major. I haven't had a fever, if you were wondering. I’m generally quite healthy, you know. Despite all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly dry cough with a little bit of white phlegm. No fever. I understand you generally feel quite healthy, and we'll keep that in mind. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term conditions like heart problems, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… my doctor back home – it was Dr. Abernathy – he said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back, so I was on some pills for that. I stopped taking them a while ago, though. He said I could manage it with diet. And I did, mostly. Otherwise, no. Nothing major, no. I had the flu once, but everyone gets the flu. Is that what you mean? I'm not sure what all those things are that people get nowadays.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Maribeth. So, a history of high blood pressure that you managed with diet – that’s important to know. And just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was…oh, in my 40s, I suppose. That was a long time ago. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist falling off a ladder trying to reach some peaches. It was a silly accident, really. Other than that…no. Nothing else significant, no. I've always been quite lucky, really. I’d like to keep it that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in your 40s and a broken wrist. That’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any health problems that run in your family, like heart disease, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. My mother…she had a weak heart. She was always tired. And my brother, he had…something with his lungs. Emphysema, I think it was. He smoked, you see. A lot. And my aunt…she had diabetes, yes. Terrible thing. She lost a foot because of it. Is that what you’re wanting to know? It's a sad story, really. They all lived long lives, though, despite everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Maribeth. That's very important information. History of heart problems in your mother, lung problems in your brother, and diabetes in your aunt. Just a few more questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve eaten everything and taken everything! I’m a pretty simple person. No reactions to any pills, no rashes from any foods. I’m very fortunate that way. Can we get on with the…the exam now? I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. No known allergies – that’s good. Alright, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your ankles. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, your heart sounds a little…distant, and I can hear some crackling in the lower part of your lungs on both sides. It’s subtle, but it's there. Now let's take a look at your ankles. I see a little bit of swelling in both ankles, as you mentioned. It’s not severe, but it’s definitely present.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that…bad? The crackling and the swelling, I mean. I knew something wasn’t quite right, but I didn’t want to worry anyone. What does it mean, Doctor? I’d like to know straight away if it's anything serious. I'm not one for pussyfooting around.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re direct, Maribeth. I appreciate that. The crackling in your lungs and the swelling in your ankles suggest that there’s some fluid buildup. Considering your symptoms – the difficulty lying flat, the fatigue, and your medical history – the most likely cause is heart failure. Now, "heart failure" sounds scary, but it doesn't mean your heart has stopped working. It means your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should be, causing fluid to build up in your lungs and other parts of your body. To confirm this, I’d like to order some tests, including a chest X-ray and an EKG, and a blood test to check your kidney function and a something called a BNP which can help us determine if it is heart failure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Heart failure. That does sound…serious. Is it something I got from my mother? I remember her always being so tired. Tests…yes, yes, do the tests. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's wrong and what can be done about it. Is there anything I should be doing now? Any special way I should be sleeping or…or anything? I’d like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible, you understand. And please, no complicated explanations. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: It’s very likely your heart failure, if that's what it is, is related to your mother’s condition. Genetics can play a role, yes. In the meantime, before we get the test results back, there are a few things you can do. First, I recommend elevating your head and chest with pillows when you sleep – at least two or three pillows. This will help reduce the fluid buildup in your lungs. Second, it’s important to limit your salt intake. Salt causes your body to retain fluid, which can worsen the symptoms. Try to avoid processed foods and limit your sodium intake to less than 2000 milligrams per day. And finally, if you notice any sudden weight gain or increased shortness of breath, please come back to the clinic immediately. We'll get those tests ordered right away. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and we’ll schedule the chest X-ray. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Pillows…check. Salt…that will be hard, but I’ll try. Sudden weight gain… I weigh myself every morning. I’m very careful. Will I have to…go to the hospital? I don’t like hospitals. And will this…this heart failure keep me from my garden? I have tomatoes ripening. That's very important. I need to know if I'll be able to get out there before they spoil. I suppose I should ask if it’s…contagious? My granddaughter visits every Sunday.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Maribeth. I understand your concerns. At this point, it’s too early to say whether you’ll need to be hospitalized. We need the test results to determine the severity of your condition. For many people with heart failure, it can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes, and hospitalization isn't necessary. As for your garden, that’s a great question. We'll need to assess your energy levels and symptoms once we have the test results. For now, avoid any strenuous activity, like heavy lifting or digging, and take frequent breaks. If you feel short of breath or fatigued, stop immediately. And no, heart failure is not contagious. Your granddaughter can visit as usual. It’s caused by problems with your heart, not by an infection. I'm going to order those tests now, and once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. The nurse will be in shortly to get things started. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that covers everything for now. The nurse will explain about the tests? And you'll call me when the results are in? I don't want to keep waiting around. Tomatoes don't wait for anyone, you know. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… very helpful. And to the point. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will explain everything about the tests, and I’ll personally call you as soon as the results are in. I understand about the tomatoes! We’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. You’re very welcome, Maribeth. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before I call you with the results. .
