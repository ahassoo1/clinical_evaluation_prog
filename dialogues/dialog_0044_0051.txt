DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Lovely to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in… now, let me think. It’s about my blood, I believe. Yes, that’s it. My blood type. I need to know what it is. It’s… important, I think. For something. My daughter mentioned it, you see. She’s a very organized girl. I just… don’t recall why exactly. Old age, you know. It slips the mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Darl. Knowing your blood type is always good information to have, and it's completely understandable that details can slip your mind as time goes on. Don't worry about that at all. To clarify, are you needing this information for a specific upcoming procedure, or is this more of a general “good to know” situation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A procedure? I don’t think so. Not that I remember, anyway. No, I think it’s just… good to know. Like having your address written down, or something. Just in case. My daughter, Elena, she's very practical. She said it was a good idea to have it on file… somewhere. With the doctor, I suppose. Is that what we’re doing? Having it on file?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Darl. Elena sounds like a very thoughtful daughter. Yes, having it on file with me is a great idea – it’s always good to have that information readily available. Now, I do see here in your chart that you've been a patient with us for a little while. Have we ever determined your blood type before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Oh, my. A chart? Well, that's good. Organized, you see. I… I honestly can't say. It’s been a long time since I’ve been to a doctor, to be truthful. Perhaps? Maybe years ago? I worked with ropes, you know. Rigging. Lots of travel, lots of different doctors along the way. Mostly just for scrapes and bruises, though. Nothing serious. I doubt they bothered with blood types for that.
DOCTOR: Ropes, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Rigging. Building… well, everything, really. Stages for concerts, film sets, even some of the big bridges, though I wasn’t doing the main work on those, of course. Mostly I was ensuring everything was safe, checking the lines, making sure things were secure. It was… a good life. Kept me moving, that’s for sure. Though, not so good for the knees these days.
DOCTOR: That sounds fascinating, Darl. A very important job, ensuring everyone's safety. It's good you kept moving; staying active is so important. Alright, let's get back to the blood type. Since it doesn't appear to be documented in your current chart, we'll need to do a quick test to determine it. It's a very simple procedure – just a small blood draw. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A blood draw? Oh… yes, that’s alright. As long as it’s quick. I don’t… I don’t love needles, if I’m being honest. But if it’s important, and Elena thinks it is… then yes. Quick, though, please. And not too deep?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Darl. I understand completely. We’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I’ll let the nurse know to be especially gentle. It's just a small sample, and we’ll be very efficient. Before we head over to the lab, is there anything else you’ve been experiencing – any aches, pains, fatigue, or changes in your health that you’d like to mention?
PATIENT: Hmm… aches and pains, well, what doesn’t ache and pain? Old age, you know. My knees, like I said. And sometimes my back acts up, especially if the weather is damp. But that’s just… life. I get a little tired, I suppose. But who doesn’t? No, nothing specific. Nothing that’s worrying me, anyway. Just the usual creaks and groans.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Darl. The usual creaks and groans are certainly common at our age! We’ll keep an eye on things. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, any recent weight loss or gain, or any problems with your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… well, it comes and goes, I suppose. Some days I could eat a horse, other days just a little soup is enough. Weight… I haven't weighed myself in ages. Probably lost a bit, to be truthful. I’m not as active as I used to be. And sleep… well, it's not as sound as it used to be. Wake up a few times during the night, you know. Thinking about things. Old memories. Nothing to worry about, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Darl. Changes in appetite, slight weight loss, and occasional sleep disturbances are all common as we get older. It's good you're aware of these changes. One more quick question. Have you had any recent illnesses, infections, or been hospitalized for anything in the past year?
PATIENT: Let me think… illnesses… Oh! I had a little cold last winter, I believe. Just a sniffle and a cough. Nothing serious. Didn't even bother going to the doctor for it. Elena made me drink lots of tea and rest. And… no, no hospital visits. Not in the last year, or for quite a while before that, thankfully. I’m a fairly sturdy old woman, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Darl. A sturdy old woman is good! It sounds like you take good care of yourself, and Elena is a very attentive daughter. Alright, that’s all the questions I have for now. It sounds like you’re generally in good health, aside from the usual aches and pains. Let's go ahead and get that blood draw done so we can determine your blood type and have it on file. The nurse is ready for you just down the hall. Would you like me to walk you over?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, Doctor. Yes, please. I do get a bit… turned around sometimes. And needles, you know. A little company would be very reassuring. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Darl. That’s what I’m here for. Come this way. It’s just a few steps. The nurse, Maria, is excellent – she’ll take good care of you. And we'll have those results back to me shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I do appreciate you walking with me. It’s funny, isn’t it? Getting old. Things just… become a bit more complicated.
DOCTOR: It is funny, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. But it’s also… a gift, in a way. All those years, all those memories. Even the complicated bits. They make you who you are, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s beautifully said, Darl. You're absolutely right. And every life has its story, and yours sounds like a particularly interesting one. Here we are. Maria is just inside. She's expecting you. I’ll be right here, reviewing some charts, and I’ll come get you as soon as we have the results. Don’t hesitate to let Maria know if you’re feeling anxious or uncomfortable at any point.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. Alright then. Here goes nothing.
DOCTOR: Maria: All done, Doctor. A little bit of a struggle getting the vein, but we got it. Dr. Asami: Thank you, Maria. You’re a lifesaver.
PATIENT: .
