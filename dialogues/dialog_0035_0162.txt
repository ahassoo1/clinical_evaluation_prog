DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t really have time for a lot of this. Just…bloating, okay? My stomach’s puffed up. It’s been happening on and off, and it’s annoying. Frankly, I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time, Mr. Kristofik. Bloating can be caused by a lot of things, so I’ll try to be quick. When did this bloating start?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t really remember. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. Like I said, it's not a big deal. It just…is. I eat, I work, I get bloated. It's just part of life now, I guess. Don’t need to make a whole thing about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is it associated with anything specific you eat, or any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I eat pretty much the same stuff all the time. Burgers, fries…you know. Work food. It doesn’t seem to matter when I eat it either. It just…happens. I’m telling you, I don’t think it’s anything serious. Probably just something I ate. Though, to be fair, I can’t really recall what I ate last week, let alone what triggers this.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I…I don’t know. I feel…normal, I guess. Tired, maybe? But that’s just from the job, you know? Pile driving isn’t exactly a walk in the park. No pain, no…nothing else really. Just the puffed-up stomach. Look, is this going to take long? I got a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, no changes in your bowel habits, no nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing like that. Definitely no vomiting. Look, I'm a grown man, not some…I don't know. No changes in…whatever you said. Bowel…things are regular enough. This is getting ridiculous. I just want to know if I need to worry about it, or if I can just ignore it. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. Just to clarify, you've had this bloating for a few weeks, it's not associated with any particular foods or time of day, and you have no other symptoms like pain, changes in bowel habits, nausea, or vomiting. Correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s…pretty much it. Look, you got it. Bloating. A few weeks. No big deal. Can we just…rule something bad out, and then I can go? I’m not looking for a whole workup, just…peace of mind. I got a job to do, you know? People are counting on me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand you want to be quick about this. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Then we can discuss next steps. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…don’t poke around too much, alright? I got things to do. Hurry it up, if you could.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik, I’m listening to your abdomen now. It doesn't seem particularly tender to the touch, and I don't hear any unusual sounds. There's a bit of…tympany, which isn't surprising with bloating, but nothing alarming. I'm not feeling any masses or anything concerning. Now, given your description and the exam, it could be simple gas and bloating, possibly related to your diet. But because it's been going on for a few weeks, and to be thorough, I’d like to order a basic blood test to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood test? Ugh. Seriously? Look, I just told you it's probably nothing. I eat burgers, I work hard, my stomach puffs up. That's it! Is a blood test really necessary? I don’t like needles, and I got things to do. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Can't you just tell me it's fine and let me go?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, and I want to respect your time. However, even though it could be something simple, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. The blood test will check things like your liver and kidney function, and rule out any signs of inflammation. It’s a standard precaution, and it will give us peace of mind. It's a quick draw, and we can get the results back relatively quickly. If everything comes back normal, then we can confidently say it's likely just gas and bloating, and we can discuss some dietary adjustments. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Fine. But if it’s normal, you gotta promise not to bother me about it again. No follow-ups, no special diets, nothing. Just tell me I’m good and let me go. And hurry it up. I hate hospitals. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I understand. Just a quick blood draw, and if everything comes back normal, we won’t bother you further. I’ll write the order now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take good care of you. Here’s the lab order. They’ll let you know when the results are available, usually within a few days. In the meantime, try to avoid carbonated drinks and excessively fatty foods, and see if that helps. Do you have any questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…get this over with. And don’t expect me to come back. Thanks…I guess. .
