DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's not really a visit, you see. I just need some forms filled out. Medicare sent me over and said I needed a doctor’s signature on a few things. I didn’t quite understand what they all were, honestly.
DOCTOR: Certainly. That's quite alright, Ms. Fabing. Medicare paperwork can be…extensive. Let’s take a look at these together. Please, feel free to point out anything that’s unclear, and we’ll go through it step-by-step. Do you have them with you now?
PATIENT: Yep, right here. It's…a lot. I tried to read through them, but some of the words just went right over my head. I appreciate you helping me with this. It's a relief to not have to figure it all out on my own.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fabing. That’s what I’m here for. It is a substantial packet, as you say. Let’s start with this first one – it appears to be a request for medical information release. It asks for permission to share your medical records with Medicare for processing benefits. Does that sound correct so far?
PATIENT: That sounds right. I figured that's what it was about. Sharing records…yeah, that makes sense if they need to know what’s going on to pay for things. Is there anything wrong with letting them have it? I just always worry about things like privacy, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible concern, Ms. Fabing, and a perfectly valid question. Privacy is paramount. Medicare has strict regulations regarding patient information, and they are only permitted to access information relevant to your claim. It’s standard procedure for benefit processing. We can certainly review the specific details of what information they are requesting if you’d like. Perhaps we can start with a quick overview of your general medical history to ensure we are only releasing necessary information?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. A quick overview… yeah, I like that. I don’t get sick much, honestly. Just the usual colds sometimes. I had my gallbladder out a few years back, though. Other than that… I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. I try to stay active, walk a lot. Does that help? Knowing what they need and only giving them that sounds a lot better.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Ms. Fabing. Staying active is wonderful. And knowing you had your gallbladder removed is good information to have. Approximately how many years ago was that surgery?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… 2021, I believe. Yes, 2021. Right before my oldest grandchild was born. That was a busy spring! It was at the hospital in Havre, if that matters. A good doctor did it, Dr. Olsen. No problems at all, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s very helpful, thank you. And no complications post-surgery – that's good to note. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, not a one. I try to avoid them as much as possible. I'm one of those people who tries to tough things out. A little bit of rest and a lot of water usually does the trick. My grandma always said, "Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food," and I try to live by that. Just vitamins sometimes, a multivitamin, but nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful philosophy, Ms. Fabing. And very sensible. So, no regular medications or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors, like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to help my mom garden when I was little, and she had all sorts of flowers, and I was fine. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing. I think I’m pretty lucky in that department too. My husband is allergic to cats, but I don’t have any allergies myself.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Fabing. No known allergies. Just to be thorough, have there been any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in your family history that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tougher one. My mom had some heart trouble when she got older, but she lived to be 85, so… I guess that's something. My dad, he was pretty healthy, a rancher, strong as an ox. He passed away in an accident, not from sickness. My brother has high blood pressure, I think. It’s hard to keep track of everything, you know? We're a big family. Does knowing about heart trouble in my mom’s family matter?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know, Ms. Fabing, and it’s perfectly alright that it’s hard to keep track. Heart trouble in your mother’s history is good information to have. We will document that. It helps to give us a more complete picture. Now, before we finish going through these forms, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I live here in town with my husband, George. He's retired now, used to be a mechanic. We have a few grandkids we see pretty often, which keeps us busy. I like to walk, like I said, and I do a little bit of beadwork. It's relaxing. We don't smoke or drink much. Pretty quiet life, all things considered. We enjoy it. Is there anything specific you need to know?
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Ms. Fabing. It's good to hear you are active and have a strong support system. And no smoking or excessive alcohol consumption – that's excellent. No, that gives me a good overall understanding. Let’s go back to these forms now. It looks like this section requires a brief summary of your current medical conditions. Since you’ve mentioned being generally healthy, would it be accurate to state “no significant current medical conditions”?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. “No significant current medical conditions.” That’s me in a nutshell. Just getting older, I suppose, but nothing I need a doctor for right now. Thank goodness. Can we just sign it then? I feel like I’ve told you my life story!
DOCTOR: You certainly have given me a very thorough overview, Ms. Fabing, and I appreciate it very much. It helps me ensure we are providing the best possible care. Yes, let's go ahead and complete these forms. I'll just need you to sign here and initial here. Once these are signed, I’ll get them processed and sent to Medicare. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Nope, I think you’ve covered everything. You’ve been very patient with me, and I appreciate it. It’s a relief to finally have this done. Thank you, Doctor.
