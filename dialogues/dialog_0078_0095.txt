DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Solero. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have all day. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face… it feels kind of droopy on that same side. Is that what you treat here? Because frankly, I need to know if this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Nissenbaum, that’s certainly something we can address. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are concerning symptoms, and it's good you came in to be seen. It's important we investigate those. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: I just told you. This morning. I woke up. Everything was… normal. Then I went to make tea, and that’s when I realized I couldn’t hear the kettle. And when I looked in the mirror… well, you see it, don't you? It's not exactly subtle. Honestly, I don’t understand why I have to explain everything twice. Is this clinic very busy?
DOCTOR: I apologize for any repetition, Ms. Nissenbaum. I want to be thorough to ensure I gather all the necessary information. It's helpful to know the symptoms appeared suddenly this morning. To clarify, did anything specific happen before you woke up this morning that might be relevant?
PATIENT: What do you mean "anything specific"? I slept. I went to bed perfectly fine, I woke up… like this. I didn't have a fall, I didn't hit my head, I didn't go swimming in a polluted river. I simply existed overnight! Are you suggesting I’m making this up? Because that’s rather insulting.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Nissenbaum, not at all. I'm simply trying to gather a complete history. Sometimes, even seemingly insignificant details can be helpful. I understand your frustration, and I assure you I’m not questioning your experience. Let’s move on then. Has this ever happened before – any similar episodes of hearing loss or facial weakness?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. If it had, do you think I would be sitting here wasting my time? I've never experienced anything like this in my life. And frankly, I find your line of questioning rather patronizing. I'm a reasonably intelligent woman, Doctor. I know my own body. Now, are you going to do something, or just keep asking pointless questions?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to expect me to proceed with an examination, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I apologize if my questions felt repetitive or patronizing. That was not my intention. I'd like to perform a quick neurological exam to assess the facial weakness and hearing loss, and check your vital signs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. But please, be quick. I have a very busy schedule, you know. And try not to poke and prod too much. I don’t appreciate unnecessary handling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. First, let me quickly check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll take a look in your ears and do a few simple tests to assess the facial weakness and hearing loss. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, if you'll allow me to look in your ears… The ear canal appears clear. Now, could you please close your eyes tightly and try to wrinkle your forehead?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It's not exactly effortless, is it? It feels… stiff. And don't tell me it's all in my head. I know what my face should feel like. Now, what next? Honestly, this whole process is rather undignified.
DOCTOR: You are correct, Ms. Nissenbaum. There is noticeable weakness on that side. Now, could you please try to smile as broadly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that broad enough for you? It feels… ridiculous. And frankly, I don't appreciate being made to look like a fool. Are you finally going to tell me what’s wrong with me, or are we going to continue this charade?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the discomfort. Based on the physical exam – the sudden onset of hearing loss and the facial weakness – the presentation is concerning for Bell’s palsy. Bell’s palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness or paralysis on one side of the face, often due to inflammation of the facial nerve. It's not usually caused by anything serious, but it needs to be evaluated to rule out other potential causes, and we'll want to discuss treatment options. To be thorough, I’d like to order a blood test to check your blood sugar levels and rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood test? Of course. Just add it to the pile. Honestly, this is exactly what I expected. More delays, more poking and prodding. Look, Doctor, I'm a practical woman. What does this "Bell’s palsy" mean? Will I be able to close my face again? And what can you do about it? I don’t have time for vague explanations and endless tests. Just tell me what's going to happen, and how long it will take. And please, spare me the medical jargon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum. You’re right to want a clear explanation. Bell’s palsy, in most cases, is temporary. The good news is that the majority of people – around 80-90% – recover fully within a few weeks to a few months, even without treatment. However, the recovery can take longer in some cases. The treatment typically involves a course of oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to reduce the inflammation of the facial nerve. In some cases, antiviral medications may also be prescribed. I’d also recommend eye drops to keep your eye lubricated, as you may have difficulty closing it fully, and a gentle face massage. I’ll order the blood test to rule out other possible causes, such as stroke or infection. Once we have the results, we can start the steroid treatment right away. I'll also give you a prescription for artificial tears and instructions on how to protect your eye. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Look, Doctor, frankly, this all sounds rather… inconvenient. Corticosteroids? Side effects? I have a very busy schedule, as I’ve mentioned. Will this medication make me tired? Will it affect my appetite? I can’t afford to be laid up in bed for weeks. I have commitments. Just tell me the bare minimum I need to know to get through this, and let’s get this over with. And please, don’t sugarcoat it. I prefer honesty, however unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry about the potential side effects, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I’ll be as upfront as possible. Corticosteroids can have some side effects, but they are usually mild and temporary. You may experience some increased appetite, temporary fluid retention, and potentially some mood changes. Rarely, they can cause more serious side effects, such as elevated blood sugar levels, but we’ll monitor your blood sugar closely. The good news is that these side effects are usually manageable, and they typically resolve once you finish the course of medication. I’ll prescribe a standard course of prednisone for 10 days. It’s important to take it exactly as directed, and to complete the full course even if you start to feel better. I’ll also give you instructions on how to manage any potential side effects. I'll also write a prescription for artificial tears to keep your eye moist, and recommend using it frequently throughout the day, especially before bed. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to assess your progress and adjust the treatment if needed. Do you have any questions about the medication or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: One week? Very well. I suppose that's as good as anything. And look, Doctor, if this medication doesn't work, I don't want to be kept waiting. I have a reputation to maintain, and I can't afford to be seen with a drooping face. Is that understood? Honestly, this whole ordeal is rather… disruptive. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a very important meeting to attend. Can we please get this paperwork sorted quickly? I haven’t got all day. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concerns and will ensure we monitor your progress closely. If you don’t see any improvement within a few days, or if your symptoms worsen, please contact the clinic immediately, and we can discuss other options. Here are the prescriptions for prednisone and artificial tears, and this is the paperwork with instructions on how to use them and potential side effects. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you a speedy recovery, Ms. Nissenbaum. .
