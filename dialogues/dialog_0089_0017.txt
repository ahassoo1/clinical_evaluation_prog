DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Uh… well, I’m here for… a checkup. For the team. Yes, the team needs me to get this done. It’s… important. I think. It’s for… sports.
DOCTOR: Okay, a checkup for sports. That’s good! We want to make sure you're in good shape for your team. Just to be clear, what sport are you involved in, and is this a routine check-up, or are you having any specific concerns or symptoms that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Sports… hmm. It’s… with the guys. You know, throwing things. And running. Mostly running. I don’t… recall exactly what they call it. It’s… a man’s game. No, no concerns. Just gotta have the paper, so they let me play. It's for the tryouts, you see. Seems silly, all this paperwork, but… they insist.
DOCTOR: Alright, “throwing things and running”… sounds like it could be a number of things, but we'll get it sorted. So, just to be sure, have you experienced any pain, injuries, shortness of breath, or dizziness recently – anything at all that might affect your ability to participate?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes my knees creak. Old age, you know? And I get winded easily. But that's just… being out of practice. Nothin’ serious. Dizziness… maybe when I stand up too fast. But who doesn’t? I’m a strong man, Doctor. Always been strong. A little creaky, a little tired… it’s normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees creaking, getting winded, and occasional dizziness when standing up. Those are good things to mention, thank you. Let’s just get a few more details. When do your knees typically creak?
PATIENT: When…? Uh… mostly in the morning. And after… sitting for a long time. Like… after watching TV. Or… when the weather's bad. Makes 'em ache, too, sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. Just… a little discomfort. It's nothin' a little rub can’t fix.
DOCTOR: Alright, morning stiffness and discomfort with weather changes. That gives us a bit more to work with. And how about the dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… hmm. Like I said, when I stand up quick. And… sometimes when I turn my head too fast. It’s not… fall-down dizziness, you know? Just… whooshy. Goes away pretty quick. I don't make a fuss about it. Old man things, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, “whooshy” dizziness with quick movements. Now, I’m just going to ask a few quick questions about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Uh… I don’t think so. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a problem. I took some medicine once, a long time ago, for a cough. But I don’t remember what it was. Never been one for pills, if I can help it. Makes me sleepy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, and prefer to avoid medication if possible. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I told you, I don’t like pills. Just… a little muscle rub sometimes. For the knees. That’s it. I believe in letting the body heal itself. That and a good night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? I don't think so. The doctor, back… somewhere, maybe said somethin' about it once. But I didn't pay much attention. I feel fine. Always felt fine. Diabetes… no. I like sweets, you see. So, that couldn't be it. I just... forget these things. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible mention of high blood pressure in the past, but you feel fine now. Let's move on to surgeries. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Now that I remember. When I was a boy… I fell off a roof. Broke my arm. Had to get it fixed. But that was… a long time ago. And… I think I had my tonsils out. But honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit hazy. So many years… I just recall a lot of white coats and… pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, broken arm as a child and tonsillectomy. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My… my father, he had… something with his heart. But he didn’t go to the doctor much. Tough man, my father. Didn't believe in complainin’. My mother… she lived a long life. Healthy as a horse, she was. Didn’t get sick much. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t remember much about their health. It was… a long time ago. They're gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with heart problems, mother healthy. Now, I'm just going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no. Never smoked a day in my life. Bad for you, you know. My father, he used to smoke cigars sometimes. Stank up the whole house. But I never touched 'em. No, no smoke for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol…? I have a beer sometimes. With the guys. Just… a couple. On weekends. Nothing fancy. Nothing that would… bother anyone. It's just… social, you see. Keeps the spirits up. Not every day, mind you. Mostly when we watch the games.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional beer. And finally, do you have any regular physical activity or exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise…? Well… I run. When the team gets together. That is exercise, isn’t it? It’s… strenuous. Throwing the ball, chasing after it… it takes a lot outta a man. And… I walk sometimes. To the store. Does that count? I'm an active man, Doctor. Always been active. Even if I am gettin’ a little creaky.
DOCTOR: Okay, running with the team and walking. Alright, Mr. Bartok, that’s a lot of helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of how things are. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just… don’t expect miracles. I’m an old man, you know. A little worn around the edges. But I'm still a strong man, at heart. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your knees. Please, just relax. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. We’ll need to keep an eye on that. Your heart and lungs sound good, though your heart rate is a little on the faster side. And your knees... I can feel some crepitus, which is that grinding sensation you mentioned. There’s a little tenderness on the inside of your right knee, and it feels a bit uncomfortable when I bend it. Do you feel the discomfort there specifically when you run?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s it! The inside of the right knee. It’s been botherin’ me for… a while now. Not bad enough to stop playin’, mind you. But… when I push off. And when I turn. That's when it really aches. It's a little ache. Like somethin’ is rubbin’ together. Is it bad, Doctor? Will I have to stop playin’? I need to play. The team needs me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like you likely have some mild osteoarthritis in your right knee, potentially with some minor ligament strain. It's common, especially with activity. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to stop playing, but we need to manage it carefully. I’m looking at your records now, and it seems like you haven’t had a full check-up in several years. And your blood pressure reading today is a concern. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work to check your cholesterol and kidney function, and an X-ray of your right knee to assess the extent of the arthritis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an X-ray? That sounds… serious. Will it take long? And… will it be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see. I just need to get this paper for the team. Is there somethin’ simpler? Can’t you just… write somethin’ down? Tell me I'm okay?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bartok. The tests aren’t meant to scare you, just to give me a more complete picture of your health so I can make the best recommendations. The blood work is a simple draw, and the X-ray is quick and painless. Regarding cost, I’ll have my nurse check your insurance coverage and let you know what your out-of-pocket expenses will be. We can also discuss options to minimize costs if needed. Now, to be honest, I can’t simply “write something down” without proper evaluation. That wouldn't be ethical or responsible medical care. I need to ensure you’re safe to participate in strenuous activity. High blood pressure, for example, can be dangerous if left unmanaged. I want to help you stay active and enjoy playing with your team, but I also have a responsibility to protect your health. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood work and X-ray?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. You're right. You're the doctor. I guess… I guess I have no choice. But… could we do it quickly? I don't want to be away from the team for too long. And… could you tell me what to expect? I don’t like surprises. And what if… what if it’s bad news? What if I can’t play anymore?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bartok. We’ll get this done as quickly as possible. First, my nurse will draw a small sample of blood. It’ll just be a quick prick of a needle, and it usually only takes a few minutes. Then, we’ll send you down the hall for an X-ray. It’s a quick scan of your knee, and it won’t cause any discomfort. As for what to expect… the blood work will give us information about your overall health, including your cholesterol levels and kidney function. The X-ray will show us the condition of the bones and cartilage in your knee. If we find something concerning, we’ll discuss all your options, including physical therapy, pain management, and, if necessary, referral to an orthopedist. I want to assure you that we'll explore every possible avenue to get you back on the field safely. And even if it means modifying your activity level, we'll work together to find a solution that works for you. Let me write down the instructions for the blood work and X-ray. My nurse, Sarah, will be right in to assist you. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Just… please, be quick. And… don’t tell me anything too bad. I just want to play. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Bartok, that’s not too much to ask at all. And I promise, we’ll do everything we can to get you back on the field safely. Sarah will be with you shortly. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns along the way.
