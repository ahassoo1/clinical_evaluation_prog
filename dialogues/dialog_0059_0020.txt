DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. I… how you say… telehealth appointment, yes? My… the lady on the phone, she say come in for… check-up. Is all okay, but… just to be sure, you know? After my husband… is good to check.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you scheduled a general check-up. And I understand you wanted to come in for some reassurance after your husband’s recent health concerns – that’s perfectly reasonable. We’re happy to do that. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with your health?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… not much, really. I feel… okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but… I work a lot, you know? With the cars… is hard work. No pain, no… big problems. Just… old, maybe? I am fifty-seven. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Fifty-seven is certainly not a problem, Ms. Benites! It’s a good age, and it’s wise to be proactive about your health. Feeling a little tired with a demanding job is quite common. We can definitely explore that further. When you say "with the cars," are you a mechanic?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Mechanic. For… long time. Thirty years, maybe more. Is good job, I like it. But… is heavy work, yes? Lifting, bending… sometimes I ache. Mostly in my back, but… nothing I can’t handle. Yet.
DOCTOR: Thirty years is a long time – that’s very impressive. And I understand how physically demanding auto repair can be. The lifting and bending certainly could contribute to some aches and pains. Let’s talk about those aches a bit more specifically. Where exactly in your back do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Mostly… lower back, Doctor. Right side. Not all the time, you know? When I bend over to get a tool, or… when I am working under a car for long time. Sometimes it is just… stiff. Other times it feels like… a pull, you know? Not sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. And sometimes it goes down my leg a little. Not always, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, right side, with some stiffness and occasionally a pulling sensation that radiates down your leg. That’s helpful to know. And it sounds like it’s often related to bending and prolonged work in awkward positions. Does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes. When I stop working, it gets better. Rest, you know? And… sometimes I take a little… how you say… ibuprofen. The white pills. They help a little. But… I don’t like to take them all the time. Not good for the stomach, my mother say.
DOCTOR: Rest and ibuprofen, that’s good information. And your mother is right to be cautious about long-term ibuprofen use – it can sometimes cause stomach issues. Now, besides the back pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… I… sometimes I feel a little… dizzy when I stand up too fast. Not often, but… sometimes. And… I am more tired than before, I think. Even with the work. It is hard to say… is it the work, or… something else?
DOCTOR: Dizziness when standing up and increased fatigue – those are both things we should investigate further. It’s good that you’re noticing these changes. We will figure out if it is related to the work or if something else is going on. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. The doctor… when I first come to this country, he say I am healthy. No high blood pressure, no… sugar problems. I have had… the flu sometimes, colds, you know? Normal things. Nothing serious. My husband, he had… problems with his heart, but… I am okay. Mostly healthy, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, no previous diagnoses of any chronic conditions. And you mentioned your husband has heart problems. Has anyone else in your family had any significant medical issues, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Yes… my father, he had… problems with his breathing. When he was old, very old. The doctor say it was… the lungs. And my sister, she has… arthritis in her hands. She can’t do much with them, she say. The rest… I don’t know. We don’t see family much, you know? Not much family.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father had lung problems, and your sister has arthritis. That’s helpful information. Now, I'd like to ask about any medications you’re currently taking – including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements. You mentioned ibuprofen occasionally, but anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Only the ibuprofen, when I need it. And… sometimes I take a little vitamin D, in the winter. But… not all the time. The lady at the store, she say is good for the bones. But I forget sometimes to take it, you know? I am not good with remembering pills.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Many people find it difficult to remember medications. So, just ibuprofen as needed and occasional vitamin D. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I can eat everything. No problem with the pollen, or… the animals. Sometimes I get a little… itchy when I touch some plants, but… nothing serious. Just a little itch. No big allergy, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmm… I work a lot, you know? Six days a week, sometimes seven. I don’t have much time for… fun. I eat… okay. I like to cook, mostly Czech food. Not much exercise, I am sorry. Standing up and working on the cars, is my exercise, I think. I don’t smoke, and I drink… sometimes a glass of wine with dinner. Not much lifestyle, I am afraid. Mostly work.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Benites. It sounds like you’re a very hardworking person. We can work with that. Okay, thank you for sharing all of that information. It gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is okay. Whatever you need. Just… be gentle, please? My back… sometimes is sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Benites. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. …Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. That’s within a normal range. Now, I will gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not much. A little… pressure, maybe. But not pain. There… a little tender. But it is okay. I think I maybe bumped it on something at the shop.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness in the lower right abdomen. I'll make a note of that. It's possible you strained it at the shop. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. …Your reflexes are normal. Now, I'd like to assess your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh… Is… difficult. My back… it is stiff. I can’t reach all the way. Sorry. It hurts a little.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Benites. No need to push yourself. I can see that your back is limiting your range of motion. That is important information. Now, I’m going to check your feet for any swelling or signs of neuropathy. …Your feet look good, no swelling or concerning changes. Your sensation seems intact. Okay, that concludes the physical exam for today. Thank you for your patience. Based on the information you’ve provided and the exam findings, I think it’s important to order some blood work to help rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue and dizziness. We also need to get an X-ray of your lower back. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is okay. Blood work… and the X-ray. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know… what is wrong, you know? So… is it bad? The back, I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Benites. It’s good that we’re getting this checked out. It's too early to say definitively if there's anything bad wrong. The blood work will help us rule out several things, and the X-ray will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on with your back. It could be a simple muscle strain, or something else. We won’t know until we get the results. I'm going to write you a referral for the blood work and X-ray. The lab and imaging center are both conveniently located near the clinic. Do you have any questions about scheduling those appointments?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I can manage. The lady on the phone, she will help, yes? She always very nice. I just… I hope is not too expensive. My insurance… is Medicare, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s right, you have Medicare, I remember. The lab and imaging center both accept Medicare, so your out-of-pocket costs should be minimal. The receptionist will be happy to help you understand the costs before you schedule anything. In the meantime, I recommend taking it easy and avoiding any strenuous activity that aggravates your back pain. You can continue taking ibuprofen as needed for the pain, but try not to exceed the recommended dosage. We will schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today to discuss the results of the blood work and X-ray. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A week is good. And thank you. For everything. You explain everything so… clearly. I feel… better now, just knowing what is happening. Thank you. Really.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. That’s my job – to help you understand what’s going on and to provide the best possible care. I'm glad you feel a little better. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here is the referral for the blood work and X-ray, and a summary of today's visit. I wish you a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again next week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. .
