DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. Lower part, you see. It's been acting up again. It’s a bit… difficult to explain, truthfully. My memory isn't what it once was, and these spells… they come and go. I do know it’s connected to… well, the condition I have. The one with the immune system. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, is that right? It’s just… painful, and it worries me.
DOCTOR: Right, Lupus. Yes, I see that in your records. It can certainly cause a variety of abdominal issues. “Acting up” is… vague, though. Could you be a bit more specific about the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… yes. That is hard. It’s not… a constant ache, not usually. It comes in waves, like a tightening. And… a cramping, very deep down. Sometimes it feels like… like something is twisting. And it’s not just the pain, it’s… discomfort. I have trouble… well, with moving things along, if you understand what I mean. It's… upsetting, and I've been feeling rather tired, too. Is that helpful at all? I apologize for being so… imprecise.
DOCTOR: It’s… passable. Waves of tightening and cramping, deep abdominal pain, and difficulty with bowel movements. And fatigue. Have you noticed anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, triggers… that's a good question. I… I honestly haven't been able to pinpoint anything specific. It seems to come out of nowhere. Though… now that you mention it, perhaps stress makes it worse. I had a bit of a… disagreement with a relative a few weeks back, and it was particularly bad around then. But then again, it has flared up at other times when I've been perfectly calm. I truly can’t say with any certainty, Doctor. It’s rather frustrating, you see. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Right. Stress can be a factor with Lupus flares, of course. But unpredictable episodes are common. Have you noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… my stool? Well… I… I apologize, Doctor, this is rather… personal. I… it’s been looser than usual, a few times. And… darker. Not dramatically, but… noticeable. It's also been… harder to pass, despite being looser, if that makes any sense. It's a very confusing situation, I assure you. I haven’t seen any… blood, thankfully, but everything else is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Looser, darker stools, and difficulty passing them despite the consistency. We’ll need to investigate this further. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then I’ll order some blood work and a stool sample. Do you have any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. An exam sounds sensible. Allergies… let me think. I had a rather unpleasant reaction to penicillin as a child, so I avoid that. And… I think I was mildly allergic to some sort of pain reliever once, but I can't recall the name. It caused… a rash, I believe. Nothing too severe, but I prefer to steer clear of anything new if possible. Do you have a list I could review? My memory is… unreliable, as I’ve mentioned. It would be far easier to simply say yes or no to a pre-printed form, if you have one.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. A mild rash… that’s… not terribly helpful, unfortunately. We’ll proceed cautiously. I don’t have a pre-printed form, Ms. Glymph, but we’ll keep it simple. Let’s just stick to the basics for now. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, I’ll gently palpate – press on – your belly to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know immediately if anything is painful. Alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Perfectly reasonable. Listening and pressing… I understand. And I will let you know if anything feels… unpleasant. Immediately, as you say. It’s just… I do bruise easily, so please be gentle. I don't wish to cause any unnecessary discomfort. Whenever you are ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take some deep breaths for me, Ms. Glymph. In… and out… Good. I’m not hearing anything particularly concerning at the moment… Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any tenderness, anywhere. Starting here… on your right side.
PATIENT: Oh… yes, deep breaths. Right. Ooh… that's a bit… tender, actually. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. It's a dull ache, rather than a sharp pain. It feels… deeper than the surface, if that makes any sense. Please… perhaps a little less pressure there? It's… a sensitive area.
DOCTOR: Right. Tenderness on the right side, deeper pain. Alright. Let’s move to the left side. Anything there?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Not as pronounced as on the right, but… there is a discomfort. It feels… almost like a cramping sensation. A tightening. It’s… unpleasant, but I can tolerate it. It’s… it's difficult to describe, Doctor. It's not a specific pain, so much as a general feeling of… unease.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about lower abdomen?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That’s where the real discomfort is. It’s… a deep ache, like a heavy pressure. And the cramping sensation is much more pronounced there. It’s… upsetting, actually. Please… be gentle, Doctor. It's rather sensitive. It feels like… something is pressing inward. It’s difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Tenderness throughout, with more pronounced discomfort in the lower abdomen. It's consistent with what you've described. I'll order some blood work to assess your inflammation markers and rule out any infection. And a stool sample to check for any abnormalities. We also need to order a CT scan of your abdomen. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A CT scan… Oh dear. That sounds… rather serious. Questions… yes. Will the CT scan… expose me to a lot of radiation? And… will it require any… special preparation? I'm not particularly fond of… procedures, you see. And… will the results take a long time to come back? I do worry about waiting for news. It's all rather… overwhelming, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The radiation exposure from a CT scan is minimal, Ms. Glymph, far less than you receive from background radiation naturally. As for preparation, you'll need to drink a contrast solution the day before – it helps us see the details of your organs. It doesn’t taste great, but it's manageable. And yes, it will take a few days for the results to come back, perhaps three to five business days. We'll call you as soon as we have them. Look, these are standard procedures to rule things out. We need to be thorough. Do you have any other concerns I should address?
PATIENT: Oh… minimal radiation. And a… contrast solution. I see. Well… I suppose not. Though… I do worry about what it might find, you see. Is it… is it likely to be something serious, Doctor? I have… a tendency to catastrophize, as my daughter says. And I worry about… well, the Lupus getting worse. Is that a possibility? I just… I want to know what to expect, if you understand. I apologize for being so… anxious. It’s just… it’s unsettling to think about.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Glymph, catastrophizing won't help anyone. The scan is to rule things out. It could be something as simple as a flare-up. It could be something more complex. It’s impossible to say without looking at the images. Yes, Lupus can worsen. It's a chronic condition, and flares are part of the course. But we'll deal with it when and if we have to. Right now, we need to gather information. I'm ordering the scan. And I’m referring you to a gastroenterologist for a second opinion. They specialize in digestive issues. That’s the responsible thing to do. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist… Yes, I understand. A second opinion… that seems… sensible. Will I… will I need to fast before the CT scan? And… what kind of contrast solution is it? Is it… unpleasant? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. It's just… I like to be prepared. And… I worry about being a bother. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and feel… better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: You will need to fast for four hours before the scan. The contrast solution is… a barium-based liquid. It tastes chalky and can cause bloating and diarrhea afterward. It’s not pleasant, but it's temporary. The radiology department will give you specific instructions. And no, you’re not a bother. You’re asking legitimate questions. I’ve sent the orders to the lab and radiology department. They’ll call you to schedule the appointments. I’m also sending a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a gastroenterologist. Her office will contact you. Do you have any other questions now, or can we wrap this up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For your time. I’ll… I’ll wait for the calls. And… I’ll try not to worry. Goodbye, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Goodbye, Ms. Glymph.
