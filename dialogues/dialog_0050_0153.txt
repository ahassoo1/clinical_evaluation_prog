DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Paraskevopoulos, is it? Yes, yes… well, it’s about this… clearance thing. For… acting, I think? Something about a performance physical. Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy. They just sent me here. I hope it won’t take too long.
DOCTOR: A performance physical, you say. Very well. While I appreciate your… brevity, Mr. Krahn, a thorough examination is necessary to ensure your well-being and provide an accurate assessment for these requirements. It will take some time, I assure you. Let's begin with a little more detail. Could you clarify what kind of performance this is for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Right, details. See, I do bits of everything, really. Ushering, tickets… sometimes they need extras for things. Plays, maybe? Or… a commercial? It was a younger man who booked me, very enthusiastic. I don't recall the name. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. I just show up where they tell me and do what they ask. It’s not… strenuous, usually. Mostly standing and smiling. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Standing and smiling. While that sounds uncomplicated, Mr. Krahn, even seemingly minor roles require a baseline level of physical capability. We need to document everything appropriately. Let's move on, then. I’ll ask some questions, and please do your best to recall as much as possible. First, have you had any recent illnesses, even a simple cold, in the past few months?
PATIENT: Hmm… a cold… let me think. There was something back in… spring, I believe? A bit of a cough, a sniffle. Nothing serious, just… one of those things. I took some… over-the-counter medicine. The usual. It cleared up quickly, though. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pretty healthy man for my age. I keep moving, you see. Can’t stand to be idle. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: “Pretty healthy” is…subjective, Mr. Krahn. We must be precise. And while staying active is commendable, it doesn't preclude underlying conditions. Let’s review your medical history a bit more thoroughly. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Chronic… Now you're asking things… Let me see… The divorce was pretty chronic, if that counts. No, seriously, I don't think so. The doctors… back when my wife was still… around… they never said anything about anything like that. Just the usual check-ups. I remember a bit of trouble with my back once, years ago. Lifting something heavy, I think. But it healed up fine. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time, to be honest. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: A history of infrequent medical care is relevant, Mr. Krahn. It means we have less information to work with. And “healed up fine” is not a diagnosis. We’ll need to be more specific. Tell me about this back trouble. When did it occur?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… Right. It was… a long time ago. Probably… fifteen, maybe twenty years back? I was helping a friend move some furniture. A very heavy dresser, I remember. Pulled something in my lower back. It was quite painful for a while. I saw a… a chiropractor, I think? He cracked and popped things for a few weeks. It got better, gradually. I haven't had any trouble with it since. Really. I’m careful now, I lift with my legs, you know? Do you need the chiropractor’s name? I doubt I remember it. Is this getting to the point? I have a… a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: A “lunch appointment” is not a substitute for a thorough medical evaluation, Mr. Krahn. We are attempting to establish a baseline of your physical condition to ensure you are fit for this…performance role. Your cooperation is expected. Now, regarding this chiropractor… it’s not about the name specifically, but did they provide any sort of diagnosis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Diagnosis… They said… something about a… a slipped disc? Or a pinched nerve? It was a long time ago, Doctor, and I wasn’t really listening to all the medical jargon. They gave me some exercises to do, and told me to avoid heavy lifting. I followed their advice, and it went away. Honestly, I don’t recall the specifics. Is this important? I mean, it was years ago, and I feel perfectly fine now. I just want to get this clearance and be on my way. My friend is counting on me.
DOCTOR: “Perfectly fine” is not a medical assessment, Mr. Krahn. We must document all relevant information, even if it occurred years ago. A history of a slipped disc, even if resolved, warrants further inquiry. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That’s… difficult. My parents passed away a long time ago. My mother… she had… something with her heart, I think. She was always tired. My father… he was a strong man, but he had high blood pressure, I believe. And my sister… she had something with her… stomach, I think. But honestly, Doctor, I wasn’t very close to my family. We didn’t talk about these things. It was… a different time. I don’t have much information. Is it necessary to go into all this detail? I’m starting to feel quite anxious. Is there a way to speed things up?
DOCTOR: “A different time” does not negate the importance of family medical history, Mr. Krahn. It provides valuable clues to potential genetic predispositions. While a lack of specific information is… unfortunate, we will make note of it. Let’s try a different approach. Do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… No, not really. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache. Aspirin, I think. Or ibuprofen. Whatever’s on the shelf at the drugstore. And sometimes, when my knees bother me, I take something for the pain. But it’s not regular. Only when I need it. And I take vitamins, sometimes. Multivitamins. To stay healthy, you know? Is that what you want to know? I try to take care of myself, even if I don’t remember everything. It’s all a bit of a blur, Doctor. Honestly.
DOCTOR: “Sometimes” and “Whatever’s on the shelf” are not adequate responses, Mr. Krahn. We need to establish a complete list of all substances you ingest. Very well. Let's proceed to a brief physical examination. I will need you to stand and allow me to assess your range of motion and check your vital signs. Please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Oh. A physical examination… I… I suppose that’s necessary. But my knees are a bit creaky, you know? And my back… well, we already discussed my back. I hope it won't be too strenuous. Please be gentle. Is this going to take much longer? I really need to get going. My friend…
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I assure you, I will be as efficient as possible. However, a thorough examination is non-negotiable. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. And breathe normally. 140 over 85. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. 78 beats per minute. Regular. 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Now, please step onto the scale. 118 pounds. That’s… quite low for your height.
PATIENT: Oh. Low? Well, I’ve always been… slender. I don’t eat a lot, you know? I don’t have much of an appetite. And I keep moving, so… I burn a lot of calories. I suppose. Is it a problem? I feel fine, Doctor. Really. Just a bit… tired sometimes. Can we hurry this up a bit? My friend is expecting me. I really don't want to keep him waiting.
DOCTOR: “Fine” is a subjective assessment, Mr. Krahn. And a weight of 118 pounds at your height of 199 centimeters is concerning. It necessitates further investigation. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please inform me if you experience any discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh… A little… yes. Just a bit tender. It’s nothing serious, I think. I get indigestion sometimes. And… well, my bowels haven’t been regular lately. I haven't really been eating much, you know? Please be gentle, Doctor. It’s… sensitive. Is this going to take much longer? I really need to get going. I don’t want to cause any trouble. I just want to be cleared for this performance. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: “Not eating much” and “irregular bowels” coupled with tenderness upon palpation are not reassuring, Mr. Krahn. I'm concerned about potential malnutrition and possible underlying gastrointestinal issues. Now, I need to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath. Breathing is slightly labored, but within acceptable limits. Heart sounds are… normal. Now, your knees. Any pain with movement?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees… Yes, a bit. Especially when I bend them. It’s been getting worse lately. It’s just… old age, I suppose. I used to be very active, but… I don’t move around as much anymore. It’s just a bit stiff and achy. Nothing serious, really. I can still walk, you know? I just… take it easy. Is something wrong, Doctor? Are you finding something? Please just tell me straight. I really need to get going. My friend is counting on me. I just want to be cleared for this performance. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I'm concerned about several findings during this examination. Your low weight, tenderness upon palpation of your abdomen, labored breathing, and discomfort in your knees, coupled with your reported history of infrequent eating and irregular bowel movements, are all red flags. Based on this preliminary assessment, I cannot clear you for any performance role at this time. I strongly recommend further investigation. I will order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool analysis. Additionally, I recommend a consultation with a gastroenterologist to evaluate your abdominal discomfort and a consultation with an orthopedist to address your knee pain. I understand you have a lunch appointment, but your health is my primary concern. I will have my staff schedule these appointments for you. In the meantime, I advise you to increase your caloric intake and ensure you are consuming a balanced diet. .
