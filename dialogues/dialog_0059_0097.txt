DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… adequate to meet you as well. I am here because, well, my husband insists. He says we need to have… arrangements made. Something about what happens if… things go awry. He mentioned a form. An “Advance Directive,” I believe he called it. I must confess, I find the whole discussion rather morbid, but he is quite insistent.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Marija. It is a difficult conversation to have, and it’s very common for people to feel uncomfortable discussing these matters. Your husband is very thoughtful to be proactive, though. An Advance Directive – sometimes called a living will – is a very important document. It outlines your wishes for medical care should you become unable to communicate them yourself. So, we’re essentially discussing preparing for potential future medical scenarios. We don't expect anything to happen, but having a plan in place can be incredibly helpful for both you and your family. To start, perhaps we can simply talk about what’s important to you regarding your healthcare values?
PATIENT: Values? Honestly, Doctor, I expect competent care. I pay my taxes, I maintain a… certain standard of living. I believe in proper hygiene and a sensible diet. Is that what you mean by "values?" It seems a rather… abstract question. I simply wish to be treated with respect and not subjected to any… unnecessary fuss. I find prolonged illness… distasteful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Marija. And very helpful to know. You're right, sometimes these terms can be a bit abstract. When I ask about values, I'm trying to understand what’s most important to you if you were ever in a situation where you couldn’t make decisions for yourself. For example, would you want us to do everything medically possible to extend your life, even if the quality of life was significantly reduced?
PATIENT: Reduced quality of life? Doctor, that is precisely what I am trying to avoid. No, absolutely not. Prolonging suffering serves no purpose. I have seen enough of that in my life. If… if it is clear there is no hope of recovery, no possibility of a return to a dignified existence, then… then no. I do not wish to be kept alive by machines. It’s… undignified. My husband… he worries about everything. He’d have me hooked up to every device imaginable. He means well, but… he lacks a certain… realism.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’re prioritizing quality of life and a dignified existence, and you don’t want aggressive interventions if there’s no realistic chance of recovery. That’s a very clear and important preference, Marija. We will absolutely ensure that's reflected in any documentation. To clarify, when you say "no realistic chance of recovery," are we talking about a permanent inability to regain a reasonable quality of life, or does that also include situations where recovery is possible, but would involve a prolonged and difficult rehabilitation?
PATIENT: A prolonged and difficult rehabilitation… That depends, doesn't it? If it is a swift recovery, a matter of weeks, then perhaps. But if it involves years of therapy, constant pain, and… and becoming dependent on others? No. Absolutely not. I have always prided myself on my independence. I do not wish to be a burden. My husband… he'd insist on every possible treatment, regardless of the outcome. He’d have me in physical therapy until my last breath, simply because “it might help.” It’s… exhausting just thinking about it. He lacks… practicality.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Marija. It sounds like you have a very good understanding of what you want and what's important to you. So, to summarize: you’re comfortable with medical treatment that offers a reasonable chance of a full recovery within a reasonable timeframe, but you do not want prolonged, aggressive interventions if the outcome is unlikely to restore your independence and quality of life. Now, an Advance Directive typically includes two main parts: a Living Will, which outlines your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment, and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, which designates someone to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. You've already expressed your wishes for the Living Will portion. Would you like to discuss who you would want to designate as your Healthcare Power of Attorney?
PATIENT: Naturally, it would be my husband. Despite his… excessive optimism and penchant for unnecessary procedures, he is my husband. And he is… persistent. He would certainly ensure my wishes are… communicated. Though I doubt he would agree with them, he would at least see them carried out, if only to prove he is correct about everything. He is rather… controlling, you see. But I suppose that is what one expects after forty years of marriage. As long as there is a clear stipulation that my wishes take precedence, I suppose it will suffice. He simply must be reminded – frequently – of what those wishes are.
DOCTOR: I understand, Marija. It's common for families to have differing opinions, and it's good that he’s willing to advocate for your wishes, even if he doesn't entirely agree with them. We can certainly include a statement in the document emphasizing that your preferences should be prioritized. Now, to be thorough, we also need to consider what types of treatments you would want, even in difficult circumstances. For example, would you want artificial nutrition and hydration if you were unable to eat or drink?
PATIENT: Artificial… sustenance? Doctor, are you suggesting I would be reduced to being fed like an infant? The very thought is… appalling. No. Absolutely not. If I am unable to nourish myself, then I wish to be allowed to… to pass on. I do not wish to be kept alive artificially. It is undignified and… frankly, rather barbaric. My husband… he’d insist, of course. He believes any extension of life is worthwhile, regardless of the circumstances. He'd have me hooked up to tubes for years, simply because "it might help." He lacks all sense of… proportion.
DOCTOR: I understand, Marija. You are very clear in your wishes regarding artificial nutrition and hydration. We will document that you do not wish to receive these interventions if you are unable to eat or drink naturally. One final area to consider is resuscitation. If your heart were to stop beating, would you want us to attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other life-saving measures?
PATIENT: Resuscitation? Doctor, that sounds… undignified as well. No. Absolutely not. If my time has come, then let it come. I do not wish to be… jolted back to life only to suffer further indignities. I have lived a full life. I have no desire to cling to existence at all costs. My husband… he would insist, naturally. He believes any attempt to preserve life is worthwhile, regardless of the circumstances. He'd have me hooked up to machines, tubes, and… and everything imaginable, simply because "it might help." He lacks… a realistic perspective. He simply cannot accept the inevitability of… the natural order.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marija. You have been very clear and thoughtful in expressing your wishes. To summarize, you do not wish to receive artificial nutrition and hydration, nor do you wish to undergo CPR if your heart were to stop beating. Now, we will put all of this into a formal Advance Directive document. It will need to be signed and witnessed. Do you have anyone specific you would like to be present when we sign it?
PATIENT: Naturally, my husband. He must be present. He needs to hear it all reiterated, documented, and… and officially sanctioned. He may still disagree, but at least he will be bound by… by official procedure. And perhaps, just perhaps, it will finally convince him to accept my… rational perspective. Though I highly doubt it. He is a remarkably… stubborn man. But it is necessary. He needs to be involved, despite his… reservations.
DOCTOR: Very well, Marija. I will schedule an appointment for you and your husband to come in and sign the Advance Directive. I will explain the document thoroughly to both of you at that time. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have covered everything, despite my… initial reluctance. You have been remarkably patient, considering my… aversion to discussing such morbid matters. I suppose, for the sake of my… sanity, it is best to have it all formalized. And, frankly, to have it documented where my husband cannot… conveniently misinterpret my wishes. So, no. I have no further questions. Unless… will this document actually prevent him from… insisting on unnecessary procedures? Because, frankly, that is my primary concern.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Marija. While an Advance Directive is a legally binding document, and healthcare providers are obligated to follow its instructions, it’s not always foolproof. It’s possible your husband might still express his opinions, and in a crisis situation, it can sometimes be difficult to ensure the document is immediately accessible and followed. However, it does provide a very strong legal and ethical basis for refusing unwanted treatment. We will make sure it is prominently noted in your medical record, and we can also discuss strategies for communicating your wishes to healthcare providers in an emergency. Ultimately, it’s about ensuring your voice is heard and your preferences are respected, even when you are unable to speak for yourself. Would you like me to provide you with a copy of the document to keep with you, as well?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a copy for myself is essential. And perhaps… perhaps a brightly colored label stating "READ ADVANCE DIRECTIVE BEFORE PROCEEDING" would be beneficial? I do not wish to rely solely on the goodwill of… well, anyone, frankly. My husband, despite his… intentions, tends to be rather… persuasive when faced with a medical crisis. A brightly colored label seems… prudent. And if you have a laminated card summarizing my wishes, that would be even better. I may need to… brandish it in a moment of desperation.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent ideas, Marija. We can certainly provide you with a laminated card summarizing your wishes, and I’ll make a note to see if we can get a brightly colored label for your medical file. We also have information on medical alert bracelets with similar information, if that would be of interest. I’m glad you’re taking these steps to ensure your preferences are known and respected. I will schedule the appointment for you and your husband. It will likely take about an hour, to go through the document thoroughly and answer any questions. Would next Tuesday afternoon work for you both?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon would be… adequate, Doctor. As long as it is understood that I will not be… swayed by my husband's… optimistic pronouncements. And please, ensure the room is… well-lit. I do not wish to be subjected to any… ambiguity. A well-lit room is essential for… clarity. And perhaps a comfortable chair for myself. I anticipate a… lengthy ordeal. But yes, Tuesday afternoon will suffice.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I will make a note to ensure the room is well-lit and that you have a comfortable chair. And I will do my best to ensure a clear and productive discussion. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have been… surprisingly accommodating, considering my… disposition. I suppose, for the sake of my sanity, it is best to have this matter finalized. So, no. There is nothing further. Though I do appreciate your… patience. And the prospect of a well-lit room. It is… reassuring. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I require a strong cup of tea. This discussion has been… rather draining.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. It was my pleasure to assist you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions before your appointment. And yes, a strong cup of tea sounds like an excellent idea. You take care. .
