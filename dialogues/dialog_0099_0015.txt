DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mikeisha Boham, 40 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… my sinuses, they been… bothering me. It’s hard to explain, really. Like… pressure, mostly. And… a little bit of pain, sometimes. It’s been going on for… a while now, I think. I don't remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: “A while now.” Right. Vague, but typical. Pressure and pain… sinus issues. Okay. Let's try to be a little more specific. Where exactly is the pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… um… it feels… here. Mostly in my forehead, I think. And… over my nose. Sometimes it feels like it’s behind my eyes, too. It’s hard to say for sure. It just… hurts up there. It doesn't hurt bad, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: “Annoying.” So, a generalized frontal headache with some facial discomfort. And it’s been… how long now?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time. Like I said, I don't remember exactly. Maybe… a few months? Or longer? It comes and goes. Some days it's better, some days it's worse. I don't know if that helps. I work outside a lot, maybe that has something to do with it? I work with the… drills. For oil.
DOCTOR: Oil… right. So, chronic, intermittent frontal headache, facial pressure… exacerbated by occupational exposure. Any nasal congestion?
PATIENT: Congestion? Um… sometimes. Not all the time. When it’s really bad, I have trouble breathing through my nose. But usually, it's not too bad. I just… blow my nose more than usual, I guess. It doesn’t… it doesn’t bother me too much, if that makes sense. It's more the pressure that’s bad.
DOCTOR: Right. So, minimal congestion, primarily pressure. Any fever, chills, or night sweats accompanying this?
PATIENT: Fever… um… I don’t think so. I haven’t checked, really. I don’t usually get fevers. No chills, no… night sweats. I sleep okay, usually. Not too hot, not too cold. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining this. It just feels… bad. In my head. And my face.
DOCTOR: Look, I appreciate you trying. But “feels bad” isn’t a diagnosis. Let's go through the basics. Any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Um… no, not that I know of. Everything looks… normal, I think. I haven’t noticed anything different. I can see okay. I haven't had to change my glasses or anything. I don't even have glasses. No blurry vision, no… double vision. Everything is clear. Is that good?
DOCTOR: Good. No visual disturbances. Okay. Now, have you experienced any recent trauma to your face or head?
PATIENT: Trauma? Um… no. Not that I remember. I work with machines, so… sometimes things fall, or I bump into things, but nothing… serious. No big falls, no… hitting my head hard. Just little bumps and bruises, sometimes. Nothing that felt… important. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Important.” Right. So, no significant head trauma. Alright. Let's do a quick exam. I need to look in your ears, nose, and throat, and feel around your sinuses. It won't take long. Just sit back.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I hope it doesn’t hurt. I don’t like things poking around in my ears.
DOCTOR: Ears are clear. Some cerumen, but nothing obstructing the canal. Nasal mucosa is slightly erythematous, some mild swelling… nothing dramatic. Tenderness to palpation over the frontal sinuses… moderate. Okay. Palpation confirms frontal sinus tenderness. It's likely you have a case of chronic sinusitis. It’s not life-threatening, but it’s clearly bothersome.
PATIENT: Sinusitis? Oh… what does that mean, exactly? Is it… serious? And what can we do about it? I just want it to stop hurting, really.
DOCTOR: It means inflammation of your sinuses, likely due to a low-grade infection or irritation. It's rarely "serious" in the life-threatening sense, but it's certainly unpleasant. Given your occupation, it's probably aggravated by dust and debris. We'll start with a saline nasal rinse twice daily to help clear out the congestion. I'm also going to prescribe a short course of a decongestant. And I strongly recommend wearing a mask at work. If it doesn't improve within a week, or if you develop a fever, severe headache, or vision changes, you need to come back immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Saline rinse… and a decongestant. And a mask at work. Yes, I think so. A mask… okay. I can do that. The saline rinse… how do I do that? Is it… complicated? And where do I get it? I don’t want to bother you again.
DOCTOR: There's a pamphlet with instructions. You can get a saline rinse kit at any pharmacy. It’s a squeeze bottle. You fill it with warm water and saline packets, and you flush your nasal passages. It’s not rocket science. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. A squeeze bottle. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you seeing me. I hope… I hope this helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. See you if it doesn't. There’s the cost of the visit. Stop wasting my time if it doesn’t resolve. .
PATIENT: .
