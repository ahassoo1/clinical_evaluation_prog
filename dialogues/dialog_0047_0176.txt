DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Redeye, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Ivette Redeye. It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Press. Though, honestly, I'd rather not be here, if I'm being frank. These hiccups are driving me mad.
DOCTOR: Well, hiccups are certainly… irritating. How long have they been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started… Tuesday, I believe. So, more than two days now. Definitely more than 48 hours. It's been pretty constant, though sometimes they're a little further apart. It's just... relentless. I haven't had a proper night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: And has anything specific started around Tuesday?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. Tuesday… no, nothing really started that day. Work was the same as usual – managing the bookings at the entertainment center, dealing with the staff… Oh! Actually, my niece, Layla, came to visit. She brought over some… I don't know what you'd call them… those fizzy drinks, the really sweet ones. I had one to be polite. Could it be that? I don't usually drink those.
DOCTOR: It's possible. Sometimes carbonated beverages can trigger hiccups, particularly if you don't normally drink them. But hiccups can have many causes. Do you recall exactly what kind of fizzy drink it was?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... it was a bright pink one. Layla said it was some new flavour... “Dragonfruit Blast” or something silly like that. Lots of bubbles. And very sweet. She loves those kinds of drinks. I only had the one, though, I promise! I just thought I’d mention it, in case it was important. I don’t usually drink anything besides water or tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the drink, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the hiccups. No pain, no heartburn, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. It's just… they won’t stop. They’re exhausting, honestly. It's hard to concentrate at work, and it’s making me quite irritable. My staff are probably sick of me by now!
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your past medical history, Mrs. Redeye?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, thankfully. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was… oh, goodness, decades ago. No heart problems, no diabetes… I’m generally quite healthy, actually. I try to eat well, and I walk whenever I can. I had a bad bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but that was it. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Just over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches, if needed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries other than your appendix?
PATIENT: No, that was it. Just the appendix when I was 16. My mother always said I had a weak constitution as a child, but I grew out of it! I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. That’s why these hiccups are so… baffling. It’s just so unlike me to have something like this go on and on.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… That’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had some trouble with his digestion as he got older. But nothing really… remarkable. No one on either side of the family had any long-term illnesses that I can recall. It's not like there's a history of chronic hiccups or anything! My auntie Safiya used to get terrible indigestion, but that was from all the spicy food she loved. Definitely not the same thing, though.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I might have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally, very rarely, but I don't really drink. And recreational drugs? Never. I run a business, Dr. Press, I can't be… well, you know. I need a clear head!
DOCTOR: And finally, any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Nothing that I’m aware of. I can eat pretty much anything. I've never had a reaction to any medication before either. I did get a few mosquito bites on holiday last year, but that’s hardly an allergy! Honestly, I’m a pretty straightforward case, usually. This is just… very strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a listen to your chest, just to rule out anything obvious. Then we’ll do a quick neurological exam. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it's best to be thorough. Could you please sit up a little straighter?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to do whatever you need. I just want these hiccups to stop. Honestly, it’s starting to drive me mad.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lungs sound clear. Now, could you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Up, down, left, right… Is that alright? I'm trying my best not to blink too much. These hiccups keep making me twitch!
DOCTOR: Good. Stick your tongue out for me, please. Just a quick look.
PATIENT: Like that? Is there anything wrong? It’s a little shaky, maybe, but that’s probably the hiccups. They make everything twitchy.
DOCTOR: Tongue looks normal, some slight tremor, but that’s understandable given the hiccups. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that enough pressure? I'm trying to be as strong as I can, but these hiccups keep making me… distracted. It’s hard to concentrate! They just came again! Hic!
DOCTOR: Okay. Strength appears normal as well. The neurological exam is unremarkable, which is reassuring. Given your history and the physical exam, these hiccups are likely benign and self-limiting. However, hiccups that persist for over 48 hours warrant further investigation, and your case is approaching that timeframe. We should consider some blood work to rule out any underlying metabolic issues.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work? Is it something serious? I just thought it was… you know, a funny turn. Is there anything else we can try first? Perhaps some… a tea? I’ve heard ginger can help with hiccups. I really don’t like needles, Dr. Press.
DOCTOR: A tea won’t hurt, certainly. And no, it's highly unlikely to be serious, but it’s prudent to rule out any easily treatable causes. The blood work will check your electrolytes, kidney function, and basic metabolic panel. It’s a standard precaution, Mrs. Redeye. We’re just being thorough. I’ll order the tests now, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in a week. If the hiccups become significantly worse, or you develop any other symptoms—like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. I understand. Blood work to be thorough. And if anything gets worse, the emergency room. A week… that feels like a long time with these hiccups. But if that’s what we need to do. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. And thank you, Dr. Press, for taking the time to listen. It’s just… incredibly frustrating. Hic!
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the lab technician come and draw the samples. And try to relax. Stress can exacerbate hiccups, ironically. I'll also write you a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication, just in case. It may help calm your nerves. I’ll see you next week. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Dr. Press. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I'll try to relax... though that's easier said than done with these hiccups! I suppose I’ll go and get the blood work done. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Right. The technician will be with you shortly. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
