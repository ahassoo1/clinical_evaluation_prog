DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. Welcome. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. It’s about my foot. This awful sore that just won't go away. It's been bothering me for weeks, and frankly, I expect it to be fixed quickly. I don’t have time for this nonsense.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. A foot sore, you say?
PATIENT: “Sore” is putting it mildly, Doctor. It’s a wound. And a painful one at that. The nurse poked and prodded at it yesterday, and it felt like she was digging into bone. Honestly, the service these days... It’s just not what it used to be. And I do believe the chart says I have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, they call it. That's probably what's causing all this trouble, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you have a history of diabetes. That certainly can contribute to slower healing, and increase the risk of infection. Now, can you tell me a little more about this wound?
PATIENT: Oh, don't tell me. I’ve been told all about it. Slow healing, infection… I've heard it all before. It's on the bottom of my foot, right where the big toe bends. It started as a little blister, I think, after walking barefoot at my granddaughter’s place. Didn’t think much of it at first, but then it just… got worse. It’s red, and it oozes sometimes. And it hurts. Especially when I try to walk. I've been trying to keep it clean, but it's difficult, you know, reaching down there. Honestly, the youth of today wouldn’t last a day doing what I do.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said it started as a blister… about how long ago was that, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It must be… six weeks, maybe seven? Around the time of little Leilani’s birthday. Yes, definitely before the church picnic. I remember because I had to wear sensible shoes for that, and it was dreadful. All these gatherings… still, family is important, isn’t it? Though, they don't understand the importance of a good pair of supportive shoes, I can tell you that much. It’s been getting steadily worse since then, I suppose. It’s not like it suddenly appeared overnight.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to seven weeks… And has the pain been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s never constant, Doctor. What kind of question is that? It’s worse when I put weight on it, naturally. Walking, standing… even just shifting my weight from one foot to the other. And if I try to wear anything other than my slippers, it’s agony. Honestly, my slippers are the only reason I’m still able to get around. They're old and worn, but they’re comfortable, at least. And when I’ve been on my feet for too long, it throbs. A dull, aching throb that keeps me awake at night. You'd think with all my years I'd know how to take care of myself. It’s just… frustrating, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your frustration, Ms. Cannington. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to take a look at the wound itself. Could you please let me examine your foot?
PATIENT: Finally. Took you long enough. Though I must say, I do wish you’d hurry. I have better things to do than sit here and discuss my slippers. Alright, alright. But be gentle, Doctor. And try not to poke too much. It's quite sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see the wound here on the plantar surface, near the metatarsophalangeal joint of the first toe. There’s some erythema—redness—and some… …tenderness to palpation. It appears to be approximately two centimeters in diameter. I also note some maceration of the surrounding skin, which suggests it's been exposed to moisture. Do you have any fever, chills, or feel generally unwell?
PATIENT: Goodness, all those… words. Erythema? Maceration? Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to confuse me? I told you it was red and sore! And no, I don't have a fever, and I don’t feel “generally unwell.” I'm 89 years old. I always feel a bit unwell. Though I did have a bit of a shiver last night, but that was probably just the draft. This house is old, you know. The walls are thin, and the wind whistles through the cracks. And no, I haven't been feeling poorly enough to bother anyone. I've lived through worse, you know. Much worse. So, what does all this fancy examination mean? Is it serious? Will I have to go to the hospital? Because I absolutely will not be going to the hospital.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. No, I don’t believe a hospital stay is necessary at this time. The redness and tenderness are concerning, and given your history of diabetes, it’s important we rule out an infection. I’m going to order a wound culture to identify any bacteria present, and a blood test to check for signs of systemic infection. We’ll also check your blood sugar levels to ensure they’re well-controlled.
PATIENT: Wound culture? Blood tests? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds like you're trying to turn this into a major ordeal! I just want this sore to heal, not become a science experiment. And checking my blood sugar… I already know that's a problem. The nurse poked and prodded at me enough yesterday to confirm that. Honestly, it's always something with this sugar sickness. Is this going to be painful? Will it take long? Because I have a luncheon with the ladies next week, and I absolutely must be on my feet for that. We’re having finger sandwiches, you know, and I promised to bring my famous coconut macaroons. They wouldn’t be the same without me.
DOCTOR: The wound culture will involve taking a small sample of fluid from the sore. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful for long. The blood test is just a standard draw, like you have with other check-ups. As for the luncheon, we’ll do everything we can to get this wound healing quickly, so you can enjoy your coconut macaroons. I’m going to prescribe a course of oral antibiotics to address any potential infection. I’ll also recommend offloading pressure from the wound with a special shoe or orthotic. And, importantly, keep the wound clean and dry. We need to keep a close watch on this, given your diabetes. I want you to follow up with me in one week, or sooner if you notice any worsening of symptoms—increased pain, redness, swelling, or fever. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oral antibiotics... another pill to add to the pile. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like a pharmacy these days! And special shoes? Orthotics? What will the ladies think? I can’t go to a luncheon in special shoes! They expect a certain… standard, you know? Though… I suppose if it absolutely has to be done… Very well. But they must be discreet. And not too bulky. And the antibiotics… are there any side effects? I don’t want to be spending the luncheon in the restroom! And one week? That’s a long time to wait! What if it gets worse before then? Honestly, all this fuss… Alright, alright. I’ll follow your instructions. But if I miss my luncheon because of this, I’m holding you responsible, Doctor. Now, can we get this over with? I have macaroons to bake.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. I understand your concerns. The antibiotics can sometimes cause mild stomach upset, but we can discuss options if that happens. I’ll write the prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic for now, and we can adjust if needed. As for the shoes, we can look at some discreet options that will help offload pressure. I’ll have the nurse give you a referral to a podiatrist who can help with that. And, of course, if your symptoms worsen at all before your one-week follow-up, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. We’ll be here to help. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and go over the medication instructions. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Podiatrist… another doctor? Honestly, it’s a conspiracy! Fine. A podiatrist. I suppose. As long as they don't try to sell me expensive insoles. And you're certain these antibiotics won’t interfere with my macaroons? Coconut is very delicate, you know. It requires precise timing and a steady hand. No, I don’t think that’s all. Tell me… is there anything I should be doing to help this heal faster? Besides pills and special shoes, I mean. Some old wives’ tale, perhaps? My grandmother always swore by a poultice of comfrey leaves, but I haven’t been able to find any good comfrey lately. .
DOCTOR: While comfrey leaves haven’t been extensively studied, and I can’t officially recommend them, maintaining good blood sugar control is the most important thing you can do to help with healing. Elevating your foot when possible, and keeping it clean and dry, are also crucial. Avoid walking barefoot, even indoors, to prevent further injury. And please, ensure your slippers fit properly and don’t cause any pressure points. Unfortunately, there are no magic cures, but focusing on these basics, alongside the prescribed treatment, will give you the best chance of recovery. Now, I believe the nurse is ready to draw your blood. Thank you for your patience, Ms. Cannington.
