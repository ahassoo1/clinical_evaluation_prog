DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit…difficult to explain, to be honest. I seem to be going to the bathroom rather frequently. More than usual, certainly. It’s been…a while now, I suppose. I don’t keep very good track of time, you understand.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, you say. And you’ve noticed this for…some time. Could you be a little more specific about “some time”?
PATIENT: Specific… yes. That is a challenge. Perhaps… several weeks? Maybe a month or two? It’s difficult to pinpoint. It just…gradually became more noticeable. I don’t recall any particular event that started it, if that makes sense. It's not painful, just…inconvenient, and a bit worrying, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright, several weeks to a couple of months of increased frequency. No pain associated with urination. Let's try to get a better picture of how frequent is “frequent”. During the day, roughly how many times would you say you’re going to the bathroom to urinate?
PATIENT: Hmm. During the day… Let me see. I suppose… every couple of hours? Perhaps more often if I drink something. Water, mostly. I do enjoy a cup of tea in the afternoon, as well. It's…hard to say exactly. I don’t really count these things. Is that helpful, Doctor? Perhaps I should start keeping a record?
DOCTOR: It would be helpful to have a more precise number, Mr. Verbos, but we can work with what we have. So, roughly every couple of hours, increasing with fluid intake. And do you notice yourself getting up at night to urinate?
PATIENT: Ah, yes… that is also happening. At night. Not every night, but… often enough to be disruptive. Perhaps two or three times a night. It’s not a full bladder each time, sometimes just…a little bit. Enough to get me out of bed, though. It's been making it hard to sleep properly, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nocturia – getting up at night to urinate – two to three times a night. Disrupting your sleep. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I suppose I have been feeling a bit more thirsty lately. Not excessively, but I find myself reaching for a glass of water more often than usual. And perhaps… a little more tired during the day, though that could simply be from the interrupted sleep. No fever, no pain, no… anything else that immediately comes to mind. Is there anything specific I should be looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Increased thirst and daytime fatigue alongside the increased frequency and nocturia. No fever or pain. Alright. Now, let's go through some basic medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… That's another difficult question. I've been generally healthy, I believe. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, but that was… quite some time ago. And I believe I had a bout of pneumonia as a young man, but I’ve never been formally diagnosed with anything serious, as far as I know. I see a doctor for check-ups occasionally, but they usually tell me everything is fine. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. Medicare covers my visits, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, distant history of pneumonia. Otherwise, generally healthy. And you said you have regular check-ups?
PATIENT: Yes, once a year, I think. Or maybe every other year. It's all a bit… fuzzy. They usually do a blood test and check my blood pressure, things like that. I don’t recall any specific concerns being raised during those visits. The doctor always seemed satisfied. It's just this… bathroom issue that is concerning me now. I haven't mentioned it during a check-up yet. I hoped it would resolve on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, a very low dose. I believe it’s… Lisinopril, perhaps? I take it every morning. And occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take a paracetamol tablet. Nothing else, I think. I generally prefer to avoid medications if possible. I don't take any vitamins or supplements. Is that all you need to know for now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril for blood pressure, occasional paracetamol for headaches. Okay. Now, regarding your family history… are there any instances of kidney problems, diabetes, or prostate issues in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tricky one. My father… he had some sort of heart condition, I believe. He passed away many years ago. And my mother… she lived a long life, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses. As for kidney problems or diabetes… I don’t think so. My brother is still alive, but we haven’t spoken in many years, so I wouldn’t know about his medical history. I'm afraid my family wasn’t very forthcoming with such details. I apologize for not being more helpful, Doctor. It's simply been a long time.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Verbos. We work with what we have. Now, before we proceed, I'm going to need to conduct a brief physical exam. It'll involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. And, if you don’t mind, I'll also need a urine sample. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly acceptable. Blood pressure, heart and lungs… and a urine sample. I understand. Let me know when you are ready. I trust your judgement entirely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just follow me to that examination table over there, and I’ll be with you in a moment to collect the sample first. We’ll take it from there. The restroom is just through that door. I'll need about 30-50 milliliters, and a mid-stream clean catch is preferred – meaning start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Mid-stream clean catch. I’ll do my best. Thank you for explaining it so clearly, Doctor. It's good to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Alright, I have the sample.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. As requested. Hopefully, that was sufficient. Shall we proceed with the rest of the examination now?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, that’s perfect. Now, if you could lie down on the examination table, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then palpate your abdomen. Breathe deeply for me, please. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Not particularly concerning at this stage, but worth noting. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… and again. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Taking a deep breath. Oh… yes, a little bit there. In the lower part, on the left side. Not sharp pain, but… discomfort. A dull ache, perhaps. It’s not constant, though. Is that significant, Doctor? Perhaps it’s just my imagination?
DOCTOR: Alright. Discomfort in the lower left quadrant. Not sharp, a dull ache. That’s useful information. Does this feel different than when I’m pressing elsewhere?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. It’s…more pronounced there. It’s not excruciating, but I definitely notice it more. It feels… a bit tender. It's difficult to describe. It’s not a muscle ache, certainly. More… internal, perhaps. Is something wrong, Doctor? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's alright, Mr. Verbos. You’re not being vague at all. We’re gathering information. Based on what you've told me, and the findings from the examination - the slight murmur, the discomfort in the lower left quadrant – I want to order a few tests to help determine the cause of your symptoms. I'm going to order a Complete Blood Count , a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , and a Urinalysis, which we already have a sample for. I'm also going to order a prostate-specific antigen test, just to rule out any prostate issues, given your age. And finally, I'd like to order a kidney function test. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. Complete Blood Count, Metabolic Panel, Urinalysis, PSA test, Kidney function test. All of those. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement entirely. When will I know the results, Doctor? And will they require further action? I apologize for all the questions.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. It’s important to ask questions. The lab results should be back within a few days, usually three to five business days. Once I have them, I’ll contact you to discuss the findings and determine the next steps. Depending on the results, we might need to consider further investigations, such as an ultrasound or a referral to a specialist. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – fever, chills, severe pain, blood in your urine – please contact the clinic immediately. I also recommend increasing your fluid intake slightly, but don’t overdo it. And try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Three to five business days for the results. Contact you if any new symptoms arise. Increase fluids, avoid caffeine and alcohol. I understand. That’s…very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. I feel much better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. Is there anything else I should be doing, Doctor? Or anything else you need from me at this point?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. At this point, just focus on staying hydrated and monitoring your symptoms. I’ll be in touch as soon as the lab results are available. And just one last thing – I’m going to send a referral to our in-house registered dietician. They can provide some personalized advice on dietary changes that might help manage your bladder health. Do you have any further questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That's very thoughtful of you, the referral to the dietician. No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and your attention. I feel much more reassured now. I'll await your call with the results. Have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbos. And you have a good day as well. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if anything changes. We'll be in touch soon. .
