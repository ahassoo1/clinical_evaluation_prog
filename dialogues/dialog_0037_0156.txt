DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly, it’s… my stomach. It’s been, well, really bad for a bit now. Like, a lot of… diarrhea. It just won’t stop. I think it’s been going on for… a while? I’m really bad with remembering dates, sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Diarrhea that’s been ongoing for a while. That’s certainly not comfortable. Don't worry about the dates – we’ll figure it out. “A while” is okay to start with. To get a better sense of things, can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… watery, mostly. And… frequent. Like, I have to go a lot during the day. And sometimes at night, which is really annoying. It doesn’t… it doesn’t usually hurt, just… uncomfortable, you know? And I feel really tired a lot. I just thought it would go away, but it hasn’t. I think I might have… something wrong with my insides? I don’t really know.
DOCTOR: Okay, watery and frequent diarrhea, happening both day and night, and you're feeling tired. That’s helpful. It's good you're coming in to get it checked out. Now, to help me understand what might be going on, let's go through some questions. First, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Um… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve seen, anyway. I try to… check, but it’s hard to tell, isn’t it? I haven’t really… noticed anything bright red or anything. Does that make sense? It’s just… a lot of… well, you know. I'm not good at talking about this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jase. It is a difficult topic to discuss, and you’re doing fine. No bright red blood is good to know. Okay. Have you had any fever or chills accompanying this?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. I think I felt a little warm a few days ago, but I just thought I was getting a cold. I didn't actually take my temperature, if that makes a difference. And maybe a little bit of chills, but again, could have been the cold. I get colds pretty easily, you know? So, probably not a proper fever, just… feeling a bit off.
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling a bit off, maybe a slight temperature, but no confirmed fever. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk about what you’ve been eating and drinking. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet… not really? I mean, my husband, Omar, does most of the cooking, and he makes pretty much the same things all the time. We eat a lot of rice and… chicken, usually. And vegetables. Nothing too fancy. I did have some… really spicy curry at a friend’s house last week, but that was just one meal. Could that have caused it? I didn’t think it was that spicy.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly the same diet, with a single spicy meal last week. It could be the curry, but it's also possible it's something else. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I haven't left town in… ages, I think. Omar and I mostly just stay home. He works a lot, and I... well, I do a bit of sales work from the computer. Nothing that requires travel. So, no exotic locations, I'm afraid. Just staying put.
DOCTOR: Alright, staying put is good to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, the doctor told me a while ago that I might have… something with my stomach. Something about it being… inflamed? And something about not being able to eat certain things? It was a long appointment, and I was really tired that day. I think it was something like… IBD or celiac disease? But I honestly can’t remember. Omar handles most of the doctor stuff, usually. He’ll know more. I'm really sorry, I'm not very good with all this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jase. It's very common to feel overwhelmed with medical information, and it's completely understandable that Omar handles most of it. So, you recall a possible diagnosis of either IBD or celiac disease. I'll make a note of that and we can look into your records to confirm. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Um… just some vitamins, I think. A multi-vitamin. And sometimes, if my joints are hurting, I take some paracetamol. Omar buys them at the pharmacy. Nothing regular, though. Definitely not anything for my stomach. Just the usual, really. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multi-vitamin and paracetamol as needed for joint pain. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I used to get hay fever as a kid, but that was ages ago. I've never had a reaction to any food or medication, as far as I know. Omar always asks when he buys things, and he's really careful. But sometimes, after I eat really spicy food, my stomach feels a bit… upset. But I don’t think that’s an allergy, just… spicy food.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just some stomach upset with spicy food. We'll keep that in mind. Now, finally, let’s talk a little about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had any bowel problems, like Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a tough one. My family is really big, and we don’t see each other very often. My mother had some… stomach trouble when she was younger, I think? But she never really talked about it. And I think my aunt had something… but again, I'm really vague on details. Omar’s family is healthier, I think. I wish I could be more helpful, but honestly, I don’t really know. It’s all a bit of a blur. I'm so sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jase. It’s common for family medical history to be a bit hazy. You’ve provided me with quite a bit of information already, and I appreciate your honesty. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, you’ve been experiencing ongoing diarrhea, fatigue, and you recall a possible previous diagnosis of either IBD or celiac disease. Given the duration of your symptoms, we need to investigate this further. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It’s just… tiring, you know? Feeling like this all the time. So, yes, please. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax and try to take some deep breaths. Okay. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now, and they seem… a little hyperactive. And there is some mild tenderness when I press here, in your lower abdomen. No significant guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. I’m also going to check your temperature and blood pressure just to get a baseline. Okay, your temperature is slightly elevated at 99.2 Fahrenheit, and your blood pressure is 120/80, which is normal. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I'm concerned about a possible inflammatory process in your gut. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and a stool sample analysis. The blood tests will help us look for signs of inflammation and rule out any infections. The stool sample will help us check for bacteria, parasites, and blood. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever tests you think are best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and get this sorted. Blood tests and a stool sample… okay. Is it… a lot of paperwork? I’m terrible with forms. And do I need to do anything special for the stool sample? Omar can help, if I need him to.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry, Jase. The paperwork is minimal, and the nurse will assist you with everything. And yes, there are a few instructions for the stool sample, but nothing too complicated. You’ll need to collect a small sample in a special container that the nurse will provide, and then bring it back to the lab within 24 hours. She’ll give you detailed instructions on how to do it. Based on your history and symptoms, I also want to consider the possibility of celiac disease. To investigate that, we can order a blood test to check for specific antibodies. It’s also important to rule out other potential causes of your diarrhea, like infections or food intolerances. So, to summarize, I’m ordering the following tests: Complete Blood Count Comprehensive Metabolic Panel Inflammatory Markers Stool Culture and Ova and Parasites Celiac Disease Panel The nurse will draw your blood now, and I’ll give you the requisition for the stool sample. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. Lots of tests, but… that’s good, right? It means we’re trying to figure it out. Okay. Blood tests and a stool sample. I’ll let Omar know. He’ll be happy you’re finally getting to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I need to do, or anything I should be aware of before the tests?
DOCTOR: That's right, Jase, we’re being thorough. As for anything else, just try to stay hydrated and eat a bland diet until we get the results back. Avoid any foods that might irritate your stomach, like spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol. If your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stool, please seek immediate medical attention. Also, I’m going to have the nurse print out some information on celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, just so you have a better understanding of those conditions. It’s important to remember that these are just possibilities, and we’ll need to wait for the results of the tests before making any definitive diagnosis. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything really clearly, Doctor. Omar will probably have questions later, but… for now, I think I'm good. Thank you. Thank you for listening, and for taking this seriously. It's been tiring, feeling like this, and I appreciate you trying to help. I’ll go find the nurse now, then. And I'll let you know if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we're a team in this. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
