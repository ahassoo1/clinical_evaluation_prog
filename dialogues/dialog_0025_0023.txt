DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um, well... my chest hurts. Not all the time, but... it hurts sometimes. It's in my breast.
DOCTOR: “Breast,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes. My breast. It feels... sore. Like when you bump your arm, but inside. I don't know if that makes sense. It's just... pain. It's a little scary, to be honest. I never thought... well, men don't get breast pain, right?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Bulaong, while it's less common in men, it certainly can happen. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Now, tell me more about this pain. When did it start?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Maybe... two weeks ago? It started kinda slow, just a little ache. I thought I slept wrong. But it hasn't gone away, and now it's... more noticeable. I noticed it more when I was working on the roof yesterday. Lifting things. That made it hurt worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Most of the day it's just... there. A dull ache. But when I move around too much, or lift something heavy like at work… then it really hurts. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a heavy feeling. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like it's spreading.
DOCTOR: Spreading where, exactly?
PATIENT: Um… it's hard to explain. Like… up towards my shoulder, a little bit. And… sometimes I feel it in my armpit. Not all the time, just… sometimes. It’s not bad enough to stop me from working, but it’s worrying me. My wife… she says I should come see you. She gets scared easy.
DOCTOR: Your wife is wise to be concerned. Now, have you noticed any changes to the breast itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? I haven’t really… looked at it much. I mean, I know it's there, but I don't… check it. Is that bad? I don’t know what to look for. I guess… no. It looks the same to me. No bumps or anything. Just… hurts.
DOCTOR: Most men don’t spend a lot of time examining their chests. Alright. And have you noticed any discharge from the nipple?
PATIENT: Discharge? You mean… liquid? No. Nothing like that. It’s… dry. Never any liquid. I’m pretty sure. I haven’t… you know. I just feel the pain. I wouldn't even know how to check for that. Sorry. I don’t think I’m very good at this doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Bulaong. We'll figure it out. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I'm usually pretty healthy. I work hard, you know? Roofin' keeps you in shape. I had the flu a couple of times, but that’s about it. No… serious stuff. My wife has high blood pressure, but I don’t. Never been to the hospital for anything big. No allergies either. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: No medications. I don't take nothin'. Just… water. And sometimes coffee when I’m really tired. My wife keeps telling me I should take vitamins, but I haven't gotten around to it. She's always worried about me. I'm a big guy, I figure I’m okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, family history. Does anyone in your family have a history of breast cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a hard one. I don't really… know much about my family’s medical stuff. My mom passed away when I was young. My dad… he didn't talk much about things like that. I think my grandma on my mom's side… she had cancer, something cancer, but I don't remember what kind. It was a long time ago. I don’t know if it was breast cancer, though. Nobody ever talked about it. Sorry. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll proceed with what we have. Now, I'm going to need to examine you. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your chest. I need to feel for any lumps or abnormalities. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. Whatever you need, Doctor. Is it going to hurt? I don’t like being touched… much. No offense. I just… don’t get sick often.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be painful, Mr. Bulaong. Just a gentle examination. I'll be as quick and respectful as possible. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… let me know when you're ready. I’m… ready when you are. This is kinda weird.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bulaong. I’m going to start now. I'm palpating the chest wall… and I do feel some tenderness in the left pectoral muscle, here. Not a distinct lump, but there’s definite sensitivity to the touch. And there's a slight swelling in the left axillary lymph nodes, but it's not significantly enlarged. Overall range of motion seems normal, no obvious signs of injury. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal.
PATIENT: Okay. That kinda hurts… a little. Not bad, just… yeah. It feels… sore. Like a bruise, almost. Is that good or bad? I don't know what any of this means.
DOCTOR: The soreness is concerning, Mr. Bulaong. It could be a number of things. Muscle strain is a possibility, given your occupation, but the swollen lymph nodes are… atypical. Given your insurance status, extensive imaging is not immediately feasible, and a biopsy is… premature at this stage. We need to rule out more serious causes. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a sedimentation rate to check for inflammation. And I want you to see a general surgeon, to get a more definitive evaluation. They can order further imaging if needed. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Complete… what? And… a surgeon? Like… to cut me? No, I don't… I don't understand. What's wrong? Is it cancer? I don't want to get cut. I just want the pain to stop. And… what does all this cost? I don’t have a lot of money. Is it going to be expensive? My wife is going to be so worried… .
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, please. Let’s not jump to conclusions. A surgeon is for evaluation only, not necessarily surgery. We need to rule things out before we panic. A complete blood count is a simple test, to see if your blood counts are normal. It can indicate inflammation or infection. I understand your financial concerns. I will write a referral to the local hospital's financial assistance program. They may be able to help with the costs. And I will prioritize seeing you back for follow up, regardless of costs. Here is a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a general surgeon at St. Luke's Hospital, and an order for the bloodwork. Please schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez as soon as possible. And go to the lab tomorrow morning. If the pain becomes severe, or you develop a fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand these instructions?
