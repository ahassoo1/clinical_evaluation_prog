DOCTOR: Hi Aeisha, good morning. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel… a little bit lost, I suppose. I'm hoping you can help me get back on track. I’m looking for a sort of… “reset,” if that makes sense. A jumpstart to feeling better, more like myself.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Lost” and needing a “reset” – that’s perfectly valid, Aeisha. A lot of people feel that way sometimes. To help me understand what “getting back on track” looks like for you, could you tell me a bit more about how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…difficult to explain precisely. I just don’t have the energy I used to. Everything feels like a bit of an effort. I used to be very active, you know? I enjoy my work – shaping things with my hands – but even that feels… heavy now. And I’ve been sleeping more, but not well. It's not a pain, exactly, just… unrestful. And I find myself…forgetting little things. Not important things, thankfully, but things like where I put my glasses or a name I just learned. It's frustrating. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: That makes a lot of sense, Aeisha. It sounds like you're experiencing a combination of fatigue, difficulty with sleep, and some cognitive changes – the forgetfulness. It’s good you're recognizing these changes. We'll definitely get to the bottom of this. To help me get a clearer picture, let's go through some things. First, could you tell me a little bit more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: Of course. Well, it's not like I’m completely exhausted all the time, it’s more…persistent. It doesn’t really come and go, it’s just… always there, a low-level drain. It affects everything, really. I used to garden quite a bit, and now even tending to a few plants feels overwhelming. It also impacts my focus. I find it difficult to concentrate for long periods, even when I'm doing something I enjoy. And I don’t have much appetite these days, which I suspect isn’t helping.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent fatigue, impacting daily activities like gardening, difficulty concentrating, and decreased appetite. That's helpful. Now, when did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: That's a good question. It wasn't a sudden thing, more gradual. I'd say… maybe six months ago? It started with just feeling a little more tired than usual. Then the concentration issues began, and the appetite followed shortly after. It's been slowly getting worse since then, though I haven't changed anything in my routine drastically. It's… perplexing, really.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, gradual onset. That helps narrow things down. Have you had any fever, unexplained weight loss, night sweats, or any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And my weight… I haven't weighed myself recently, to be honest, but I don’t think I’ve lost a significant amount of weight. I've certainly not been intentionally trying to lose weight. No night sweats either. And no… constant pain, no. I sometimes get aches after working, which is normal for my profession, but nothing unusual.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no weight loss, no night sweats, no constant pain. Good to know. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about ten years ago, but it’s been well-managed with medication for the past eight. Other than that… no, nothing significant. I've had the usual colds and flu, but nothing major. My doctor always said I was very healthy, quite robust, actually.
DOCTOR: That's good to know – well-managed hypertension. And you said "robust," which is excellent. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think… It’s Lisinopril. I take 20 milligrams every morning. I’ve been very diligent about taking it, as prescribed. My previous doctor stressed how important it was, and I’ve always followed his instructions carefully.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. That’s helpful. Any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, and I haven't had any problems with pollen or dust. I used to help my mother with her roses, and I never had a reaction. She had quite a beautiful garden, actually.
DOCTOR: That's good. No allergies. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes, actually. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, maybe eight or nine years old. And… oh, I had a minor surgery on my hand a few years ago, to repair a tendon after an accident at work. Nothing major, though. Just a local anesthetic and a quick recovery.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and a hand surgery a few years ago. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any mental health conditions?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, like me, and she also developed arthritis in her later years. My father… he had heart disease. He passed away when I was in my twenties. And my sister… she’s been struggling with anxiety for many years, but that’s the extent of any major health concerns in the family, that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of hypertension, arthritis, heart disease, and anxiety. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I've never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I believe in taking good care of my health, and that includes avoiding harmful substances.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned earlier, I’m a molder, shaper, and caster. I primarily work with clay, wax, and plaster, creating sculptures and decorative pieces. It’s quite physical work, requiring a lot of hand strength and precision. I have my own small workshop at home, and I've been doing this for over twenty years. I really enjoy it, it’s very fulfilling. But, as I said, it has become more taxing recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, physical work as a sculptor. That’s helpful. Finally, let's talk about your sleep. You mentioned it's not restful. Can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I fall asleep easily enough, usually without any trouble. But I wake up several times throughout the night. It’s not a full awakening, more like… a restless stirring. And I often feel tired and groggy when I wake up in the morning, even after a full eight hours of sleep. It's like my sleep isn't restorative, you know? I don’t have any nightmares or sleep apnea, as far as I’m aware. It’s just… fragmented and unsatisfying.
DOCTOR: Okay, fragmented sleep, not restorative, waking up tired. Thank you, Aeisha, that was very thorough. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a basic neurological exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I want to understand what's going on, and I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 135/85, pulse is 72 and regular. A little elevated, but not significantly so, considering you mentioned a history of hypertension. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes, and a little bit of your coordination. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Balance is good, and coordination appears intact. No obvious neurological deficits. Finally, I'll just palpate your thyroid gland. Thyroid gland is normal in size and consistency, no nodules or tenderness. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything appears normal at this point, which is good, but doesn't explain your symptoms. Given your history and the exam findings, I suspect we need to do some blood work to rule out a few things, like thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, and anemia. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Blood work sounds sensible. I want to get to the bottom of this, and if that’s what you recommend, then I’m happy to proceed. What exactly will the blood work involve?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. We’ll do a complete blood count to check for anemia and other blood disorders. We'll also check your thyroid-stimulating hormone to rule out thyroid problems, and your vitamin D and B12 levels, as deficiencies in these vitamins can cause fatigue and cognitive issues. We will also check your electrolytes and kidney function just as a baseline. I’ll write you a lab requisition now. You can go to the lab downstairs, and they’ll draw the blood. The results usually come back within a few days. Once I have those results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. A few days is fine. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It makes me feel more confident that we’re on the right track. And…is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any changes to my diet or activity levels that you recommend while we wait for the results?
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Aeisha. While we wait for the results, I wouldn’t recommend making any drastic changes. However, it’s always a good idea to stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet. Try to get enough protein and iron-rich foods, like lean meats, beans, and leafy greens. And I recommend avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol. As for activity levels, listen to your body. Don’t push yourself too hard, but try to get some gentle exercise, like walking, if you’re able. And prioritize getting enough sleep, even if it’s fragmented. I’ll also send you a handout with some information about managing fatigue and improving sleep hygiene. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That’s all very helpful. You’ve explained everything clearly, and I feel much better informed. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll go downstairs and get the blood work done now. I look forward to hearing from you once the results are back.
DOCTOR: Excellent. You’re very welcome, Aeisha. It was a pleasure meeting you. The lab will send the results directly to the clinic. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention.
