DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you too. Well, it's a bit difficult to explain, honestly. I’ve been feeling… unsteady. Like I might fall over, sometimes. It's been happening for a while now, and it's a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteady, like you might fall over. And you said it’s been happening for a while… could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: A while… yes. It’s hard to say exactly how long. Months, I think? Perhaps longer. It doesn’t happen constantly, you understand. More… in waves. Some days I feel perfectly fine, and other days… well, other days it's like the floor is moving beneath my feet. I work on oil rigs, you see, and… that’s not a good feeling when you’re up high. I don't recall anything specific that started it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Lilyanna. It's helpful to know it comes and goes, and that it’s been several months. And you work on oil rigs – that certainly adds to the concern, given the risk. So, when you say “unsteady,” can you describe that feeling more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not exactly dizziness, Doctor. Not like spinning, though sometimes there is a little bit of that. It's more… a loss of balance. Like my feet aren't quite… connected to the ground. It's hard to explain. It feels… precarious. And sometimes it’s just a general feeling of weakness in my legs. Like they might give way. Does that make any sense at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Loss of balance, feeling disconnected, and weakness in your legs. We'll try to get to the bottom of this. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers… that’s a good question. I honestly haven’t noticed a clear pattern. It doesn’t seem to be related to what I’m doing, necessarily. It happens when I’m working, when I’m resting, even… when I’m just walking around. I've tried to pay attention, believe me. But no, I can’t pinpoint anything specific. It just… comes and goes. Perhaps stress? Work is quite demanding, naturally. But even on my days off, it can happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not clearly related to activity or stress, which makes it a little harder to track down. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Well, I’ve been… rather tired lately. More tired than usual, even for someone with my job. And sometimes… I get headaches. Not terrible headaches, just a dull ache at the back of my head. And… I think my vision has been a bit blurry sometimes, but I assumed that was just from staring at machinery all day. I don’t know if any of that’s related, though. It's all rather… vague, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not vague at all, Lilyanna. Fatigue, headaches, and blurry vision – those are all potentially relevant. Okay. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… That's… difficult. My husband, he always handled those things. I… I don’t recall any major diagnoses, no. Just the usual things, I suppose. Colds, flu… Nothing serious. He passed away a little over a year ago, and… everything is a bit of a blur since then. I do have insurance, private insurance, if that helps. I haven’t really seen a doctor much since… well, since he’s been gone. I’m sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You are very helpful, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly understandable, and I’m very sorry for your loss. It’s a lot to deal with. Okay, no major diagnoses. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed any, thankfully. I did break my arm when I was a child, a long time ago, but that healed perfectly. Nothing else. And… I don’t take any regular medication, Doctor. Just… sometimes an over-the-counter pain reliever for headaches, if they get bad. But that's it. I hope this is useful?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is all very helpful, Lilyanna. No surgeries, no regular medication – that’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… that’s a bit tricky. I didn’t grow up with… a lot of family, Doctor. My parents passed away when I was young, and I don’t have any siblings. My husband’s family… I knew them, of course, but we didn’t talk much about medical history. I seem to recall his mother had some problems with her… joints? Arthritis, perhaps? But I'm not certain. And his father… I believe he had high blood pressure. But honestly, I don't remember details. It’s all rather… hazy. I’m sorry I can’t be more specific. My memory isn’t what it used to be, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilyanna. You’ve given me what you know, and that’s perfectly fine. It sounds like a possible family history of arthritis and high blood pressure. Okay. Let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Certainly not. I don't smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions – and I’ve never used any recreational drugs. I need to be completely clear-headed for my job, you understand. It’s… a demanding profession. I eat reasonably well, I think. Mostly just standard fare, nothing fancy. And I try to get enough sleep, though that’s sometimes difficult with the shifts. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Lilyanna. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs – that's all good information. Alright. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s quickly review any allergies you might have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don't believe so, Doctor. I've never had any serious allergic reactions to anything. I've had a few mosquito bites, of course, but nothing more than the usual itching. I don’t recall any food allergies, either. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, to my knowledge. I’m quite robust, generally. Though, now that I mention it, sometimes my skin gets a little itchy after I use certain detergents, but it’s nothing major. Just a mild irritation. Is that something we need to worry about?
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally robust, with mild skin irritation from some detergents. That’s good to know. Alright, Lilyanna. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilyanna. I will explain everything as I go, and we'll take it slow. <stage>I observe your gait carefully. "You seem slightly unsteady on your feet, as you described, but no significant abnormalities at this time." I then perform a Romberg test, asking you to stand with your feet together and your eyes closed. "Okay, and now could you close your eyes and see if you can maintain your balance for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Alright. It’s… a little difficult, as you can see. I have to concentrate quite hard. Oh… whoa. I… I don’t think I can hold this for very long, Doctor. I feel like I’m going to fall. It's much worse with my eyes closed. Definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, that’s perfectly alright. It’s good we’ve identified that. That indicates a possible issue with your proprioception – your sense of where your body is in space. Okay, Lilyanna. Everything appears relatively normal, physically. However, the unsteady gait and the worsened balance with your eyes closed are concerning. Given your symptoms, history, and the findings of this exam, I think we should investigate further. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I'd also like to schedule you for a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and a… a CT scan? Yes, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best, then yes, absolutely. I want to get to the bottom of this. It's… unsettling, feeling so unsteady, especially with my job. I understand the need for thorough investigation. Will the CT scan… will it involve radiation? And… what kind of things are we looking for? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m a little worried, naturally.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It’s good to ask questions, and I understand your concerns. Yes, a CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but it’s a very low dose, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks in this case. We are looking for any structural abnormalities in your brain – things like tumors, aneurysms, or signs of stroke. It’s unlikely that’s what’s going on, but we need to rule it out. The blood work will help us check for things like vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and signs of inflammation. I'll write you a referral for both the blood work and the CT scan. The lab is just down the hall, and the CT scan center is located on Maple Street. Do you have any questions about how to schedule the scans, or anything else?
PATIENT: Maple Street… alright. No, I think I can find it. And the lab is down the hall, you said? That’s good. Vitamin deficiencies… that’s… concerning. I haven’t been eating very well lately, I suppose, with the long shifts. How long will it take to get the results, Doctor? And… what happens after that? Will you… will you explain everything to me? I’m a little frightened, if I’m being honest. It's just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be frightened, Lilyanna. It is a lot to take in, and I’m here to help you through it. The blood work results usually come back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan results may take a little longer, depending on how busy the radiologist is, but I expect to have them within a few days. Once I have the results, I will call you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment. At that appointment, I will explain everything to you in detail, and we will discuss the best course of action. We'll go through all the options, and I'll answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience any severe headaches, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: 24-48 hours for the blood work… a few days for the CT scan… and I should call you when the symptoms worsen… alright. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment. I'll… I'll write all that down. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I appreciate your time and attention. I feel… a little less frightened now, knowing that we’re taking steps to figure this out. I think I'll go get the blood work done now. If you'll excuse me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
