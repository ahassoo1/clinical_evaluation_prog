DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Bigger, good to see you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh. They told me to come. Something about the… the place I work. Been workin’ there a long time, you know? Underground. Diggin’ things out. Never had trouble ‘til now, they just want to… check. Don’t feel nothin’ wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your employer requested a check-up because of your work. That’s good they’re being proactive. Just to be clear, you said you don’t feel anything wrong currently?
PATIENT: Exactly. No coughin’, no achin’, no… what you call it… dizziness. Everything workin’ just fine. Been strong my whole life. Strong like bull. But they payin’ for this, so here I am. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I hear you, and I appreciate you coming in despite feeling well. Even if you're feeling strong, sometimes things can be developing that aren't immediately obvious. We just want to make sure everything is okay. So, you’ve been doing this work underground for a long time… roughly how long?
PATIENT: Eh… let me think. Started when I was… twenty. Maybe twenty-one. That’s… sixty years? Sixty-plus years diggin’ in the dark. You young people don't understand hard work no more. Always complainin’.
DOCTOR: Sixty years is a very long time, Mr. Bigger. That’s incredibly dedicated work. And you’re right, things were different back then. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what exactly you’ve been digging out?
PATIENT: Diggin’… coal. Mostly coal. Some iron ore sometimes, but mostly coal. Black stuff. Dirty stuff. Make the lights on. Used to be a lot of men. Now… not so many. Dangerous work. Always dust. Always dark.
DOCTOR: Okay, coal mining. And you said there's always a lot of dust. Have you noticed any changes in your breathing over the years because of the dust?
PATIENT: Changes? Eh… maybe a little more coughin’ in the winter. But I always cough in the winter. Old man cough. Not because of the… the coal, I don’t think. Just the cold air, you know? Always been a smoker too, you gotta remember that.
DOCTOR: Right, a smoker. How many packs a day, roughly?
PATIENT: Eh… used to be two. Maybe three when things were… hard. Now, maybe one. Tryin’ to cut back, you know? Doctor told me years ago to quit, but… hard habit. Like the work, hard to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, about one pack a day. And how long have you been smoking, roughly?
PATIENT: Since I was a boy. Maybe sixteen, seventeen. Long time. My father smoked, his father smoked. It's… it's just something you did. Relaxin'. Now they make it so expensive, that’s the real problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly since you were 16 or 17. We'll make a note of that. Do you have any other medical problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Eh… my knees. They ache. Get stiff in the mornin’. Doctor said it’s… arthritis, I think. Old age again. And my back… it goes out sometimes. Liftin’ heavy things, you know? Part of the job. Nothin’ serious, I can usually work through it.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your knees and some back pain. We’ll add those to the chart. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never been allergic to nothin'. Strong stomach, I am. Used to eat anything. Don't like those pills though. Make me sick. I only take them if I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Now, just to finish up with your history, are you currently taking any medications for your knees, your back, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Just some cream for the knees. Doctor gave it to me years ago. Don't use it much, don't really help. That’s it. No pills. Hate pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the cream for your knees, and you don't use it often. Alright, Mr. Bigger. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your lungs, your heart, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Eh… fine. Get it over with. But don’t take too long. Got things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Won't take long. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath in for me, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: Like this? Feels a little tight, if you ask me. Always been a little tight, though. Like I said, strong man, but not a young man no more.
DOCTOR: Okay. I do hear a little wheezing, yes, and your breathing sounds a bit labored. It's not surprising given your history of smoking and working in the coal mines. Now, let's listen to your back. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh! A little bit. Right there. That's where it goes out sometimes. Not today, but… usually right there. Like a sharp pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some muscle tension and tenderness there. Alright, I'm going to check your knees now. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: There. Hear that creakin’? Old bones. Used to be good knees. Good for diggin’. Now… not so much. Can't bend them like I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some creaking, as you mentioned, and a limited range of motion. I don’t see any significant swelling or redness, but there's definitely some tenderness when I bend them. Alright, Mr. Bigger. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you have some chronic bronchitis likely related to your smoking and coal mining work, some muscle strain in your lower back, and osteoarthritis in your knees. We need to get some imaging done to confirm that. I'm going to order a chest x-ray and knee x-rays. Would you be able to get those done at the clinic across the street?
PATIENT: X-rays? More time wasted. Clinic across the street, you say? Fine. But I don't want to be runnin’ back and forth all day. And who pays for all this? My insurance? I hope so.
DOCTOR: Yes, your insurance will cover it. I'll have the paperwork ready for you. The clinic across the street is very efficient, it shouldn’t take too long. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options. In the meantime, I recommend you try to avoid strenuous activity, especially lifting heavy things, and continue to try and cut back on smoking, even a little bit can help. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Treatment options? What kind of treatment? Pills? I don’t want no pills. And cut back on smokin'… easy for you to say. It's a habit. Like diggin’ in the dark. What if the x-rays show somethin' bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. As for treatment, we’ll discuss all the options after we see the x-ray results. There are options besides pills, such as physical therapy, breathing exercises, and inhalers to help with your breathing. As for the x-rays, they will help us see what’s going on in your lungs and knees. If there is something concerning, we’ll discuss it thoroughly and create a plan to manage it. Right now, let's focus on getting those x-rays done. I'll write you a referral and you can schedule an appointment with the clinic across the street. Do you have any difficulty with transportation?
PATIENT: Transportation? No. Got a car. Old car, but it works. I can drive myself. Just… don’t want to be stuck there all day. And you sure I can’t just… avoid all this? I feel fine, mostly. Waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. However, even if you feel "mostly" fine, these tests are important for preventative care and to ensure we aren’t missing anything that could become a bigger problem down the road. The x-rays will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. I’ll make the referral as quick as possible and you can schedule the appointment at your convenience. Here's the referral. The clinic’s number is on the form. Once you have the results, you can either bring them back here or have them sent directly to us. Do you have any questions about the referral process?
PATIENT: Fine. I’ll call them. But don't expect me to be happy about this. And if they try to sell me somethin', I'm walkin' out. I just want to know if I'm gonna die or not, that’s all. And… what if they find somethin' bad? What then?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Bigger. If the x-rays do show something concerning, we will discuss it openly and honestly, and develop a plan of action together. That plan might involve further testing, medication, therapy, or other interventions. I will be here to guide you through every step of the process. We won’t rush into anything without your full understanding and consent. For now, let's focus on getting the x-rays done. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s enough questions for one day. Just… try not to scare me when I come back. And don’t tell me to quit smokin’ again. .
DOCTOR: I understand. I won’t pressure you about smoking, and I promise to be straightforward with you. Thank you for coming in, Mr. Bigger. Please call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day. .
