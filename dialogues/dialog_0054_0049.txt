DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Dashevsky, is it? That’s a nice name. Well, now, let me see… It’s my ears, I think. They just don’t… hear like they used to. Everything’s a bit muffled, you know? It’s hard to make out what folks are sayin’ sometimes. Been gettin’ worse lately, I reckon. Not sure when exactly, though. Time just… slips away, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does, Mr. Schneer. Thank you for explaining that. So, it sounds like you're experiencing some hearing loss, and it’s been gradually worsening. "Muffled" is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. Now, let me think... I think it was after I retired from the shoe factory. Or maybe before? I worked there a long time, you see. Lots of noise, all those machines clatterin' away. Could be that did somethin’ to ‘em. Or… maybe it just happened slow, like? I really can't put my finger on it, Doctor. Sorry, I’m not much help with dates. My mind ain’t what it used to be, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. It’s very common for things to be a little hazy with time, and pinpointing the exact start of hearing loss can be difficult, especially with prolonged noise exposure like you had at the factory. So, it sounds like the issue developed gradually, potentially linked to your time at the shoe factory. Besides the muffled hearing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me see. Sometimes, I get a bit of a… ringing in my ears. Not all the time, just now and then. Like a high-pitched whine, you know? And… I sometimes have to ask folks to repeat themselves. More than once, even. My daughter, bless her heart, says I turn the TV up too loud. She tells me I’m gonna go deaf if I keep it cranked up! I don’t think it’s that loud, but… maybe she’s right. Do you think that’s a sign, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mr. Schneer. The ringing in your ears—we call that tinnitus—and needing to repeat things are certainly common symptoms associated with hearing loss. Your daughter is right to be concerned about the TV volume; consistently listening to loud sounds can worsen the problem. So, tinnitus and difficulty understanding speech are present. Have you experienced any dizziness, pain in your ears, or any fluid leaking from your ears?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. I get a bit unsteady sometimes, but that's just my legs, I think. Old age, you know? Pain… no, no pain in my ears. And definitely no fluid leakin’ out! Never had that. I do feel a bit… full in my ears sometimes, like somethin's blocked. Not a painful full, just… uncomfortable. Like when you're on an airplane, maybe? Do you know what I mean? It comes and goes, though. Mostly when it's damp out, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Feeling of fullness in the ears, especially with changes in weather, is quite common as well. Okay, so no dizziness or pain, just the fullness and occasional ringing. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… The doctor told me a while back my blood pressure was a bit high, but he put me on some pills for it. I’ve been takin’ ‘em ever since, I think. Can't remember the name of ‘em, though. And… I had a bit of trouble with my sugar a few years back, but it went away on its own, mostly. I try to watch what I eat now, you know? Mostly just… sensible things. And… no, no heart problems, as far as I know. I get a bit short of breath climbin’ stairs, but I put that down to bein’ old! Is that enough? I'm not very good at rememberin' things, you see.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Schneer. It sounds like you have a history of high blood pressure, which is currently managed with medication, and a past issue with elevated blood sugar that has since resolved. That’s good to know. Do you recall any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, I think. That was a long time ago. And… oh, and I had my gall bladder taken out, too. That was a bit of a rough time, but the doctor said it went well. And… I think that’s it. Maybe I had somethin’ else, but I just can’t recall. My memory's like a sieve these days, you know? It just lets everything slip through. It's frustrating, to be honest. I'm sorry I can’t be of more help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. You’ve given me quite a bit of helpful information already. Appendectomy and cholecystectomy are noted. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just the one, I think. For my blood pressure. Like I said, I can't remember the name of it. It's a little white pill, I think. I take it every mornin' with my breakfast. And… sometimes I take a little somethin' for my arthritis, when my joints are really botherin' me. It's over-the-counter, you can get it at the drugstore. I think it's called… ibuprofen? Or maybe naproxen? Something like that. I forget which one I bought last time. My daughter usually keeps track of these things for me, bless her heart. I rely on her a lot these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a blood pressure medication and an over-the-counter pain reliever, possibly ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed for arthritis. Now, just a few more questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings – who have experienced hearing loss or other ear problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My mother, bless her soul, she was always a bit hard of hearin’ when she got older. But I think that was just from bein’ old, like me. And… my brother, he worked in a factory too. Lots of noise, like me. I think he had some trouble with his ears later in life, but I don’t really know what it was. We didn't talk about it much. And… no, I don't think anyone else had any particular ear problems. Not that I recall, anyway. It was a long time ago, you know. Family's mostly gone now. It's just me and my daughter.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, some hearing loss in your mother and potentially your brother, both linked to factory noise exposure. That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anythin'. I eat just about anything, you know? My daughter always tells me to be careful, but I've never had any trouble. No allergies to penicillin or anythin' like that. I think I'm pretty lucky, to be honest. Never been much for gettin’ sick, either. Just the usual colds now and then. But no serious allergies, no. I'm pretty sure of that. Is that alright? I’m sorry if I’m not bein’ very helpful. My mind’s a bit of a mess these days.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Mr. Schneer. No allergies noted. Alright, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable. My ears are a bit sensitive, you know? But I’m not afraid. Go right ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. I'm just going to look into your ears with this light. It won't hurt, but please let me know if you feel any discomfort. Okay… I’m seeing some cerumen – that’s earwax – buildup in your right ear canal. The tympanic membrane, or eardrum, appears slightly dull in color. Now, let’s take a look at your left ear… Similar findings here – some cerumen buildup and a slightly dull tympanic membrane. Both ear canals appear clear of any inflammation or obvious obstructions other than the wax. Okay, Mr. Schneer. It appears you have a buildup of earwax in both ears, which could be contributing to your hearing loss. The slight dullness of the eardrums could indicate a bit of fluid or thickening behind them, but it's hard to tell definitively without further testing.
PATIENT: Oh, earwax, is it? Well, that's not so bad. I reckon I haven't been cleanin' 'em properly. I always thought you weren't supposed to stick anything in your ears! My mother always warned me about that. Fluid behind the eardrums, you say? That doesn't sound good, does it? What sort of testin' do you mean, Doctor? Is it gonna be painful? I’m a bit nervous now, to be honest. Just tell me what you’re thinkin'. I trust you, but… I just worry, you know? Old age makes you worry about everything.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be nervous, Mr. Schneer. It's good you haven't been sticking anything in your ears – that can definitely cause problems. The testing I’m thinking of is an audiometry test – a hearing test. It’s completely painless. You’ll wear headphones and listen to different tones and sounds at different volumes. It helps us determine the type and severity of your hearing loss. We can also do a tympanometry test which measures how well your eardrum moves, which will help assess any fluid in the middle ear. It’s a quick and simple procedure. It will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on and help us decide the best course of action. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A hearing test, you say? With headphones? That doesn't sound too bad, actually. As long as it doesn't hurt, I reckon I can manage that. And you said it measures how well my eardrum moves? That sounds… thorough. I appreciate you explainin' it all so clearly, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease. Yes, alright. Let's go ahead with the testin', then. I'd like to know what's goin' on with my ears, you know? It's been botherin' me for a while now. Just… let me know if I need to do anything special. And… don't hesitate to stop if I get uncomfortable. I'm a bit of a worrier, as I said. But… let's get it done, then. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Schneer. It will give us a good baseline. Okay, so we’ll go into a soundproof booth. You'll sit in a chair with headphones on. I’ll be in the next room, and we’ll talk through an intercom. I’ll play different tones and sounds at different volumes, and I’ll ask you to indicate when you hear them. It's as simple as pressing a button each time you detect a sound. We will repeat this test with different words as well. The tympanometry test is quick. A small probe will be inserted into each ear, and it will gently measure the movement of your eardrum. You won’t feel anything. It’ll just take a few seconds per ear. I'll be with you every step of the way, and if you feel uncomfortable at any point, just let me know, and we’ll stop immediately. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Headphones, button pressin', and a little thing in my ear. Sounds manageable. A soundproof booth, you say? Will I be able to hear you talkin' through the intercom? I don't want to miss any instructions. And… how long will it take, roughly? I have a bit of an appointment later this afternoon, and I don't want to be late. And… one more thing. Will it show why my hearin’s bad? Is it somethin’ serious? I’m gettin’ a bit anxious now, I reckon. Sorry to be a bother, Doctor. I just worry, you know. It's the age.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Mr. Schneer. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious, and it’s good you’re asking questions. Yes, you’ll be able to hear me perfectly through the intercom. I’ll be speaking clearly throughout the test. The entire process should take about 30-45 minutes, including the tympanometry test. The test will help us determine the type of hearing loss you have – whether it’s conductive , sensorineural , or mixed. It won't necessarily tell us the exact cause right away, but it will give us a good starting point. We may need further investigation depending on the results. Let's get the test done first, and then we’ll discuss the results and any further steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Thirty to forty-five minutes. That's not too bad. Type of hearing loss… conductive, sensorineural… Sounds complicated. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Yes, let's get it done, then. I'm ready when you are. Just… lead the way. And… thank you for bein' so patient with an old worrier like me. It puts my mind at ease. It really does.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It’s my pleasure. And please don’t hesitate to let me know if you need any assistance at all. Right this way. The booth is just over here. I’ll explain everything again once we’re inside, and I’ll be right next door if you need anything. Let's go ahead.
