DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Nixon. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. Well, my left leg... it's gotten quite swollen. And, um, I have been told I have a funny heartbeat sometimes, atrial... something. It’s the leg that’s botherin’ me most right now, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a swollen left leg and some concern about your heartbeat. Let’s start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It wasn't sudden, exactly. I think it started maybe a week ago? It was just a little bit bigger than my other leg, but now... well, you can see it’s quite a bit bigger. I didn’t think much of it at first, to be honest. I just thought I’d been standin’ too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything made it better or worse since it started?
PATIENT: Well, restin’ it helps a wee bit, I suppose. When I sit down and put my feet up, it goes down a little. But if I’m on it all day, like when I’m teachin’, it gets much worse by the end of the day. Walkin’ doesn't seem to make it much different, neither better nor worse, really. Just tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, so rest helps, and standing or being on your feet makes it worse. And you said you're a teacher, so you're on your feet a good bit of the day. Any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It's more… heavy. Like it's weighin' a ton. And a little bit achy, maybe, but not a sharp pain. It’s just… uncomfortable, mostly. It feels… tight, if that makes sense. Like my skin is stretched too far.
DOCTOR: Alright, heavy, achy, and tight. Okay. Now, let’s talk about this heartbeat thing. Who told you about it, and when did they mention it?
PATIENT: It was… a friend’s mother, actually. She's a nurse. I was over at their house a few months ago, and she was takin’ my pulse just for a laugh, and she said it felt… irregular. She said somethin’ about “atrial fibrillation”, but I didn't really understand what that meant. It hasn’t bothered me much, though, so I didn't think much of it. I just get a little bit… fluttery sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a nurse friend’s mother mentioned atrial fibrillation a few months ago, and you sometimes feel a fluttering sensation. Do you feel dizzy or short of breath when you have that fluttering?
PATIENT: No, not usually. Sometimes maybe a wee bit tired afterwards, but that could just be from work, I suppose. No dizziness or shortness of breath, thankfully. It’s not a frequent thing, either. Maybe once a month, or even less. It just… happens sometimes. I hadn't really thought much of it until now, when my leg started swellin’. I wondered if maybe the two were connected.
DOCTOR: Alright. So no dizziness or shortness of breath with the fluttering. Let’s do a quick exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I want to take a look at your leg. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly alright. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I am hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, which could be consistent with what your friend’s mother mentioned. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look at your leg. Could you point to where the swelling is the worst?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s mostly here, around my calf. And my ankle feels a bit puffy, too. It’s not really red or hot, just… bigger than my other leg. See?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There is definite swelling, and it does pit, meaning it holds an indentation for a few seconds after I press on it. Your leg isn’t red or hot to the touch, which is good. I’m also checking your pulses in both feet… good, strong pulses in both. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright. That all sounds… good? I don't know much about what you're doin', but I’m happy to let you check. Just tell me if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are normal on both sides. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it could be a few things. The leg swelling could be due to venous insufficiency – meaning the valves in your veins aren't working as well as they should, leading to fluid buildup. The irregular heartbeat could be contributing to this, or it could be a separate issue. Hmmm… it looks like you haven’t had a recent EKG or any bloodwork done. I think we need to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would you be alright with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. I don’t mind gettin’ tests done if it will help figure out what’s wrong. I’d rather know, to be honest. What sort of tests are we talkin’ about? And will they be painful? I’m not very fond of needles, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll start with a blood test – just to check your kidney function and rule out any other potential causes for the swelling. And we'll do an EKG – that's a quick, painless test that records your heart's electrical activity. It involves placing a few sticky pads on your chest. No needles involved for that one! The blood test will be a small needle prick, but it’s usually quick and not too uncomfortable. We might also consider a venous ultrasound of your leg – that's an imaging test that looks at the veins in your leg to see if there are any clots or valve problems. That one involves a cool gel on your leg and a probe, and it doesn't hurt at all. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable, I think. No needles sounds good! And the ultrasound doesn't sound too bad either. I'm happy to have all those tests done if it will help. When can I get them done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’m going to write up the orders for the bloodwork, EKG, and ultrasound now. The lab is just down the hall, and they can get you in right away for the bloodwork and EKG. They'll schedule the ultrasound for you – usually within a couple of days, depending on their availability. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have the results, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and go over a treatment plan. In the meantime, try to elevate your leg as much as possible when you’re sitting or lying down. And wear compression stockings if you have them – they can help reduce the swelling. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very clearly, Doctor. Elevate my leg and wear stockings… I can do that. I don’t think I have any questions right now. Thank you for explainin’ everything so well. Where should I go for the bloodwork and EKG?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The lab is right outside the door, to your left. Just tell the receptionist that Dr. Voytek ordered bloodwork and an EKG for you. They'll get you all set up. Once you're done, just come back here and let me know. And if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening leg swelling, go to the emergency room immediately, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I'll go to the lab and tell them Dr. Voytek sent me. And I’ll remember to go to the emergency room if things get worse. Thank you again, Doctor. .
