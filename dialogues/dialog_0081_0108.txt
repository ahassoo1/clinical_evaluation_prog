DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, honestly. Waste of time, most of ‘em. But… well, I’ve been, uh, losing a bit of blood. Not a little, you know? Enough to… concern me. It’s coming from… down there. I just figured I’d get it checked before it gets really bad. Don't need a mess, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood from the… rectal area, you're saying?
PATIENT: Yeah, rectal area. Is that what you call it? Look, I'm a simple man, Doc. It's coming out of my backside, alright? And it’s not just a little trickle. It's… substantial. Dark color, too. Not bright red, if that means anything to you. I haven’t changed my diet or anything. Nothing new, I swear.
DOCTOR: Dark color…substantial. Alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a week ago? At first it was just a little, and I figured it was something I ate. But it’s gotten worse each day. Like I said, now it's… noticeable. And frankly, a bit worrying. I'm not one to panic, but a man can only lose so much before… well, you get the picture.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you describe the blood for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want me to do, write a poem? It’s…thick. Not watery, you know? More like… sludge. And dark, really dark. Like… old coffee grounds, I guess. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, Doc, I’m not a doctor. I just tell you what it looks like. It’s not pretty, alright? And it’s getting…more frequent. Every time I…go, there's more of it.
DOCTOR: Thick, dark, resembling coffee grounds, and increasing in frequency. Right. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, exactly. More like… a straining. You know, gotta push a bit harder than usual. And a little… discomfort afterwards. Like something’s irritated. Not a sharp pain, just… unpleasant. It doesn't happen every time, but it's there sometimes. And honestly, the worry is probably causing me more discomfort than anything. You think it’s serious, Doc? Don’t sugarcoat it, I can handle the truth.
DOCTOR: Straining and post-movement discomfort. We need to determine the source of the bleeding, Mr. Gentz. Given the color and consistency you’ve described, and the fact that it’s increasing, it warrants investigation. I'm going to need to perform a physical exam. That will involve a rectal exam, unfortunately. It's…standard procedure. And I'd also like to order some blood work, a complete blood count, and a fecal occult blood test. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Seriously? Look, I'm not thrilled about that idea at all. Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn’t we just…try something else? Blood work, fine. I guess. But sticking something up… well, it feels like an invasion of privacy, frankly. I’ve lived a long life, Doc, and I haven't needed anyone poking around down there before. Tell me why it has to be done. What are you even looking for? And what if it's…nothing?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your discomfort. However, a digital rectal exam is often the quickest and most direct way to identify potential sources of rectal bleeding. We are looking for things like hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or any masses that could be causing the bleeding. While it may be unpleasant, it’s a crucial part of the diagnostic process. And yes, it could be something minor, like hemorrhoids. But we need to rule out anything more serious. Delaying a proper examination could have consequences. I assure you, I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. Do you understand the importance of ruling out other causes?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t like it, but…fine. Do what you have to do. Just…be quick about it, alright? And I want you to explain everything afterwards. Don't just poke around and then tell me “everything's fine”. Tell me what you were looking for, what you saw, and what it means. And be honest, Doc. I don’t appreciate being talked down to. As for the blood work… go ahead with that too. But I swear, if it turns out to be nothing, I’m sending you the bill for the stress. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll explain everything thoroughly afterwards. Please lie on your side with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I will need to lubricate a gloved, finger and gently insert it into the rectum to palpate for any abnormalities. It will only take a moment.
