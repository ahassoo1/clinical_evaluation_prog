DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It's August 2nd. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s kinda embarrassing, but I’m havin’ a real hard time gettin’ out of chairs. Like, I sit down, and then… stuck. Not always, but often enough it’s a problem. It's been goin' on a few weeks now, I guess.
DOCTOR: I see. It's alright, Mr. Fratoni, there’s no need to be embarrassed. Many things can cause difficulty rising from a chair, and we’ll work together to figure out what’s going on with you. When you say “stuck,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it feels… like my legs just won’t respond. Not pain, exactly. More like… they’re heavy, and it takes a lot of effort to push myself up. Sometimes I gotta use my arms to kinda… heave myself outta the seat. And it’s not just low chairs, either. Happens with normal chairs, kitchen chairs, even sometimes gettin’ up from the couch. It’s kinda scary, actually. I’m a roustabout, workin’ oil and gas… gotta be able to move.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially given your line of work. It’s good you’re addressing this now. So, it’s not pain causing the difficulty, but a feeling of heaviness and effort to push yourself up, even from normal chairs and couches. And it’s been happening for a few weeks now. To get a better understanding, could you tell me about how this started?
PATIENT: That’s right, exactly. How it started… hmm. That's the weird part. It didn’t really start suddenly. It was kinda gradual. I noticed it first after a particularly long shift, felt more tired than usual. Thought it was just the exhaustion, you know? But it didn’t really go away. Then, it just slowly got worse. Like, one day it was just a little harder to get up, next day a little harder still. I don’t remember any specific injury or event that triggered it. Just… faded in, I guess. It’s kinda freakin’ me out ‘cause my wife… she had problems with her legs before she passed, and I… well, I don’t wanna end up like that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, particularly given your wife’s history. It's good you’re being proactive about this. A gradual onset, without a clear injury, is helpful information. To get a clearer picture, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any weakness in your legs besides when getting up from a chair?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Sometimes my legs feel kinda… shaky when I’ve been standin’ for a while. Not all the time, but it happens. Like, if I’m workin’ on somethin’ and gotta stay on my feet for an hour or so, they’ll start to feel wobbly. I gotta lean on somethin’ sometimes. And… this might sound weird, but sometimes they just feel… tingly. Not painful, just… like pins and needles. It comes and goes. It happens in both legs, mostly my thighs. I didn't really think much of it 'til this chair thing started gettin’ bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Shaky legs with prolonged standing and tingling sensations in your thighs – that gives us more to work with. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: Changes in… what now? Sorry, Doc, you’re usin’ big words. You mean… goin’ to the bathroom? I haven't noticed anything different there, no. Everything’s been… normal, I guess. No trouble holdin’ it, no changes in how often I go, nothin’ like that. Just the chair and the shaky legs and the tingly feelin’. I ain't been havin' no accidents or nothin'. Sorry if that's too much info. I just wanna be clear.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Fratoni. It’s important to be clear, and you’re doing a good job of explaining everything. It's good to know there haven’t been any changes in your bowel or bladder function. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothin' official. I’ve never really been to a doctor much, honestly. Work keeps me busy. I get checked out at the oil rig sometimes, basic stuff, but they never told me I had anything wrong. I've always been pretty healthy, strong. My wife… she was the one who needed doctors. I took care of her, but me? No. No diagnoses. I get a bit of aches and pains from the work, but that's just part of the job, y'know? Nothing serious. I’m not on any medications either.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no previous medical diagnoses and you aren’t currently taking any medications. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgery. Broke my arm when I was a kid, fell outta a tree, but they just put it in a cast. Healed up fine. That’s it. No cuts, no stitches, nothin' major. Just the broken arm when I was little. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Always been a careful fella. Well, except for that tree. My mom was not happy about that. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries either. And you mentioned your wife – do you know if she had any medical conditions that ran in her family?
PATIENT: Oh, man. She… her mom had somethin’ with her nerves. Real bad. She was in a wheelchair for a long time before she passed. And her grandma, on her dad’s side… she had somethin’ similar, I think. Like, weakness in her legs, trouble walkin’. It was always kinda hush-hush, though. She didn’t like talkin’ about it. They went to specialists and stuff, but I wasn’t around much then. I was workin’. Her brother told me a little bit after she was gone, said it was somethin’ they couldn’t fix. It scared her real bad, that's for sure. It’s kinda why I’m freakin’ out about this chair thing, y’know? Don't wanna end up like her.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Mr. Fratoni. Knowing about your wife’s family history of nerve issues is very important. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ like that. Never been a smoker. I used to have a beer now and then with my wife, but I haven’t touched it since she passed. It just… doesn’t feel right. And no, no drugs. I need a clear head for work, y’know? Dangerous job. I drink a lot of water, though. Gotta stay hydrated out there in the sun. I try to eat healthy when I can, but it’s hard when you’re on the go all the time. Mostly just grabbin’ whatever’s quick and easy. I work long hours, though. Six, seven days a week sometimes. That’s about it. No fancy habits or nothin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. That’s good to know. And you work long hours. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Doc. I just wanna figure out what’s goin’ on. Long as it ain’t somethin’ bad. I’m ready when you are. Just tell me what I gotta do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit on the table for me, please. We’ll start with some basic neurological tests – checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. It shouldn't take long. First, could you please cross your legs and relax your arms by your sides?
PATIENT: Yeah, no problem. Alright, I’m ready. Just let me know what you want me to do. I hope it ain't nothin' too serious. This chair thing is really freakin’ me out.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Fratoni. We’ll take it one step at a time. Okay, I’m checking your reflexes now. Just relax your legs. Good. Both reflexes are present and symmetrical, which is good. Now, I’d like you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, I felt that. There. Is that good? I’m pretty strong, if you haven’t noticed. Rough work, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, your grip strength is good, very strong as you said. Now, can you please push your feet against my hands like you're pressing the gas pedal in a car?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that what you want? I'm pushin' as hard as I can. Just let me know if I need to do somethin' different.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Both legs are strong. Now, let’s check your coordination. Could you please place one foot directly in front of the other, heel to toe, and walk a straight line for me?
PATIENT: Okay, I’m tryin’ to walk straight. It’s kinda tricky like this, though. I gotta concentrate to keep my balance. Is this okay? I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: You’re doing fine, Mr. Fratoni. Just walk at a normal pace. Okay, thank you. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the table.
PATIENT: Alright, I’m lyin’ down. Just let me know if you need me to do somethin’ different. I hope everything sounds okay. My heart’s always been strong, as far as I know. Rough work, you know? A lot of heavy liftin’ and long hours.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within the normal range. Okay, Mr. Fratoni, everything I’ve examined so far appears normal. Your reflexes are intact, muscle strength is good, coordination is normal, heart and lungs sound clear, and your blood pressure is normal. However, your symptoms – the difficulty getting up from a chair, shaky legs, and tingling sensations – warrant further investigation. It sounds like you may be experiencing some early signs of neuropathy, or nerve damage.
PATIENT: Neuropathy? What's that? Is that bad? My wife... was that what she had? I’m kinda scared now, Doc. You said everything sounds normal, but I can barely get outta a chair! What does this mean? Do I need tests? What kinda tests? Is there somethin’ you can do for me? I need to be able to work, y’know? What if I lose my job?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Fratoni, and it’s good you’re asking these questions. Neuropathy simply means nerve damage, and it can have many causes. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s as severe as what your wife experienced. It’s a broad term, and the severity can vary greatly. Given your history and symptoms, it's possible, but we need to confirm this. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few tests. First, a nerve conduction study and electromyography . These tests measure the electrical activity in your nerves and muscles, which can help us pinpoint the source of the problem. We'll also do some bloodwork to check for underlying conditions like diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or other causes of neuropathy. These tests will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. Depending on the results, treatment options could include physical therapy, medication to manage symptoms, or addressing any underlying medical conditions. It’s important to rule out other possible causes first. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… okay. Nerve… what was it? Conduction study? EMG? Sounds scary. And bloodwork… I haven’t had bloodwork in years. How long do these tests take? And… how much are they gonna cost? I don’t have insurance, Doc. I lost it when my wife… well, it's been hard. I barely make enough as it is. And if it is somethin' serious… what kinda treatment are we talkin’? Is it gonna keep me from workin’? I gotta provide for myself, y’know? This is really worryin’ me. I appreciate you listenin’, but I’m scared I can't afford all this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Fratoni. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests and costs, especially without insurance. The nerve conduction study and EMG usually take about an hour to an hour and a half. They involve placing small electrodes on your skin to measure nerve activity – it might feel a little uncomfortable, but it's not painful. The bloodwork will be much quicker – just a standard blood draw. As for costs, it varies depending on the lab, but I can connect you with resources that offer financial assistance programs for patients without insurance. I also have a medical billing specialist who can help you navigate the costs and explore payment options. We can definitely work something out. As for treatment, it depends on the diagnosis. Many people with neuropathy can continue to work with appropriate management. Physical therapy can help strengthen muscles and improve balance. Medication can help manage symptoms like pain or tingling. We'll discuss all your options and create a plan that works for your lifestyle and your work demands. The goal is to get you back to doing the things you enjoy and continue providing for yourself. Before we proceed, would you like me to order the bloodwork and schedule the nerve conduction study and EMG?
PATIENT: Okay… financial assistance… medical billing specialist… that sounds good. Anything that helps with the cost. I really appreciate that, Doc. Yeah… yeah, let’s order the bloodwork and schedule the tests. I just wanna know what I’m dealin’ with. The sooner the better, I guess. And… could you give me the names of those programs and the billing specialist, just in case? I wanna be prepared. This is a lot to take in, but… I appreciate you bein’ straight with me. And tryin’ to help. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll go ahead and get the orders for the bloodwork and the nerve conduction study and EMG. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll schedule the nerve conduction study for you – it usually takes a week or so to get an appointment. Here are the orders. I’ve also included a list of resources for financial assistance programs – the contact information and websites are all listed there. And here is the name and number of my medical billing specialist, Ms. Evelyn Hayes. She’s very good at navigating insurance issues and finding affordable payment options. Don't hesitate to reach out to her with any questions. We’ll discuss the results once they're available and create a plan based on what we find. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or you experience any new problems, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doc. Seriously. You've been a big help. I'm still scared, but… at least I know what we're tryin' to figure out. I’ll call Ms. Hayes and get those tests scheduled. And… I appreciate you bein’ so patient with me. It ain’t easy talkin’ about this stuff. I guess I’ll see you again when the results come back. Have a good day, Doc. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Fratoni. It's my job to help, and I’m glad I could provide some clarity. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I’ll see you when the results are back. Have a good day as well.
