DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's...fine, I suppose. I came because my legs just suddenly feel weak. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a really nasty cold. Not a pleasant experience, let me tell you. I haven’t felt this unsteady in years.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness in the legs after a cold can be concerning. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just weakness, Doctor. It’s…difficult to explain. It feels like they don’t quite listen to my brain anymore, you know? Like there’s a delay. And it’s both legs, which is odd. Usually, I’m very coordinated. I lead tours, after all. People expect a certain…level of professionalism. I haven’t stumbled yet, thankfully, but it’s getting harder to maintain my usual pace. It’s very unsettling.
DOCTOR: I see. A delay in response, affecting both legs, and making it harder to maintain your usual coordination… That is unsettling, especially with your profession. To clarify, when you say "delay," is it a gradual slowing down of movement when you try to move, or is it more like a feeling of unsteadiness while you're walking?
PATIENT: It's more the unsteadiness, I think. It’s not like I can’t make myself walk, it’s just… precarious. Like I’m balancing on a tightrope. And it comes and goes. Sometimes I feel perfectly fine for a few minutes, then whoosh, it hits me again. It’s not constant, thankfully. Though, to be honest, I’ve been taking it easy just in case. Don't want to risk anything. It's quite disruptive, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent unsteadiness, affecting both legs, and not a constant issue. That’s helpful. Has this unsteadiness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. No numbness, no tingling. No pain, thankfully. No fever now, obviously, since the cold is gone. I did feel a little dizzy once or twice, but I chalked that up to getting up too quickly. I tend to stand a lot during my tours, so that happens sometimes. Nothing major, Doctor. Just this unsettling weakness. It's very bothersome, frankly. And I really can't afford to be unwell. The season is busy.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone, especially with your busy season. No numbness, tingling, or pain, just the intermittent unsteadiness and occasional dizziness. Let’s review your medical history. Do you have any significant past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. Nothing major. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was routine. And I’ve always had slightly high blood pressure, but it’s managed with a small dose of medication. Nothing else, really. I try to stay healthy. I walk a lot, as you know, and I eat reasonably well. I don’t drink much, and I certainly don't smoke. It's just…this is so unusual for me. I'm usually very robust.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal in the past, and managed hypertension. That's good to know. And you mentioned you take medication for your blood pressure. Could you tell me the name and dosage of that medication, please?
PATIENT: It's...Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once a day. Every morning. Though, to be honest, I haven't had it refilled in a few months. My blood pressure has been stable, and I've been meaning to schedule an appointment with my primary care physician. It just slipped my mind, you know? Things get so busy. I really should be more organized.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Firestone. Not having your Lisopril refilled for a few months is something we'll need to address. And you said this started a few days after a cold. Do you remember any specifics about the cold itself?
PATIENT: Oh, it was a nasty one. Sore throat, runny nose, you know the drill. And a terrible cough. I was congested for days. I tried everything – over-the-counter decongestants, lozenges, the whole nine yards. It lasted about a week, maybe a little longer. I thought I was completely over it when this leg weakness started. It just…appeared suddenly. Very peculiar. It’s not like I pushed myself or anything. I was resting! That’s what’s so unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, a typical cold with a sore throat, runny nose, and cough, lasting about a week, followed by this sudden onset of leg weakness. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any neurological conditions – like stroke, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm...that’s a good question. My mother had some memory problems towards the end of her life, but the doctor said it was just old age. My father was very healthy, lived to be eighty-five. No stroke, no Parkinson’s… I don’t recall anyone with multiple sclerosis, no. My family isn’t particularly prone to illness, honestly. We’re a pretty hardy bunch. It's rather worrying that I’m having these issues, to be frank. It’s quite out of character.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Firestone. No significant neurological conditions in the family history. Finally, let's talk about social history. Do you use alcohol or tobacco?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally – a very small glass, mind you – but that’s it. And I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked, and it was dreadful. I vowed never to start, and I haven’t. I prefer a nice cup of herbal tea, honestly. Much healthier. I need my wits about me, you know? Leading tours requires a certain…clarity.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. No alcohol or tobacco use. Thank you for providing that information. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I’m aware of. I’ve taken various medications over the years for minor ailments – pain relievers, antibiotics – and I’ve never had a reaction. I’m very careful about what I put into my body, you know? I don't want any surprises. It’s just…this leg weakness is the surprise, isn’t it? A most unwelcome one, I must say. It’s very disruptive, and I really need to get to the bottom of it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Firestone. No known allergies. Alright, with all that information, let's do a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then assess your neurological function. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. Honestly, I feel rather unsteady on my feet today. I’m not usually like this, I assure you. I hope you don't mind if I hold onto the chair for a moment. Just in case.
DOCTOR: Of course, please do. No problem at all. I'm just going to check your blood pressure first. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, Ms. Firestone, but that could be due to being in the office and your concerns. Now, let’s check your pulse and temperature. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Very well. It’s a little difficult, Doctor. My vision seems a bit…unfocused. And I feel a slight dizziness when I move my eyes quickly. Not terrible, but noticeable. I haven't had any problems with my vision before, you know? I always prided myself on having excellent eyesight. Especially important when spotting interesting wildlife on my tours. It's just… everything feels a bit off today.
DOCTOR: I see. And that’s helpful information. Now, I'd like to check your strength in your legs. Could you please sit back down for a moment?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate, of course, but I must say, I’m feeling rather fragile today. I really do hope you can determine what’s causing this. It’s most unsettling. I’ve never felt so unsteady in my life. It's quite concerning, frankly. I have a tour scheduled next week, and I don't want to disappoint my clients.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone. We will do our best to get to the bottom of this. Now, could you please extend your legs straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Alright. It's a bit difficult, Doctor. They feel… heavy. And I have to concentrate to keep them straight. They keep wanting to bend. I’m not usually this clumsy, you know? I’m quite coordinated. I used to be a dancer, years ago. But this feels very different. Much weaker.
DOCTOR: I see. And I appreciate you pointing that out. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. I'm going to gently tap on your knees with this small hammer. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished on both sides, Ms. Firestone. And now, I will check the sensation in your feet. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, I can feel that. And that as well. Everything feels…normal, to be honest. Though, now that you mention it, my feet do feel a little… numb, perhaps? It's a very subtle sensation, difficult to describe. Not like pins and needles, but… distant. A slight lack of feeling. Is that what you're looking for, Doctor? It's rather difficult to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. A slight decrease in sensation is important to note. Okay, Ms. Firestone, that completes the physical exam for now. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam – the intermittent leg weakness, the slight dizziness, the diminished reflexes, and the decreased sensation – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Your elevated blood pressure could be contributing, but I suspect there's more going on. Given the nature of your symptoms following a cold, one possibility is Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves. Another possibility, though less likely, is a more common nerve compression issue. To help me narrow down the cause, I'd like to order some blood tests and an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Guillain-Barré syndrome? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it… common? And an MRI? Is that… painful? I must admit, I’m rather apprehensive. I’ve never had any serious illnesses before, and I’m not fond of hospitals. But if it’s necessary to determine what’s wrong, I suppose I can cooperate. But please, explain everything carefully. I need to understand what’s happening, and what the risks are. This is all very unsettling, Doctor. Very unsettling indeed.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Firestone, and I want to assure you we're taking this seriously, but we're also being thorough. Guillain-Barré syndrome is rare, affecting about 1 in 100,000 people. It's often triggered by a viral infection, like the cold you recently had. The MRI is non-invasive; you’ll lie in a scanner that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain and spinal cord. It's painless, but it can be a little noisy, and you'll need to lie very still for about 30-40 minutes. The blood tests will help us look for any signs of inflammation or autoimmune activity. We’ll be looking at your nerve function as well. Given your symptoms, it’s important to rule out any serious underlying causes. While Guillain-Barré syndrome is a possibility, it's not the only one. We need to gather more information before we can make a diagnosis. I'll order the tests right away. The clinic will contact you to schedule the MRI. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity. If you experience any new symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, severe muscle weakness, or problems with swallowing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. No, I haven’t experienced any of that, thankfully. Just the weakness and the unsteadiness. And the slight dizziness. I’ll be very careful, Doctor. I promise. And the tests… how long will it take to get the results? And what if it is Guillain-Barré syndrome? What kind of treatment is involved? I need to know what to expect, you understand? I have a tour scheduled for next week, and I’m responsible for the safety of my clients. This is all very stressful. I really wish I hadn’t come down with that cold.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone, and I want to be as transparent as possible. The blood tests usually take 24-48 hours to come back. The MRI results can take a bit longer, typically 1-2 business days. If it is Guillain-Barré syndrome, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. The main treatment involves plasmapheresis, a procedure where we remove harmful antibodies from your blood. It’s similar to dialysis, but instead of filtering your kidneys, we’re filtering your blood. There's also intravenous immunoglobulin , where we give you antibodies from healthy donors to help suppress your immune system. The recovery process can be lengthy, and it may involve physical therapy to regain your strength and coordination. But with prompt treatment, many people make a full recovery. In the meantime, we’ll keep monitoring your symptoms closely. We'll discuss all the options once we have the test results. For now, focus on resting and avoiding any strenuous activity. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address right now?
PATIENT: Plasmapheresis… that sounds… invasive. And a lengthy recovery… I don’t know if I can afford to be out of commission for that long. I have bills to pay, you know? And clients to serve. I suppose I should call my insurance company, then. To see what’s covered. Medicare, I have. But they can be… difficult to deal with. And what about my tour? I’ll have to cancel it, I suppose. I feel terrible about that. Disappointing my clients… it’s not a good look. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… a lot to think about. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything, at least. I suppose I’ll wait for the test results, then. And hope for the best.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Firestone. We’ll do everything we can to help you get through this. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We'll contact you as soon as the test results are available. And don't worry about the tour right now, your health is the priority. Take care, and we’ll be in touch soon. .
