DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. So, Mrs. Squiers, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s very kind of you to see me. I’m hoping you can help with a wee bit of paperwork, if you don’t mind. I’m going on a cruise next month – a rather special one, actually – and they need a form filled out with some… medical information. I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time, and I don’t have a family doctor anymore, you see. My husband… well, never you mind about that now. It's just this form.
DOCTOR: A cruise, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. To the Norwegian Fjords. I always loved the sea, and my husband… well, we’d planned it for years. It’s a bit lonely going without him, but I thought he'd want me to go. Anyway, the cruise line needs to know about any… conditions, or medications, or anything like that. I’m fairly fit for my age, I think, but I wouldn’t want to leave anything off the form. Do you have it there, perhaps? Or should I get it for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let's focus on your medical history, Mrs. Squiers, not… extraneous details. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, of course, you’re right. Sorry, I do tend to ramble on. Let me think… Well, years ago – must have been thirty years now – I had a rather bad bout of pneumonia. I was in hospital for a week or so, but I recovered fully. And I have a touch of arthritis in my hands, mostly just in the mornings it’s a bit stiff. Nothing that stops me from doing things, mind you. I still manage my work just fine. I’m a merchandise displacer, you see – window trimming, mostly. It keeps me on my feet. Is that… helpful? I wasn't sure what you needed to know.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia, thirty years ago. And arthritis in your hands. Anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but that was all straightforward. No problems afterwards, thankfully. And… Oh! I used to be quite prone to migraines when I was younger, but they’ve mostly stopped now. It’s been… well, ten years at least since I had one. I used to take something for them – a little pink pill, I think – but I don’t take anything regularly now. Does that sound right? I'm trying to remember everything. It feels like a lifetime ago sometimes.
DOCTOR: Migraines… intermittent. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Absolutely nothing. Not a single pill. I try to stay away from them if I can, prefer a cup of tea if I'm feeling poorly, to be honest. I used to take cod liver oil when I was a girl, for my joints, but I haven't touched that in years. Just tea, and the occasional wee biscuit, if I'm being bad! I really don’t take anything regularly, I assure you. I pride myself on being fairly healthy, all things considered. Though my knees do ache a bit when the weather changes, but that’s just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. None at all. I've always been able to eat anything, thankfully – never had any trouble with shellfish or anything like that. And I’ve never reacted badly to any medication, as far as I can remember. I had all my vaccinations as a child, of course, and had a booster for tetanus a few years back when I cut my hand gardening. But no allergies, no. I'm quite lucky in that regard, really. I haven’t even had poison ivy once, and we have plenty of it growing around here!
DOCTOR: Alright. And your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother lived to a good age – eighty-nine, she did – but she had a touch of high blood pressure towards the end. My father was quite strong, but he passed away suddenly from a heart attack when I was young, must have been in his sixties. My only brother is still alive, thankfully, but he lives in Canada and I haven't seen him in years. He's always been very healthy, though, keeps fit and active. There wasn't much…serious illness in the family, if you ask me. Nothing like cancer or anything like that. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Is that helpful, Doctor? I’m trying to think of everything important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, regarding your social habits... do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor! Not a drop of it, not ever! I wouldn’t dream of it. My husband didn't approve of smoking, and I wouldn't want to start after he's gone. And I certainly don't partake in anything… recreational. I do enjoy a nice cup of tea in the evenings, and perhaps a wee biscuit with it, but that’s the extent of my indulgences. I’m a very… temperate person, if you ask me. I've never had a wild streak in my life, not really. I prefer a quiet evening at home with a good book, to be honest. Is that alright, Doctor? I hope I’m giving you enough information.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We will start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. Happy to. Though I confess, I'm not terribly fond of doctors' offices. It always makes me feel a bit… vulnerable. Just point me in the right direction, and I'll get up there. Though I might need a wee hand getting up, if you don’t mind. My knees aren't what they used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: There. And I will assist you if necessary, but try to manage on your own if you can.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor, that's very kind of you. It's just a bit of a climb, you see. I used to be so nimble, but these old bones aren't as cooperative as they once were. Is it cold in here, or is it just me? I always feel a chill in doctors’ offices.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated, 145/90. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Everything seems… within normal limits, considering.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Elevated, you say? That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Is that… worrying? My mother had high blood pressure towards the end, as I mentioned. Perhaps it's hereditary? What does that mean, exactly? Should I be taking something for it? And… what about the cruise? Will this affect my ability to travel? I’m rather anxious about it now, if I’m honest. I just wanted to be sure everything was alright before I went.
DOCTOR: It is not immediately alarming, Mrs. Squiers. Elevated blood pressure is common. We need to monitor it. Given your family history, we will need to revisit this. I will prescribe a low dose of lisinopril. Start with 5mg daily. This should help to lower your blood pressure. Now, about the cruise... it is your decision to travel. However, I recommend you consult with your primary care physician upon your return for further evaluation. And avoid strenuous activity.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… good to hear it’s not alarming, Doctor. Thank you. Lisopril, you say? I’ve never taken anything like that before. Are there any… side effects I should be aware of? And how long will it take to start working? I don't have a primary care physician, you see. That’s why I came to you. My husband always handled the medical things. Is it alright if I ask you a few more questions about it? I just want to be sure I understand everything before I leave. It's just... a bit overwhelming, all of a sudden.
DOCTOR: Common side effects include dizziness, lightheadedness, and a dry cough. It will take a few weeks to see the full effect. This pamphlet contains more detailed information. As for not having a primary care physician… frankly, it is irresponsible. You need a doctor who follows your care consistently. I can provide you with a list of physicians in the area, but I am not responsible for ongoing treatment. Do you have any other urgent questions?
PATIENT: Oh, dizziness and a cough... Well, I do get a bit of a tickle in my throat sometimes, but I put that down to the tea. A list of physicians, you say? That would be very kind of you, Doctor. I suppose I haven't really thought about it properly since... well, since my husband passed. He always took care of those things. Just one more thing, if you don’t mind. The cruise… is it safe for me to go, even with the blood pressure? I've been looking forward to it for so long. I don't want to cancel it if I don't have to. But I also don't want to put myself at risk. It’s just… I’m a bit lost, if I’m honest. Is there anything else I should be doing to prepare? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Given the medication, you may proceed with the cruise. However, monitor your blood pressure regularly. Avoid strenuous activity, excessive alcohol consumption, and stay well-hydrated. If you experience any dizziness, lightheadedness, or chest pain, seek immediate medical attention. Here. These are physicians in the area. I strongly recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment upon your return. I've documented everything. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor, that's very kind. I will certainly monitor my blood pressure, and I’ll take all of your advice to heart. Thank you for everything. And... thank you for your patience. I won't take up any more of your time. .
