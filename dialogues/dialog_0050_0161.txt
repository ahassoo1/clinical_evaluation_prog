DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I look into something… this PrEP thing. She said it's good to be careful, and honestly, I'm just trying to be smart about my health. I don't have a lot of time, so I figured I'd just get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I see. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis. A sensible approach to preventative healthcare, certainly. Though, frankly, many patients come in seeking this without a full understanding of the risks involved. Before we proceed with any medication, it’s crucial we establish whether it’s truly appropriate for you. Now, Ms. Trefren, could you elaborate on what prompted your friend’s suggestion?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… just general stuff. She's… more active, let's say, than I am. And she mentioned it’s good if you have… multiple partners. I don’t, currently. I haven't been with anyone in a long time, but she said it's better to be prepared, just in case. I’m single, as the paperwork probably says, and haven’t really been dating. But, you know… things change. I just want to know what it is, really, and if I even need it. I don’t want to take pills if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: "Active," you say. I understand. It's prudent to be informed, though your friend's advice, while well-intentioned, requires a bit of nuance. PrEP, as you know, is a medication – specifically, a daily pill – that significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission. However, it is not a blanket preventative measure for all sexually transmitted infections. It’s solely focused on HIV. Now, Ms. Trefren, to determine its appropriateness for you, I need a rather detailed history. Let’s start with your sexual history. Have you had any sexual contact in the past six months?
PATIENT: Six months… let me think. No. Not in six months. It’s been… longer than that. Years, honestly. I haven't really thought about it much, to be clear. I mean, I’ve had partners in the past, of course, but it's been a long time since anything happened. I don’t even remember the exact dates, if that helps. I mostly just… keep to myself these days. Is that the kind of thing you need to know exactly? I’m not trying to be difficult, it’s just… not something I dwell on.
DOCTOR: A precise timeline isn’t required, Ms. Trefren, but understanding the recent history is important. The absence of sexual activity in recent years is… relevant. However, past exposure remains a factor. Can you recall the approximate number of sexual partners you’ve had in your lifetime?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a tough one. Honestly, I’ve lost count. Not a huge number, I don’t think. Maybe… five? Six? It’s really hard to remember. It was a long time ago, and I’ve… changed a lot since then. I wasn’t always as cautious as I should have been, if I’m being honest. But, like I said, that was a long time ago. I'm more careful now, even if I haven’t been with anyone. Does it matter if I don’t know the exact number? It feels like a very personal question.
DOCTOR: Everything is confidential, Ms. Trefren. And while a precise count isn't critical, a general understanding of past sexual activity helps us assess risk. It's not merely about the number of partners, but whether you’ve ever had unprotected sexual contact with anyone whose HIV status was unknown. Have you ever engaged in sexual activity without a condom?
PATIENT: Yes. I have. Several times, when I was younger. We didn’t really… think about things like that back then. It was… different. A lot of people weren’t talking about it. And, to be honest, I wasn’t always the smartest. I regret that now, of course. It was foolish. But that was a long time ago. Before I knew any better, really. Does that change things? I'm starting to feel like I shouldn't even be here bothering you with all this old history.
DOCTOR: It does not mean you are "bothering" me, Ms. Trefren. It simply means we're gathering the necessary information for a comprehensive assessment. Your candor is appreciated, though I must caution you against self-blame. Past behavior cannot be altered, but future risk can be mitigated. Now, to proceed, we need to perform some baseline testing. Specifically, an HIV test, a syphilis screening, and tests for other sexually transmitted infections. We will also need to assess your kidney function, as PrEP can have effects on renal health. Would you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That makes sense. If you need to know, you need to know. I understand. Kidney function… okay. Whatever you think is necessary. I just want to get this over with, honestly, and know if I need to worry or not. So, yes. I consent to the tests. Where do we start? And how long will this all take? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The phlebotomist is prepared to draw your blood now. It will take approximately 15 minutes for the blood draw itself, and results typically take 5-7 business days to return. While we await the lab results, let's discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Just my age, I guess! No, seriously. I have high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. And a bit of arthritis, but nothing major. I take something for that too. Medicare covers everything, thankfully. No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had any serious illnesses, really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older. Is that enough? I'm not exactly a complicated case, Doctor.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication. And arthritis. That is pertinent information, Ms. Trefren. Could you please list the names and dosages of the medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see… Okay, for the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams every morning. And for the arthritis, I take Ibuprofen… usually 600 milligrams, when I need it. Not every day, just when my joints are acting up. I try to take as little as possible. And sometimes I take Tylenol, if the ibuprofen isn’t enough. Is that detailed enough? I’m really not good with remembering all this stuff, honestly.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg daily and Ibuprofen 600mg PRN. Tylenol as needed. Very good. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes. I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. That was… unpleasant. And I had a hysterectomy when I was younger. That was… a long time ago, and not something I like to talk about. Other than that… no. Nothing major. Just a few minor things, like wisdom teeth pulled. Does the gallbladder removal matter? It seems like a long time ago. I’m starting to feel a bit tired, if you don’t mind me saying. This is a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy and gallbladder removal. Both are relevant. Now, is there anyone in your family with a history of chronic illness?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. My mother had diabetes, and my father had heart disease. And my brother… he had some kind of cancer, a long time ago. He's gone now, unfortunately. Other than that… not that I know of. My family wasn't really big on talking about health things. We mostly just… kept to ourselves. Is that helpful? I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very organized. It’s just… a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: Diabetes, heart disease, and a history of cancer in the family. That's helpful information, Ms. Trefren. Now, to return to your lifestyle… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped years ago. It wasn’t good for my blood pressure. And I certainly don’t do any drugs. Never have, never will. I’m a very… respectable woman, Doctor. I try to take care of myself. That’s why I’m here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That is reassuring, Ms. Trefren. Now, is there anything else you think I should know?
PATIENT: Hmm... Well, I live alone. I have a daughter, but she lives out of state. She's very busy with her own life, which is fine. I mostly keep to myself, like I said. I try to stay active, walking when the weather is nice. And I volunteer at the local library a few hours a week. It keeps my mind busy. I guess that's it. I'm not really a complicated person, Doctor. I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing. Is this all you need for now? I’m starting to feel a bit drained.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Trefren. Thank you for your candor. At this point, we've covered the essential elements of your medical history. As we discussed, we will proceed with the baseline blood tests. Once we have the results, we can determine whether PrEP is appropriate for you, and discuss any potential risks and benefits. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your current lifestyle, including your volunteer work and regular walks. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've answered everything I've been wondering, really. I just… appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's been a lot, but I feel better knowing I'm getting things checked out. When should I expect to hear back about the results? And is there anything I need to do before my next appointment?
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Trefren. The results typically take 5-7 business days. The phlebotomist will contact you directly to inform you when they are available. In the meantime, no preparation is necessary for your next appointment. I will review the results with you in detail and discuss our next steps. I will have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you before you leave. Do you have any concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind. I appreciate it. I’ll just wait for the call. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Trefren. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
