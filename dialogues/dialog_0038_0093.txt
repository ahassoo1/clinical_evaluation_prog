DOCTOR: Alright, Chanz, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Doctor Auelua, right? Look, it’s… well, it’s been a bit of a rough patch, honestly. My sleep’s just not what it used to be, and I feel… sluggish, I guess you’d say. Not exactly in peak condition. I’m hoping you can sort it out. I don’t really do fitness, if that helps. More of a… sit and tune things kinda guy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, Doctor Auelua. And thanks for coming in, Chanz. It sounds like you're dealing with some fatigue and sleep issues. That's certainly something we can look into. When you say "not what it used to be," can you tell me a little more about your sleep?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics… that’s always the hard part. It’s just… patchy. I wake up a lot, I think. And when I do sleep, it doesn't feel… restorative, you know? Like I haven’t actually been asleep. It’s been going on for… well, a while now. Months, definitely. Maybe longer? It all blurs together, honestly. My wife used to ask, but… nevermind. It's just… not good sleep. I don't know if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Chanz. It sounds incredibly frustrating. "Patchy" and not feeling rested even after sleep... that gives me a good starting point. So, months now... roughly how many months would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez… let me think. After… after everything, it started getting bad around… November, maybe? Yeah, November of… 2024, I think. So… eight months? Something like that. It’s hard to be precise. I wasn’t really keeping track of sleep patterns back then, too preoccupied with… other things. Look, I’m terrible with dates, alright? Just… around eight months. Probably. It definitely wasn't before November.
DOCTOR: No worries at all about the dates, Chanz. Around eight months is perfectly fine. We can work with that. Now, you mentioned "after everything." Would you mind sharing a little more about what was going on around November?
PATIENT: Ugh. Right. That. Well… my wife, Layla, she… she got sick. Very sick, very quickly. It was… a shock. She was gone by February. So… yeah. That was… everything. It's still… difficult. I’m still getting used to… everything being different. And honestly, I haven't really felt like myself since. I just… haven’t been sleeping. Probably doesn't help the situation, does it?
DOCTOR: Chanz, I am so incredibly sorry to hear about Layla. That is a devastating loss, and it’s completely understandable that you haven’t been feeling like yourself since. Grief can manifest in so many ways, and sleep disturbance is very common. It absolutely doesn't help the situation, and we need to address it. Beyond the sleep issues, have you noticed any other changes since Layla's passing?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… I suppose I’ve been… less motivated. I used to enjoy tinkering with instruments, restoring old things, but now… it just feels like effort. And my appetite's gone a bit. I don’t really feel hungry, you know? I eat because I know I should, not because I want to. And… well, I suppose I’m just… generally more irritable. Smaller things bother me now. And… I get tired easily. Even just getting out of a chair can be… a bit much. Does that make any sense? I'm probably just rambling.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Chanz. It sounds like you're experiencing a number of symptoms that are often associated with grief and, potentially, other things we should rule out. Reduced motivation, changes in appetite, irritability, and fatigue… all of those are important things to consider. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss since this started?
PATIENT: Weight loss… yeah, probably. I haven’t actually weighed myself, if that makes sense. I just… my clothes feel looser. And I haven’t had to replace anything recently, which I usually do around this time of year. It’s not dramatic, mind you. I’m a tall guy, naturally quite thin, so a few pounds… probably wouldn’t be noticeable to anyone else. But yeah, I’d say… some weight loss. Definitely not gaining any. I just don't have much of an appetite, to be honest. It's not like I'm wasting away or anything, but it's there.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. It's helpful to get a complete picture. Now, in terms of your medical history, have you been diagnosed with any other conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history… I’m terrible with all that. Let me think. Nothing major, I don’t think. I had… the usual childhood stuff, you know? Measles, chickenpox… nothing that required any long-term treatment. And I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was… ages ago. Otherwise, I’ve always been… reasonably healthy. I haven't really needed to go to the doctor much in my life, to be honest. Just the occasional check-up. Layla was always the one who kept track of all that stuff, and… well, now it's all a bit of a blur. I think I got my flu shots regularly, but beyond that... I'm drawing a blank.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Appendix removed as a teenager, childhood illnesses, and regular flu shots. No chronic conditions that you’re aware of. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father had… high blood pressure, I think? And my mother… she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. She was always complaining about the pain. Otherwise, nothing really stands out. My grandparents lived to a pretty good age, both of them. My father’s side was Syrian, my mother was… Scottish, I believe. They weren’t really the type to talk about their ailments, if that makes sense. A stoic bunch. They just… dealt with things. Not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Chanz. It's good to know about your parents’ history of high blood pressure and arthritis. It can give us some clues. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not a single one. I pride myself on not needing them. Always been a bit… skeptical of pills, to be honest. I prefer to let my body heal itself, if that makes sense. And… well, after Layla… I just haven’t really felt the need to go to the doctor, let alone take medication. Sorry. That probably sounds foolish. But truly, no medications at all.
DOCTOR: That doesn't sound foolish at all, Chanz. It's perfectly reasonable to prefer to avoid medication if possible. And given the recent loss, it's understandable that you haven't been seeking medical attention. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. Nothing major, thankfully. I get hay fever in the spring, a bit sniffly, a bit itchy, but nothing that requires antihistamines or anything like that. And… I think I had a bit of a reaction to penicillin when I was a kid, a rash, but I haven't taken it since. Otherwise, no. I can eat pretty much anything without any problems. And I haven't noticed any seasonal allergies, aside from the usual spring sniffles. Honestly, I’m quite lucky, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Hay fever and a mild reaction to penicillin as a child. Alright, Chanz, thank you for sharing all of that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, alright? I don't really have a high tolerance for… poking and prodding. No offense, of course. Just… not my favorite thing.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Chanz. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that can be common with stress, and we'll keep an eye on it. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your abdomen is normal. Everything else seems within normal limits. Now, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, loss of appetite, and irritability, likely exacerbated by the recent loss of your wife. We need to rule out some other possibilities, though. I'd like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels , and a complete blood count to rule out anemia or infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work… ugh. Fine. If you think it's necessary. I just… I’m not a fan of needles, to be honest. But if it helps figure things out… alright. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? And… tell me what it involves, exactly. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension, Chanz. It's perfectly normal to be nervous about needles. It will be a standard blood draw. A phlebotomist will use a small needle to collect a few vials of blood from your arm. It usually takes just a few minutes, and it shouldn't be painful – just a quick pinch. We'll be checking your thyroid levels, vitamin levels , and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying issues like anemia or infection. I’ll write you a lab requisition, and the phlebotomist will explain everything to you before they start. Do you know where the lab is located within the clinic?
PATIENT: The lab… I think I saw a sign for it down the hall, near the waiting room? Yeah, I think so. It’s just… I’m not the best with directions. Honestly, I’d probably get lost trying to find it myself. Is there anyone who can… show me? I don’t want to wander around aimlessly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I can walk you over there myself, if you’d like. It’s just down the hall as you said, and I’ll make sure you get checked in properly. It will only take a few minutes. Then, once the results are back, we can discuss them and develop a plan to get you feeling better. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Thank you. I appreciate you walking me over there. I really am terrible with directions. And… yeah, getting back to feeling… normal, would be nice. Very nice. Let’s go, then. Before I lose my nerve.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Chanz. It's what I'm here for. And don't worry, we'll take it one step at a time. Here we are. Just let them know Dr. Auelua sent you, and they'll take good care of you. Do you want me to stay while you check in, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Uh… I think I can manage checking in myself. It's just… a bit of paperwork, right? I'm alright with that. You've already been very helpful, getting me this far. I don’t want to take up any more of your time. Thanks again, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chanz. I'm glad I could help. Just let the receptionist know if you have any questions, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. I'll be back in my office if you need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
PATIENT:
