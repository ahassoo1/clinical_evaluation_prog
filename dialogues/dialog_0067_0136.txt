DOCTOR: Hello Lucia, good afternoon. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... I keep... burping. A lot. It's kinda embarrassing, but it's been happening for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent burping can be bothersome. A few days, you said. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It doesn't hurt, it just... happens. Especially after I eat. Not every time, but most times. Sometimes even when I drink water. I don't know why. I eat normal food, you know? Rice, beans, chicken... nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it’s not associated with pain, thankfully. And it seems to be triggered by eating and sometimes drinking, but not always. When you say “normal food,” about how much are you typically eating at a meal?
PATIENT: Um... a regular plate? Not too much, I don't think. Like, a good size portion, but I don't stuff myself. I try not to. Maybe... a cup of rice, a half cup of beans, and a piece of chicken about the size of my hand? Is that too much? I don't know how much is too much.
DOCTOR: That doesn’t sound excessive at all, Lucia. It’s good you’re mindful of portion sizes. And you mentioned it happens even with water sometimes. Is the water cold, or room temperature?
PATIENT: Usually cold. I like cold water. Sometimes room temperature if the cold water is all gone. But mostly cold. Does that make a difference? I never thought about it before.
DOCTOR: It can, actually. Cold liquids can sometimes cause more gas. Let’s talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the burping?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not really. No stomach pain, like I said. No... bloating, I guess. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I always feel a little tired. I work hard. Nothing else really. No heartburn, no... anything. Just the burps. It's just annoying, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no associated pain, bloating, or other major changes. Just the burping and some general fatigue. Have you experienced any recent changes in your diet besides the cold water?
PATIENT: No, not really. Same stuff as always. Rice, beans, chicken, some vegetables when I have them. I had a little bit of cake last week for my friend's birthday, but that was just one time. I don't eat a lot of sweets. Just... the normal. I haven't started any new foods or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel... what? Sorry, I don't... understand. Like, going to the bathroom? Is that what you mean? Everything is... normal there. Not different. If that's what you're asking. Sorry, I don't always understand the big words.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Lucia. I should be clearer. Yes, I meant your bowel movements – going to the bathroom. You said everything is normal there, which is good. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um... not really. I don't think so. I haven't been to the doctor in a long time, to be honest. I usually just try to rest when I'm sick and it goes away. No one ever told me I had anything. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. Just... healthy, I think. Mostly. I work hard, so I try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven’t had any surgeries. Everything is... original, you know? I've been lucky, I guess. No broken bones or anything like that either. Just a few little cuts and scrapes from work, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Um... my mama, she has a little bit of trouble with her stomach sometimes, but she's old. She gets heartburn a lot. And my brother, he has high blood pressure, I think. But other than that, everyone is okay. Nothing major that I know of. They live in Cuba, so I don't see them very often. It's hard to talk to them on the phone, you know? The connection is bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of stomach issues in your mother and high blood pressure in your brother. Do you currently take any medications, Lucia?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any medicines. Never have. I try to stay away from them if I can. I just try to rest when I'm sick and drink lots of water. I don't like taking pills if I don't have to. I believe in letting my body heal itself, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all kinds of food. I haven't ever had to go to the hospital for allergies. I'm pretty sure I'm not allergic to anything. I have a friend who is allergic to peanuts, but I'm not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Great. I’d like to listen to your abdomen and check your pulse and blood pressure, if that’s alright with you. It will just take a few minutes. Would you mind sitting up there for me?
PATIENT: Okay, that's fine. No problem. I hope it's not anything bad. I just want the burping to stop. It's embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Lucia. Let’s take a deep breath in… and exhale. Good. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. Just feels... like you're touching my stomach. Not bad, just... weird. Like when someone pokes you. But not painful. It's okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No tenderness to palpation. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. They sound… active. Your blood pressure is 120 over 80, and your pulse is 72, which are both normal. Everything sounds and feels normal so far. It sounds like you may be swallowing a bit of air when you eat or drink, especially if the water is cold. It’s a common thing.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Swallowing air? I never thought about that. Maybe that's it. I do drink pretty fast sometimes when I'm thirsty. Is there anything I can do about it? Like, eat slower? Would that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly! Eating and drinking slower can make a big difference. Also, try to avoid drinking through straws, as that can also cause you to swallow more air. We can also try to rule out other possibilities, but based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it's likely this is the issue. Would you like me to order some tests just to be sure?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. If it's just the air, I'd rather not have tests. That sounds... expensive. And scary. If eating slower and not using straws will help, I'd like to try that first. That sounds easy enough. I can try that for a week and see if it gets better?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable plan, Lucia. We'll start with those simple changes – slower eating and avoiding straws – and see if that helps reduce the burping. If it doesn’t improve after a week or so, or if you develop any other symptoms like pain, bloating, or difficulty swallowing, please come back and see me, and we can explore other options. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a lot better. I'll try the slower eating and no straws. And I'll come back if it doesn't get better. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lucia. I’m glad I could help. If you need anything in the meantime, don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. And remember, slow and steady!
PATIENT: Okay, I will. Thank you again. Have a good day too, Doctor. .
