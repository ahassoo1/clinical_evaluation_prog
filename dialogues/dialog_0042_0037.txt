DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s lovely to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Very nice to meet you too. I am here because… well, I have been having some trouble breathing. A little bit of wheezing, you see. It is not so good.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble breathing and some wheezing. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It happens… not all the time. Mostly when I walk fast. Or… when I climb the stairs. It is like… a whistle sound when I breathe out. Not very loud, but I can feel it. It started maybe two weeks ago. I don’t know what caused it.
DOCTOR: Two weeks ago, with activity… that’s helpful. When you say climbing the stairs, how many stairs are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh… not many! Just the stairs to my apartment. Maybe… ten stairs? It is a small building. Not a big problem usually, but now… the whistle sound comes. And I feel… tired after. A little bit scared, maybe. It is new, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Ten stairs is good to know, and it’s concerning that it’s new and making you feel tired. Have you noticed this happening at any other times, besides when walking or climbing stairs?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. When I am sitting, watching television, I am okay. When I sleep, I am okay. It is only when I… do something. Move a little faster. Maybe when I carry groceries. But not always. Sometimes groceries are fine. It is… strange. I do not understand.
DOCTOR: It is strange, and that’s why we're here to figure it out. So, it seems to be triggered by exertion, but not consistently. Have you had a cough at all with this, Margret?
PATIENT: A cough? Sometimes. A little bit. Not a big cough. More like… a tickle in my throat. I clear my throat. Like this. Not much phlegm, you see. Just… a tickle. Mostly when I lie down at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tickle in your throat, mostly at night and with exertion. Have you had a fever, chills, or any chest pain at all with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No chills. And no pain in my chest. Everything feels… normal, except for the breathing. And the tiredness. The tiredness is… annoying. I like to walk in the park, you see. But I am afraid to walk too far now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially wanting to continue your walks. That’s very reasonable. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had… high blood pressure, a long time ago. The doctor gave me some pills. I took them for many years. But he said I was good now, so I stopped taking them. Maybe… five years ago? And… I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands. It is not so bad. Just a little bit stiff in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, managed with medication, and some arthritis in your hands. That’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones, for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications now. Just… sometimes I take a little bit of something for my hands when they are very stiff. It is just a cream, you see. From the shop. Not a pill. And… sometimes I take something for sleep, if I cannot sleep. But not every night.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cream for your hands and something occasionally for sleep. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I eat everything. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I am a very simple person, you see. Not many problems.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had any problems with asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a hard question. My mother… she had some trouble breathing when she was very old. But I do not know what it was. The doctors did not say. She smoked, you see. Many cigarettes. My father… he was very healthy. No problems. I have a sister, but I have not seen her in many years. I do not know about her health.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had breathing problems later in life, and smoked, and your father was healthy. That’s helpful. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I am retired, you see. I used to work as a… a trainer. For athletes. Now I mostly stay home. I cook, I watch television, I walk in the park when the weather is good. I do not smoke. I drink a little bit of tea. And… I like to garden. I grow vegetables. It is a quiet life.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, a very active past and a relaxing present. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and out… again… deep breath… and out… Thank you. I'm hearing some… wheezing, as you mentioned, especially on exhale. It's not terribly loud, but it's definitely present. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit of a murmur. Not concerning at this moment, but something we should keep an eye on. No swelling in your legs. Your chest feels clear, no tenderness. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m hearing, it sounds like you may be experiencing some asthma, or a condition very similar to asthma. However, to be sure, I'd like to do a simple breathing test, called spirometry. It will measure how much air you can blow in and out, and if there is any obstruction in your airways. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Asthma? I… I have never been told I have asthma. Is it serious, Doctor? And… a breathing test? What does that involve? I do not like tests very much. I just want to be able to walk in the park again.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Margret. Asthma can be serious if it’s not managed, but it’s very treatable. Many people live full, active lives with asthma. The breathing test is very simple. You will just breathe normally into a tube for a few seconds, then take a deep breath and blow out as hard as you can. It doesn’t hurt at all. It just tells us how well your lungs are working. Before we do that, I want to rule out anything else. Given your age, and the fact that you used to have high blood pressure, I would also like to get an EKG - that is a simple tracing of your heart's electrical activity - and a chest x-ray, just to make sure everything looks clear. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: An EKG and… an x-ray? Oh, Doctor… That sounds… a lot. I just wanted someone to listen to my chest. I do not want so many tests. Are you sure they are necessary? What if… what if something is wrong? I just want to breathe easier, not worry about everything.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask questions, Margret, and I apologize if I'm overwhelming you. It’s not my intention to cause you stress. The reason I suggest these tests is to be thorough. Your history of high blood pressure means we want to rule out any heart-related causes for your breathing difficulties, and the x-ray helps us visualize your lungs to make sure there isn't anything else going on, like pneumonia or another infection. We can start with the breathing test, the spirometry, and see what that tells us. If the results are suggestive of asthma, we can discuss treatment options and see if they help. If those don't give us enough information, then we can consider the EKG and x-ray. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds better. Just the breathing test first. And… if it is asthma, what kind of treatment? Will I have to take pills? I do not like taking pills. I just want to be able to walk in the park again, Doctor. Please. That is all.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Margret. Walking in the park is a wonderful goal, and we will work towards that. The most common treatment for asthma is an inhaler. It delivers medication directly to your lungs, which minimizes side effects. Some inhalers are used as needed when you feel short of breath, and others are used daily to prevent symptoms. There are pills available, but we would only consider those if the inhaler isn’t effective. Let's start with the breathing test. It will take just a few minutes. I will explain everything step-by-step, and I'll be right here with you the whole time. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. Please be gentle, Doctor. And… explain everything. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Margret. I will be right here with you, guiding you every step of the way. First, I'm going to have you sit upright and take a normal breath. Then, I'll ask you to blow out as hard and as fast as you can for as long as you can. Don't worry about getting it perfect – just try your best. I'll tell you when to start and stop. I’ll give you a mouthpiece to hold in your mouth, and I’ll ask you to make a tight seal around it with your lips. There’s a clip on your nose to help you breathe through your mouth. Are you ready to try?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. But… what if I cannot blow hard enough? What if I feel dizzy? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Margret. You won’t be forced to blow harder than you’re comfortable with. This isn’t a contest! We just want to see what you can do naturally. And if you start to feel dizzy at any point, just stop immediately, and we’ll take a break. I will be right here watching you, and I can stop the test at any time. Just relax, take a nice, deep breath, and blow out like you’re blowing out a candle. Okay, ready?
PATIENT: Alright… I will try. Please… be gentle. And… tell me when to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, perfect seal. Take a deep breath in… and blow… blow as hard as you can, steadily… and keep blowing… good… good… keep going… and… stop. Excellent! You did wonderfully. Now, let’s do it two more times to make sure we get consistent results. Take a moment to rest, and then we’ll repeat the process. You're doing great.
PATIENT: Two more times? Oh dear. Alright… I will try. But… can I have a little water first? My mouth is dry.
DOCTOR: Of course, absolutely. Here you go. Take your time, and let me know when you’re ready. There's no rush at all.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is better. Alright… I think I am ready to try again. But… please tell me what you are looking for. What are you hoping to see?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Margret. I’m looking to see how much air you can blow out of your lungs, and how fast you can blow it out. In people with asthma, the airways can become narrowed, which makes it harder to get air out. The spirometry test measures this narrowing, if it’s present. Essentially, we’re looking to see if there’s an obstruction in your airways. It's a simple way to get a lot of information. Okay, let’s start again. Deep breath in… and blow… good… steady… and keep blowing… and… stop. Excellent! One more to go.
PATIENT: Alright… here I go. And… stop. That is the last one, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is the last one! You did a fantastic job, Margret. Really, you did. Okay, let’s see… The results are… interesting. Your lung volume is normal, which is good. However, the airflow is slightly reduced, indicating some obstruction in your smaller airways. This is consistent with early-stage asthma, or a condition called COPD – Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. COPD is more common in people who have smoked, but it can occur in non-smokers as well. Given your history, and these results, I recommend a chest x-ray to get a better look at your lungs. It’s a quick and painless procedure, and it will help us rule out other possible causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: COPD? But I have never smoked! And… an x-ray? Oh dear. What does this mean, Doctor? Am I very sick? And… what if the x-ray shows something bad? I just wanted to be able to walk in the park again. I do not understand all of this.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’re worried, Margret. Let me reassure you, COPD can occur in non-smokers, though it’s less common. It’s often caused by long-term exposure to irritants in the air. And having a slightly reduced airflow doesn't automatically mean you have COPD. It simply means there's some narrowing in your airways, which could be due to a number of things. The x-ray is just a precaution, to get a clearer picture of your lungs and rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms, like pneumonia or a tumor. It’s a very quick and painless procedure – you simply stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. And no, you are not very sick. Your symptoms are mild, and we’re catching this early, which is excellent. With proper treatment, we can manage this and help you get back to doing the things you enjoy, like walking in the park. Before we proceed with the x-ray, I want to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: If I get the x-ray… will I have to wait a long time for the results? And… what if they find something bad? Will I have to have… surgery? Or… something worse? And what kind of treatment are you talking about? Will it make me feel tired? I do not want to feel worse than I already do. I just want to understand everything, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Those are all very reasonable questions, Margret, and I'm happy to answer them. The x-ray results usually come back within a few hours, and I will personally review them and discuss them with you as soon as they're available. If the x-ray does show something unusual, we will discuss all of your options, and I will explain everything in detail. Surgery is very rarely necessary for early-stage lung conditions. As for treatment, the most common approach is an inhaler, like I mentioned earlier. It delivers medication directly to your lungs, which opens up your airways and makes it easier to breathe. Some people experience mild side effects, like a slightly dry mouth or a fast heartbeat, but these are usually temporary and can be managed. We would start with a low dose and monitor your response carefully. The goal is to find a treatment that works for you with minimal side effects. I understand that you're worried about feeling worse, and I want to assure you that we will work together to find a treatment that helps you feel better, not worse. Before we proceed with the x-ray, I'd like to answer any other questions you have. Is there anything else you're concerned about?
PATIENT: Okay… an inhaler. That sounds… better than surgery. But will it help me walk in the park again? That is all I really want. And… can I have a second opinion? If I am not happy with the results, or the treatment… can I see another doctor? I just want to be sure I am making the right decision. I do not want to rush into anything, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Margret. Absolutely, the goal is to get you back to walking in the park, and an inhaler is often very effective in achieving that. It helps open up your airways, making it easier to breathe and reducing shortness of breath, which would allow you to enjoy your walks again. We will monitor your response closely, and if it's not effective, we can explore other options. And absolutely, you have every right to a second opinion. I fully support that. If you're not comfortable with the results, or the treatment plan, you are welcome to see another doctor. I will be happy to provide you with all of your medical records and any other information you need. I want you to feel confident and comfortable with your care, and I will never pressure you into making a decision you're not comfortable with. Before we proceed with the x-ray, or if you prefer, we can postpone it for now, let’s discuss the possibility of starting a trial with an inhaler to see if that improves your symptoms. Would that be something you'd be interested in?
PATIENT: A trial with the inhaler… that sounds… less scary than the x-ray right now. If it helps me breathe easier… that would be good. But what if it doesn't work? Then what? Will I have to get the x-ray eventually? And… if I try the inhaler, how long will I have to wait to see if it's working? I do not want to wait months, only to find out it doesn't help.
DOCTOR: Those are very fair questions, Margret. If the inhaler doesn't work, we would then discuss the possibility of getting the x-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. It is not something that has to happen, but it would allow us to make a more informed decision. As for how long it takes to see if the inhaler is working, typically, you should start to notice some improvement within a week or two. We would schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from now to assess your response. If you're not feeling any better by then, we can explore other options. If you're comfortable with that plan, we can get you set up with an inhaler prescription today. We will also provide you with detailed instructions on how to use it properly, and we will answer any questions you have. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… good. A trial with the inhaler. And a follow-up appointment in two weeks. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very patient with me. I appreciate it. Let's start with the inhaler. I hope it helps me walk in the park again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. It’s my pleasure. And I understand your concerns completely. I'm hopeful that the inhaler will help you get back to enjoying your walks. Alright, I'm prescribing you a short-acting inhaler called albuterol. It’s a commonly used medication that helps open up your airways quickly. I’ll also give you a written instruction sheet on how to use it properly. Here you are. The instruction sheet has detailed information on how to use the inhaler, as well as potential side effects. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. We have scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, on August 16th at 10:00 AM. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. Thank you again for being so patient and understanding. I feel much better now. I will try the inhaler, and I will see you in two weeks. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please remember to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And I sincerely hope you start feeling better soon. Enjoy your day as well.
