DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Luftcht. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It's… about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you about it. It's been a little hard to process, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I understand that receiving such news can be… unsettling. To ensure I have a complete understanding of your situation, could you elaborate on which cancer you were informed about?
PATIENT: Um… they said it was in my lung. A spot. That's all I really know. I just… got a letter, and then the nurse called to make this appointment. I haven’t really had a chance to ask many questions yet. It’s all happened so fast.
DOCTOR: A “spot,” you say. And a letter… yes, often these initial communications are… lacking in detail. Do you recall who informed you of this finding?
PATIENT: It was the hospital, I think. I had some tests done a few weeks ago… a chest X-ray because I had a bad cough. The lady on the phone said the doctor wanted to talk about the results, and then I got the letter. I don't remember the doctor's name… he was very quick.
DOCTOR: A chest X-ray for a cough… hmm. And this cough – is it still present?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. It hasn't gone away completely. It’s worse in the mornings, usually. Sometimes I cough up… well, a little bit of… stuff. I haven’t noticed any blood, if that makes sense. It just… won't stop. It’s tiring, really.
DOCTOR: "Stuff," you say. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh… um. It’s… it’s clear, mostly. Thick. Like… mucus, I guess? And sometimes it's a little bit… yellow. Not always, but sometimes. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at describing things. I just know it's annoying. And it feels like something’s stuck in my chest.
DOCTOR: Right. Mucus, sometimes yellow. And a sensation of something being “stuck.” Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Well… I’ve been feeling more tired than usual. And I’ve lost some weight, I think. Not a lot, but my clothes feel a little looser. And sometimes I get… winded. Like, walking up the stairs is harder now. Does that make sense? I used to be able to run up the stairs, no problem.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, weight loss, and shortness of breath. These are… concerning symptoms. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And I haven't had night sweats. I sleep pretty normally, actually. A little restless sometimes, but not because I'm sweating. Just… thinking. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately. It’s just… all this is scary, Doctor. Really scary. I lost my husband last year, and now this.
DOCTOR: I see. A difficult time, indeed. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had pneumonia when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. And… I have high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. Other than that, I’ve always been pretty healthy. I try to eat right, I really do. Mostly. Is my husband’s medical history relevant? He… he had some heart problems.
DOCTOR: Potentially. Please elaborate on your husband's heart problems. What specifically was he treated for?
PATIENT: He had… arrhythmia. That’s what the doctor said. His heart would beat too fast sometimes, and too slow other times. He had a pacemaker put in a few years before he… passed. He was seeing a cardiologist regularly. I don’t know all the details, honestly. I mostly just drove him to the appointments. I can get you the name of his doctor, if that would help.
DOCTOR: That could be useful, yes. Do you have a list of your current medications?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here. This is for my blood pressure, and… this is just an allergy pill I take sometimes. And I have some vitamins. That’s all. Is this enough? I feel like I’m forgetting something…
DOCTOR: This is sufficient for now. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I get hay fever in the spring, but that's just sneezing. It’s not a serious allergy, I don’t think. I can eat anything, really. I'm not a picky eater. That’s one good thing, I guess. Everything just feels so… overwhelming right now, Doctor. I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You are not rambling, Ms. Luftcht. However, it is important that we gather all pertinent information. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit years before we got married. I always told him it was bad for his heart. I’ve never even tried a cigarette. I don’t drink much either. Maybe a glass of wine on special occasions, but that’s it. Mostly, I just… take care of things. And worry. A lot. Is that important, Doctor? Is worrying a symptom?
DOCTOR: Worrying is… common in situations like these, Ms. Luftcht. However, it does not contribute to a diagnosis. Now, what about your occupation?
PATIENT: I’m an occupational therapist. I help people with… well, with doing everyday things after they’ve been sick or injured. It’s a good job. I like helping people. I work at the clinic in town. Mostly with stroke patients and people who have had surgery. It keeps me busy, mostly. I've been feeling a little tired at work lately, though. It's been harder to focus. Is that… could that be from the cancer?
DOCTOR: Potentially. We will need to investigate further. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, and what we can do about it. I’m ready, I guess. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? I’m not good with pain. It makes me… anxious. I shouldn’t have said that, I’m sorry. I'm rambling again.
DOCTOR: It should not be overly uncomfortable, Ms. Luftcht. We will proceed at your pace. Now, if you would please, take a deep breath and exhale slowly. I will begin by listening to your lungs and heart. Please, place your arms at your sides. I do hear some… diminished breath sounds in the lower left lobe. And a slight… wheezing. It's subtle, but present. Now, I’m going to check your lymph nodes. Please, relax your neck muscles.
PATIENT: Okay. That… that’s a little sensitive. On this side. I don't know if that’s normal. I get a lot of knots in my neck from working, so maybe it’s just that. I try to keep my shoulders down but feel them creep back up towards my ears. I swallow hard. This is… a lot. Is something wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I do detect some… slight enlargement of the lymph nodes on your left side. They are… firm, but not particularly hard. Now, I will percuss your chest to assess the underlying lung tissue. There is a… slight dullness to percussion in the lower left lobe. The rest of your lung sounds are… relatively normal. Your heart rhythm is… regular, but slightly fast. Based on this preliminary examination, your symptoms and the findings… are concerning. However, we need further investigation to determine the cause. I would like to order a chest X-ray—a more detailed one than the previous one—and a CT scan of your chest and abdomen. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is necessary. A CT scan and another X-ray… okay. Will those scans tell us what’s going on? Will they show if it’s… cancer? I’m… I’m scared, Doctor. Is it bad? I need to know. I have to know. I’ve been trying to be strong, but… I don’t know if I can handle much more uncertainty. I just want to know what I’m facing, even if it’s… bad news. And… can you explain the scans to me? I don’t want to be sent to a bunch of specialists and not understand what anyone is saying.
DOCTOR: The scans will provide us with more detailed images of your lungs and surrounding structures, which will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. They may reveal the presence of a malignancy, but further testing—a biopsy—would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis. As for specialists, I will explain the results to you directly, and if a referral is necessary, I will ensure you have a clear understanding of the findings before you meet with anyone else. However, it is important to understand that I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without the results of these tests. I will order the chest X-ray and CT scan immediately. The radiology department will contact you to schedule the appointments. I also want to order some blood work to assess your overall health and rule out any other potential causes. In the meantime, I want you to try to remain calm. I understand your anxiety, but unnecessary worry will not be beneficial. Once we have the results of these tests, we will develop a plan of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. As good as it can be, I guess. Scans and blood work… then a plan. I can do that. I’ll try to stay calm. It’s just… hard. And… what if it is cancer? What happens then? I… I don’t even know what questions to ask. Will I… will I lose my hair? Will I be sick all the time? I’m sorry, I’m just… a mess right now. It’s all happening so fast.
DOCTOR: If the tests do reveal the presence of a malignancy, we will discuss treatment options in detail. These may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or a combination of these approaches. The specific treatment plan will depend on the type of cancer, its stage, and your overall health. The potential side effects of these treatments vary depending on the individual and the specific therapy used. Some patients experience nausea, fatigue, and hair loss, while others experience minimal side effects. We will discuss these potential side effects in detail before initiating any treatment, and we will take steps to manage them effectively. It is important to remember that cancer treatment has advanced significantly in recent years, and many patients achieve excellent outcomes. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results of the tests and develop a plan of action. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… not right now. I think… I think I just need to process everything. Scans, blood work, follow-up appointment… treatment options… it’s a lot. I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. Even though it’s… scary. I guess… I’ll see you next week then. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Luftcht. I will see you next week. .
