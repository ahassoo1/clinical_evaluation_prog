DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer, good morning. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor… Burlingham, is it? Yes, good morning. Well, it’s… a bit silly, really. I just… I was hoping you could write me a little card.
DOCTOR: A card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a get well card. Or… something encouraging. My daughter, she thinks I should come to the doctor for… for a little boost. She worries too much. But a nice card from a doctor… that would show her I’m alright. You know, respectable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I am a physician. My role is to assess your health and provide medical care, not to… fabricate reassurance. Are you experiencing any actual symptoms that prompted you to come in today?
PATIENT: Now, hold on a minute. Fabricate? I didn’t say anything about… making things up. I feel… fine. Just a little low, that’s all. My daughter, she’s always been dramatic. A card from a professional… it’s just a little something to quiet her down, you see? It’s not like I’m asking for a prescription for… happiness.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your daughter is concerned, but a doctor’s note stating you are “feeling alright” is… not standard medical practice. It doesn’t provide any useful information about your health. Now, are you experiencing any fatigue, changes in appetite, difficulty sleeping, or any other physical complaints?
PATIENT: Physical… complaints? Look, I’m a stationary engineer. I work with boilers! I don't go around complaining. I feel… normal. Maybe a little tired, working those long shifts, but who isn’t tired? It’s just… she makes such a fuss. A little card would solve everything. You write notes all the time, don’t you? It’s not a big ask.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I document medical findings, not subjective feelings to appease family members. While I appreciate you stating you work long shifts, that doesn’t negate the need to rule out any underlying medical causes for fatigue. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Honestly, Doctor, I haven't been stepping on a scale. I eat… well, I eat. Maybe not as much as I used to, things don’t taste the same, you know? But I’m not wasting away! I’m a solid man. Look at me. A card. That's all I'm asking for. It's a simple request. Are you refusing a paying customer?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, your weight is relevant. A loss of appetite coupled with fatigue warrants further investigation. We need to determine why things don’t taste the same. It could be a simple vitamin deficiency, or something more serious. I am not refusing to see you, but I will conduct a proper assessment. Let's start with a basic review of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor, haven’t keeled over from anything yet. Dust bothers me a bit, working around the boilers… but everyone gets a little sniffly. Look, I appreciate you trying to be thorough, but honestly, I just want a card. I'm a grown man, I know my own body.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, "knowing your own body" doesn’t preclude the possibility of an underlying medical condition. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? Just… a little something for my knees sometimes. They ache after a long shift. It’s an old injury, from the navy. Nothing serious. The kind you get at the pharmacy, you know? Not a prescription. Just… cream. And maybe an ibuprofen now and then. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, while ibuprofen is readily available, it can mask symptoms of underlying inflammation. And relying on it regularly is not ideal. Now, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Let me think… the doctor in the navy said something about my blood pressure once. It was a little high, but they told me to lay off the salt. That was years ago, though. I’ve been fine ever since. Mostly. Look, this is getting ridiculous. Are you going to write the card or not? I have work to get back to.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration, but dismissing potential health concerns is not in your best interest. "A little high" blood pressure, even years ago, warrants further investigation. Have you had it checked recently?
PATIENT: Recently? No. Like I said, it was years ago. I feel fine now! Look, my daughter is going to be furious if I stay here all day. And frankly, I’m wasting my time. A simple card. That’s all I asked for. You’re making this very difficult. I think… I think I’ll just go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I am a physician, and I have a professional obligation to assess your health. I cannot, in good conscience, simply write a note stating you are “feeling alright” when you have a history of hypertension and are minimizing potential symptoms. However, I will perform a brief physical exam to address your concerns. It will be quick, and if everything checks out, we can discuss your daughter's reassurance. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A brief exam… Alright. Fine. But don’t go poking and prodding too much. And then the card? You promise? This is all for my daughter, you know. She’s a good girl, just… worries too much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your weight and blood pressure. Please step on the scale over there, and then I’ll take your vitals. Afterwards, we'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your knees.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: 64 kilograms. And your height, if you don’t mind?
PATIENT: One eighty-seven. Centimeters, of course. I used to be bigger, you know. The navy… good food back then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Please sit comfortably and relax your arm. I’m going to take your blood pressure now.
PATIENT: Just hurry it up, Doctor. I got things to do. And don’t make it too tight, alright? My arm gets sore easily.
DOCTOR: 150 over 90. That’s a bit elevated, Mr. Kammer. Now, if you could just lie down on the examination table, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Elevated? See? This is what I mean. Just a little stress. My daughter… always fussing. But I’m fine. Perfectly fine. Hurry it up, Doctor. My back isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds: slightly irregular rhythm. Lungs: mild wheezing bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you bend them for me?
PATIENT: There we go. See? Just a little ache. Old injury. The navy. Rough work. Don't poke too hard. And then… the card? You promised.
DOCTOR: Mild swelling and tenderness in both knees, range of motion slightly limited. Mr. Kammer, based on this brief examination, your blood pressure is elevated, your heart rhythm is slightly irregular, and you have some wheezing in your lungs. Your knees also show signs of inflammation. While you may feel “fine,” these findings warrant further investigation. I recommend a full blood workup, an EKG, and possibly a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Blood work? X-rays? Are you serious? I just wanted a card! This is ridiculous. I’m not sick! I told you, my daughter… she worries too much. This is all her fault! I'm leaving. I’m not doing any of that. No blood work, no X-rays, no poking and prodding! Just write the card and let me go!
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration, but I have a professional obligation to ensure your health and safety. I cannot, in good conscience, simply dismiss these findings. Ignoring them could lead to serious complications. I am not trying to upset you, but I need to investigate these concerns further. Look, I will write a note stating that you came in for a check-up and I found some minor irregularities that require further investigation. I can also note that you are feeling generally well. But I will not fabricate a statement saying you are perfectly healthy when that is not supported by my findings. And I strongly recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment for those tests. Is that something you would be willing to consider?
PATIENT: …Fine. Just… write something. Write that I came in. And that… that you checked me. Don’t say anything about being sick. And don’t make it too long. Just something my daughter won’t fuss over. And then… can I have the card? Please? I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here you are. And here's the card. I still recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment, Mr. Kammer. But for now, I hope this is sufficient for your daughter. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: …Hmmph. It’ll have to do. Fine. No. No more questions. Thank you, Doctor. I think I’ll just go home now. And try to stay away from my daughter.
DOCTOR: .
