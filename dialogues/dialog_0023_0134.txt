DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s been my stomach, mostly. Seems like it hasn’t been right for a little while now. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don’t even get very hungry, you know? I eat just a little bit and feel full right away. It’s… bothersome. I can’t really say when it started, exactly. Just gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: "Gradually" can be difficult to pinpoint. Can you describe the nausea for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, it is. It’s not… violent, if that makes sense. Not like food poisoning. It's more of a queasy feeling, most of the time. Like… seasickness, maybe? Though I haven’t been on a boat in years. It just comes and goes, and it doesn't always mean I will actually get sick, just… feel like I might. It's worse in the mornings, I think. And it doesn’t seem to matter what I eat. Though, now that I think about it, rich foods… maybe they bother it more. But honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: So, a queasy feeling, worse in the mornings, and possibly aggravated by richer foods. You mentioned not being very hungry and feeling full quickly. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this – any heartburn, bloating, changes in your bowel movements, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… heartburn, not really. Though sometimes my chest feels a little… tight? Not painful, just uncomfortable. Bloating… yes, a little. I do feel a bit puffed up sometimes, especially after I eat. And… now that you mention it, I think I have lost a little weight. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven't weighed myself in… oh, I don't know how long. Months, certainly. I mostly just try to eat what I can when I can, you know? It’s hard to keep track of things.
DOCTOR: "When you can"… is this a recent change in your appetite, Ms. Kelder, or has it been fluctuating for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely gotten worse recently. I used to have a pretty good appetite, always enjoyed my food. But, goodness, that was… well, it feels like a long time ago. It’s been… maybe the last few months that it’s really started bothering me. I don't know exactly. I've just been… not feeling up to eating much. And then I get tired easily. I used to be able to do so much around the house, but now… well, it’s different. I just haven’t told anyone much about it, you know? Didn't want to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, Ms. Kelder, have you experienced any vomiting, blood in your stool, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Oh, no vomiting, thankfully. And no blood in… well, no, I haven’t noticed anything like that. And swallowing… no trouble with that either. I can eat and drink normally, it's just… not very much of either. I'm sorry, I'm probably not being very helpful. Everything feels so… blurry.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Kelder. You are being helpful. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. And… I was diagnosed with… something a while back. Cancer, I think it was. It’s been a long time, and I had treatments. A long time ago. They said… well, they said it was under control. But honestly, the details are… a bit hazy. It was all so stressful. I mostly see Dr. Miller for check-ups, but he’s retired now, I think. I haven't really kept track of who I’m supposed to see anymore.
DOCTOR: A history of cancer is… significant, Ms. Kelder. Do you recall what type of cancer it was, or where it was located?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a long time ago. I think it was… in my stomach? Or nearby? It was something to do with my digestive system, I'm pretty sure. They did a lot of tests, and I had chemotherapy. It was a long time ago, though. They said it was… early stages. And that they got it all. But like I said, my memory… it's just not what it used to be. I really wish I could remember more details for you. I apologize. It feels like a lifetime ago, and I was so scared, I don't think I really listened to everything they said.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. I'm going to need to access your medical records to get a clearer picture of your past treatment. Do you have any objections to me doing so?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no objections at all. Please do. I just… I wish I could remember everything myself. If that helps you figure out what’s going on, then please, look at whatever you need to. It’s just… everything feels so confusing now. I just want to feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me see… Ah, here we are. It appears you were diagnosed with Stage I gastric adenocarcinoma in 2012. You underwent a partial gastrectomy and received adjuvant chemotherapy. The records indicate you’ve been in remission since then, with regular surveillance endoscopies… though it appears the last one was in 2021. Now, given your history and current symptoms – nausea, early satiety, weight loss – we need to investigate whether there's a recurrence of the cancer, or another cause for your discomfort. We'll start with some blood work to check your overall health and tumor markers. Then, I'd like to schedule an upper endoscopy to visualize your stomach and esophagus. It’s important we rule out anything serious, Ms. Kelder. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. 2012… that was a long time ago. And an endoscopy… that doesn't sound very pleasant. But… yes, I understand. If that's what you think is best, then yes, please. I just… I don't want to go through all that again. But if it’s necessary, then I trust your judgment, Doctor. I do. What exactly will the blood work tell us? And… what does an endoscopy involve? I'm a little scared, to be honest. I just hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us a baseline assessment of your overall health – your red and white blood cell counts, liver and kidney function, and some specific tumor markers that can sometimes be elevated in cases of cancer recurrence. It's not a definitive test, but it can give us a starting point. As for the endoscopy, it involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum – the first part of your small intestine. It allows us to directly visualize the lining of these organs, and take biopsies – small tissue samples – for further analysis. It’s usually well-tolerated, but you'll be given sedation to keep you comfortable. It’s a standard procedure, Ms. Kelder, and we take every precaution to ensure your safety. We'll discuss the risks and benefits in more detail before proceeding, but I want to assure you we're doing this to get to the bottom of what's going on. Do you have any allergies to medications, particularly sedatives?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… a little scary, but I understand. Sedatives… let me think. No, I don't think so. I've had sedatives before, during the… the treatments. I don’t recall any allergic reactions. But I’m a little worried about the biopsy part. Will that hurt? And how long will I be… out of it? I have to arrange for someone to drive me home, you know. And I don’t want to be too sick afterwards. I just get so nervous with these things. It brings back… bad memories.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be nervous, Ms. Kelder. The biopsy itself is usually quick and doesn't cause significant pain – you might feel a slight pressure or discomfort. We’ll use a local anesthetic to numb the area beforehand. As for the sedation, we’ll use a mild sedative, and you’ll likely feel drowsy and relaxed for the rest of the day. We require someone to drive you home, and we advise against making any important decisions for 24 hours afterwards. We'll monitor you closely throughout the procedure, and we’ll have someone available to answer any questions or concerns you may have. I’m going to order the blood work now, and I'll have my nurse schedule the endoscopy for you. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. It’s just… it’s a lot to take in. And I do appreciate you being so patient with me. I’m just… worried. That’s all. When should I expect to hear about the blood work results? And… what if it is the cancer again?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It is a lot to take in, and your concerns are perfectly valid. The blood work results should be available within 24-48 hours. My nurse will contact you directly to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If the cancer has recurred, we'll discuss all available treatment options with you. We’ll consider your overall health, the stage of the cancer, and your preferences before making any decisions. It’s important to remember that treatment options have advanced significantly since your initial diagnosis, and there are many possibilities we can explore. However, let’s not jump to conclusions before we have the results. We need to remain optimistic, Ms. Kelder, and focus on getting to the bottom of this. My nurse will be in shortly to take some more information and schedule your appointments. In the meantime, please try to rest and take care of yourself. Do you have any immediate concerns I can address before I leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll just… wait for the nurse. .
DOCTOR: Very well.
