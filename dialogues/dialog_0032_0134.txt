DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well… it’s been a bit of a bother, this feeling. Mostly, I just don't feel like eating much anymore, and when I do try, I get full awful quick. It's just… not right, you know? I feel sick to my stomach a lot too, even when I haven't eaten anything. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, a while now. I can’t rightly say how long. A few weeks, maybe? It all feels like one long stretch these days.
DOCTOR: I see. Loss of appetite and early satiety, accompanied by nausea… and you estimate this has been occurring for a few weeks. To clarify, Ms. Kelder, when you say “early satiety”, does that mean you feel full after just a few bites of food?
PATIENT: Yes, that's exactly it! Just a few bites. It's like… my stomach is telling me to stop even before I’ve really started. It's frustrating, because I want to eat, but it just doesn’t feel good. It’s not like a pain, exactly… more of a… fullness, and then that sick feeling comes on. And it doesn't matter what I eat, really. Soup, crackers, even just a little bit of fruit… it all feels the same. It's all a bit muddled in my head, if you don't mind. I'm getting older, you know. Things don’t stick like they used to.
DOCTOR: Understood. So, it’s been a few weeks of early satiety – feeling full with minimal intake – accompanied by nausea, and it’s not consistently related to specific foods. You mentioned this is happening regardless of what you consume. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss during this time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weight loss… I hadn’t really thought about it. I suppose… I haven’t been weighing myself. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? But then again, I've always been a small woman. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps telling me I need to eat more, but like I said, it just doesn't stay down. It’s hard to keep track of these things. I used to weigh myself regularly, but… well, things slip your mind when you get to be my age, don’t they? I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Kelder. We can work with what you recall. So, no intentional weight loss, but you've noticed your clothing is a bit looser. Now, let's move on to other symptoms. Have you experienced any vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting… hmm. Not… exactly. More like… a queasy feeling, and then sometimes I’ll just… bring up a little bit of whatever I ate. Not a full-blown heave, if you know what I mean. Just a little bit. And it doesn't happen every time, just when it's really bad. It's hard to explain. It's just… uncomfortable, and makes me not want to eat anything for fear of it happening again. It’s a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Occasional regurgitation, triggered by meals, with a subsequent aversion to eating. Now, beyond the stomach issues, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Bowel habits… let me think. Now, that's a personal question, isn't it? Well, everything feels a little… sluggish, I suppose. Not as regular as it used to be. Everything's just... slower these days. I haven't had any trouble, if that makes sense. Just… less frequent. And, honestly, I haven’t been drinking as much water as I should be, probably. It’s hard to remember to drink when you don’t feel like eating. Does that help? I'm afraid I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Kelder. No need to apologize. Reduced appetite, early satiety, nausea, occasional regurgitation, and now infrequent bowel movements. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have you noticed any abdominal pain or bloating?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now that you mention it… not exactly pain, more like… a fullness. A heavy, uncomfortable feeling in my belly. And yes, bloating too! Especially after I try to eat something. It feels like… like I’m carrying a little extra weight, even though I haven't gained any. It goes away after a while, but it's very uncomfortable when it happens. It makes me feel… tired, and sort of weak. It's hard to describe. It's just… not a good feeling. I've been trying to take it easy, but it’s hard when you feel so… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss of appetite, early satiety, nausea, occasional regurgitation, infrequent bowel movements, and abdominal fullness and bloating. Now, let's briefly review your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, where to start? Well, I had my gallbladder out many years ago. And the doctor told me I had high blood pressure, but they put me on a little pill to fix that. It's been… a long time. I also had some arthritis, mostly in my hands, but it doesn't bother me too much anymore. Oh, and… I had cancer a few years back. Breast cancer. They did the surgery, and the radiation, and… well, I've been in remission for a while now. It’s why I’m with Medicare, I suppose. Does that help? I'm sorry if I'm forgetting something important. It all gets a bit mixed up in my head.
DOCTOR: I see. History of cholecystectomy, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and a history of breast cancer in remission. That’s important information. Are you currently taking any medications, aside from the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. Just the little pink pill for my blood pressure. And sometimes I take something for the arthritis when it flares up, but that's not very often. Usually just when the weather is bad. And… oh, sometimes I take a little something for sleep. Just to help me rest. But that's it, I think. Nothing else. I try not to take too many pills. My daughter worries about them, bless her heart. She's always telling me to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with allergies. I eat pretty much everything, though I don’t have much appetite for anything these days, as we’ve discussed. No, no allergies. I used to help my grandmother with her garden, and we grew all sorts of things. Never had a reaction to any of it. Except maybe pollen, sometimes makes my nose itch, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just a little sniffle.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and check for any obvious signs of distress. Please lie back on the examination table. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild distention… and there's a very slight tenderness in the epigastric region. No guarding or rebound tenderness. I don’t feel any masses.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That’s… it does feel a little tender there, doesn't it? Right in the middle. And yes, I suppose it is a little puffy. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a heavy feeling. And yes, I do feel a little bloated, as we've talked about. Is that what you're feeling? It's hard to tell sometimes, you know. Everything feels a little… off these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I would like to order some basic blood work. A complete blood count to assess your overall health, a comprehensive metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out any thyroid issues. Additionally, given your history of breast cancer, I would like to order a CA-15-3 tumor marker test as a precaution. I also recommend an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out any potential issues such as ulcers or inflammation. It is the most thorough way to determine the cause.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… like a lot. Blood work, I can handle, I suppose. But an… endoscopy? What exactly is that? And a tumor marker… is that because you think the cancer… I'm getting a little scared now, Doctor. I just wanted to find out why I don’t feel like eating, not… not all of this. Is it really necessary? I’m an old woman, and I don't want to go through a lot of tests if it’s not absolutely needed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Kelder. It is a lot, and I apologize if I’ve overwhelmed you. Let me explain. The blood work is fairly standard, and will give us a baseline of your overall health. The endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and look for any abnormalities. It allows us to directly see what’s causing your symptoms. As for the tumor marker, it's a precautionary measure, given your history of breast cancer. It doesn't necessarily mean we suspect the cancer has returned, but it's a good idea to check. We need to determine the cause of your symptoms – loss of appetite, early satiety, nausea, bloating, and abdominal discomfort. While it could be something simple, we need to rule out more serious possibilities. I would not recommend these tests if I didn’t believe they were necessary to get to the bottom of this. I understand you’re an older woman, and we will proceed with the least invasive tests first. We can start with the blood work, and then discuss the endoscopy further. You are not obligated to proceed with any test you are uncomfortable with, but I strongly recommend considering it to ensure we get an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Does that help clarify things?
PATIENT: Well… that does make a little more sense, I suppose. A precautionary measure… that’s better than thinking the worst. And starting with the blood work sounds alright. I can handle that. But the endoscopy… I don't know. I'm afraid of things like that, you know? I’ve always been a bit squeamish. Is it painful? Will I be awake? Will it take a long time? I just don't want to go through anything horrible. I’m an old woman, and I’ve had enough of unpleasantness in my life. Perhaps we could wait and see what the blood work says first? Maybe it’s something simple after all.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Kelder, and I completely respect your concerns. The endoscopy is typically not painful, though you may feel some mild discomfort. We would administer a sedative to keep you comfortable and relaxed throughout the procedure, so you likely won't remember much of it. It usually takes about 15-30 minutes. You are right to suggest we start with the blood work. That will give us a better understanding of your overall health and may provide some clues as to the cause of your symptoms. We can then discuss the endoscopy further, based on the results. If the blood work reveals something concerning, it may become more important to proceed with the endoscopy to get a definitive diagnosis. If the blood work is normal, we can explore other options. I will write an order for the blood work now. The lab is located just down the hall, and the nurse will be happy to assist you. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Blood work first. And then we’ll see. A week sounds good. I suppose I can handle that. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly, and you’ve been very patient with my questions. It’s… reassuring to know you’re taking everything seriously. I’m still worried, but… a little less so now. I'll go to the lab and get the blood work done.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. Please don't hesitate to let me or the nursing staff know if you have any questions or concerns along the way. We'll get to the bottom of this together. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you. In the meantime, I'll have the blood work order sent to the lab. Have a good day, Ms. Kelder, and please try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I'll see you in a week. .
