DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, that's all. Medicare sent me over, said I needed to do this to keep things updated. I think it’s mostly just address and stuff, but I figured I’d do it here to be sure.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Medicare forms. Yes, we handle those quite often. Address changes, that's very common. Don't you worry, we'll get everything sorted out. Just to be thorough – and to make sure I have a complete picture – would you mind if I asked you a few quick questions?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely, Doctor. No problem at all. Ask away. I don’t mind a bit.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let's start with a little bit of background. I see here your date of birth is… correct me if I’m wrong, but it's listed as [date of birth redacted for privacy]?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. [date of birth redacted for privacy]. That’s me. Everything okay so far? I sometimes forget things, so if I miss something just let me know.
DOCTOR: Perfect. And your race is listed as Blackfeet Tribe, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I'm Blackfeet. My family has been on the reservation for generations. It’s important to me to keep that connection strong. Is that something you need for the form?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. Medicare asks for that information for statistical and demographic purposes. It helps them understand the needs of different communities and ensure equitable access to healthcare. It’s good to know. Now, I see your height is listed as 171 centimeters, and your weight as 70 kilograms. Is that about right?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. 171… that sounds about right, I guess. I haven’t been measured in a while. And 70 kilograms… that feels… okay, yeah, that sounds about right too. I’ve been pretty steady lately. I try to stay active, you know? Hiking and stuff.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about staying active! It's wonderful you enjoy hiking. Just to be certain, would you mind if I quickly measured your height and weight just to update our records?
PATIENT: Oh, no problem at all, Doctor. That’s a good idea. I wouldn’t want to give you the wrong information. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, just stand normally…perfect. And now for your height… okay, 173 centimeters. And your weight is 72 kilograms. So, just a little bit different than what we had on file. No cause for concern, just good to have accurate information. Now, are you currently experiencing any health problems or have you been feeling unwell lately?
PATIENT: Oh, wow, 173 and 72… interesting. Maybe I have gained a little bit. To answer your question, no, not really. I’ve been feeling pretty good, all things considered. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just life, you know? Nothing I’m worried about. My knees bother me a bit after a long hike, but I just rest them. I think it’s just old age catching up to me!
DOCTOR: I understand. A little fatigue and occasional knee soreness with activity… that’s not uncommon. It's good you’re resting them when needed. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… no major surgeries, no. I had pneumonia when I was a kid, a really bad case, but I recovered fully. And I broke my arm once falling out of a tree, but that was a long time ago. Other than that, nothing serious. Just the usual colds and flu, you know? Nothing that needed a hospital visit.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia as a child, and a broken arm… good to know. And no recent hospitalizations, that's reassuring. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My mom always said I was a pretty hardy kid. She tried to get me to take allergy medicine once, but I spit it out right away. She gave up after that! I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, so I guess I’m not allergic to anything. I can eat whatever I want, which is probably why I’ve gained a little weight!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! No known allergies is always good to hear. And enjoying a good appetite is certainly something to be thankful for. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. I believe in letting my body heal itself, you know? I take some Vitamin D in the winter, just because we don’t get much sun up here, but that’s it. No prescriptions, no over-the-counter stuff, just a little Vitamin D when it’s dark outside. Does that count as a medication?
DOCTOR: Vitamin D definitely counts! It's good you're proactive about your health. We just need to document everything. Now, just a few questions about your family history… Are there any major health problems that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… My grandpa on my mom’s side had heart trouble, I think. He passed away when I was pretty young. And my aunt had diabetes, but she wasn’t very healthy overall, so it’s hard to say if that was genetics or lifestyle. My mom was pretty healthy, thankfully. She lived a long life. Other than that, I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. We didn’t really talk about it much growing up. It wasn’t something we focused on.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s common for family medical history to be unknown or incomplete. Knowing about heart trouble on your grandfather’s side is helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, huh? Well, I’m married, been with my husband for fifteen years. We live on the reservation, mostly. I work as a control and valve installer and repairer - it keeps me busy! I enjoy hiking, like I said, and spending time with my family. We try to stay involved in the community. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while. I try to eat healthy, but I have a sweet tooth! I love to bake. Overall, I’d say I have a pretty good life, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Ms. Fabing. A good, active life with a strong community… that's wonderful. Now, just to finalize the paperwork, let's double-check your address and insurance information. Is your current address still [address redacted for privacy]?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s still correct. [address redacted for privacy]. And my insurance is still Medicare, everything should be up to date. I haven’t had any changes there, thankfully. Is that everything? I’m glad we got all that sorted out.
DOCTOR: Yes, that seems to be everything, Ms. Fabing. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. I’ve updated your records with all the information we discussed. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time. You were very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I guess I’ll just head out then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fabing. It was a pleasure meeting you. If you experience any changes in your health or have any concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to schedule an appointment. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your hiking!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too!
