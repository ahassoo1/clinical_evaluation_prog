DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’m Liza, by the way. Liza Sugino. I’ve been thinking a lot about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I’ve heard it can be helpful, and I’d like to learn more about it, if that’s something you can help with. I work on the railway, fixing signals and switches, and it can be… stressful sometimes. Not dangerous, usually, but definitely keeps you on your toes.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Liza. It's good to know a little about your background. So, you're interested in exploring mindfulness or meditation as a way to manage stress related to your work. That’s excellent. We can certainly discuss that. To get a better understanding of how it might be helpful for you specifically, could you describe what that stress feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… what does it feel like… Well, it’s not a constant thing, thankfully. But when things are really busy – lots of repairs needed, tight deadlines – it’s like… a buzzing in my head, almost. Like too many thoughts at once. And I get tense, you know? Shoulders tight, jaw clenched. I don’t sleep as well those nights, either. It’s not terrible, I manage, but I thought maybe learning to calm things down a bit would be… helpful. I guess preventative, more than anything.
DOCTOR: That's a very helpful description, Liza. The "buzzing in your head" and the physical tension – shoulders and jaw – those are common responses to stress. And wanting to be proactive about it is a very wise approach. It sounds like you’re experiencing some symptoms of what we might call situational anxiety, brought on by the demands of your work. Before we delve into mindfulness techniques, I'd like to get a bit more information, just to rule out other possibilities. Have you experienced anything like this outside of work, or is it primarily related to your job?
PATIENT: That sounds about right, “situational anxiety.” It is mostly work related, I think. Honestly, when I’m not working – gardening, spending time with friends, reading – I feel pretty calm. I don't really get… panicky or anything, even when things are a bit difficult. It’s just… the constant responsibility at work. Knowing that something could go wrong if I miss something. It's a lot of little things adding up, I think. Not one big overwhelming fear, just… a lot to keep track of. And the noise, too. The railway isn’t exactly quiet! Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Liza. It sounds like a very reasonable response to a demanding environment. The constant responsibility and the noise level certainly contribute. It's helpful to know it’s primarily work-related and doesn't extend significantly into other areas of your life. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Well, I’m generally quite healthy, I think. I have Medicare, so I see my doctor regularly for check-ups. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was all straightforward. No major illnesses or anything. I do wear glasses, as you can see! And I had a bit of a bad back a few years ago, but physiotherapy helped with that. Nothing else… Oh! I do have slightly high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. A small dose, just to keep things stable. I can give you the name of the medication if you need it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Liza. That's good to know. It's excellent that you see your doctor regularly and that your blood pressure is well-managed. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and the back issues is helpful as well. And yes, please do tell me the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure. Just for my records. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. Just the Lisinopril for my blood pressure. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but not very often. And I used to take a Vitamin D supplement in the winter, because I don’t get much sun, but I haven’t been taking it lately. I started gardening more, and I think that helps with the Vitamin D naturally. I try to eat a healthy diet, too. Lots of vegetables. Nothing else… no herbal remedies or anything like that. I’m a pretty straightforward patient, I hope!
DOCTOR: You absolutely are, Liza. And that’s wonderful! It’s very helpful to have a clear picture of your medications and lifestyle. It sounds like you are taking good care of yourself. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother was allergic to penicillin, but I don't seem to have inherited that. No food allergies, no pollen allergies, nothing. I can eat pretty much anything. Oh, wait… I get a little itchy sometimes if I’m stung by a bee, but that's just a local reaction. Not a full-blown allergic reaction, just a bit of discomfort. Nothing I need to carry an EpiPen for!
DOCTOR: Excellent. No significant allergies, just a local reaction to bee stings. That's good to know. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… My mother had high blood pressure, like me, and she also had diabetes later in life. My father was healthy for most of his life, but he had a heart attack when he was in his seventies. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. He doesn’t talk about his health much. And my grandmother on my mother’s side had arthritis, but that’s about it. Nothing else particularly… dramatic. We’re a fairly long-lived family, generally. So, that's probably all the important stuff.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Liza. That gives me a very good overview of your medical history, family history, and current health status. It sounds like you're generally quite healthy, and you're proactive about taking care of yourself, which is excellent. Now, let’s talk about your stress and explore whether mindfulness or meditation might be helpful. Before we get into specific techniques, would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds perfectly sensible. Please do. I'm happy to have a quick check-up. It’s always good to be sure. I don’t mind at all. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. That’s a little elevated, but not dramatically so. It's good to keep an eye on it, especially with your history. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good there. So, physically, everything seems to be in good shape. Now, let's talk about how we can address the stress you’re feeling at work. Do you have any experience with mindfulness or meditation techniques already?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I’ve read a few articles about it, and I’ve seen things on television, but I’ve never actually tried anything. It always seemed a bit… esoteric, I suppose. A bit too new-agey for me. But I’m willing to try, if you think it might help. I’m just not sure where to start. I imagine it’s not as simple as just… sitting quietly. I’ve got a very busy mind, as you probably gathered! I need a bit of direction, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Liza. It can seem a bit daunting, and it's common to feel unsure where to start. And you’re right, it’s not just about sitting quietly. There are many different techniques, and not all of them are the same. And you’re right to say your mind is busy – that’s perfectly normal! We can start with a very simple technique called mindful breathing. It involves focusing your attention on the sensation of your breath—the rise and fall of your chest or abdomen, the feeling of the air entering and leaving your nostrils. The goal isn't to stop your thoughts—that’s nearly impossible—but to simply notice them without getting carried away by them. Would you be willing to try a short guided breathing exercise with me now?
PATIENT: Yes, I would. That sounds… manageable. Focusing on my breath… I can probably do that. It’s better than trying to empty my mind completely. A guided exercise would be very helpful, thank you. I’m ready when you are. Perhaps if you tell me what to do, and I can let you know if it’s… working or not? I’m not sure what I’m supposed to feel exactly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s exactly right. It’s not about feeling a certain way; it’s about the practice of bringing your attention back to the breath when your mind wanders. And please, let me know how it feels—or doesn’t feel. We can adjust as needed. Okay. Let’s get comfortable. You can sit with your feet flat on the floor, or if that’s uncomfortable, you can sit in a chair with good back support. Gently close your eyes if that feels comfortable, or simply lower your gaze. Now, take a few deep breaths, noticing the sensation of the air entering your lungs and then slowly exhaling. And then, without trying to change your breathing in any way, simply observe it. Notice the rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. Notice the feeling of the air entering and leaving your nostrils. And if your mind wanders—which it likely will—simply acknowledge the thought without judgment and gently redirect your attention back to your breath. Think of it like gently guiding a puppy back to your side. Now, just continue breathing normally, observing the sensation of each breath. Don't try to control it, just observe it. Let’s do this for another 30 seconds. What do you notice?
PATIENT: Well… it’s harder than I thought. My mind is really racing. I keep thinking about the signal repairs I need to do tomorrow. And Mrs. Petrova’s cat. I promised to check on her cat while she’s on vacation. It’s just… a lot of little things. And I’m aware of my back now. It’s a bit achy. But I can feel my chest rising and falling, yes. It feels… okay. Normal. I’m not sure if I’m doing it right. It feels a bit silly, honestly. But I am breathing. A bit faster, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Liza. What you’re experiencing is exactly what most people experience when they first try mindfulness. Your mind will wander. It’s not about stopping the thoughts—it’s about noticing them without getting carried away. And noticing your back and your faster breathing—that’s great awareness! The fact that you noticed all those things means you’re doing it right. You're not failing if your mind wanders; you're succeeding in noticing when it wanders. And bringing your attention back to your breath, even for a moment, is a success. It takes practice. Think of it like any other skill—you don’t get good at it overnight. Let’s try just a few more breaths, and this time, instead of trying to stop the thoughts, simply label them as “thinking.” If you notice you’re thinking about the signal repairs, just silently say to yourself, “thinking.” If you notice you’re thinking about Mrs. Petrova’s cat, say, “thinking.” And then gently bring your attention back to your breath. How does that feel?
PATIENT: That… actually helps a bit. Labeling it as “thinking” feels… less overwhelming. Like I’m not failing at being quiet. It’s still racing, but it’s a bit more… distant, maybe? I can still feel my back, but it’s not as prominent. And my breathing is… a little slower, I think. I'm not sure. It's hard to tell. But it feels less… frantic. I think. Is it supposed to feel calm? Because it doesn’t feel calm. It just feels… less chaotic. I can feel my cat purring, even though she's not here. That’s a thought, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Liza! “Less chaotic” is a perfect description, and that's a very positive sign. It's not about feeling calm; it’s about creating a little bit of space between you and your thoughts. And noticing your cat purring—that’s wonderful awareness! You're practicing being present, even with a wandering mind. You’re doing remarkably well, especially for your first attempt. We can continue to practice this technique regularly – even just for five minutes a day. There are many guided meditation apps available that can help you with this as well. I can recommend a few if you’re interested. For now, let's talk about some other strategies that can help you manage stress at work. Would you be open to discussing some simple relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be good. Relaxation techniques sound helpful. Progressive muscle relaxation… that sounds… involved. But I’m willing to try. And yes, some recommendations for apps would be great. I’ve got a smartphone, so I can probably download something. Five minutes a day seems manageable. I think I can fit that in. As long as Mrs. Petrova’s cat doesn’t get into too much trouble!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Progressive muscle relaxation is simpler than it sounds. It involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in your body, which can help to reduce physical tension. We can go through a quick exercise now, if you'd like. It doesn't take long, and it can be very effective. As for apps, I recommend "Headspace" and "Calm". They both offer guided meditations for beginners, and they have a variety of different techniques to choose from. They do have subscriptions, but there’s usually a free trial period. Before we start the exercise, do you have any physical limitations or injuries that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. My back gets a bit achy sometimes, as I mentioned, but nothing serious. I can move all my limbs okay. No arthritis or anything like that. I did pull a muscle in my shoulder a few years ago, but that’s healed now. I think I can manage most things. Just… be gentle with the shoulder, maybe? And don’t ask me to do any heavy lifting!
DOCTOR: Perfect. We’ll definitely take it easy with the shoulder. And no heavy lifting required! Okay. Let’s start with your hands. Make a tight fist with both hands, squeezing them as tightly as you can. Really feel the tension in your hands and forearms. Hold it for about five seconds… and now, slowly release, letting your hands go limp. Notice the difference in sensation. Feel the relaxation spreading through your hands and forearms. Good. Now, let’s move on to your arms. Bend your elbows and tense your biceps, flexing your arms as tightly as you can. Hold it for about five seconds… and now, slowly release, letting your arms go limp. Again, notice the difference in sensation. Feel the relaxation spreading through your biceps. We’ll continue this process with different muscle groups in your body. Does this feel comfortable so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… surprisingly pleasant. It feels good to actually focus on the tension, and then release it. My hands feel warmer now, I think. And my arms do feel a bit more relaxed. It’s a bit strange, focusing on your muscles like this, but not unpleasant. It’s a bit like stretching, but more… intentional. I can manage this, I think. Let’s continue. Perhaps we can do the shoulders next? Gently, of course!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Gently is exactly right. Okay. Let’s move on to your shoulders. Bring your shoulders up towards your ears, tensing them as much as you can. Really feel the tension in your upper back and neck. Hold it for about five seconds… and now, slowly release, letting your shoulders drop. Notice the difference in sensation. Feel the relaxation spreading through your upper back and neck. How does that feel?
PATIENT: That… feels good, actually. My shoulders are always a bit tense, I think. Especially after a long day on the railway. It’s a nice release. I can feel the tension melting away. My neck feels a bit looser too. It’s still a bit achy, but not as bad as before. It’s a bit like a little massage. Yes, I like this. Let’s continue, please. Perhaps the face next? I’m always frowning, my mother says.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your mother sounds like a wise woman. It’s common to hold tension in your face, especially if you tend to frown. Okay. Let's move on to your face. Now, this might feel a bit strange, but try to scrunch up your face as tightly as you can. Tighten your forehead, squint your eyes, clench your jaw, and press your lips together. Really feel the tension in all your facial muscles. Hold it for about five seconds… and now, slowly release, letting your face go limp. Feel the relaxation spreading through your forehead, eyes, jaw, and lips. How does that feel?
PATIENT: That is strange! It feels a bit silly, scrunching up my face like that. But… surprisingly relaxing. My jaw does feel a bit looser. I do clench it a lot, I think. And my forehead feels smoother. It's like a little facial… workout. Yes, I like this too! It's a bit like giving yourself a mini-massage. Let's continue. What's next? My legs? I've been on my feet all day, so they could probably use some attention.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your legs definitely sound like they deserve some attention after a long day on your feet. Okay. Let's move on to your legs. Tighten your thigh muscles, as if you're trying to lift your legs off the table. Really feel the tension in your thighs. Hold it for about five seconds… and now, slowly release, letting your legs go limp. Feel the relaxation spreading through your thighs. How does that feel?
PATIENT: That feels… good. Very good. My thighs are always a bit tight, especially after walking along the tracks. It’s nice to actually focus on the tension, and then release it. They feel… warmer now, I think. And a bit looser. Yes, this is definitely helping. What’s next? My calves? They’re always aching.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll get to your calves next. Okay. Point your toes as if you’re trying to reach the ceiling, tightening your calf muscles. Really feel the tension in your calves. Hold it for about five seconds… and now, slowly release, letting your feet go limp. Feel the relaxation spreading through your calves. How does that feel?
PATIENT: That feels… wonderful. Very wonderful. My calves are always aching, especially after a long shift. It's nice to actually focus on the tension and release it. They feel… warmer now, I think. And a bit looser. Yes, this is definitely helping. I feel… more relaxed. It's strange, but I think I can feel the tension melting away. Are we finished now?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are finished with the progressive muscle relaxation exercise. How do you feel overall?
PATIENT: I feel… very relaxed. Surprisingly relaxed. I didn't think scrunching up my face and tightening my legs would make me feel better, but it did. I feel… calmer. And more aware of my body. I think I can definitely do this again. It's a bit like a little self-care ritual. Thank you. That was very helpful. What do we do now?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. I’m glad you found it helpful. It's excellent that you feel calmer and more aware of your body. That's exactly what we're aiming for. Now, let’s talk about a plan moving forward. I recommend practicing the progressive muscle relaxation exercise at least a few times a week, or whenever you feel stressed. Even just five minutes a day can make a big difference. And we talked about the guided meditation apps – “Headspace” and “Calm” – those can be a great supplement. I also want to emphasize the importance of self-compassion. Be kind to yourself, especially when you're feeling stressed. And remember, it’s okay to ask for help if you need it. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor Kalinski. I feel much more equipped to deal with the stress at work now. I think I’ll download those apps tonight and try to make the relaxation exercise a regular habit. And I’ll try to be kinder to myself. That’s a good reminder. Thank you again. I think I’m good to go.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, I’m here if you need anything in the future. Please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment if you have any concerns. I’ll have my nurse give you a handout with information about relaxation techniques and the guided meditation apps. And a work note excusing you from any strenuous activity today, just to give you a chance to rest and recover. Have a wonderful day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor Kalinski. That’s very kind of you. I appreciate that. You too. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. Have a wonderful day. .
