DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Lovely to meet you. Though, honestly, I don’t know why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Said I needed to… get things checked. Something about my feet. Honestly, they feel alright. A little tired, maybe, but what feet aren’t tired after all these years? I’ve been a podiatrist for… well, a long time. Longer than you’ve been alive, I suspect.
DOCTOR: I see. Your daughter brought you in because of your feet, even though you don’t feel anything specifically wrong?
PATIENT: That’s right. She worries too much, that girl. Always has. Says I don’t take care of myself. Can you believe it? I’m a foot doctor! I know more about feet than… well, than anyone. She just keeps going on about some newfangled tests and scans. Honestly, I don't need any tests. I make the tests, I don't take them. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when family members worry and suggest things you feel aren’t necessary. Still, even doctors benefit from a second opinion, or a routine check-up. It’s good to be thorough. Perhaps we can just start with a quick examination of your feet, and then we can talk about whether any further testing is needed?
PATIENT: Hmph. A routine check-up. As if. Look, dear, I appreciate your… politeness. But I’ve been examining feet since before you were born. I’ve seen it all. Bunions, hammertoes, ingrown nails… you name it. I assure you, my feet are perfectly… adequate. I don’t need you poking and prodding. What exactly are you hoping to find? I've lived a long life, and I'm not afraid of a few aches and pains. It’s just… bothersome, that's all.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Wynell. You've had a remarkable career, and I respect your expertise. However, sometimes even the most experienced among us can miss something on ourselves. A simple exam can give us a baseline, and rule out anything unexpected. It's not about questioning your self-assessment, but ensuring complete well-being. Would you be willing to humor me, just for a few moments?
PATIENT: Humor you? Honestly. It’s just… I don't like people fussing over me. I've always been the one doing the fussing, the one examining, the one in charge. It’s a bit… undignified, to be poked and prodded like some… patient. But… alright. Fine. A quick look. But don't expect to find anything. And don't take too long. I have a luncheon to get to, you know. With the ladies. We're discussing… well, it's not important. Just get it over with, quickly.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just a quick examination. We’ll be as efficient as possible. If you could just sit back for me… excellent. Now, I’m just going to take a look at each foot, check the skin, and feel for any tenderness. Can you tell me if anything feels painful or uncomfortable as I do this?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Don't go digging around too much. My skin is probably a bit dry, I haven’t had time to moisturize properly lately. Busy life, you know? And there might be a little… callous here or there. I walk a lot, even now. Used to walk everywhere, actually. Before… well, before things got difficult. Just be gentle, dear. Very gentle. And hurry up, please. The ladies will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Alright. Skin is dry as you mentioned, with some mild calluses on the heels and the balls of your feet – very common with walking, as you said. I do notice some slight discoloration on your left big toe… it’s a bit pale, and feels slightly cool to the touch. Is this new, or has it always been like this?
PATIENT: Pale? Cool? Oh, now don't go alarming me. Let me see… Hmm. You’re right, it does look a bit… off. I hadn’t noticed, to be honest. I haven't really looked at my feet in ages. Always too busy looking at other people’s feet, you see. But… no, it’s not always been like that. I think… I think it started a few months ago, maybe? After… after I tripped on that rug at the market. A silly little thing, really. Didn't even fall, just stumbled. But perhaps… perhaps that’s when it happened. What does it mean? Is it serious? Don't tell me it's something awful.
DOCTOR: It’s good you noticed the change. And it’s helpful to know about the trip. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, Wynell, but the discoloration and coolness could indicate a few things. It could be a minor injury that hasn’t fully healed, or it could be something related to circulation. To get a better understanding, I’d like to check your pulses in your feet and legs. And I think it would be wise to get a quick Doppler ultrasound to assess the blood flow to your toe. It's a painless test, just uses sound waves. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A Doppler… ultrasound? Sound waves? Honestly, dear, you're speaking a foreign language. All this… technology. When I started practicing, all we had was a good light and a trained eye. No fancy machines. I don’t like the sound of it. What will it show? And if there's something wrong with the circulation… what does that mean? Am I going to lose my toe? I need my feet, you know! I still enjoy walking, even if it's just to the market. What if I can't walk anymore? Oh dear, oh dear. This is dreadful. Just dreadful. I should have stayed home. My daughter is going to hear about this. She always insists on these things, and look what it's led to!
DOCTOR: Wynell, please try not to worry. It’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious when you don’t know what’s going on. The Doppler ultrasound is a very simple test, it doesn't involve any needles or pain. It just allows us to see how well the blood is flowing to your toe. And it’s important to remember, we haven’t even confirmed anything yet. It’s possible it’s nothing serious at all. But it’s better to be safe and get a clear picture, so we can make the best decision for your health. If it is related to circulation, there are many treatments available, from medication to lifestyle changes. And it’s very unlikely you would lose your toe without trying all other options first. Would you like me to explain the ultrasound procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Explain it… yes, please. But speak slowly, dear. My head is spinning. And don't use all those… medical words. Just tell me, in plain English, what it involves. And what it will show. Is it going to be uncomfortable? Will it take long? I have that luncheon, you know. With the ladies. We were discussing… oh, it doesn't matter. Just tell me, in simple terms, what this… Doppler thing is all about. And please, dear, try to reassure me. My heart is racing something awful. I really didn’t want to come here. My daughter… she means well, but… this is just too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. The Doppler ultrasound is completely painless. It’s like using a microphone, but instead of picking up sound, it picks up the flow of blood in your vessels. I’ll just apply a little gel to your toe, and then gently move a small handheld device over the skin. It sends sound waves that bounce off the blood cells, and those waves are converted into a picture on a screen. It doesn't involve any needles, electricity, or anything like that. It doesn't heat up or cause any discomfort. It takes about 15-20 minutes, maybe a little longer. And the technician will explain everything as they go. It will show us how well the blood is flowing to your toe. If the flow is good, that’s a good sign. If it’s reduced, we can investigate further to find out why. I understand you’re anxious, and I want to reassure you that we’re taking this step to get a clear picture, not to scare you. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No needles… that’s good. And just gel, like for a baby? That’s… alright. Fifteen minutes, you say? Well, I suppose I can spare fifteen minutes. But what if it is bad? What if the flow is reduced? What does that mean, exactly? Will I need… surgery? I don’t want surgery, dear. I’m too old for surgery. And what about the luncheon? The ladies will be furious if I’m late. They’ve been planning this for weeks. Oh dear, oh dear. This is just dreadful. Perhaps… perhaps I should just go home. I don’t think I can do this. My daughter… she always gets me into these situations. She means well, but… this is just too much for an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: Wynell, please try to stay calm. We haven't even done the test yet, and we're already talking about surgery. That's jumping way ahead. If the flow is reduced, it doesn't automatically mean you need surgery. There are many other things we can try first. Medication, lifestyle changes, even just careful monitoring. We'll discuss all the options if that's the case. And I understand your concern about the luncheon. If the test takes longer than expected, we can certainly reschedule it. Your health is the most important thing right now, not the ladies. Let's just focus on getting the test done, okay?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Just the test. No promises about the luncheon. And no talk of surgery. Promise me, dear. No surgery. Not yet. I'm too old for all that. And… and what about the results? How long will it take to get them? Will I have to come back here? I really don't like this place. It smells… clinical. And those chairs are terribly uncomfortable. But… alright. Just the test. Get it over with. But promise me, dear. No surgery.
DOCTOR: I promise, Wynell. No talk of surgery at this point. We'll take things one step at a time. We’ll do the ultrasound, and then we’ll discuss the results together. The technician will review the images right away, and we should have a preliminary idea of what’s going on within an hour. I’ll explain everything to you, and we’ll decide what to do next. And if you’d like, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss things further, but it's not a requirement. And I apologize about the chairs and the smell. It's not the most comfortable environment, I agree. Now, let’s get you comfortable. The technician, Mark, will be in shortly to start the ultrasound. He's very gentle and will explain everything as he goes. Just relax, and try not to worry. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Mark, you say? Is he… experienced? I don't want some young whippersnapper poking around my feet. And gentle… that's good. Very important. And no sudden movements, please. My bones are… delicate. And what about the gel? Is it cold? I don't like cold things on my feet. And… and will it stain my stockings? They're silk, you know. Very expensive silk. Alright… I suppose I'm ready. But promise me, dear. If it gets too uncomfortable, I want to stop. Immediately. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Mark is very experienced; he's been doing ultrasounds for over ten years, and he’s known for his gentle touch. He's quite meticulous, and he always explains everything he's doing beforehand. The gel is room temperature, not cold. And it's water-soluble, so it won’t stain your stockings. It washes off easily. And yes, absolutely. If you feel any discomfort at all, you can stop immediately. We'll respect your wishes. Your comfort is our top priority. Here comes Mark now. He’ll introduce himself and explain the procedure in detail. Just relax, and remember, you’re in control.
PATIENT: Alright… let’s get this over with. But be gentle, please. Very gentle.
