DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I'm Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s about my bruising, really. Seems to be getting worse, despite being on… you know, the blood thinner. It’s just… concerning. I don’t usually bother doctors with little things, but this is… noticeable. It's been happening for a few weeks now, I'd say.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. And you said it’s despite being on a blood thinner?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. You’d think it would prevent this, wouldn’t you? I mean, that’s what they told me when they put me on it. It's just… illogical. I’ve been very careful, too. I avoid anything sharp, try not to bump into things… but it still happens. A little knock, and bam, a bruise the size of my hand. It's getting old, frankly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And which blood thinner are you currently taking, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… the name… it’s a little orange pill. Warfarin, is it? Yes, Warfarin. That’s the one. I've been on it for… oh, must be close to five years now, maybe more. I honestly can’t recall exactly. My wife used to manage all the medications, you see.
DOCTOR: Five years, okay. And are you consistent with taking it?
PATIENT: Consistent? Well, as consistent as one can be. I set an alarm, you know. Every evening. But sometimes… sometimes I forget. It happens. I’m not a young man anymore. But I always take it eventually. Within a few hours, usually. It’s not like I skip it entirely for days on end. I wouldn’t do that. It just… slips my mind sometimes. It's a busy life, even for someone my age.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had any recent falls or injuries that you can recall, even minor ones, that might explain the bruising?
PATIENT: No, nothing like a fall. I wouldn’t say that. Just… the little bumps. You know, walking into a doorframe, stubbing my toe… things like that. Nothing significant enough to cause this much bruising, certainly. I’m not exactly clumsy, you know. I'm a pathologist, we have steady hands. This is… different. It’s worrying me because it wasn’t like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… other symptoms… no, not really. No bleeding gums, no nosebleeds… nothing like that. I feel… tired, perhaps. But that’s just age, I suppose. And maybe a little achy, but again, I'm not getting any younger. It’s hard to say what’s normal at my age and what isn’t, honestly. Nothing specifically linked to the bruising, if that makes sense. It’s just… the bruises are the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better look at things. Could you roll up your sleeves and pant legs, please?
PATIENT: Really? Is that necessary? I mean, I just told you about the bruising. It's all over. I suppose… if you insist. There. Happy? It's quite obvious, isn’t it? And rather unsightly, I might add.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is quite noticeable. Bruising on both arms and legs, varying in shades of purple and blue. Some appear more recent, others older. No obvious swelling or warmth. Capillary refill is normal. Alright, Mr. Farson. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a PT/INR test to check your blood clotting levels.
PATIENT: Tests, of course. Always tests. I swear, doctors these days just want to run tests for everything. Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. When will I get the results? And will this involve… needles? I dislike needles intensely. I'd prefer to know beforehand.
DOCTOR: The tests will involve a blood draw, yes. I apologize for that. It’s standard procedure to check your clotting levels when you're on Warfarin and experiencing unexplained bruising. As for the results, the lab usually takes about 24-48 hours to get them back to us. We’ll give you a call as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause injury. And if you notice any signs of significant bleeding – nosebleeds that won't stop, blood in your urine or stool, or excessive bleeding from a cut – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Emergency room. Got it. Though I highly doubt I’ll be needing the emergency room over a few bruises. It's… rather alarmist, don’t you think? Fine. I'll try to be careful. Though, honestly, a little bump is all it takes these days. 24 to 48 hours, you said? And you’ll call me? Not a voicemail? I’ve had… unpleasant experiences with automated systems.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Farson, we will call you directly. Not a voicemail. I understand your concerns. We'll have the nurse make a note on your chart to ensure a personal call. In the meantime, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long. I have things to do, you know. And please, please make sure someone actually calls me. It’s a simple request, really. I suppose I’ll be going then. Thank you… I guess. Tests, always tests…
