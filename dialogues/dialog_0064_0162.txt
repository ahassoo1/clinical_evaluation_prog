DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get this over with. It's my stomach. Been… puffy, I guess. Bloated. It’s uncomfortable, alright? Honestly, I don't know why I'm even here. My wife usually handled this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no problem at all. We'll get to the bottom of things as quickly as we can. “Puffy and bloated,” uncomfortable… Okay. And how long has this been going on, this discomfort?
PATIENT: Ugh, how long? Honestly? Not sure. Weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. I eat something, then it swells up. Then it… doesn't. It's hard to say. Look, I work long hours, I don't pay attention to this stuff. Pile driving isn’t exactly a job for someone who’s worried about their… insides. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, it absolutely makes sense. Pile driving certainly sounds demanding. "Weeks, comes and goes, related to eating..." Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're eating when this happens?
PATIENT: What am I eating? Everything, usually. I'm a grown man, I eat food. Steak, chicken, pasta... whatever's quickest. I don’t… fuss with salads and stuff. My wife used to make me eat vegetables, but… well. I guess it happens with most meals, honestly. Not like there's something specific I can point to. It’s just… food.
DOCTOR: Alright, “most meals, no specific trigger foods…” And is there any pain associated with this bloating?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, exactly. More like… pressure. Like a really full balloon. Discomfort, yeah. Especially after I eat. And sometimes… gas. Look, it's embarrassing to talk about, alright? It’s not like it’s a sharp pain, it just feels… wrong. And it makes me tired, honestly. I'm always tired these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright, no need to be embarrassed. These things happen. "Pressure, gas, fatigue…” Okay. And has this fatigue been recent, or has it been going on for a while as well?
PATIENT: A while. It’s been getting worse, I guess. I just figured it was the job. Long hours, hard work. But this bloating… it’s making everything worse. Look, I need to get back to work, if that’s alright. Is there anything you can do about this quickly? Some kind of pill, maybe? I don’t have time for tests and stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand you're short on time, Mr. Kristofik, and I want to help as efficiently as possible. While a quick fix with a pill is possible, it's important to understand what's causing this bloating and fatigue so we can address the root of the problem. Before we consider medication, I’d like to just ask a few more questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any issues with your stomach before – ulcers, heartburn, anything like that?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t remember. My wife took care of all that stuff. Doctors, appointments, pills… she did it all. I just… worked. I don’t think I’ve ever had anything serious with my stomach. Maybe some indigestion sometimes, but nothing a little antacid couldn't fix. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. Can’t you just give me something for the gas? Anything? I’ve got a job to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. It sounds like your wife was very thorough with your healthcare, and it's difficult when things change. Just to be sure, let's quickly review some basics. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies? No, not that I know of. Again, my wife kept track of all that. I took what she gave me, when she gave it to me. I don't go around testing things, alright? This is ridiculous. Are we getting anywhere, or are we just going in circles? I've got steel to drive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your limited recall of past medical history and your wife’s role in managing your healthcare, I think it’s best to be cautious. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any obvious issues. It won’t take long. After that, I’d like to order some basic blood work to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I really don’t have time for this, but I guess I don’t really have a choice, do I? Blood work... whatever. Just don't keep me here all day. Steel isn't going to drive itself.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Please lie down on the table. I’ll just listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It will only take a moment. Okay. Your abdomen is a little distended, as you mentioned, and I can hear some increased bowel sounds. No significant tenderness to the touch, which is good. It could be something simple like gas or a mild digestive issue, but given the fatigue and the bloating, I still want to rule out anything more serious with the blood work. It's just to be safe.
PATIENT: Safe. Right. Look, can I go now? Get the blood work ordered, give me a slip, and let me get back to work. I'm losing money just sitting here. This is a complete waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kristofik. I completely understand your concerns. Here's a slip for the blood work. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll need your insurance information, of course. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try to avoid foods that seem to worsen the bloating, and stay hydrated. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
