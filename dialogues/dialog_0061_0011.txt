DOCTOR: Bula and hello, Mr. Honcoop! It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well now, Doctor… Kimm, is it? Yes. Look, I ain't got all day, so let’s get this over with. I need… a paper. A paper sayin’ I’m alright to… do somethin’. For my face. That's all. Cosmetic… somethin’. My nephew said I needed clearance. He handles all this newfangled stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need a note for something cosmetic your nephew is helping you with. Let's get some information so I can make sure it's safe for you to proceed. Just to clarify, when you say “for your face”, what exactly are you planning to have done?
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute. You need to know what I’m doin’? Why does it matter? I just need the paper. He said somethin’ about… liftin’. Liftin’ the… you know. The face skin. It's droopin', alright? That's all you need to know. Don’t need a whole life story 'bout it. Is that enough for your paper, or are you gonna keep askin’ questions?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. It's not about needing a life story, it's about making sure any procedure is safe for you, given your health. Even something like a facial lift can have risks, and I need to be aware of your medical background to minimize those. To start, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I'm a perfectly healthy man. Been workin’ with towers my whole life! Climb those things like a monkey. What do you think, I got time to be sick? Now, I don't go to doctors, alright? Never have. So no, I ain't got no… diagnoses. And I doubt I need 'em. Just give me the paper. This is ridiculous. You makin’ me late.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you telling me that. Even if you haven’t been officially diagnosed with anything, have you ever had any problems with your heart, like chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Now you're just askin' things to ask things! I told you, I climb towers! You think you get to climb a tower with a bad heart? No. Look, maybe… once, a little bit of…flutterin'. But that was just from the height, alright? Nothin' serious. Happens to everybody. And it was a long time ago. Don't see what that's got to do with liftin' my face. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fluttering” is good to know. That sounds like it could be a heart palpitation, and it’s important we check it out. And you're right, it might not be directly related to the face lift, but it's my responsibility to ensure your safety. To be thorough, do you take any medications at all – even over-the-counter things like aspirin, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Good lord, no. I don't do medications. Never have, never will. Real men don't need pills. I eat right, work hard, that's all. Vitamins are for weaklings. Now are we almost done here? My nephew is expectin' this paper. He's a smart boy, but he don't understand the importance of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. That's helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… hmm. Let me think… Well, when I was a boy… maybe. But that was a long time ago. A broken arm, I think. Fallin' out of a tree. And... somethin' else, a long time ago. I don't rightly recall. It wasn't nothin' serious. Just a quick in and out. And no, no surgeries. Definitely no surgeries. Now, can we please finish this? I got things to do. This is holdin' me up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child and something else a long time ago – we don't need to worry about that right now. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any heart problems, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history? Now you're askin’ about other people? Look, I barely talked to my family. My parents are… gone. And I don’t keep up with my siblings. I wouldn't know if they got heart problems or… the sniffles, for all I know. This is ridiculous! I came here for a paper, not a family reunion questionnaire. Are you gonna give me the paper or not? I'm startin' to get annoyed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you don’t have much information about your family history. That’s alright. Now, just to be complete, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Never had a problem with… bees or poison ivy or nothin'. I'm a tough man, alright? Don't break out in hives over nothin’. I’m tellin’ ya, this is a waste of time. Just give me the paper so I can go. I got appointments! Important appointments!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for that. Alright, Mr. Honcoop, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. It will only take a few minutes. Then I can decide if I can safely give you this note. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But make it quick. And don't poke me too much. I don’t like bein’ poked. And don't tell me nothin' I don't need to know. I just want the paper, alright? The paper. That's all. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Honcoop… and exhale. Again… Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. And I do hear a slight murmur when I listen to your heart. It’s faint, but it’s there. Your pulse is a bit irregular as well. It’s not dramatically irregular, but it’s definitely not completely regular. Mr. Honcoop, given these findings, I'm not comfortable giving you this note right now. I recommend you see a cardiologist for a full evaluation. I want to make sure your heart is healthy enough for this procedure. We don't want to take any risks.
PATIENT: What?! Are you serious? A cardiologist? For a little face lift? This is ridiculous! I told you I was fine! I climb towers, for goodness sake! You're just tryin’ to get more money out of me! I don't need no fancy doctor tellin’ me what's wrong with me! I'm perfectly healthy! I'm gettin' my nephew to find another doctor. A real doctor! Waste of my time! A complete waste of time!
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but my priority is your health and safety. A slightly elevated blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat are things that need to be investigated. I am not trying to get more money out of you, but rather ensure you don’t have any underlying heart condition that could be aggravated by a procedure. Here is a referral to a cardiologist. Please, for your own well-being, schedule an appointment. I wish you the best, Mr. Honcoop, and I hope you will reconsider this recommendation. .
