DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I'm Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, things have been…painful, lately. It's mostly in my back, but it shoots down my leg sometimes. It’s been going on for a little while now, not getting any better.
DOCTOR: Okay, "painful"… and mostly in your back, with some shooting pain down your leg. And you said it's been going on for a little while, not improving. Could you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More like a dull ache, most of the time. But when it shoots down my leg, that feels sharp. It kinda feels like…pins and needles, too, sometimes, in my foot. It's worse when I stand for a long time, or if I try to bend over.
DOCTOR: A dull ache mostly, with sharp shooting pain and pins and needles in your foot…worse with standing and bending. And does anything help the pain, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Well, not really, to be honest. Sitting helps a little, but I can’t just sit all day, right? Sometimes a warm bath feels okay for a few minutes, but it doesn’t last. I’ve tried some over-the-counter pain relievers, but they don't do much either. I don’t know what to do anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand, it sounds frustrating when things aren’t providing relief. You've tried sitting, warm baths, and over-the-counter pain relievers with limited success. Have you noticed any weakness in your legs or feet, or any numbness besides the pins and needles?
PATIENT: Weakness…hmm. That's a good question. I don't think so, but maybe a little? I feel a little clumsy sometimes, especially when I'm tired. It’s hard to say for sure. And yes, the numbness is mostly in my foot, like I said. It's not constant, though. It comes and goes. I don't really know if that's the same thing as just being tired, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, it can be hard to pinpoint these things. You’ve mentioned some clumsiness and intermittent numbness in your foot. Now, have you had any recent injuries to your back, or done anything strenuous that might have triggered this pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing that I can think of, anyway. I haven't fallen or anything. I mostly just work at my computer all day, doing…well, it's complicated, but it's office work. I did help my son move some furniture a couple of months ago, but that wasn’t that heavy. It didn't hurt right away, though. It started gradually, you know? A little ache here and there, and then it got worse over time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no recent injury, and the pain started gradually after helping your son move furniture a couple of months ago. Before we go further, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I don't have a lot of problems, thankfully. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been controlled with medication for years now. And I had my appendix out when I was a kid. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy. No surgeries or anything serious. I don't really go to the doctor much, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, you have a history of high blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, and had your appendix removed as a child. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, just the one for my blood pressure. And sometimes I take something for allergies, but that’s only when the pollen count is really high. It's just over-the-counter stuff, though. Nothing prescribed by a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, so just the blood pressure medication and occasional over-the-counter allergy medication. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always makes sure I don't take anything new without checking, though. She’s the cautious one in the family. But no, I don't have any known allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I'd like to ask about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had back problems or similar issues?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, my mother had arthritis when she got older, and she complained about her back a lot. But that was when she was, oh, in her 80s, I think. My father was healthy as a horse, never had any problems. And my brother is fine, too. So, not really, not that I know of. It’s not something we really talked about much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had arthritis with back complaints later in life, but no other significant family history of back problems. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. We’ll just check your range of motion and do a few simple tests to see what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I’m not too worried about it, but I do hope you can figure out what's wrong. It's just annoying, you know? Getting old is not for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. If you wouldn't mind, please lie down on your back for me. I'll start by checking your reflexes. Okay, your reflexes seem normal. Now, could you bend forward and touch your toes, if you're able?
PATIENT: Okay. Oof, that’s a little difficult. It hurts a little in my lower back when I do that. Not terrible, but definitely noticeable. It's harder than it used to be, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion with some discomfort in your lower back. Now, could you lie on your side, and I’ll gently feel along your spine?
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead. Just tell me if anything feels too painful. It’s okay to let me know if something doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling along your spine now… there's some tenderness here, on your lower back, right around L4 and L5. Does that feel particularly painful?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes, that's it. That's where it hurts the most. Not a sharp pain, but definitely tender. Like a dull ache, almost. It's been bothering me for a while, like I said. So, that's it, huh? That’s the spot?
DOCTOR: Yes, that tenderness around L4 and L5 is significant. Now, I'm going to ask you to lift each of your legs, one at a time, while lying on your back. Just keep your leg straight. This will help me assess your nerve function.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Just let me know if it’s too much, alright? I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, and how does that feel?
PATIENT: It's okay… a little bit of a stretch, but not painful. I feel it in my hamstring, mostly. It's a little uncomfortable, but I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Alright… and what about that leg?
PATIENT: Oof… that one’s different. It’s not just a stretch. I feel that pain shooting down my leg again, the one with the pins and needles. It's not terrible, but definitely noticeable. It feels… worse than the other leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. That pain radiating down your left leg during the straight leg raise is concerning. Based on the physical exam, the tenderness around L4 and L5 and the pain radiating down your left leg with the straight leg raise test, it suggests possible nerve compression, likely sciatica. To get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. And if the X-ray doesn't give us enough information, we might consider an MRI. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Sciatica, huh? I've heard of that. Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and how to fix it. An X-ray sounds good. An MRI…well, whatever you recommend. I trust your judgment. I just want the pain to go away, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Way. We'll get to the bottom of this. Okay, I'll write the order for the X-ray now. We can get that done here at the clinic, and the results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help manage the pain. And gentle stretching exercises, if you’re able, but nothing that causes significant discomfort. And I’ll also give you a handout with some helpful information about sciatica and some exercises you can try. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Ibuprofen, stretching… I can try that. A handout would be helpful, too. I always forget what the doctor tells me as soon as I walk out the door, to be honest. So, no heavy lifting, right? I should just take it easy for a while?
DOCTOR: Exactly. No heavy lifting, bending, or twisting for now. Just take it easy and listen to your body. Here’s the order for the X-ray, and this handout provides information on sciatica, pain management, and some gentle stretches you can try. If the pain worsens significantly, or if you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, please call the clinic immediately. We may need to adjust the plan. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I’ll take it easy, try the ibuprofen and stretches, and get the X-ray done as soon as I can. I guess I’ll see you again after the X-ray results come back?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Way. I'm glad I could help. Yes, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the X-ray results and determine the best course of action. The receptionist will help you with that as you check out. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or questions. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Nice to meet you too, Doctor. I will. Thank you again.
