DOCTOR: Hi Westly, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather a nuisance, to be frank. I seem to be… visiting the restroom quite frequently. More than usual, you understand. It’s been going on for a bit now, though I couldn't say how long, precisely. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. I understand. Not being precise about the timeframe isn’t a problem at all – we'll figure it out. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… not painful, thankfully. Just…constant. Especially at night. I find myself getting up… quite a few times, I'm afraid. It disrupts my sleep, you see. And during the day, it's… well, I hesitate to go out for long periods, lest I be… inconvenienced. Is that clear enough, Doctor? I do apologize for being… vague.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly clear, Westly. No apologies necessary at all. So, frequent urination, especially at night, disrupting your sleep, and making you hesitant to go out. Have you noticed any changes in how you urinate?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think. I don’t believe so. The… stream seems normal, if you will. Not weaker, not stronger. Just…more of it, more often. And no… burning or anything unpleasant like that. Though sometimes, it feels like I haven’t completely emptied my bladder, even after I’ve gone. A small amount, perhaps. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's relevant, thank you for telling me. Feeling like you don't completely empty your bladder is important to note. And the increased frequency without pain or change in stream. Before we go further, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, I’ve been a bit…thirstier than usual, perhaps. I find myself reaching for a glass of water more often. And, now that you mention it, my appetite hasn’t been quite what it once was. Not a dramatic loss, you understand, but… diminished. I assumed it was simply… age. Is that useful information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s very useful, Westly, thank you. Increased thirst and a decreased appetite alongside the other symptoms. Okay. To get a better understanding, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a difficult question. I’ve led a rather… quiet life, Doctor. I don’t believe I’ve ever been diagnosed with anything significant. I’ve had the usual…colds, perhaps. And a touch of arthritis in my knees, but nothing that requires…intervention. My doctor, Dr. Novotny, used to say my blood pressure was a bit elevated, years ago, but it wasn't anything concerning. He retired some time ago, I'm afraid. I haven’t seen a physician regularly since. Does that…help? I apologize again for the lack of specifics.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, Westly. It's helpful to know you haven’t had any major diagnoses and haven't seen a doctor regularly in a while. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Just this. My neighbor, Mrs. Kovarova, suggested I take these for my…prostate. She swore they helped her husband. They're…saw palmetto, I believe she called them. And sometimes, I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they act up. Nothing else, I assure you. Just the saw palmetto and the occasional ibuprofen. Is that…significant, Doctor? I do hope I'm not taking something I shouldn't be.
DOCTOR: Okay, saw palmetto and ibuprofen as needed. It’s good to know what you're taking, even supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I've never experienced any…severe reactions. A bit of a sniffle with certain pollens in the spring, perhaps. But nothing life-threatening, certainly. I recall my mother always said I had a strong constitution. A bit of a stubborn streak, she called it. Does that answer your question sufficiently? I truly believe I’ve never had a proper allergy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know, Westly. No known allergies. One last question about your history before we do a quick physical exam: have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I believe I had my tonsils removed as a child. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… ah, yes. Years ago, I had a small growth removed from my back. A benign tumor, the doctor assured me. It wasn’t causing any trouble, but he recommended removing it just to be safe. Other than that, nothing comes to mind. A rather uneventful medical history, all things considered. Is that…adequate, Doctor? I fear I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Westly. That's very helpful. Tonsils as a child and a benign growth removed from your back. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Please proceed. I trust your judgment completely. I’m…not particularly fond of examinations, but I understand they are necessary. Do let me know if I need to do anything specific. And please, don't hesitate to ask if you require any further information. I shall endeavor to recall as much as I can, despite my… limitations.
DOCTOR: Alright, Westly. Just relax, and breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Your heart and lungs sound clear, but your abdomen is… slightly tender in the lower quadrant. No obvious masses, but it's a little sensitive to the touch. Now, let's check your weight. 141 kilograms. And what is your height, if you happen to know it?
PATIENT: 141 kilograms… that seems… a bit high, doesn't it? I haven't weighed myself in some time. As for my height, I believe it’s 182 centimeters. Though I must admit, I haven't been formally measured in years. Perhaps I've… shrunk a bit. Is that… relevant, Doctor? And what does the tenderness mean? Is it something to be concerned about? I do apologize for my inquisitiveness. I simply prefer to be informed, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, 182 centimeters and 141 kilograms. You're right, that puts your BMI at 42.6, which is considered obese. That can contribute to several health issues, including high blood pressure. The tenderness in your lower abdomen could be related to several things, and that’s what we need to investigate further. Based on your symptoms – frequent urination, especially at night, increased thirst, decreased appetite, tenderness in the lower abdomen, and your elevated blood pressure – I think it's important to rule out a few possibilities. I'd like to order some lab work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar, and a urinalysis to look for infection or other abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Lab work… yes, that sounds… prudent, Doctor. If it helps determine the cause, then certainly. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, urinalysis… yes, please proceed. I trust your professional judgment implicitly. I understand it's necessary to gather more information. Will these tests require a… substantial amount of blood? I confess, I'm not particularly fond of needles. And when can I expect the results? I apologize for my numerous questions, but I find it… reassuring to be fully informed. Perhaps you could explain the purpose of each test in a little more detail?
DOCTOR: Of course, Westly. No apologies necessary at all. We’ll only need a small amount of blood, just a few vials. And I'm happy to explain each test. The complete blood count will give us information about your red and white blood cells, which can help rule out infection or other underlying conditions. The metabolic panel will check your kidney function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar levels. Your increased thirst and frequent urination could be a sign of diabetes, so that's important to assess. And the urinalysis will examine your urine for any signs of infection, blood, or other abnormalities. The lab results usually take about 24-48 hours. Once we have those, we can discuss the results and develop a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and urinalysis. I appreciate you explaining each test in such detail. It eases my anxieties considerably. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours… very well. I shall await your call with… anticipation. And if I experience any… significant changes in my condition before then, should I contact you immediately? I do apologize for my continued inquisitiveness. I simply prefer to be prepared for any eventuality. Perhaps a glass of water before the blood draw would be prudent? I do find myself… rather thirsty.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, a glass of water before the blood draw is a good idea. And if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – like a fever, severe pain, or difficulty urinating – please contact the office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. I’ll have the lab order sent over to the front desk, and they can schedule the blood draw for you. Once you have the results, you can call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time, Westly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You have been… most thorough and patient. I appreciate your willingness to address my concerns, despite my… tendency to ramble. I shall await the lab order and schedule the blood draw accordingly. Thank you once again for your time and attention. I trust your expertise implicitly. Perhaps I should refrain from drinking too much water before the draw, lest I… overfill. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Westly. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. And yes, maybe just a normal amount of water – you don't want to make it too difficult for the phlebotomist! Have a good day, and I’ll talk to you soon.
