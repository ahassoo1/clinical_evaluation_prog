DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. McKinnon. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my muscles, mostly. They feel… weak. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, absolutely. Weakness… okay. And when you say “a little while”, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… around three months, maybe a little longer? It started gradually, I didn't even really notice at first. Just felt a bit more tired than usual, and things felt heavier. Now, lifting things is… a real effort. Even getting out of a chair sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months, gradual onset… and is this weakness all over, or are there specific muscles or areas that are more affected than others?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my legs and arms, I think. My legs get tired really fast when I’m walking, and my arms feel… wobbly when I try to lift anything. It's not painful, just… weak. My hands feel a bit clumsy sometimes too, like I’m losing my grip.
DOCTOR: Okay, legs and arms predominantly, some clumsiness in the hands. Not painful, just weakness. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I've been feeling more tired than usual, like I said. And I've been having a bit of trouble sleeping. Not every night, but often enough that it’s noticeable. Oh, and I’ve been a little more forgetful, I guess. Though, to be fair, I've always been a bit forgetful.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, some difficulty sleeping, and increased forgetfulness. We’ll definitely explore all of that. Now, just to get a more complete picture, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… not much, really. I haven't been to a doctor in… years, honestly. I try to stay healthy, eat reasonably well, you know? No major illnesses, no surgeries. I did have the flu once, a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed fine. I don’t take any regular medication. I don’t have insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No significant medical history, no surgeries, no regular medications. And thank you for letting me know about the insurance situation; we’ll certainly keep that in mind. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My dad had some problems with his heart when he got older, needed a pacemaker eventually. My mom was pretty healthy, lived a long life. I have a sister, she's doing fine as far as I know. No one else that I can think of with similar problems to what I'm having, though. It's probably nothing, honestly. Just getting old, maybe.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know, and it’s always helpful to have that information. "Just getting old" is a perfectly valid thought, but we want to rule out anything else that could be going on. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are there any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything. Seriously, I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Food, medication, pollen… nothing bothers me. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Alright, Mr. McKinnon, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Let’s get it over with. I got work to do later.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won't take long. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination, and listen to your heart and lungs. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, let's start with your reflexes. Just relax your legs… good. Alright, those seem… slightly diminished. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that okay? It feels… a little harder than it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, and thank you. Both sides feel a bit weaker than I’d expect. Now, can you push your hands against mine?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it looks. My arms are getting tired already.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. And that’s perfectly alright. We just need to see what’s going on. Now, let’s check your legs. Can you try to lift each leg up while I hold it?
PATIENT: There. It’s… harder than it used to be. A lot harder.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. Both legs appear weaker than expected, and I noticed some slight tremor as you held them up. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please breathe normally. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Alright, Mr. McKinnon, that concludes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings from the exam, I’m concerned about possible muscle weakness, and the faint heart sounds warrant further investigation. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Further investigation…? What does that mean? Like, what’s wrong with me? And… what kind of tests are we talking about? I'm not good with needles, you know. And… is it serious? I got a job, people depending on me.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Mr. McKinnon. I understand your concerns. Right now, it’s too early to say definitively what’s going on. The muscle weakness, fatigue, and faint heart sounds could be due to a number of things. It could be something relatively minor, or it could be something that needs more attention. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and signs of inflammation. We may also want to do an EKG to get a better look at your heart’s electrical activity. As for the tests themselves, the blood tests will involve a small needle stick, but it’s usually quick and relatively painless. The EKG involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs – no needles involved. I want to rule out anything serious, and these tests will help us do that. Given your concerns about your job and your responsibility to others, it’s particularly important that we get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… blood tests, EKG. No needles for the EKG, that's good. But blood tests… I really don't like needles. What if something is seriously wrong? What if I can’t work? And… how long will it take to get the results? I got bills to pay.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. McKinnon. It’s perfectly normal to be worried when you don’t know what’s going on. I want to reassure you that we’re going to do everything we can to get you answers quickly. Regarding the blood tests, we can discuss ways to make it as comfortable as possible. The nurse is very skilled, and we can use a numbing cream if you’d like. We can also take things slowly. As for the possibility of something serious, it's important not to jump to conclusions. Most likely, this is something we can manage with treatment or lifestyle changes. But it's better to be safe and rule out any serious conditions. The blood test results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe weakness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I know this is a lot to take in, and I want to assure you that you're not alone in this. We’ll work through this together. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this point?
PATIENT: Okay… 2-3 days. I can manage that, I guess. And no new symptoms, got it. What about the cost of all this? I don’t have insurance, remember? I don't want to get a huge bill I can't pay.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Mr. McKinnon. It's a very important question, and I apologize for not bringing it up sooner. As you mentioned, you don’t have insurance. I will have the billing department contact you to discuss the costs of the blood tests and EKG. They can also explore potential financial assistance programs or payment plans to help make it more affordable. We work with a few local organizations that offer assistance to uninsured patients, and we'll do our best to find a solution that works for you. I’m also going to write a letter to the billing department, explaining your situation and requesting that they be as flexible as possible. We don’t want financial concerns to prevent you from getting the care you need. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that's good. That’s a big help, thank you. Financial assistance… that sounds good. So… I just need to wait for the billing department to contact me? And then schedule the tests? Is there anything else I need to do right now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. You just need to wait for the billing department to contact you – they should be in touch within the next business day or two. They’ll discuss the costs and schedule the tests. For now, try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. If you notice any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I’m going to print out a summary of our conversation and the tests we’ve discussed, so you have it for your records. And I’ll also include a list of local resources that may be helpful. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been really helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, and for trying to help with the cost.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re here for you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
