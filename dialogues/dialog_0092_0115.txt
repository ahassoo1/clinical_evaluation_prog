DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I wish the circumstances were better. It’s about my… well, my skin. It’s turned quite yellow, you see. And the doctor I usually see… he suggested I come here. For… something about my liver? I don't recall the specifics, truthfully. It’s all rather muddled.
DOCTOR: I see. Yellowing of the skin is certainly something we want to investigate. It’s good you followed up on your previous doctor’s recommendation. Let me pull up your records here… Alright, Ms. Durig, it says here you haven’t been to our clinic before. Could you tell me a little bit more about when you first noticed this yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I haven’t? That’s… typical, I suppose. My memory isn't what it used to be. When did I notice it… let me think. It was… some time ago. Perhaps a month? Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, so it’s hard to pinpoint. It wasn't sudden, thankfully. Just… a slow change in my complexion. I thought it might be the lighting at first, but no… it’s definitely me. And I do feel a bit tired lately. More tired than usual, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over about a month, with some increased fatigue. That’s helpful to know. Now, Ms. Durig, besides the yellowing and the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me see. Oh, my appetite hasn't been very good. I don’t have much of a hunger, really. And… sometimes my stomach feels a little uncomfortable. Not pain, exactly. More like… a dull ache. And… oh, I've been a bit itchy, too. All over, really. It’s rather bothersome. I keep thinking it’s the laundry detergent, but I've tried different kinds. It doesn't seem to help much. Is this… serious, Doctor? I do apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Durig. You’re describing things perfectly well. Loss of appetite, a dull ache in your stomach, and generalized itching… these are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or problems with your liver or gallbladder?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. So many years… I think I had… something with my gallbladder, a long time ago. Perhaps thirty years? They may have removed it, I honestly don’t recall. And… I had a bout of hepatitis when I was younger, traveling in… well, it doesn't matter where. It was quite a long time ago, and I recovered fully, or so they said. Other than that… I’ve always been fairly healthy, I suppose. Or, I thought I was. I haven't been to the doctor much, truthfully. I dislike hospitals and clinics. It's all rather unsettling. Are you writing all this down, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Durig, I am taking detailed notes. It's important to have a complete picture. So, a history of possible gallbladder removal and hepatitis many years ago. That is very helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… No, not regularly. I used to take something for my…arthritis, I believe. But I stopped years ago. It didn’t seem to do much good, and I dislike taking pills if I can avoid it. I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. And… sometimes a little something for sleep, if I’m particularly restless. But not every night. Just when I absolutely have to. It's an over-the-counter one, I can’t recall the name. I really try to avoid medication whenever possible. It always makes me feel unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Durig, so no regular medications, occasional aspirin, and an over-the-counter sleep aid when needed. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. I used to, a very long time ago. When I was younger, of course. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. But I haven’t had a drink in… decades, I should think. It never agreed with me, truthfully. And I don’t smoke, never have. I always thought it was a dreadful habit. And I try to eat… reasonably well. Though my appetite hasn’t been very good lately, as I mentioned. Is this all important, Doctor? I feel rather foolish being questioned about my habits at my age. It feels… intrusive. But I understand you’re trying to help. I just wish I had a better memory!
DOCTOR: It’s not intrusive at all, Ms. Durig. It's all very important information. Your history is helping me understand what might be going on. And it’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall everything perfectly; we’ll do our best to figure it out together. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do you have any family members who have had liver problems, gallbladder disease, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… difficult. My family… they weren't very forthcoming with medical details. It wasn’t something we discussed much. I know my mother… she was often unwell, but I don’t recall what with. And my brother… he passed away many years ago, quite suddenly. I don’t believe it was liver-related, but I honestly can’t be certain. We weren't close, truthfully. And I don’t have any other close relatives. So… I’m afraid I can’t be much help with that, Doctor. I apologize. My memory is just… a fog. Is there something… seriously wrong with me, Doctor? I feel rather frightened.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Durig. Don't worry about not knowing your family history; many people don’t have that information. Now, given your symptoms – the yellowing of your skin, fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort, and itching – and your history, it sounds like we need to investigate potential liver problems. The hepatitis you had in the past is also something we need to consider. I’d like to perform a physical exam and order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… blood tests? A physical exam? Oh, dear. I dislike doctors and hospitals immensely, as I mentioned. But… if it’s necessary, I suppose. I trust your judgment, Doctor. But please, be gentle. And… could you explain everything to me beforehand? I do get rather anxious. And… how long will this take? I have… an appointment later this afternoon. I wouldn't want to be late. And… will it be painful? I really dislike needles. Oh, dear, I'm being quite difficult, aren't I? But I am frightened. Very frightened.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Ms. Durig. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious, and I understand your concerns completely. I will explain everything beforehand, and we'll take things at your pace. The physical exam will be relatively quick. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check for any signs of swelling or tenderness. It shouldn’t be painful at all. As for the blood tests, we’ll just need a small sample of blood from your arm. There will be a brief pinch, but it’s over very quickly. It’s the same discomfort as when you donate blood. We'll send the sample to the lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results back. The whole process should take about 30-45 minutes, including the blood draw and the exam. I’ll do my best to be quick and gentle. Would you like me to proceed with the exam and blood tests now?
PATIENT: Oh… 30-45 minutes… I suppose that’s bearable. And you promise it won’t be painful? And you’ll explain everything beforehand? Very well, Doctor. Let’s… get it over with. But please, be as gentle as possible. And… if I feel faint, please let me know. I have… a tendency to do that. And… perhaps a chair? It’s all rather overwhelming. Oh, dear. I feel so very weak. Is there a nurse available? I might need someone to hold my hand. Oh, dear, this is dreadful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Durig. Let me get a nurse to assist us. And yes, absolutely, please sit down in that chair right over there. Nurse, could you please come to examination room three?
