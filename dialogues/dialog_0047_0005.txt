DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac, though most folks just call me Lennie. I believe I am here today to… to get a look-over, yes. To be sure I am fit enough for a senior living place. My daughter, bless her heart, thought it was time. I don't mind so much, mind you. Just want to be certain everything is as it should be before I make the change.
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-placement exam. Sensible of your daughter. And perfectly reasonable for you to want everything checked over beforehand. Let’s start with the basics then. Can you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ve always been a fairly… robust man, I suppose you could say. I used to work with my hands a great deal, baking mostly. A family trade, it was. I still do a bit of baking, though not as much as I used to. My joints aren't what they once were, but I manage. Never had any serious illnesses, not that I recall. A touch of the flu now and then, a cold, things like that. I eat… well, I eat a good deal, I confess. Always have. I enjoy a good stew, and, of course, fresh bread. I suppose that's why I’m a baker.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been experiencing any particular symptoms recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. Nothing I’d call concerning, at least. My memory… well, it isn't quite as sharp as it once was. But I remember things. I remember dates, faces… important things. Just sometimes take a bit longer to recall a name, or where I put my spectacles. Though, I suppose that comes with age, doesn't it? Nothing that interferes with my day, mind you. And I sleep well enough. Perhaps a little creaky in the mornings, but nothing a warm cup of tea can’t fix.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… significant problems. Hmm. I broke my wrist once, when I was a young man. Fell off a horse. Nasty bit of business, that was. Healed up just fine, though. And I had my appendix out, oh, must be fifty years ago now. Other than that… nothing that I recall needing any lengthy treatment for. A few stitches here and there over the years, scrapes and bruises, but nothing serious. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. I’ve avoided the truly bad illnesses, thank goodness. My grandmother always said a strong spirit keeps the sickness away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries other than the appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. Just the appendix, as I said. I’ve always been one to avoid the doctor if I could help it. A bit of rest and a good broth usually did the trick. My daughter… well, she worries, you see. She wants me to be thorough. But I assure you, there haven’t been any other surgeries. I would remember something like that, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Right. Now, tell me about your family’s health. Are there any conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had trouble with her heart in her later years. Not a strong heart, she didn't. My father, he was a sturdy man, but he had trouble with his breathing as he got older. Some kind of lung trouble, I believe. My siblings… my brother had diabetes, yes. And my sister… she passed away from cancer, a long time ago now. Lung cancer, if I recall correctly. So, yes. There’s a bit of heart trouble, some lung problems, and, sadly, cancer in the family history. It's not a cheerful topic, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I haven’t taken much in the way of medicine over the years, so I haven’t had much opportunity to develop any allergies. I can eat just about anything. Sometimes a bit of a stomach ache if I eat too much rich food, but nothing serious. No hives, no difficulty breathing, nothing like that. I’ve always been a fairly sturdy constitution, as I said.
DOCTOR: And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a single one. I don’t believe in relying on pills and potions if I can help it. A good night’s sleep and a healthy appetite are usually enough for me. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take something for my joints, but I refuse. I’d rather just take things slow and steady. She worries so much. But no, I take nothing. Not a single pill, not even aspirin.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Tkac, that's a good overview. Now, I'm going to need to do a physical examination to get a better sense of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I understand. Best to be thorough, as my daughter says. I am ready whenever you are. Just let me know what you’d like me to do. I’ve never minded a good check-up.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, but slightly diminished. I’ll need to note that. Lungs… some slight crackles bilaterally, especially at the bases. I'll need to investigate further.
PATIENT: That alright, Doctor? Just a bit of a tickle in my throat, sometimes. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: <stage>I pause, looking at him over my glasses. “Yes, thank you.” I continue the auscultation, listening more carefully to the areas where I detected crackles. “Can you tell me if you've had any recent coughs or colds, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. Nothing to speak of. I had a bit of a sniffle a few months back, but it cleared up quickly. Just a minor cold, nothing more. It didn't bother me much. My daughter insisted I rest, of course. She always does. I haven’t been running any fevers, and I haven't been coughing up anything… unusual. Just a bit of phlegm sometimes, when I wake up in the morning. But that's been happening for years, I suppose. Old age, again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm just going to check your lymph nodes. Please relax your shoulders… and your neck. A few mildly enlarged nodes. Not alarmingly so, but worth noting.
PATIENT: Everything alright, Doctor? You don’t seem to be finding anything concerning, do you?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Tkac, everything appears stable at this point. However, I've noted a few minor findings that warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood work and a chest X-ray, just to get a clearer picture of your overall health. The blood work will check your basic organ function, and the X-ray will help us assess your lungs. Nothing to be overly concerned about, mind you. Just a routine precaution.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I understand. Best to be thorough, as my daughter always says. Blood work and an X-ray, you say? Will that take long? And where will I go to have those done? I haven’t been inside a hospital in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: The blood work will only take a few minutes, Mr. Tkac. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so you won’t have to go anywhere for that. The X-ray will require a visit to the imaging center across the street, but it's a quick procedure. It shouldn’t take more than half an hour. My nurse will give you the necessary paperwork and instructions. It’s a modern facility, Mr. Tkac. I assure you, it's nothing to be concerned about.
PATIENT: A lab here in the clinic, that’s good. And the X-ray… across the street, you say. Modern, you assure me. Very well. I trust your judgment, Doctor. My daughter would want me to be certain, and you seem very… competent. Though, I confess, I’ve always preferred a good cup of tea to a modern facility. But I suppose some things are necessary. When can I expect the results?
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours, Mr. Tkac. The radiologist will review the X-ray and send a report to me within the same timeframe. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results and we can discuss them. If anything concerning is found, we’ll address it promptly. But I suspect it’s simply age-related changes. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. My daughter will be pleased to hear we’re being so diligent. I suppose I’ll go and let your nurse get me started with the paperwork then. Thank you again, Doctor Press.
DOCTOR: Very good. My nurse is just outside. She'll take good care of you. .
