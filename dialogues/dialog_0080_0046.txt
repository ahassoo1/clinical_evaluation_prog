DOCTOR: Hi Marialena, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor Rosanova. Thank you for having me. I’ve been experiencing a… well, a persistent pressure in my bladder, and it’s become quite bothersome. It’s the main reason for my visit.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent bladder pressure. I understand. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I believe, approximately three weeks ago. It wasn’t constant at first, just occasional discomfort, but it’s definitely become more frequent and noticeable over the past week. I can recall the exact date it started – June 15th, after a weekend trip to visit my sister.
DOCTOR: June 15th, after your trip… good detail, thank you. And can you describe the pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels…full, even after I’ve just gone to the restroom. Not painful, precisely, but definitely uncomfortable, like there’s still a significant amount of urine remaining. It’s a constant sensation, a sort of heaviness. And sometimes, it feels like I need to go even when I don’t. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A feeling of fullness, heaviness, and the urge to go even after emptying your bladder. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I have been waking up a couple of times during the night to use the restroom – which isn’t typical for me. And… I've also noticed a slight burning sensation when I urinate, though it’s intermittent. Not every time, but it’s present on some occasions. I believe it started around the same time as the pressure, June 15th.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency, especially at night, and intermittent burning with urination. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. The urine has been a bit cloudier than usual, and… well, the odor is stronger, more noticeable. I hadn't thought much of it until you asked. It’s definitely not the clear, relatively odorless urine I'm accustomed to. I can remember specifically noticing the change on June 18th.
DOCTOR: Okay, cloudier urine and a stronger odor, starting June 18th. And have you experienced any fever, chills, back pain, or nausea?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, none of those. No fever, chills, or nausea. My back feels normal, and I haven’t had any digestive issues. I did have a slight headache yesterday, but I attributed that to the heat – it was quite warm. But overall, I feel otherwise healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No fever, chills, or back pain is reassuring. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you had any urinary tract infections in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I recall having two UTIs in my early twenties, approximately 2014 and 2016. Both times required a course of antibiotics. I remember being quite uncomfortable, and the symptoms were similar – burning sensation and frequent urination. The doctor at the time explained it was fairly common.
DOCTOR: Okay, two UTIs in the past. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: I am not currently taking any regular medications. As for allergies, I have a mild sensitivity to penicillin; it causes a rash. Aside from that, I have no known drug allergies. I’ve informed all my previous doctors about the penicillin sensitivity. I remember the rash being quite itchy, so I’m always careful to mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, mild penicillin allergy. And have you had any surgeries or significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. And I don’t have any significant medical conditions – I’ve been generally healthy my whole life, thankfully. I have occasional migraines, but they are well-managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. I believe I had my last migraine approximately three months ago, on March 10th.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries, generally healthy. Okay. And could you tell me a little bit about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother has a history of high blood pressure, which she manages with medication. My father had type 2 diabetes, though he passed away several years ago. And my sister is healthy, as far as I know. I don’t recall any history of urinary issues in my immediate family, but I haven’t specifically asked about it. I do remember my grandmother mentioning kidney stones once, but that was many years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with high blood pressure, father with type 2 diabetes, grandmother with kidney stones. Last question for the history part, and then we'll do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. I occasionally drink a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week, but I wouldn't consider myself a heavy drinker. And I do not use any recreational drugs. I believe the last time I had more than one glass of wine was on July 4th, during a celebration with friends.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional wine, no recreational drugs. Thank you, Marialena. That's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your abdomen, listen to your back, and I'll need a urine sample. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor Rosanova. I understand. Please proceed. I’ll gladly provide a urine sample. Just let me know where I can find the collection container and instructions.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The bathroom is right over there. There's a collection cup and instructions on the counter. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample—that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-flow. Once you've collected it, please bring it back to me, and I’ll take a look. I’ll be right here. Take your time.
PATIENT: Very well. I’ll head to the bathroom now and collect the sample as instructed. I'll return shortly. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Marialena. No rush at all.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor Rosanova. I followed the instructions as best as I could – a mid-stream sample, collected just now. I washed my hands thoroughly afterwards. I hope it’s sufficient.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Perfect. I’m going to do a quick dipstick test now, and then I’ll listen to your back and gently feel your abdomen. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Okay… the dipstick shows leukocytes and nitrites are present, and there’s some blood detected. The pH is normal, and the specific gravity is slightly elevated. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but there’s some mild tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region, but no masses detected. Okay, Marialena. Based on the history and the quick exam, it sounds like you likely have a urinary tract infection, or UTI. The leukocytes and nitrites in the urine are indicative of infection, and the tenderness in your lower abdomen supports that. The elevated specific gravity suggests possible dehydration.
PATIENT: That… that makes sense, considering the symptoms. I am relieved to finally have some clarity. So, what are the next steps, Doctor? What kind of treatment would you recommend? And is it something serious? I’m a little concerned about potential complications.
DOCTOR: It's good that we have some clarity. UTIs are very common, and thankfully, usually quite treatable. It's not typically serious if treated promptly, but left untreated, it can lead to a kidney infection, which is more serious. The standard treatment is a course of antibiotics. I'm going to prescribe you a seven-day course of Nitrofurantoin. It's generally well-tolerated, but some people experience mild nausea or loss of appetite. Alongside the antibiotics, it’s very important to drink plenty of fluids – at least eight glasses of water a day – to flush out the infection. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate your bladder. I'm also going to give you some Phenazopyridine, which is a urinary analgesic. It will help relieve the burning and discomfort while the antibiotics take effect. It will turn your urine orange, which is normal, and it should only be taken for two days. Do you have any allergies to sulfa drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not have any allergies to sulfa drugs. That’s good to know. And thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. The orange urine… I appreciate the heads-up. It’s reassuring to know what to expect. So, just to confirm, seven days of Nitrofurantoin, plenty of water, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and two days of Phenazopyridine for the discomfort. Will I need to come back for a follow-up appointment? Or will that be necessary? And is there anything else I should be aware of, any warning signs I should look out for?
DOCTOR: Excellent. No sulfa allergy, that's good. Yes, that’s correct – seven days of Nitrofurantoin, plenty of fluids, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and two days of Phenazopyridine. I'd like to see you back in a week, just to make sure the infection has cleared up. If your symptoms don’t improve within a couple of days of starting the antibiotics, or if you develop a fever, chills, back pain, or nausea, please call the office immediately. Those could be signs that the infection is spreading. Here are your prescriptions. The Nitrofurantoin is for seven days, and the Phenazopyridine is for two. Please take them as directed and finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better. Stopping early can lead to antibiotic resistance. I’ll also send a note to your primary care physician letting them know about the UTI. And I’ll give you some written instructions summarizing everything we discussed. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That’s very considerate of you to inform my primary care physician. And thank you for the written instructions; that will be very helpful. No, I believe that answers all of my questions, Doctor Rosanova. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and patience. You’ve eased my concerns considerably. Thank you again for everything. I’ll schedule the follow-up appointment and will be sure to contact the office if I experience any worsening symptoms. Have a wonderful day!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. You have a wonderful day as well, and get plenty of rest!
