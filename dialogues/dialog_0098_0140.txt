DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… rather embarrassing, frankly. I don’t typically bother doctors with… this. It’s a bit of a nuisance, really. It's in my mouth.
DOCTOR: I understand. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, so don’t feel embarrassed at all. Many issues can occur in the mouth, and we’re here to help. Could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… white. Patches. In my mouth. On my tongue mostly, and… well, it’s uncomfortable. It doesn’t hurt hurt, but it’s… irritating. And it’s unsightly. I eat regularly, I assure you. I maintain a… reasonable standard of hygiene. It just appeared one day. Honestly, I thought it would go away on its own. It hasn’t. It’s been… a week, perhaps? I don’t keep track of such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, white patches in your mouth, mostly on the tongue, for about a week. You mentioned it’s irritating, not painful, and you’ve noticed no change with eating or hygiene. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the patches a little more?
PATIENT: Describe them? Well, they're… white. As I said. Not particularly large. Smallish, scattered. They don’t… bleed, if you touch them. They’re… slightly raised, perhaps? I wouldn’t call them bumps, exactly. More like… a film. A disagreeable film. And they’re… tenacious. I tried… scraping one off with my toothbrush, but it didn’t budge. Which is why I’m here, wasting my time, frankly. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: "Tenacious" and "disagreeable film" are helpful descriptions, thank you. And it's good you didn’t force anything. Scraping can sometimes cause more irritation. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside these patches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. No, not really. I haven't lost my appetite. My gums haven’t been bleeding. I haven't noticed any… swelling. No fever, naturally. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a reasonably healthy man. I don’t typically… complain. This is… an anomaly. And it’s interfering with my… presentation. I meet with clients, you see. One must maintain a certain… appearance.
DOCTOR: I understand. No other symptoms, no change in appetite, no bleeding gums, no swelling, no fever. You’re concerned about your appearance for work, which is perfectly reasonable. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. Disgusting habit. My wife wouldn't allow it, even if I were inclined. She's very particular about… cleanliness. And I value my sense of taste. It’s important for… appreciating fine cuisine. I have a robust palate, you see. No, Doctor, I assure you, tobacco is not involved.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No tobacco use. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. My wife and I, we enjoy a quiet evening… a good Bordeaux, a modest cheese plate. It’s… civilized. Certainly nothing that would contribute to… this. I’m not a… a sot, if that’s what you’re implying.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Schieber. I'm simply gathering information. A glass of wine with dinner is perfectly fine. Now, let’s talk about any medications you’re taking – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all.
PATIENT: Medications? No, nothing. I rarely get sick, as I've said. A common cold, perhaps, once a year. I treat it with… rest and fluids. My wife makes a lovely ginger tea. No pills, no potions, no… unnecessary chemicals. I’m a firm believer in the body’s natural ability to heal itself. And frankly, I’m skeptical of most pharmaceuticals. They seem… excessive. No, Doctor, I take nothing. Absolutely nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. That's good to know. Now, before we do a quick examination, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmmm. Not that I’m aware of. I eat… everything. Shellfish, nuts, dairy… no problems whatsoever. My wife attempts to introduce new cuisines regularly. I am quite adventurous, you see. We travel extensively. I’ve never had… a reaction. No hives, no swelling, no difficulty breathing. Absolutely none. A robust constitution, Doctor. It's a family trait. So, no, I have no allergies. None.
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful, Mr. Schieber. Thank you for providing that information. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to take a quick look inside your mouth. It will just take a moment, and it will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Could you please open wide for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Get it over with. I have a luncheon meeting, you know. Important clients. This is… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay… I see some white patches on your tongue, as you described. They do appear somewhat tenacious. No obvious ulcers or significant swelling. The surrounding tissue looks relatively normal. I also notice a slight redness at the base of your tongue. It’s subtle, but worth noting. It's possible this is a condition called oral thrush, or candidiasis, although it's more common in people with weakened immune systems, which you don't appear to have. It could also be a form of lichen planus, or even geographic tongue. It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation.
PATIENT: Thrush? Candidiasis? Those sound… unpleasant. And I assure you, Doctor, my immune system is perfectly robust. I eat well, I exercise regularly, and I maintain a positive outlook. Lichen planus… is that contagious? I meet with a great many people, you see. I couldn't possibly… spread something. This is… distressing. Is it serious? And what, precisely, are you proposing we do about it? I haven’t time for… extensive treatments.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schieber. Neither condition is typically serious, and neither is contagious. Lichen planus is an autoimmune condition, and thrush, while a fungal infection, isn’t something you’d pass on through casual contact. To get a clearer diagnosis, I'd like to take a swab of one of the patches. It’s a quick, painless procedure, and it will allow us to determine if it’s a fungal infection. Then, depending on the results, we can discuss treatment options. If it is thrush, an antifungal medication, typically a mouthwash, is usually very effective. If it’s something else, we may need to consider a biopsy. Would you be willing to proceed with the swab?
PATIENT: A swab? More… poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather… undignified. A biopsy? That sounds… invasive. I distinctly recall stating I haven’t time for extensive treatments. And frankly, the idea of a fungal infection is… distasteful. Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn't we… simply try something? A stronger mouthwash, perhaps? Something over-the-counter? I have a rather important presentation next week, and I need to maintain a… presentable appearance. This is… inconvenient, to say the least. Do you have something… discreet?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the inconvenience and the presentation next week, Mr. Schieber. We can certainly start with a less invasive approach. Before recommending a stronger mouthwash, I do want to be clear that without knowing the cause, we’re essentially treating symptoms and not the underlying problem. However, given your schedule and concerns, we could try a prescription antifungal mouthwash for a week. If it doesn’t show improvement, we would need to revisit the possibility of further testing. I can write you a prescription for nystatin oral suspension. It’s generally well-tolerated. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Nystatin… oral suspension. Very well. As long as it doesn't involve… further procedures. And it's discreet? I can’t have my clients suspecting anything. Write the prescription. And make it… quick. I have a luncheon reservation. This entire experience has been… most unsatisfactory.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. Here is your prescription for nystatin oral suspension. It’s a standard medication and shouldn’t cause any visible issues. Use as directed, and if you don’t see any improvement within a week, or if your symptoms worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can explore other options. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. None. I trust this will resolve the matter. And please, Doctor, no further… inconveniences. Good day.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schieber. Thank you for coming in. I wish you a good day as well, and a successful presentation. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. .
