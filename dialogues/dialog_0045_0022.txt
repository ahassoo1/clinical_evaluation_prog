DOCTOR: Alright, Soila, good to meet you. I see here you're ninety years old – that's wonderful! So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Billman, yes? It’s… it’s my tummy. It feels… big. And I don't want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to, anyway. It just doesn't… feel right. I don't remember when it started, exactly. A little bit at a time, I think.
DOCTOR: “Tummy feels big, loss of appetite…” Okay. And you said you don’t remember when it started, just a gradual thing?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. Like… like the snow in the winter. It just… comes. Slowly. I used to eat everything, you know? Pierogies, borscht… all the good Russian food! Now… not so much. It’s not that it hurts, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And big. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Right, gradual onset, mostly discomfort… no pain. So, you've noticed a change in your appetite and your stomach size. Okay. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think… I get tired easier, maybe? Yes, tired. And… oh! Sometimes I feel a little… wobbly. Like a baby bird. But that might just be old age, yes? I don't know. It's hard to remember what’s new and what’s just… me now, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue, and some… “wobbliness.” Right. And when you say “tired,” is that more just feeling generally weak, or are you having trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleeping… yes. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night. And then I can't get back to sleep. I just… lie there. Thinking. About… things. Old things. But I don't feel tired all the time, if that makes sense. Just… sleepy sometimes, and then not. It's all mixed up, like a bad dream. Do you understand? Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent sleep disturbance. It could be relevant. Alright, let's try this. Have you noticed any changes in your… bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh dear. Is that… is that a polite question, Doctor? I… I don’t talk about these things. But… hmm. Maybe a little bit? I don't go as often as I used to. And… it’s harder, sometimes. But I thought that was just… you know. Old age. Everything gets… slower, yes? Is that what you mean? I’m sorry, I don't understand all the doctor words.
DOCTOR: Right. Decreased frequency, increased difficulty. Look, these things are important, Soila. It's good you're telling me. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, no. Not that I… I don’t think so. I haven’t looked, exactly. I don’t like to look. That sounds… scary. My daughter always checked these things for me, but… she moved away, you see? To California. A long way away. It's just me now. I don't think there's blood, but I couldn’t be sure. Everything is… blurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Well, given your age and what you’re telling me – the gradual abdominal distension, loss of appetite, fatigue, intermittent sleep, and changes in bowel habits – we need to do a little bit of checking. I'm going to listen to your tummy, and then I'm going to feel it gently. Just to see what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright. If you think it's… good. I trust you, Doctor. My tummy does make funny noises sometimes. Like… rumbling. Maybe that’s what you're listening for? I used to tell my daughter it was a little bear living inside. She would laugh. She had a good laugh. Please be gentle, though? It feels… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relaxing. Breathe normally for me. Hmm. Okay. I do hear some… activity. And there is some tenderness here… Not sharp pain, but definitely sensitive. And it does feel… a little bit full. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly just to get a baseline. Heart sounds are… adequate for your age. Lungs are clear. I'm going to need to order some blood work, Soila. And probably an abdominal ultrasound. To see what's going on inside.
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Blood work? Oh dear. Is it… is it something bad, Doctor? I don’t like needles. And I get nervous in those… machines. My daughter always took me for the tests. She knew how to explain things. What will the tests show? Will it hurt? I’m getting scared now. Maybe it's just… old age. Maybe I just need to eat more pierogies.
DOCTOR: Look, Soila, let's not jump to conclusions. Tests are just tests. They give us information. The blood work will tell us about your overall health and check for any signs of infection. The ultrasound uses sound waves – it doesn't hurt – to create a picture of your organs. It will help us see what's causing the distension and discomfort. It's a standard procedure. As for it being "just old age," well, things can change with age, but we need to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to have my nurse draw the blood for you and then schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning. And you’re right to be nervous. It's okay to be nervous. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll also write you a prescription for a stool softener. That might help with some of the discomfort.
PATIENT: Stool… softener? That sounds… strange. But if you think it will help, Doctor, then I will try it. And the ultrasound… tomorrow? My daughter always held my hand during those tests. Will you… will you be there? Or will I be alone? I don't want to be alone. It's… it’s a long way to California.
DOCTOR: Look, Soila, I have a full schedule tomorrow. I won’t be able to sit with you during the ultrasound personally. But the technician will explain everything to you, and the nurse will call you afterwards to discuss the results. I’ll review them myself, of course. And we can go over them together then. It's a pretty straightforward procedure. They'll just put some gel on your tummy and move a wand around. It shouldn't take long. Here’s the prescription. Take this as directed. And don't worry, you're not alone. We’re here to help. The nurse will go over everything with you before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… try not to be scared? Is that silly? My daughter always said I worried too much. She was right, probably. But… it’s just… everything feels so different now. And I miss her. Thank you, Doctor. For trying. I will… I will try not to worry. I think… I think I just want to go home now.
