DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot is bothering me. A sore, it is. Been there a while now, and it's getting more painful to walk. It’s on my… my right foot, I think. Maybe the top? It's hard to tell these old bones apart sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your right foot that’s been getting more painful to walk with. I understand. It can be tricky to pinpoint things sometimes. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the sore?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it started small. Just a little red spot, I thought maybe a bug bite. Then it didn’t go away. And now… now it’s kinda deep. And wet. I’ve been trying to keep it clean, with soap and water, but it doesn’t seem to help much. I have… what you call it? Sugar sickness? That's what the other doctor told me a long time ago. Maybe that has something to do with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started as a small red spot, hasn’t gone away, and is now deeper and wet despite you keeping it clean. And you mentioned you have… diabetes, or “sugar sickness” as you put it. Yes, that's important information, as diabetes can sometimes affect healing. Do you remember when you were diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time ago. Maybe… twenty years? Or more? The doctor, he passed away now. Dr. Akana. He was a good man. He gave me pills, and told me to watch what I eat. I tried, but it’s hard, you know? All the good things… pineapple, mango… I stopped seeing him a long time ago. Just tried to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be hard to keep up with things, especially after losing a doctor you trust. And you're right, those fruits are tempting! Okay, so you were managing your diabetes with pills and diet for some time, but haven't been regularly followed up with a doctor for quite a while. Besides the foot sore and diabetes, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me see… My eyes, sometimes they get blurry. Not all the time, just… when I’m tired, maybe. And my feet… they tingle a little, sometimes. Like pins and needles. But I thought that was just old age. And I get thirsty. Very thirsty. Even when I drink plenty of water.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, tingling in your feet, and increased thirst… okay. Those can all be related to diabetes, so it’s good you mentioned them. Now, have you had any recent injuries to your foot, even minor ones like a scrape or cut that you might not remember specifically?
PATIENT: Injury? Not that I recall. I try to be careful. I mostly stay around the house now. Don’t go walking barefoot much anymore, after… after my wife passed. She always told me to wear slippers. No, I don’t think I cut or scraped it. Maybe stepped on something sharp in the garden once, a long time ago. But nothing recent.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent injuries that you recall, possibly stepped on something sharp in the garden a long time ago. Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, I'd like to take a look at your foot now, if you don't mind. I'll need to do a quick physical exam to assess the sore and check your circulation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Be gentle, eh? Old bones, you know. And the sore… it's kinda sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Stoegbauer. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I'm seeing some redness and swelling around the sore. The skin is broken, and there's a small area of exposed tissue. I'm also going to check your pulses in your foot and ankle to assess the circulation. Your pulses are a little weak, but present. That's something we need to keep an eye on. I’m also going to check the sensation in your foot to see if there is any nerve damage. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Hmm. That one… that one feels a little… numb. Not completely, but not like the others. The others, I feel it. A little tickle, maybe. But that spot… not much. And yes, I think you’re right. My wife, she used to tell me I didn’t feel things like I used to. I thought she was just fussing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so reduced sensation in a specific area of your foot. Mr. Stoegbauer, based on what you've told me and my initial exam, it seems you have a foot ulcer, likely related to your diabetes and possibly some reduced circulation. The reduced sensation is also a concern, as it means you might not notice small injuries that could worsen the ulcer. We need to take this seriously to prevent it from getting worse. I’d like to order some lab tests to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and a test to assess the blood flow in your legs and feet. I also recommend a wound culture to see if there is any infection present. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Lab tests… yes, alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I don't understand all the fancy words, but if it helps my foot… then yes. Infection… that sounds bad. Is it… is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We’ll get those lab tests ordered right away. Yes, infection can be serious, especially for someone with diabetes. It can lead to complications like a deeper infection in the bone, or even… potentially amputation, though we are taking steps to prevent that. That’s why it’s important to identify any infection early and treat it promptly. But we are being proactive, and these tests will help us determine the best course of action. I also want to recommend a referral to a podiatrist. They specialize in foot care and can provide expert treatment for your ulcer. They can also help with proper wound care, offloading pressure from the ulcer, and recommending appropriate footwear. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Podiatrist… a foot doctor? Yes, alright. If you think I need one, then yes. More doctors… it’s just… a lot. But I understand. You’re trying to help. Will they… will they have to cut on it? I don’t like cutting.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Stoegbauer. It can be overwhelming with multiple doctors. The podiatrist will assess the ulcer and determine the best treatment plan. Sometimes, simple wound care and offloading pressure are enough. In some cases, they may need to remove any dead or infected tissue, but they will discuss all options with you before proceeding. They will explain everything in detail and answer any questions you have. For now, I’m going to prescribe a course of oral antibiotics to help prevent infection while we wait for the lab results and see the podiatrist. I’m also going to give you instructions on how to care for your foot at home, including keeping it clean and dry, and protecting it from pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… yes, that sounds good. Anything to help. And instructions… yes, alright. I’ll try my best to follow them. Will they be hard to understand? My eyes… they aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good point. I’ll make sure the instructions are written in large print, and I’ll go over them with you step-by-step before you leave. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to check your progress and answer any questions that may arise. Here are the instructions. It's important to keep the wound clean and dry. Wash it gently with soap and water twice a day, and pat it dry with a clean towel. Cover it with a sterile bandage, and change the bandage daily, or more often if it gets wet or dirty. Avoid putting any pressure on your foot, and wear comfortable, supportive shoes. And, of course, take the antibiotics as prescribed. Do you have any questions about these instructions, or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Change the bandage… how tight should it be? I don't want to cut off the circulation, but I don't want it to be too loose either. And comfortable shoes… my slippers, would those be alright? They’re soft and warm. And… will these pills make me sleepy?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Stoegbauer. The bandage should be snug, but not too tight. You should be able to easily slip a finger underneath it. If your foot becomes numb, tingly, or changes color, that means it's too tight and you need to loosen it immediately. As for slippers, while they’re comfortable, they don’t provide enough support for someone with your condition. They can actually put more pressure on your foot and worsen the ulcer. I recommend a comfortable, supportive shoe with a wide toe box. As for the pills, some people experience mild drowsiness as a side effect, but it's not common. If you do feel sleepy, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery. If you have any other side effects, please contact the office. I’m also going to give you a handout with information about diabetes foot care. It has a lot of helpful tips and resources. Do you think you'd like that?
PATIENT: A handout… yes, alright. More information can’t hurt, I suppose. It’s just… a lot to remember. But I’ll try. Is there anything I need to do besides the pills and the bandages and… not wearing slippers?
DOCTOR: You're right, it is a lot to remember, and you're doing great asking questions. Besides the pills, bandages, and footwear, the most important thing is to monitor your foot for any changes. Look for signs of infection, like redness, swelling, pus, pain, or warmth. Also, check your foot daily for any cuts, blisters, or sores. If you notice any changes, contact the office immediately. It's also important to control your blood sugar levels. That's the best way to prevent further complications. I recommend following a healthy diet and getting regular exercise, if possible. I can refer you to a diabetes educator if you'd like to learn more about managing your condition. And finally, avoid smoking, as it can worsen circulation and slow healing. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Smoking… no, I quit years ago. Diabetes educator… yes, that might be helpful. I don’t understand all the numbers and things. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m happy to help. I’ll go ahead and get that referral to the diabetes educator scheduled for you. We’ve covered a lot today, so don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns that come up after you leave. Here's a summary of everything we discussed, including the lab orders, prescription information, referral to the podiatrist and diabetes educator, and the discharge instructions. Please keep this with you. I wish you all the best with your foot care. Remember to take it one step at a time, and don’t be afraid to ask for help. We’re here to support you. Is there anything else I can do for you before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you again for your kindness. It’s… it’s good to know someone is listening. I will follow your instructions as best as I can. I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. It was my pleasure. Please take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. We’re here to help. Have a good day.
