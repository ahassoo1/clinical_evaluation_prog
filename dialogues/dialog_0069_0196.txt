DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on… a while now, I guess. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of dates anymore. It just… is. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a good place to start. "Always tired" can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Ugh, where to start… It’s not like I’ve been doing anything to be tired, you know? I just… wake up tired. And it doesn’t really get better throughout the day. I try to rest when I can, but… it doesn’t really help, help. It's just… draining. I used to be able to do so much more. My husband… well, never mind. It's just… hard.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds really frustrating to feel constantly drained, especially when rest doesn’t seem to make a difference. It's good you're bringing this to our attention. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see… Sometimes my muscles ache a little. Not like a bad pain, just… sore. And… I forget things. A lot. More than usual, I think. Though, to be honest, I always had a terrible memory. Is that… is that helpful? I don’t know. It’s all a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Licano. Muscle aches and increased forgetfulness along with the tiredness are definitely things we want to explore. When you say "increased forgetfulness," can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… like… I went to the store yesterday, and I completely forgot what I went there for! I just stood there, looking at things, and… nothing. Or, I’ll be talking to someone, and I can’t remember their name five minutes later. It's embarrassing, really. It wasn’t this bad before, I don't think.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds distressing, and it's completely understandable that it's embarrassing. It's good you're noticing these changes. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's… a good question. My husband always handled all that paperwork. I… I think I had high blood pressure at some point? And… something with my cholesterol? Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. I’m on Medicare now, so… something must be wrong, right? I don’t really remember being told anything specific.
DOCTOR: It's alright if you don't remember the specifics, Ms. Licano. We can look up your records in the system here. Okay, I see here you were diagnosed with hypertension about five years ago and hyperlipidemia around the same time. You’re currently prescribed lisinopril and atorvastatin, is that correct?
PATIENT: Lisinopril and… atorvastatin? Yes, I think so. Little pills. I take them every morning. Honestly, I just take whatever the doctor tells me to take. I don’t really question it. Do they… are those supposed to help with the tiredness? I thought they were for… something else.
DOCTOR: Those medications are typically for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. They don't usually cause tiredness directly, but sometimes medication side effects or the conditions themselves can contribute to fatigue. Let's move on to some other questions. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder removed, years ago. And… I think I had something done on my knee, a long time ago. It was… painful. But that was before my husband… ugh, never mind. I don't remember much about either one, to be honest. It was all just… a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and something on the knee. Thank you. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, goodness. My mother… she had diabetes, I think. And my father… he had heart problems. He… passed away when I was young. My sister… she’s still alive, but we don’t talk much anymore. She lives far away. I don’t really know what health problems she has. It was never really discussed, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Licano. That’s helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! Not me. My husband… he used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I never touched the stuff. And definitely not anything else! I don’t even like the smell of cigarettes. No, no, just…tired. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. I mean, I get hay fever in the spring, but that’s it. Nothing serious. No reactions to any of the pills I take, as far as I know. My husband always checked all that stuff. I really wish he were here to answer these questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Licano. Thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and memory. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I want to feel better. I’m just so tired all the time. Yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course. Okay, deep breaths in and out for me, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Finally, let's do a quick memory test. I'm going to say three words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me after I say a few other things. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Ready… I think so. Three words? Oh dear. Okay, go ahead. I’ll try my best. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your day. What did you have for breakfast this morning?
PATIENT: Oh… breakfast? Um… I think… toast? Yes, toast with… jam. Strawberry jam. But… What were the words again?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. Don’t worry about the words just yet. Let’s just focus on the questions. Now, can you tell me what day of the week it is today?
PATIENT: Ugh… today? Oh dear. Is it… Tuesday? No… Wednesday? I always get them mixed up. It’s… a weekday, I think. I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you repeat the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Oh… the words. Um… apple… and… something with a table? And… a color? No… I can’t remember! I’m so sorry. It’s just… gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Licano, that’s alright. It's not a test, and it's not something to be upset about. This quick assessment does suggest some cognitive impairment. Given your reported tiredness, muscle aches, and now these memory issues, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or anemia. I also want to order a complete metabolic panel and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. We may also consider further neurological evaluation if these initial tests don’t provide a clear answer. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh… tests? More tests? I just want to feel better, Doctor. Is it something serious? What will the tests show?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Licano. It’s hard to feel uncertain. The tests will help us understand why you're feeling this way. Many things can cause these symptoms, and we need to rule out the more serious possibilities first. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious is wrong. The blood tests will give us a good starting point. We'll check for common vitamin deficiencies, assess your thyroid function, and look at your kidney and liver health. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and create a plan to get you feeling better. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood today, and we should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your medications as prescribed and getting plenty of rest. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Rest… I try. No, I don’t think so. Just… when will I feel better? Is it going to take a long time? And… will it be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. I just want to know… what’s wrong with me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Licano. It's frustrating not knowing, and worrying about costs is completely valid. As for when you'll feel better, that's hard to say without the test results. It could be something simple to fix, or it might take a bit more time and investigation. We will work together to figure it out. Regarding costs, Medicare typically covers most of these tests, and we'll make sure to check your coverage before proceeding. Our billing department can also help you understand any potential out-of-pocket expenses. I’ll make a note to have them contact you regarding costs. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. We’ll call you as soon as the results are back, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. I just… I’m tired of being tired.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Licano. I understand, and I'm here to help. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. The lab technician will be with you shortly to draw your blood. If you experience any sudden or worsening symptoms in the meantime—like a high fever, severe headache, or difficulty breathing—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here's a printed copy of the lab order. Thank you again for coming in today. I’ll be in touch soon.
