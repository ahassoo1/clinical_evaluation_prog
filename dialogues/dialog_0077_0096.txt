DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s about my eyes, really. They’ve been… sensitive to the light lately. More than usual, anyway. It’s been bothering me for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Sensitive to light… alright. And when you say “more than usual,” can you describe what you typically experience, and how this is different?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Usually, bright sunshine is bright sunshine, you know? I might squint a bit. But now, even indoor lights… like the ones in the grocery store, or even my phone screen sometimes… they feel really harsh. It’s like they’re burning, almost. And it gives me a bit of a headache afterwards. It's just… uncomfortable. I used to be able to handle a lot more light without a problem.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s a noticeable change in your tolerance. And it's accompanied by headaches after exposure to light. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sensitivity and headaches?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. A noticeable change. Hmm… let me think about other symptoms. I haven't really noticed anything else, not exactly. My vision seems okay, I think. No blurriness or anything. Though… now that you mention it, my eyes do feel a little gritty sometimes, like there’s something in them, even when I’ve washed them out. Not all the time, though. Is that connected, maybe?
DOCTOR: The grittiness could be related, yes. It often accompanies issues with the surface of the eye. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known allergies, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never been allergic to anything, as far as I can remember. I mean, I've never had a reaction to food, or anything like that. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. My wife… she had hay fever, but that's about it in the family. I’m a widower, by the way, if that's helpful information. She passed away a little over a year ago.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry for your loss, Mr. Komarov. It’s perfectly helpful to have that information, thank you. And no allergies to be aware of, that’s good. Are you currently taking any medications, or have you taken any recently – even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or eye drops?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I don’t really take any medication. I try to stay healthy. Just vitamins now and then. I haven't needed anything stronger, and I haven't used any eye drops for this… not yet, anyway. I was hoping it would just go away on its own, but it hasn’t. That's why I came in.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. That simplifies things. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I've been pretty healthy my whole life, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, measles and chickenpox and things like that, but nothing serious. I’ve had regular check-ups with my primary care doctor, and everything has always been good. He retired last year, that’s another reason I haven’t been to the doctor much lately. I still need to find a new one, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No significant medical history. And no surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that either. Never had to have surgery, thankfully. And I’ve never been in the hospital, not even as a kid. I've always been lucky with my health, I guess. It’s just… this eye thing is really bothering me. I work as a dental assistant, you see, and I need to be able to see clearly and comfortably to do my job. It's making it difficult.
DOCTOR: A dental assistant, that does require good vision. Alright. And just to complete the picture, Mr. Komarov, do you have any family history of eye problems – glaucoma, macular degeneration, cataracts, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had cataracts when she got older, I think. She needed surgery for them, but it went well. My father, he wore glasses all his life, but I don’t think he had anything serious. Just regular age-related vision changes, you know? Nothing like what I'm experiencing, anyway. It’s been a while since I thought about their health, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, cataracts in your mother and age-related vision changes in your father. Thank you for that information. Now, if you’ll permit me, I'd like to do a quick examination of your eyes. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Please go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I'm ready when you are. I’m hoping you can figure out what’s causing this. It’s really starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we'll get started. First, I'm going to check your visual acuity – how well you see at different distances. Then, I’ll take a look at the front of your eyes with a special light. Can you read the smallest line on this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, I'll try. Um… let's see… is it… E… P… V… D… H… Is that right? It’s a little blurry. It’s hard to make them out clearly. I think that’s it, though. It's definitely not as sharp as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Your vision is slightly reduced, 20/30 in both eyes. Not dramatic, but noticeable. Now, let me examine the front of your eyes with this light. I’m noting some mild redness in both eyes, and a slight inflammation of the conjunctiva. Your pupils are reacting normally to light. I do not see any signs of a cataract or glaucoma at this time. Do you feel any pain or gritty sensation when I gently touch your eye?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain at all. And no… gritty sensation either. It just feels… dry, sometimes. Like I haven’t blinked in a while. And maybe a little sensitive to the light, even with your light. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It’s hard to explain. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay. No pain, just dryness and sensitivity. That’s helpful. Given your symptoms – the light sensitivity, redness, mild inflammation, and dryness – it sounds like you may be experiencing conjunctivitis, likely due to environmental factors. It's often caused by allergies or irritation. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, so I'd like to perform a quick Schirmer's test to measure your tear production. It just involves placing a small strip of paper under your eyelid to see how much you're producing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get it sorted out. I’m happy to do the test. A Schirmer’s test, you say? It doesn’t sound too bad. Is it going to be uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't be uncomfortable at all, Mr. Komarov. Just a mild sensation of something under your eyelid for a moment. Your tear production is slightly lower than normal, which supports the diagnosis of dry eye syndrome, potentially contributing to the conjunctivitis symptoms. We can manage this with artificial tears and, if needed, other treatments. I'm going to recommend using preservative-free artificial tears four times a day, even when your eyes feel comfortable. It’s best to start with those. We'll reassess in two weeks. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve, we can consider a referral to an ophthalmologist. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. Artificial tears, four times a day. Preservative-free, you said? I’ll make sure to get those. And two weeks to reassess. That sounds good. I appreciate you taking the time to figure out what’s going on. It’s a relief to have a plan. Is there anything else I need to know or do? Any specific brands you recommend? Or things I should avoid?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Komarov. I’m glad we could get a plan in place. As for brands, Systane Ultra or Refresh Relieva are both good options. Look for the preservative-free varieties. As for things to avoid, try to limit exposure to dry, windy conditions, and avoid rubbing your eyes. Also, make sure your computer screen isn't too close, and that the brightness is adjusted properly. If you wear contact lenses, make sure they're fitted correctly and that you’re cleaning them properly. I will send a prescription for the artificial tears to your pharmacy. Here’s a handout with information about dry eye syndrome and tips for managing it. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate your patience and kindness. And thank you for the handout. I'll read it carefully. I think I'm good for now. Hopefully, the artificial tears will do the trick. Thank you again, Doctor Pirl. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Komarov. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. And you have a good day as well. .
