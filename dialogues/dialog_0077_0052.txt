DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Och, good mornin’ to ye too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet ye as well. Well, I’ve been havin’ a bit o’ trouble wi’ mornin’ sickness, if ye can believe it. Seems a bit daft at my age, doesn’t it? But it’s been goin’ on for a few weeks now, and it’s startin’ to worry me, seein’ as how I’ve got a bad heart.
DOCTOR: Morning sickness… at your age, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Not the usual thing for a man o’ 63, is it? It’s not exactly like the stories ye hear, mind ye. It’s more… a queasy feelin’, and sometimes I actually chuck a bit. It always happens first thing, before I’ve even had a bite to eat. And it’s been gettin’ worse, that’s the thing. It’s worryin’ because o’ the heart, ye understand. Doc told me a few years back it wasn’t gettin' any stronger, and strainin' myself isn't a good idea.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Benic. And you’re right to be cautious given your cardiac history. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. When you say "a few weeks," could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it must be, oh, close to a month now. Maybe five weeks? Started right after I had that wee cold spell, but the cold cleared up quickly enough. It wasn't the cold itself, I don't think. It just… started a few days after. And it's pretty much every mornin' now, though some days it’s just a wee bit o’ discomfort, other days it’s… well, not pleasant at all. I try to take it easy, but still, it's makin’ it hard to get goin' in the mornin'.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. And you mentioned this happens before eating, even first thing?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Before I’ve had a drop o’ tea, before a biscuit, before anythin’. Just wakin’ up, and there it is. Sometimes it’ll settle a bit if I manage to get a bit o' toast down, but it takes a good while. And it’s not like a regular sick feelin’, ye ken? It’s… deeper, if that makes any sense. It’s right in my stomach, a proper roilin' feelin'. It's just…unsettlin', ye understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A deeper, roiling sensation, occurring before food… that’s certainly unusual. Now, have you noticed anything else accompanying this, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Just a general fadin’ feelin’, ye ken? And I’ve maybe been a wee bit short o’ breath, but that's nothin’ new, to be honest. The heart’s been playin’ up on and off for years, so it's hard to say if it's connected. And… oh, now that ye mention it, I've had a bit o’ indigestion as well. Not every day, but it seems to come on more often when this mornin' sickness is bad. It’s like everything’s just… all mixed up inside. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Benic. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides your heart issues?
PATIENT: Och, aye, go ahead. I’ve nothin’ to hide. Let me see… well, I had my appendix taken out when I was a lad, but that was a long time ago. And I’ve got a touch o’ arthritis in me knees, mostly just stiffness in the mornin’ – the Scottish weather doesn’t help with that, ye ken? Oh, and I had a wee bit o’ pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Nothin’ else major, I don't think. I've always been fairly healthy, all things considered… until this mornin' sickness started, that is. It's just... strange. A 63-year-old man feelin’ sick every mornin', it's just not right, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it is certainly not typical. Now, and please forgive me for asking, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Aye, that's a fair question. I take a wee tablet for the blood pressure, Ramipril, I think it's called. And sometimes, when the arthritis flares up, I take Ibuprofen, but not every day, just when I need it. That's it, really. Not much else. I try to avoid takin’ too many pills, if ye understand. I've always believed in lettin' nature take its course, as much as possible. And I definitely didn’t think I’d be needin’ somethin’ for mornin’ sickness! It feels… well, ridiculous, to be honest. A grown man and all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Benic. Now, would you mind if I performed a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Och, aye, go ahead. I’ve nothin’ to hide, as I said. I've been examined by doctors plenty o' times, mostly about the heart, mind ye. Just let me know if ye need me to do anythin’ special. I’m not the most flexible o' lads these days, ye ken? Arthritis and all that. But I'll do me best. Just get on with it, and let's see if we can figure out what's goin' on with this sickness. It's startin’ to get me down, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Benic. We'll take it slowly. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the table. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I detect a slight murmur, consistent with your previous cardiac evaluations. Your lungs are clear, thankfully. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Do you experience any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Aye, that's alright. It's a bit o' a strange feelin' havin' someone poke about, but I'm used to it, as I said. Let me see… Hmm, now that ye mention it, there's a wee bit o' discomfort right here, just under the ribs on me left side. Not sharp pain, just… a dull ache, if ye understand. It's not there all the time, just when ye press on it. And it seems a bit more sensitive than usual. I thought it might just be indigestion, but… well, maybe not. It feels a bit deeper than that. It’s not somethin' I've noticed before, not until ye started pressin' about, that is. Just a wee bit o' discomfort, aye.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Benic. I also noticed some mild guarding when I palpated that area, suggesting some underlying inflammation. Now, I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds. Your bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. Given your symptoms, your medical history, and the findings from the examination, I believe we need to investigate this further. I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and an amylase level. These will help us rule out any underlying infection, liver issues, or pancreatic problems. I would also recommend a stool sample to check for any abnormalities.
PATIENT: Och, aye, that sounds sensible. If ye think it's best, I'm happy enough. Blood tests and a stool sample, aye. I've given plenty o’ blood samples in me time, so I'm not worried about that. A stool sample… well, that's a bit embarrassing, to be honest, but I'll manage. If it'll help figure out what's makin' me feel sick every mornin', then I'm happy to do it. Just tell me what I need to do, and I'll get on with it. I’m trustin’ yer judgement, Doctor. I just want to get back to feelin’ myself again, ye understand? This sickness is really gettin’ me down, and I'm worryin’ it’s somethin' to do with the heart.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Benic. We will proceed cautiously, and the tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out any serious cardiac issues. I’ll give you the necessary instructions and collection containers for the blood tests and stool sample. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to take your blood pressure medication as prescribed. Also, avoid any strenuous activity and eat smaller, more frequent meals. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or persistent vomiting, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Aye, that's all very clear, thank ye. Smaller meals, no strenuous activity… I can manage that. And if things get worse, I'll get straight to the hospital, aye. Hmm… let me think. Just one thing. Is it possible… could this be somethin' to do with my age? I've never heard o' a man o' 63 havin' mornin' sickness before, and I'm worryin' it's somethin' serious, somethin' I should’ve known about years ago. And if it’s somethin' serious… will it show up in the blood tests? I’m just… a bit anxious, ye understand. It's just all a bit strange, and I like to know what's goin' on, if ye can keep me informed.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Mr. Benic. And it’s good that you’re asking questions. While morning sickness is commonly associated with pregnancy, nausea and vomiting can have many causes, and it's certainly not unheard of in men your age. It could be related to a variety of factors, such as gastritis, a stomach ulcer, medication side effects, or even a viral infection. While less common, it could also indicate a more serious underlying condition, which is why we’re conducting these tests to rule out those possibilities. The blood tests will provide valuable information about your overall health and help us identify any abnormalities. I’ll personally review the results as soon as they’re available and contact you to discuss them and formulate a plan of action. I want to assure you that we’re taking your concerns seriously, and we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: Och, aye, that's very reassurin', thank ye, Doctor. Ye've put me at ease a wee bit. I suppose I'll just have to wait for the tests, then. I appreciate ye takin' the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. It’s easy to get worried when somethin's not right, and ye've been very patient. No, I think that’s all for now. Just waitin' for the results, then. Thank ye again, Doctor. I'll be seein’ ye, hopefully with some good news.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Benic. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any changes in your condition. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Take care of yourself, and I hope to see you soon with some positive news as well. .
