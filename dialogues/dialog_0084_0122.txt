DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… it is about my memory. It is… troubling me. Recently, things… slip my mind. It is very frustrating, and I want to understand why. I am Venus Alvara, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Alvara, I see your name here. It's good to meet you. Memory issues are frustrating, and we'll definitely try to figure out what's going on. When you say things “slip your mind,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. It is… difficult to explain precisely. Small things, mostly. Like… where I put my keys, or the name of a neighbor I see every day. Things I always knew before. I remember details from many years ago perfectly, but now… today’s events… they are… hazy. I do not forget everything, just… recent happenings. It is… worrisome, because my blood pressure has been high for some time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's primarily recent memory that's affected, and you're noticing this happening more frequently. And you're understandably concerned given your history of high blood pressure. That's good you mentioned that. Do you find this memory loss is interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Yes, it is… becoming difficult. I manage several properties, you see. Real estate. And the community associations… there are many details. Dates for meetings, names of contractors, what repairs are needed… I write everything down, of course. But sometimes… I forget where I wrote it down! It is… embarrassing, and it takes much longer to complete tasks. I do not want to make mistakes for my clients.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very stressful, especially with the responsibilities you have. It's good that you're recognizing this and taking steps to get it checked out. Let's talk a little more about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Only the blood pressure. It has been… managed with medication for some years now, but it is always a little high, even with the pills. The doctor… my previous doctor… said I need to watch my diet, and exercise more. Which… I try to do, but it is difficult with my work. I am a widow, you see. I do most things myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure is your main medical issue, and you’ve been managing it with medication. And you’re aware of the lifestyle recommendations. I appreciate you sharing that you're a widow and managing things on your own. That gives me a better picture. Are you currently taking any other medications besides what you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the pills for the pressure. A small white one, and a larger pink one. I take them every morning with my breakfast. I have not… added anything else recently. I do not like taking many pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the white and pink pills for blood pressure, taken every morning. Good to know. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies that I know of. I eat… most things. I have never had a reaction to any medication. I am Russian, you see, and we… we eat a lot of different foods when I was growing up. Very few restrictions.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. My mother… she did become very confused in her later years. She lived to be 92, but the last few years… she did not recognize people sometimes. My father… he died young, from a heart attack. He was only 68. I do not know if he had any memory problems. We were… not very close. My brother… he is alive, but we do not speak often. I do not know about his health.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother experienced some confusion in her later years, and your father died of a heart attack at a relatively young age. You don’t have much information about your brother’s health. That's alright, we work with what we have. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. My husband… he smoked for many years, but he stopped before he became ill. It is… a very bad habit. I always discouraged it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. Good. And how much alcohol do you typically consume in a week?
PATIENT: Very little, Doctor. Perhaps one glass of wine with my dinner, once or twice a week. I do not drink often. It does not… agree with me, and I prefer tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, minimal alcohol consumption. And finally, are you experiencing any other symptoms besides the memory loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I sleep… well enough. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but that is probably from working too hard. My appetite is… normal. No headaches, no dizziness. Just… this forgetfulness. It is the most troubling thing. I feel… anxious about it, if I am honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily the memory loss and some associated anxiety. No other significant symptoms. Alright, Ms. Alvara, that gives me a good starting point. I'd like to do a brief physical and neurological exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you think is best. I want to find out what is causing this, and hopefully… fix it. I need my memory, you see. It is very important for my work, and for… everything.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/85. Not drastically, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are normal. Good. Strength and coordination seem normal. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to check your memory and cognitive function. It’s just a quick screening, nothing to worry about. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… let me see… It is… August 2nd. 2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I… I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: This is… an urban area, yes? I believe this is… the city. I do not… remember the name specifically. I travel a lot for my work. I am sorry, Doctor. I should know.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Alvara. No need to apologize. Let's try something else. I'm going to name three words, and I want you to try to remember them. Repeat them back to me after I say them, and then I'll ask you to recall them in a few minutes. The words are: apple, table, penny.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. I… I think I can remember those. They are simple words.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's move on to a quick assessment of your attention and concentration. I want you to count backwards from 100 by sevens. Just as far as you can go. Take your time.
PATIENT: Ninety-three… eighty-six… seventy-nine… seventy-two… sixty-five… sixty-eight… no… sixty-three… fifty-six… fifty… fifty-three… I… I am losing track. It is… difficult.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Alvara. You did very well. No need to continue if you’re feeling uncomfortable. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of this brief exam, it’s difficult to pinpoint a specific cause for your memory issues at this time. The fact that you’re having trouble with recent memory, and the difficulty with the serial sevens test, suggests some cognitive impairment. However, it's not definitive. Given your history of high blood pressure, it's important to rule out any vascular causes. High blood pressure, if poorly controlled, can sometimes lead to small strokes or changes in the brain that affect memory and thinking.
PATIENT: I… I see. So, it could be the pressure? That is… worrisome. I do try to manage it, but it is always a little high. What do we do now, Doctor? I want to know what is happening, and what can be done about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, it could be related to your blood pressure, but we need to investigate further to be certain. I'm going to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out other possible causes. I also want to schedule an MRI of your brain. An MRI will give us a detailed picture of your brain and help us identify any changes that might be contributing to your memory problems. In the meantime, it's important to continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and to focus on healthy lifestyle habits—a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in the brain and nervous system. They can provide a more comprehensive evaluation and help us determine the best course of treatment. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… serious. And a neurologist… Is it something… bad, Doctor? I do not understand. And the blood work… how long will it take to get the results? I am… anxious about all of this. I just want to know what is happening to my memory.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Alvara. It’s perfectly natural to feel worried when you’re facing uncertainty. An MRI is a safe and painless imaging test. It doesn't involve any radiation. We use it to get a detailed look at your brain so we can rule out any structural problems. And seeing a neurologist doesn’t automatically mean something is seriously wrong. They’re simply the experts in this area, and they can help us get a more definitive diagnosis. The blood work should be available in a few days, usually within a week. The MRI will take a bit longer to schedule, perhaps a week or two, depending on availability. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Here's a referral to a neurologist and an order for the blood work. The lab is just down the street. You can call the neurologist’s office to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions about how to schedule the tests or anything else at this time?
PATIENT: A week or two… that feels like a very long time. I am… worried about forgetting things in the meantime. I manage so many properties… and my clients… I… I do not know how to thank you, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. I… I think I understand now. No, I do not have any further questions at this time. Just… thank you. I will call the neurologist’s office tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I'm glad I could provide some clarity. And please, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We're here to support you. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. Keep a detailed calendar and write everything down, and remember we're taking steps to figure this out.
