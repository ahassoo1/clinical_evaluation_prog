DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It’s not… right. It’s different than it usually is, and I can’t quite place what is right about it, you know? I just… smell different.
DOCTOR: Different how, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s the hard part. It's not… worse, exactly. Just… not me. Usually, I just smell… clean, after my shower. Or maybe a little bit of the soap. But lately, it’s… almost sweet? And a little bit… musty, if that makes sense. I’ve tried different soaps, different deodorants, but nothing seems to cover it up. It's not a bad smell, but it’s definitely… noticeable. I don’t want to offend anyone, that’s why I came in.
DOCTOR: Sweet and musty… an unusual combination. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. No fever, no chills, and I sleep pretty soundly, don’t wake up sweaty at all. I haven't felt sick, really. That's what's so strange about it. It's just… this smell. I work a lot, you know, laying floors… lots of physical work. Could that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Physical labor can certainly contribute to body odor, Ms. Purtee, but a change in character of the odor… that’s less typical. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I have been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I always chalked that up to the work. And… oh! My appetite's been a bit bigger, I guess. I’ve been eating more, but I haven't really gained any weight. Just… hungry more often. Does that sound important?
DOCTOR: Increased appetite… and fatigue. Right. And are you experiencing any changes in your bowel habits, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, yes, actually. Now that you mention it. I’ve been… a little more regular, if you know what I mean. More frequent, and… looser. Not diarrhea, exactly, but not… firm. It started around the same time as the smell, I think. I didn't think it was important enough to mention, honestly. Is that… connected?
DOCTOR: More frequent, looser stools… and a change in body odor. Very well. Have you noticed any weight loss, despite the increased appetite?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no weight loss. Like I said, my weight’s stayed pretty much the same. I weigh myself every couple of weeks, just to keep track, and it hasn’t budged. That’s what’s so confusing! Everything feels… off, but nothing is dramatically different, you know? I eat more, I’m a little tired, my… bathroom habits are a bit different, and I smell… strange. It's like a puzzle.
DOCTOR: Ms. Purtee, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule out any underlying medical causes. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None at all. Latex is fine, everything is fine. Okay, a physical exam sounds good. I just want to figure out what's going on. I’m ready when you are. It’s just… I’m a little nervous, I guess. All this feels a bit… serious, even if you say it probably isn’t.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I will start with auscultation of your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Purtee… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I need to palpate your abdomen. Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Not at all. It's a little sensitive sometimes, just from the work, you know? Lots of bending and lifting. But no sharp pain or anything. You can… press as hard as you need to. I'm pretty tough.
DOCTOR: No acute tenderness. Slight guarding, but likely due to physical exertion. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. That's normal. Now, please sit up. I’m going to need to briefly examine your skin. Any new rashes, moles, or lesions?
PATIENT: No rashes, Doctor. Nothing new. I get the occasional scratch from work, but those heal pretty quickly. My skin’s usually pretty clear. I try to stay out of the sun as much as possible, but when I’m laying floors outside… it’s hard to avoid. I don’t think I’ve noticed anything unusual, though. Just a little dirt sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Skin appears normal. No visible lesions. Ms. Purtee, based on this preliminary examination, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your symptoms. However, given the changes in your body odor, increased appetite, and bowel habits, I recommend a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We should also rule out any underlying infection. Do you have a preference for a lab?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. That sounds… thorough. I haven’t been to a lab in years, honestly. No preference, Doctor. Whatever is closest would be fine. I just want to know what's going on. Blood work sounds good. Is it… something serious? You said it was hard to pinpoint, and that sounds a little… worrying.
DOCTOR: Ms. Purtee, it is unlikely to be anything serious, but it is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. These tests will help us determine if there is an infection, vitamin deficiency, or any other abnormalities. I will send the lab order to the clinic lab. You can go there at your convenience. Once the results are back—usually within 24-48 hours—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, severe abdominal pain, or significant weight loss, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and running the tests. I’ll go to the lab as soon as I can. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Thank you again. I’ll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Purtee. Have a good day. And try not to worry unnecessarily. .
