DOCTOR: Right. Kiwane Barban, 28 years old. Good. Well, Mr. Barban, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: The… paper said something about a check-up? Before the… the health help starts. I do not understand all the words, but they sent me here. It is for the insurance, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. A general check-up, as the insurance requires. It's…standard. Though frankly, I find these blanket appointments a bit of a waste of time when the patient hasn't articulated a specific complaint. But rules are rules, I suppose. Regardless, let’s not dwell on that. To make this efficient, let's start with what you are experiencing. Are you feeling unwell in any way?
PATIENT: Unwell? No. I work. Every day. Food processing. It is… hard work, but I am strong. I do not have time to be… unwell. What kind of questions is this? It feels like you are asking if I am weak.
DOCTOR: Weakness wasn’t precisely my intent, Mr. Barban. I was attempting to ascertain if you’ve experienced any changes in your health – fatigue, pain, digestive issues, anything at all – that might warrant investigation. It's a rather standard line of questioning, I assure you. But if you insist you are in perfect health, we can proceed directly to the physical examination. Though, frankly, a basic history is far more informative. Perhaps you could tell me, have you noticed any changes at all in your appetite, sleep patterns, or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes? The work is always the same. Hard. I eat when I can. Sleep when I am finished. Weight… it is the same. Maybe a little less when it is very hot, but that is normal. I do not need to tell you about my body. You should just look at the tests. It is a waste of my time, this talking.
DOCTOR: With all due respect, Mr. Barban, simply looking at tests is insufficient. A test is a snapshot, a single data point. It doesn’t reveal the full picture, the context of your health. And that context comes from understanding your experience. However, if you are so resistant to providing any information, we can certainly proceed with the examination. But don’t expect a comprehensive assessment. Very well. Let’s start with your vital signs. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature… and weight, as you mentioned. Could you step onto the scale, please?
PATIENT: Fine. But do not make me wait. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: 90 kilograms. Alright. And your height is listed as 188 centimeters. That gives us a BMI of… 25.5. Slightly overweight, but not alarming. Now, I need you to remain still and quiet while I take your blood pressure. Try to relax. 138 over 82. Elevated, but again, not immediately concerning. We will need to monitor this. Pulse is 78, regular. Temperature is 37 degrees Celsius. So, physically, you appear…stable. Now, for the sake of completeness, I must ask a few more questions. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. I have never been… diagnosed. I work. I do not go to doctors. My father, his father… we work. We do not sit and talk about… feelings. We do. That is enough. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's…helpful. No prior medical history. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I told you, I work. No time for such things. Just… look at the tests. I have other things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Family history, then. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything at all?
PATIENT: Family? My family is… in Yemen. A long time ago. We do not talk about… such things. It is not important. They work. They… exist. This is pointless.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I understand. Limited information. But let me ask you about lifestyle factors then. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. It is bad for you. I need my lungs for work. Do you think I want to be weak and coughing all the time? That is foolish. Next question.
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes. With food. Not much. It is… relaxing after work. Maybe one or two small glasses. It helps me sleep. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, it is not inherently a problem. But I must ask. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No. I do not take anything. I work hard and eat. That is enough. Is that all? I really must go.
DOCTOR: Just a few more basic questions, then we can finish this. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I don’t think so. Maybe…dust? Sometimes when I am cleaning the machines at work I sneeze. But that is normal, no? Everyone sneezes. Is that it now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. Very well. Let’s move on to a quick physical examination. It will be brief, given the limited information you’ve provided. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and a quick palpation of your abdomen. If you could please lie down on the table, we can proceed.
PATIENT: Hurry, please. This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are normal, regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation, although slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Could be normal variation, could indicate some chronic exposure at work. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Reflexes are normal, 2+ bilaterally. Well, Mr. Barban, physically, you appear…stable. However, given your lack of medical history, the slightly diminished breath sounds, and your work environment, I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung issues. It’s a precautionary measure. I will write an order for that now.
PATIENT: A… what? An X-ray? Why? I told you, I am fine. This is ridiculous. You are trying to find something that is not there. I do not want an X-ray. It is a waste of money and time. Just… give me a paper saying I am healthy and let me go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your reluctance, but I am obligated to provide reasonable care, and that includes investigating potential risks. Your work environment presents inherent respiratory hazards. A chest X-ray is a standard diagnostic procedure. It’s not about finding something that isn’t there, it’s about confirming that everything is as it should be. I’m not simply ordering tests arbitrarily. It’s a prudent step, especially given your limited medical history and the diminished breath sounds I detected during the examination. I strongly recommend you consider it. Refusing medical advice could have consequences. However, if you absolutely refuse, I will document your refusal in your chart. But I must advise you against it. I can refer you to a pulmonologist for a second opinion if you wish.
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I do not want a…pulmonologist. I do not want anything. I told you, I am fine. You are trying to scare me, to make money. I do not trust you. Just give me the paper. Say I am healthy. I need to go to work. This is a waste of my time and yours. Stupid doctors… always trying to find something…
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your frustration, but I cannot in good conscience discharge you with a clean bill of health without addressing these concerns. Documenting your refusal is the only ethical course of action. Here is a summary of your visit, including my findings and your explicit refusal of the chest X-ray and referral to a pulmonologist. Please review and sign it. I also strongly urge you to consider the importance of preventative care and to seek medical attention if you experience any changes in your health, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or persistent cough. You are free to leave now. But please, take care of yourself. And consider that sometimes, seeking help is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.
PATIENT: There. Happy? Now, I am leaving.
