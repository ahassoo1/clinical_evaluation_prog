DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Burlingham. It’s very kind of you to see me. I requested a general wellness check – a full lab panel, if you will. Just wanting to keep an eye on things, you understand. At my age, one wants to be… proactive.
DOCTOR: Proactive, yes, well, that's... sensible. Though, frankly, most people your age are just chasing after every ache and pain. Still, a check-up is a check-up. Let's get some basics down first. You said general wellness, so I'll need to ask a few questions. Now, have you been feeling alright generally?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, quite alright, thank you. No complaints, truly. I sleep well, eat reasonably well – my wife is a fantastic cook, you see – and I maintain a moderate level of activity. I still do some light work with my construction crew, though not as much as I once did. No sudden changes, no worrying symptoms. Just… a desire to know everything is as it should be.
DOCTOR: Right, "everything is as it should be." Always the optimists, aren't we?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, after seventy-four years, one tends to appreciate the good things. And proactively ensuring one continues to appreciate them seems… prudent, wouldn't you say? Though, I confess, I worry I sound like a bothersome old man.
DOCTOR: Bothersome is a strong word, Mr. Mombrun. Let’s just say some people have a… heightened sense of anxiety. Now, let's try to be useful with this visit. You mentioned light work in construction. Anything strenuous?
PATIENT: “Strenuous” is relative, Doctor. It's mostly lifting and carrying – nothing above, say, fifty pounds regularly. Some bending and kneeling, of course. We’re mainly doing finish work these days – installing drywall, trim, that sort of thing. Nothing like the heavy lifting I did when I was a younger man, building the foundations and framing. It's certainly not pushing my limits. I take breaks when I need them, and I’m careful not to overexert myself. My foreman is very accommodating, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Accommodating... good. Alright, let’s get your medical history then. Any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Let me see… As a child, I had the usual things – measles, mumps, chickenpox. Nothing serious. In my early thirties, I had a rather unpleasant bout of pneumonia, but recovered fully. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about fifteen years ago, but it’s been well-managed with medication ever since. And, ah, I had my appendix removed when I was in my early twenties. Beyond that… nothing significant, to my recollection. I’ve been fortunate, truly. I do have a touch of arthritis in my knees, but it’s manageable with over-the-counter remedies and occasional physical therapy. Do you need a more detailed list, Doctor? I have all my records at home, if necessary.
DOCTOR: “Fortunate” is… a matter of perspective. High blood pressure is significant, Mr. Mombrun. And arthritis, even if managed, still needs documenting. Let’s focus on the blood pressure for now. What medication are you currently taking for it?
PATIENT: You are quite right, Doctor. It is important to be thorough. I am taking Lisinopril, twenty milligrams daily. I’ve been on it for about twelve years now. My previous physician, Dr. Alvarez, adjusted the dosage a few times to find the right level. It seems to be working quite well, as my blood pressure readings have been consistently within the normal range for the past several years. I check it regularly at home with a digital monitor, you see. I believe I have a log of my readings somewhere in my briefcase, if you would like to review them.
DOCTOR: A log. Yes, well. Most people just tell me their readings. And those home monitors aren’t always reliable, you know. Alright, Lisinopril. Any other medications?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just the occasional ibuprofen for my arthritis, Doctor. Perhaps once or twice a month, when the pain is particularly bothersome. And a multivitamin daily, a general health supplement. Nothing else, truly. I avoid taking unnecessary medications whenever possible, you see. I prefer a natural approach to health, whenever feasible. My wife makes me herbal teas for various ailments, you know. Ginger for nausea, chamomile for sleep… that sort of thing. She’s quite knowledgeable about natural remedies.
DOCTOR: Herbal teas. Right. Now, let's get to the family history. Anything of note?
PATIENT: My father… he had heart disease, Doctor. He passed away when he was seventy-two, a heart attack, unfortunately. My mother lived to be eighty-nine, though she suffered from diabetes in her later years. I have one sister, she’s quite healthy, as far as I know, living in Venezuela. No history of cancer on either side of the family, thankfully. My wife’s family… her mother had high blood pressure as well, and her father had arthritis. So, a bit of a pattern, you see. Is there anything specific you’re looking for, Doctor? Perhaps I should have brought my family tree… I do have one, meticulously documented, going back several generations.
DOCTOR: A meticulous family tree. Of course. Alright, so heart disease in your father, diabetes in your mother, and some arthritis. It seems you come from a… predisposed family. Now, how about allergies?
PATIENT: Predisposed, yes, that would be a fair assessment. As for allergies… none, thankfully. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I’ve never needed an antihistamine or an epinephrine pen, or anything of that sort. I can eat shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, all of it. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, you see. My sister, on the other hand, is allergic to pollen. A terrible affliction, she says. She has to take medication every spring. But I, thankfully, am immune to all such inconveniences. Is there anything else, Doctor? Perhaps you have a list of common allergies you'd like me to run through? I'm happy to do so, if it would be helpful.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Mombrun, a list isn't necessary. Alright. Last thing for now. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have, never will. I find the habit… distasteful. And as for alcohol… I enjoy a glass of red wine with dinner on occasion. Perhaps two or three times a week. Nothing excessive, you understand. A small indulgence. My wife and I enjoy it with our meals. It's a Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon, a rather pleasant vintage. But I assure you, it’s merely a social enjoyment, not a habit. I maintain a moderate lifestyle, you see. Everything in moderation. Is that satisfactory, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Satisfactory. Now, let’s move on to the physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths now. In… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly… muffled. Lungs are clear, no wheezing. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not alarming. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No masses. Reflexes are normal. Ears are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your feet. Good circulation, but some mild swelling in the ankles. It's probably just from standing too long. Alright. That’s all for now.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That was… thorough. The swelling in my ankles, yes, that’s not unusual. I’m on my feet quite a bit at work, as you know. And the weather has been rather warm lately, which doesn’t help. Is there anything concerning about the muffled heart sounds, Doctor? Or the slightly elevated blood pressure? Should I be adjusting my medication dosage, perhaps? Or limiting my red wine consumption? I’m happy to make adjustments, you understand. I just want to ensure I remain in good health. It's a priority, you see.
DOCTOR: The muffled heart sounds… it's likely nothing, Mr. Mombrun. It could be a number of things. And the blood pressure, it's not significantly elevated. But we should run some blood tests just to be sure. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, lipid panel, and an EKG. Just to get a baseline. And maybe a urine analysis. I'll order those for you now. And I suggest you monitor your blood pressure at home more closely for a week and keep a log. And… yes, perhaps cut back on the red wine just a little. It won't hurt.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A complete panel, an EKG, and a urine analysis. And more diligent blood pressure monitoring, along with a reduction in my red wine intake. I shall do so. I appreciate your thoroughness. It puts my mind at ease, you see. When can I expect the results, Doctor? And will you need another appointment to discuss them? I’m quite flexible with my schedule. I want to be proactive, you understand. I just want to ensure everything is as it should be.
DOCTOR: The results will take about a week. The lab usually sends them directly to my office. Then my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Unless something urgent comes up, there’s no need to rush. For now, just try to relax, Mr. Mombrun. And remember what I said about the red wine. And the blood pressure monitoring. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time and your expertise. And thank you for addressing my concerns. I appreciate your patience and your thorough approach. I shall await my nurse’s call and diligently follow your instructions. One last thing, Doctor… is there anything I should be concerned about specifically, given my family history? Anything I should be watching out for? Perhaps a particular symptom or change in my body that warrants immediate attention? I just want to be prepared, you see. And ensure I remain in good health. .
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Mombrun, you're perfectly capable of reading WebMD. Don’t bother me with every minor ache and pain. But if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or sudden weakness on one side of your body, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just follow the instructions, and we’ll see what the tests say. Have a good day. And try not to worry so much. And Mr. Mombrun?
