DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I requested to come in... about getting tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, and I thought it was best to just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a very sensible thing to do. It’s good you’re taking charge of your health. Before we proceed with the testing, can you tell me a little bit about why you're wanting to get tested now?
PATIENT: Hm. Well, it's… a bit difficult to talk about, honestly. My husband and I... we haven't always been the most careful, shall we say. And it's been a few years since we last spoke about it. I just want to be sure, for both our sakes. It would give me peace of mind, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It takes courage to discuss these things, and you’re doing the right thing by addressing it. No judgment here at all. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me roughly when you last had unprotected sex?
PATIENT: Let me think... It must have been... oh, around six months ago, perhaps? It wasn't a planned thing, and we didn't... use anything. It was a moment of weakness, if I'm being honest. It's been a long time, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. Six months ago is important to know. Now, have either you or your husband experienced any symptoms that have concerned you – things like fever, fatigue, weight loss, swollen lymph nodes, or any unusual rashes or skin changes?
PATIENT: No, not really. We both feel quite healthy, thankfully. My husband hasn't mentioned anything, and I haven't noticed anything different about myself either. I do get tired sometimes, but I put that down to my age and the job... standing all day, you know? Nothing that would make me think of anything serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't been to the doctor in a while, to be truthful. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older. My blood pressure is sometimes a little high, but nothing a bit of salt reduction hasn't helped. I’m not on any regular medication, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had a blood transfusion, or shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve certainly never shared needles, and I’ve only ever had blood taken when a doctor has requested it. I’ve never needed a transfusion, thankfully. I hope that’s not a common question?
DOCTOR: No, it's standard protocol – just covering all the bases. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no. I eat everything, really. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. My husband always jokes I have a cast-iron stomach! Nothing I need to tell you about, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. So, to recap, you’re here for HIV testing due to a potential exposure six months ago, you’re generally healthy with no known allergies or medical conditions, and you’ve never had a blood transfusion or shared needles. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is absolutely correct, Doctor. You've summarised it perfectly. I appreciate you taking the time to ask all those questions. It makes me feel... more comfortable, knowing you're being thorough.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, we have a few options for testing. We can do a standard blood test, which can take a few days to get the results back. Or, we can do a rapid test in the clinic today, but it might not be as accurate if it's been exactly six months. Given your exposure was six months ago, the standard blood test is probably the best option. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. If you think the standard test is best, then I trust your judgement. A few days is perfectly fine. I'd rather have accurate results than a quick answer, if you know what I mean. So, what happens next? Do I need to fast or anything?
DOCTOR: No fasting is required. I’ll just need to draw a small sample of blood from your arm. We'll send it to the lab, and I'll give you a call as soon as the results are back – usually within three to five business days. Before I order the test, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very well. Three to five days is fine. It’s… a relief, actually, to finally be getting this done. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I don't believe I have any further questions at the moment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, I’m ordering the blood test now. I'll need you to fill out this consent form, just confirming you understand the testing procedure and that your results will be kept confidential. And here’s a form for your insurance information, though you mentioned you are uninsured – we can discuss payment options afterwards. Do you have a pen?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Here you are. Uninsured, yes. I haven't been able to afford it for a while now, unfortunately. We’re managing, but it’s always a worry. I’m happy to discuss the payment options whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, take your time with the form. Once you've completed it, just let me know, and I'll call a nurse to draw your blood. It'll only take a few minutes. After that, you're free to go.
PATIENT: I think I've completed it to the best of my ability. It asked about a lot of things, but I answered everything I could. Please let me know if anything is missing. And thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. This looks perfect. I'll just make a note of your contact number. Now, I'll call Nurse Davies to come in and draw your blood. She's very gentle, and it won't take long. Just relax, and try not to worry. "Davies, could you come to exam room three for a blood draw, please?
PATIENT: Very good, thank you. I think I will just… sit here and try to relax, as you suggested. I do tend to worry a bit, to be honest. But I feel much better having taken this step.
