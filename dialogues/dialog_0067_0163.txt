DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Pfennig. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure. Well, it’s about a rather…enthusiastic dietary approach I’ve been attempting. Perhaps “attempting” is too strong a word. More like…considering, then briefly experimenting with. It’s all a bit silly when I think about it, really. I suppose I’d like your opinion on whether it’s doing me more harm than good.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're thinking critically about it and coming to me. "Enthusiastic dietary approaches" can sometimes be a little more complicated than they seem. Can you tell me a bit more about what you've been trying?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's called the “Moon Phase Diet.” Rather fanciful, isn’t it? The idea is you eat only certain foods depending on the phase of the moon. New moon – root vegetables, waxing crescent – leafy greens, and so on. It’s all very…precise. A friend of my granddaughter suggested it. She’s quite taken with…alternative wellness practices, let’s say. I thought, well, it can’t hurt to try it. Though, after a week, I find myself rather restricted, and missing a good Sunday roast, I must confess.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is…a specific approach. And it’s wise to be cautious, even if something seems harmless. It sounds like it’s certainly changing your usual eating habits. Besides missing your Sunday roast – which is perfectly valid! – have you noticed any other effects since starting the diet?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. Initially, there was a certain… lightness, I suppose. A feeling of purging, perhaps. Though that could simply be the relief of not indulging in quite so much rich food. However, I’ve found my energy levels have been… uneven, shall we say? One day I feel quite sprightly, the next I’m flagging by mid-afternoon. And, rather embarrassingly, my… regularity has been somewhat disrupted. It’s not a comfortable topic, I know, but it’s a fact nonetheless. I haven’t lost any weight, which is rather disappointing, considering the restrictions. And I do find myself rather preoccupied with the lunar calendar, which is a bit ridiculous for a man of my age.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Mr. Vantine. It’s very helpful to get a full picture. Those are all important things to consider – the initial feeling of “purging” could be related to changes in your fiber intake, and the uneven energy levels and changes in regularity are definitely things we want to look into. It's good you're aware of the preoccupation with the calendar as well. Before we discuss this further, could you tell me a bit about your usual diet before starting the Moon Phase Diet?
PATIENT: Certainly. My usual diet…well, it's fairly traditional English fare, I suppose. I enjoy a good breakfast – porridge in the winter, toast and eggs in the summer. Lunch is often a sandwich, perhaps with a bit of salad. But dinner is where I indulge. I rather enjoy a roast on a Sunday, as I mentioned. Otherwise, it’s typically meat and vegetables, perhaps with potatoes or rice. I do enjoy a pudding afterwards – trifle, or crumble, something along those lines. I’m not a huge fan of fish, I must confess, and I don’t eat a great deal of poultry. Red meat is my preference. And I do enjoy a glass of sherry with dinner, and perhaps a small brandy afterwards. I wouldn't say I overindulge, but I certainly don’t deny myself. I’ve always been a fairly active man, despite my age, so I’ve never been overly concerned with restricting my diet. Until now, of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s very helpful. So, a fairly typical diet for someone with your background and activity level, with a preference for red meat and enjoying occasional indulgences. It sounds like the Moon Phase Diet is a fairly significant departure from your usual eating habits. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been remarkably healthy, thankfully. I had a bout of pneumonia some years ago, but I made a full recovery. My doctor, a Dr. Abernathy, used to say I was “built like a brick outhouse.” He retired some years ago, I’m afraid. I have a touch of arthritis in my knees, which is to be expected at my age, but it’s not particularly troublesome. I take a mild pain reliever when needed, but that’s all. I have regular check-ups with my current doctor, Dr. Finch, and she’s always been very pleased with my overall health. I had my cholesterol checked last year, and it was slightly elevated, but not concerning enough to require medication, she said. And, of course, my eyesight isn't what it used to be, hence the spectacles. But overall, I’d say I’m in remarkably good health for a man of eighty-five.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Vantine. It sounds like you’ve been very fortunate with your health. And it’s good you have a regular check-up with Dr. Finch. Slightly elevated cholesterol is common, and we can certainly discuss that further if you’d like. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, nothing of the sort. I've always prided myself on avoiding hospitals, if I'm honest. A broken arm as a boy, falling out of a tree, but that was many, many years ago. A local doctor set it, and it healed perfectly well. Apart from that, I’ve been remarkably fortunate. I’ve always been careful, I suppose. Not one for risky activities, and I’ve always taken care to maintain a reasonable level of fitness. I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees aren’t up to it these days. It's a shame, really. But I still manage a bit of walking, when the weather permits. And I enjoy reading, which keeps the mind active, if nothing else. But no surgeries, no prolonged hospital stays, thankfully. I've always considered myself rather lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Mr. Vantine. A history of avoiding significant medical interventions is certainly a positive thing. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My father… he suffered from heart problems in his later years. He was a smoker, unfortunately, and didn't take very good care of himself. He passed away at the age of seventy-two, from a heart attack. My mother… she lived to a good age, eighty-nine, but she had diabetes towards the end of her life. It was fairly well-controlled, but it did cause her some discomfort. And my sister… she was diagnosed with breast cancer in her fifties, but she responded well to treatment and lived for many years afterwards. So, yes, there's a history of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer in the family, unfortunately. Which is why I try to maintain a reasonable level of health, despite my fondness for a good roast. I suppose it's something to be mindful of, if nothing else.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's important information, Mr. Vantine. A family history of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer does increase your risk, so it’s good you’re aware of that. And it’s understandable that you try to maintain a healthy lifestyle despite your enjoyment of certain foods. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've always been remarkably fortunate in that regard as well. I've never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat pretty much anything without any ill effects. I've never been stung by a bee, thankfully, and I've never had any problems with pollen or dust. I've always considered myself quite resilient, if I'm honest. My wife, God rest her soul, was allergic to shellfish, but I never shared her aversion. So, no allergies to report, thankfully. Just a fondness for a good pudding, and a slight preoccupation with the lunar calendar at the moment.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Vantine. No known allergies is certainly a positive thing. And I understand the preoccupation with the lunar calendar – it sounds like you’ve been doing a lot of thinking about your diet lately! Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the mild pain reliever for my knees, as I mentioned. Paracetamol, usually. I take it only when needed, perhaps a couple of times a week, if my knees are particularly troublesome. And occasionally, I’ll take a multivitamin, but it’s not a regular occurrence. Other than that, no medications, no supplements, nothing at all. I’ve always preferred a natural approach to health, if possible. And I’m rather skeptical of these miracle cures and dietary fads. Which is why I’m here, I suppose, questioning the wisdom of this Moon Phase Diet.
DOCTOR: Very good. So, just paracetamol as needed for your knees, and occasional multivitamins. That’s helpful to know. Now, I think we have a pretty good understanding of your background and medical history. Let’s talk a bit more about this Moon Phase Diet and how it’s affecting you. You mentioned uneven energy levels and changes in your regularity. Can you describe those symptoms in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Certainly. The energy levels…they fluctuate quite dramatically. One day I feel perfectly sprightly, capable of a brisk walk, perhaps even a bit of gardening. The next, I'm feeling rather sluggish, needing a nap by mid-afternoon. It's very unpredictable, and rather unsettling, if I'm honest. I've always been a man of routine, and this inconsistency is throwing me off balance. As for the regularity…well, let's just say it's not what it used to be. Some days it's perfectly normal, others it's… considerably delayed. And, if I'm being perfectly frank, it’s accompanied by a degree of discomfort. It’s not painful, but it’s certainly not pleasant. And, of course, it’s causing me a degree of anxiety, if I'm being honest. It's a rather undignified topic, I know, but I feel it's important to be candid.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so candid, Mr. Vantine. It's very important to be open about these things, and you're absolutely right to mention them. Fluctuating energy levels and changes in regularity are definitely things we need to investigate. It sounds like this diet is disrupting your usual bodily functions. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and considering your family history, I’m a bit concerned about the potential for nutritional deficiencies and the impact on your digestive health. The Moon Phase Diet, while perhaps not inherently harmful, is certainly restrictive and may not be providing you with all the nutrients you need. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us check your vitamin levels, assess your digestive function, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. I wouldn't want to ignore anything that might be causing these symptoms. And you're right, this diet is rather restrictive, and I've been wondering whether I'm missing out on essential nutrients. Blood tests sound like a good idea. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I’ve always believed in a thorough assessment before embarking on any course of action. And, frankly, I’m rather looking forward to getting back to a more normal diet.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll just enter the orders for the blood tests now. They’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, thyroid function, vitamin D and B12 levels, and a few other key markers. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will give you a requisition form. You’ll need to fast for eight hours before the test, so you may want to schedule it for tomorrow morning. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend stopping the Moon Phase Diet and returning to your usual eating habits. And I'd suggest focusing on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or the recommendations?
PATIENT: No, that sounds perfectly clear, Doctor. Fasting for eight hours, stop the diet, balanced eating… all very sensible. I’m quite happy to comply. And I daresay my wife would be pleased to hear I’m returning to a more normal diet. She always insisted on a good Sunday roast. I don't think I have any questions at the moment. I’m quite confident in your advice. Just let me know when the results are available, and we can discuss them. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. It’s reassuring to be in such capable hands.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. I’m glad I could reassure you. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once the results are back – typically within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, or significant weight loss – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful, and I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I feel much more reassured now. I shall contact the clinic if anything changes, and I look forward to discussing the results with you. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
