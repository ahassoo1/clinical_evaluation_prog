DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they're still going. It's…well, it's been over 48 hours now, I think. It’s very annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Hiccups that persist for that long can be quite bothersome, Ms. Redeye. Over 48 hours, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It started…let me think…Tuesday, I believe. And it’s not like little ones, either. These are big hiccups. I even tried holding my breath, like everyone says, but that didn’t do a thing. And drinking water quickly didn't help either, surprisingly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the hiccups, or anything that makes them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I haven't really noticed a specific trigger, no. I was gardening on Tuesday, maybe that? But I garden all the time and never get hiccups. I was a little stressed with getting ready for my niece’s birthday party this weekend, but I didn't think that would cause hiccups. I ate a pretty normal lunch, nothing unusual. Honestly, they just…started. It was right after I finished talking to my sister on the phone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no specific food, activity, or stressor that immediately preceded the onset. And you said they began shortly after a phone call with your sister?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. We were talking about…well, it wasn’t bad news, just planning the party and she was getting a little frantic about everything. It’s her first time hosting a big one, you see. I was just trying to calm her down, really. Maybe I was talking a lot? I don't know. It sounds silly, doesn't it? Getting hiccups from a phone call.
DOCTOR: Not at all silly, Ms. Redeye. The body can react in unexpected ways to stress, even seemingly minor stress. We'll explore all possibilities. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the hiccups. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no stomach trouble. I'm eating normally, drinking normally. Sleeping alright, though they do wake me up sometimes, naturally. I haven't felt feverish or anything like that. Just…hiccups. Persistent, annoying hiccups.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no associated symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fever… that's good. And they’re impacting your sleep, but otherwise, your normal functions are intact. Now, let's go over some medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see…I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was all routine. No major illnesses, no surgeries besides that. I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication – a small dose, nothing serious. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, considering.
DOCTOR: Okay, cholecystectomy ten years ago, and managed hypertension. Do you recall the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it's… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. I've been on it for about five years now. And I take it every morning, like clockwork.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything, and never had a reaction. My sister is very allergic to shellfish, but that's not me. I've never had an issue with any medication either.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members with significant medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, type 2, and my father had heart problems later in life, needed a stent, I think. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. And my sister, well, besides her shellfish allergy, she's okay too. Nothing major on either side of the family, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of diabetes in your mother and heart disease in your father. Now, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke, never have. And I very rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. Not a drinker at all, really. I prefer tea, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very limited alcohol consumption. Now, Ms. Redeye, before I perform a brief physical exam, is there anything else at all you think might be relevant?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, I can't think of anything else. I really don’t. It’s just these hiccups. They're so frustrating! I feel like I've tried everything on the internet, you know? Holding my breath, drinking water, sugar, vinegar… nothing works. It’s starting to worry me, I suppose. That's why I came in.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Redeye. It's good you came in. Persistent hiccups, as you said, can be concerning, and it's best to rule out any underlying causes. Let's just do a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and a brief abdominal exam. It shouldn't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I'm ready. Hopefully, you can figure out what's going on with these pesky hiccups.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Redeye. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope, and then I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just try to breathe normally, if you can, despite the hiccups. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No masses palpated. You do flinch a little when I press here, on your left side… any pain there specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A little bit, when you press there. Not sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. It’s not constant, just when you push. And I didn’t even really notice it before the hiccups started, to be honest. It’s very mild.
DOCTOR: Alright, so mild tenderness on the left side. It's not radiating anywhere?
PATIENT: No, it doesn't go anywhere. Just… there. It’s funny, I never even thought about it. I guess I’m so used to little aches and pains at my age, I just ignore them. But you’re right, it is a little uncomfortable when you press on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Redeye. Thank you. Based on the exam, and given the persistence of the hiccups and the mild tenderness in your left side, I'm going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. It’s possible this is just a prolonged case of hiccups, but we need to rule out any underlying causes, like inflammation or irritation in the diaphragm or an electrolyte imbalance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m just glad you’re taking it seriously. The hiccups are driving me mad! An X-ray and blood work… alright. Where do I go to get those done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Redeye. I’ve just sent the orders to the lab and radiology department, which are located just down the hall. The receptionist will be able to direct you. The lab work should only take about 30 minutes to an hour, and the X-ray shouldn't take much longer. The results typically come back within 24 to 48 hours. Once they’re back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if the hiccups become excruciatingly painful, or if you develop any shortness of breath or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that's very clear. 24 to 48 hours for the results… and go to the emergency room if things get worse. I understand. Thank you, Doctor Chagaris. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. We'll get to the bottom of this. And please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here is a printed copy of the orders, and the contact number for the clinic. I’ll see you then.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. Have a good day. .
