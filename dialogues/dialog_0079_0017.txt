DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. I see you're here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, well, I’m here for… a check-up. For the… team. A sports team. It’s… important. I need to be cleared to… try out. Though, I can’t rightly remember which team just now. It’s one of them. You know. A team.
DOCTOR: A team, yes. Of course. And how old are you, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Fifty-one. Though I feel… younger. Much younger, on some days. It's hard to keep track, you know? Time just… goes. Fifty-one, though. That's what the lady at the office said.
DOCTOR: I see here you are 51 years of age. And are you experiencing any specific concerns that prompted this check-up, besides needing clearance for this… team?
PATIENT: Concerns? No, not really. I feel… okay. A little winded sometimes, maybe. But that’s just… getting older. And I used to be… quite the athlete. So, you know, a little bit of rust, I suppose. Nothing a good tryout won't fix. I wouldn’t be here if there was a problem, would I?
DOCTOR: Of course. Still, a thorough examination is standard procedure, Mr. Bartok, particularly given your age and desire to participate in athletics. Let’s begin with a brief review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? Hmm. The doctor… a long time ago… said something about my… pressure. But I don’t recall exactly what he said. Something about… watching what I eat. I think. I don’t take any pills for it, if that means anything. My ex-wife… she always worried too much. She was always on my case about something or other. I’m generally a healthy fella.
DOCTOR: "Generally healthy" is good to hear, but we need specifics, Mr. Bartok. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… there was… a time. A long time ago. When I was younger. A… a football injury, I think? I broke… something. My… arm, maybe? It was fixed, though. They fixed it. It doesn't bother me now. A long time ago. Really. I don't remember the details. It’s all a bit hazy, you see?
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Not much family left, to be honest. My… ex-wife’s side is… complicated. My own… parents are gone now. A long time ago. I had a brother… maybe? I think. But we didn’t… keep in touch. He was always getting into trouble. It's best not to dwell on it, you see? Doesn’t do any good. What do you need to know about them, exactly?
DOCTOR: Let's move on to allergies, Mr. Bartok. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Used to. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything. Though… my skin gets a little itchy sometimes. But that’s just the… heat, I reckon. Puerto Rico gets awfully humid, you see. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. None at all. Really.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No, sir. Not a one. I don’t believe in all those… pills. They just make you feel worse, in my opinion. I prefer to… let nature take its course. I eat healthy, when I can. That’s all you need. No pills, no nothing. I’m a natural man, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to… adjust anything. My balance isn't what it used to be. Though, I'm still pretty quick on my feet. For an old guy, that is.
DOCTOR: 124 pounds. And your height is listed as 5’5”. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Please remain still and try to relax.
PATIENT: Relax? Easy for you to say, Doctor. I’m a little nervous, to be honest. Hoping I can get cleared for this team… Alright, alright, just get it over with. I’m ready. Though, it’s a little tight, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 150/90. That’s… elevated, Mr. Bartok. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that… bad? I told you I get a little nervous. It’s probably just that. Deep breaths… like this? Is something wrong, Doctor? You’re awfully quiet over there…
DOCTOR: I'm detecting a slight murmur, Mr. Bartok. And your breathing sounds a little… wheezy. Have you experienced any shortness of breath or chest pain recently?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath…? Well, I get a little winded sometimes, like I said. But that’s just… being out of shape. And chest pain…? Not exactly pain. More like… a tightness. A little squeeze. But it comes and goes. It doesn't bother me too much. Old age, you know? Things start to… creak. Is it serious, Doctor? Am I still able to try out for the team? That’s the important part, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, your blood pressure is significantly elevated, and I’m detecting a heart murmur and some wheezing. These findings require further investigation before I can clear you for any strenuous physical activity. I'm concerned about the possibility of underlying cardiovascular issues. I recommend a complete blood workup, an EKG, and a consultation with a cardiologist. I'm going to write you a referral order now.
PATIENT: A… cardiologist? What’s a cardiologist? And blood work…? That sounds… unpleasant. Look, Doctor, I just need you to sign the form so I can try out for the team! This is very important to me! I don't have time for all these… tests and… doctors! Can't you just… look at me and tell me I'm okay? It's just a team, you see! It’s not like I’m running a marathon!
