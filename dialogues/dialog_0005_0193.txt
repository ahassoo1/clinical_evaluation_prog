DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. So, you’re here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… a bit embarrassing, truly. I have… much gas. More than usual, you understand? It is… uncomfortable. And sometimes… loud. It started, I believe, about one week ago. I eat normally, nothing changed in my diet that I am aware of.
DOCTOR: Gas, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Quite a lot of it. It does not… hurt, exactly. But it is… disruptive. And I worry, you see? Is it something serious? My mother… she always worried about everything. Perhaps it is a family trait. I do have Medicare, if that is important.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Goodstein, excessive gas can be caused by a number of things. It’s rarely serious, but we need to rule things out. Disruptive is… a good way to put it, I suppose. Now, tell me, when you say "normal" eating… what does that consist of in a typical day?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, a typical day. Let me think. For breakfast, usually toast with a little jam. Sometimes an egg, if I am feeling… energetic. Lunch is often a sandwich - ham and cheese, usually. And dinner… well, dinner varies. Perhaps some chicken, or potatoes. I do enjoy a good potato. And I drink water, of course. Plenty of water. Not much soda, you see. It is bad for the teeth, my mother always said.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major changes in diet… toast, sandwiches, chicken, potatoes… water. And no soda, good for you. Any recent travel?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No travel at all. I have not left the city in… oh, it must be five years now. I do not… care much for travel, truly. It seems… stressful. And expensive. I prefer to stay close to home, where things are familiar. It is much easier, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the gas?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me consider. No pain, as I mentioned. No… changes in my bowel habits, if you understand. No fever, no nausea. I have been… a little tired, perhaps? But I am always a little tired. It is the summer heat, I think. And I have been sleeping… normally. Perhaps a little restless, but nothing significant. Oh! And… sometimes a little bit of heartburn after dinner. But that is not new. It happens sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no real changes in bowel habits, no fever, no nausea. A little tired, restless sleep, and occasional heartburn... That heartburn, is that frequent?
PATIENT: Not frequent, Doctor. Perhaps once or twice a week. It is… mild. I take a little something for it, an over-the-counter tablet. It usually helps. It is just… another thing. I did not think it was important, truly. It is nothing compared to this… this gas situation. It is quite embarrassing, you understand? Especially in public.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, just to be thorough. I'll listen to your abdomen. Then we'll discuss some possibilities. Just lie back on the table, please.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you think it is best. I hope it will not be too… unpleasant. I am not used to doctors, you see. I try to avoid them, truly. But I do appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your abdomen sounds… active. A bit of rumbling, which isn’t unexpected with the gas. No tenderness, no masses. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants. Heart rate and blood pressure are normal. Now, sometimes, gas can be caused by something as simple as swallowing too much air – eating too quickly, chewing gum, things like that. Do any of those apply to you?
PATIENT: Swallowing air… Hmm. I do eat rather quickly, if I am honest. I do not have much time for leisurely meals, you see. And I… I do enjoy chewing gum sometimes. It keeps my mouth busy. Perhaps that is it? It seems… a simple solution, if that is all. A bit silly, truly, to be worried about gas caused by chewing gum.
DOCTOR: It is often something simple, Mr. Goodstein. It’s good you’re observant. Let’s try eliminating those things for a week. Slow down your eating, and cut out the gum. If it doesn't improve, we can consider other possibilities, but let's start with the easiest changes. Any questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. Slow down my eating, no gum. I can certainly try that. It is a small price to pay, truly, if it solves the problem. I do appreciate your help. And your patience. It is… embarrassing to discuss such things. I thank you kindly.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Goodstein. Don’t hesitate to call if it doesn’t improve or gets worse. Otherwise, I’ll see you back here in a month if needed. Try not to worry about it. A lot of people experience this.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will do as you say. Slow down my eating, no gum. And I will call if things… worsen. Thank you again for your time and consideration. I wish you a good day.
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Mr. Goodstein.
PATIENT: .
