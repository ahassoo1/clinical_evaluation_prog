DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 59 years of age. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, Sasha Queener, that's me. Um… it’s my leg. It’s been… swelling. After the cancer treatments, you see. It’s not painful painful, just… big. It's mostly my right leg, I think. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Queener, that is helpful. You mentioned cancer treatments. Could you elaborate on what type of cancer you were treated for, and when those treatments concluded?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it was… breast cancer. A few years ago now. Let me think… the last treatment was… March of last year, I believe? It was a lot of… things. Pills, and… the machine. Radiation, was it? It all kind of blurs together after a while, you know? It was at the city hospital. They were very nice. Does that help? I don't remember all the details, sorry.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… adequate. And you said the swelling started after the treatments ended?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. It didn’t bother me during… all of that. It started a few months after, I think. Maybe… around November? It was slow at first, just a little puffiness. Now it’s… well, you can see! It’s my right leg mostly, but sometimes the other one feels a bit… thick too. It's worrying me a little bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this swelling been consistently increasing since November, or has it fluctuated?
PATIENT: Oh… fluctuating, yes! That’s a good word. It’s better some days, worse others. If I… sit with it up, it goes down a little bit. But if I stand for too long… or walk too much… it gets bigger again. It’s not constant, you see? It's not like it just keeps getting bigger and bigger every day. It just… depends. I try to rest it when it gets bad.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any other symptoms with this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think… Not really pain, like I said. Sometimes it feels… heavy? Like it's hard to lift it. And… my skin feels a little bit tight. Not itchy, just… different. Oh! And sometimes I feel… a little tired. But I always feel a little tired, to be honest. Is that what you mean? It's hard to say what's from the swelling and what's just… me.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes in the skin color of your right leg?
PATIENT: Oh, color… hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t think so. Maybe a little bit… red sometimes? But I'm not very good at noticing those things. I put lotion on it every day, so it’s usually… pinkish? I really don't know. It doesn’t look… purple or anything scary like that. Is that what you’re asking? I get a little worried sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Queener. I'm going to need to take a look at your leg. If you'll just lie down on the table, please. We'll start with a physical examination to assess the swelling and skin condition. I need to see it directly, and also check your pulses.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. This old leg isn’t as good as it used to be. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. Is it cold in here? I always feel cold.
DOCTOR: You may want to remove your pants on that leg and put on a gown. And no, the temperature is regulated. It's perfectly normal. Now, if you could lie on your back, please, and extend your right leg. I'll start by palpating your leg to assess the extent of the swelling and tenderness, and then I'll check the pulses in your foot. Please let me know if anything is uncomfortable. Hmm. There is definite pitting edema present, extending from the ankle to just below the knee. Skin temperature is within normal limits. Now, let me check the dorsalis pedis pulse… Pulse is present, but slightly diminished compared to the left. Capillary refill is approximately 3 seconds. The swelling is significant, and the diminished pulse is concerning. It's likely a post-thrombotic syndrome related to the cancer treatment, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your right leg to assess the blood flow.
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… serious. Doppler ultrasound? Is that… painful? Post-thrombotic… what was that? Something about blood? I thought the treatments were supposed to help me, not… cause this. Is it bad? Please tell me it’s not bad, Doctor. I'm getting a little scared now. And three seconds… is that a long time? I don't understand any of this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Queener, please try to remain calm. A Doppler ultrasound is non-invasive. It uses sound waves to create an image of the blood vessels in your leg. It won't cause any pain. Post-thrombotic syndrome means that a blood clot may have formed in your leg at some point, perhaps during or after your cancer treatment. Even if the clot has dissolved, it can sometimes leave behind damage to the veins, leading to swelling and other symptoms. A three-second capillary refill is slightly prolonged, which suggests that blood flow may not be optimal. It doesn't necessarily mean anything definitive, but it warrants further investigation. We're not jumping to conclusions here. The ultrasound will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. It's important to rule out a current blood clot, as that would be serious. I will also order a D-dimer test, which is a blood test that can help detect the presence of blood clots. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… clots. That sounds very bad. I remember reading about those. Okay, ultrasound and… D-dimer. Blood test. I understand… I think. It’s just… all of this is so much. And after everything I’ve been through… Will it hurt? Will I have to have more treatments? I don’t think I can go through more treatments. Is there anything else I should be worried about? I just want this leg to stop swelling. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Queener, I understand you’re anxious. However, it’s crucial to remain rational. We haven’t even confirmed anything yet. Jumping to conclusions won't help. The ultrasound and D-dimer are simply diagnostic tests. If a clot is detected, we’ll discuss treatment options, which may include blood thinners or compression therapy. I can assure you, we will explore all available options and prioritize your comfort. Right now, the most important thing is to get these tests done. I will write you a referral to the radiology department. They will schedule the ultrasound for you. And I will order the D-dimer test to be done here in the clinic today. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. Please refrain from speculating about worst-case scenarios until we have concrete information. Do you have any questions about scheduling the tests?
PATIENT: No… no, I don't think so. Just… where do I go? And do I need to… prepare in any way? I’m just… tired. I just want to go home. Scheduling. Right. Thank you, Doctor. I guess. .
DOCTOR: The radiology department is located at City General Hospital, on the third floor. You don't need to prepare in any way, just arrive 15 minutes early to fill out some paperwork. I’ll have the lab technician draw blood for the D-dimer test before you leave. I expect you to follow up with me once you have the results. Do not delay. Next patient.
