DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of me head, you know? Been botherin’ me for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head. And how long has this been bothering you, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started… maybe about three weeks ago now? Started kinda gradual, just a little ache, but it’s been gettin’ a bit worse each week, if I’m honest. Not terrible, but enough to notice, y’know?
DOCTOR: Alright, three weeks, starting gradually and worsening. And would you describe it as a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Not a constant throb, thank goodness. It’ll be quiet for a few hours, then it pops up again. Seems worse in the evenin’s, after I've been on me feet all day at the shop. That’s where I work, you see - doin’ nails. Lots of bendin’ and lookin’ down.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent, worse in the evenings after work. And you mentioned doing nails – so a lot of bending and looking down. Does changing positions, like standing up or lying down, affect the headache at all?
PATIENT: Yes, actually! Now that you mention it, standin’ up usually makes it a little bit better. Lyin’ down… not much change, to be honest. But definitely feelin’ it more when I’m bent over, workin’ on someone's hands or feet. It’s like a pressure buildin’ up, right at the base of me skull.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's positional – better standing, worse bending. And you describe it as a pressure at the base of your skull. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. No dizziness, no blurry vision, no nausea. Sometimes me neck feels a little stiff, but I figured that’s just from bendin’ over all day. No fever or anything like that either. Just the headache and a little bit of neck stiffness now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, vision changes, nausea, fever. Just the headache and occasional neck stiffness. Do you have any trouble with your memory lately, or any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness? No, not at all. Arms and legs are workin' just fine, thank you. I'm still able to hold me tools steady as a surgeon! And me memory is… well, I'm 87, Doctor! Things slip sometimes, but that’s just gettin’ old, nothin’ to do with the headache, I reckon. I can tell you what I had for breakfast this mornin’, and that was a while ago! Everything’s right where it should be, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No weakness, and you’re sharp as a tack. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, yes, a bit of that years ago. Doctor gave me some pills for it, but I haven’t been takin' them regularly lately. Just didn't seem to be botherin’ me, and I don’t like takin' too much medication if I can help it. Arthritis, too, in me hands, but it's not too bad. A little stiff sometimes, but nothin’ major. Other than that… nothin' really, not that I remember. I’ve been pretty lucky with me health, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure, not currently medicated, and some arthritis in your hands. And have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, I had me appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago now. And I had a cataract removed from me left eye maybe ten years ago, somethin’ like that. That went well, thankfully. Other than those two things, no surgeries. Nothing that I can recall, anyway. I’ve been very fortunate, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and cataract removal. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… Me mother, she had heart trouble later in life. Had to be careful what she ate. And me brother, he had a stroke maybe twenty years ago. Recovered alright, but he wasn't quite the same after that. Cancer… I think me aunt had somethin’… breast cancer, I believe. But other than that, nothin' really stands out. We weren’t really a family to talk much about illnesses, if I'm honest. More focused on livin' life, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements, besides the blood pressure pills you mentioned not taking regularly?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis cream, Doctor. Rub it on me hands a couple of times a day. That's it, really. No vitamins, no supplements… I try to eat a good diet, plenty of fruits and vegetables, and leave it at that. Don't really believe in fillin' me body with too much stuff it doesn't need. Just the cream for me hands, and that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, just arthritis cream. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had one in me life, thankfully. Can eat anything, touch anything, breathe anything… never had a reaction to nothin'. I’m a pretty simple man, I guess. Nothing bothers me, except maybe a rude customer now and then! But that's not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that wouldn’t be an allergy! Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright with you. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and taking a look at your neck and shoulders. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I haven’t got nothin’ to hide! Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Popova, everything seems fairly normal, but your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and I do feel some tenderness in the muscles at the back of your neck. It’s likely contributing to your headache. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by your work and slightly elevated blood pressure.
PATIENT: A tension headache, you say? That sounds about right. Lots of tension in me neck, workin’ all day bent over. So, what do I need to do about it, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? I don’t want to be worryin’ about it too much, you know. Just want to get back to me work, keepin’ me customers happy.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't sound like anything serious at all, Mr. Popova. Tension headaches are very common. We can manage it. I recommend a few things. First, let's address that blood pressure. I want you to try and monitor it at home, if possible. We can discuss medication if it remains consistently high. Second, let's focus on relieving that neck tension. I’m going to recommend some gentle stretching exercises, and I think a warm compress on your neck a few times a day would be helpful. We can also try an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Monitor me blood pressure, stretches, warm compress… I can do all of that. I've got a bit of a knack for rememberin' things, so I’m sure I can keep up with it. What kind of stretches do you recommend? And how often should I be doin’ ‘em? Don’t want to overdo it, you know. And ibuprofen... that’s the one for aches and pains, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, ibuprofen is for aches and pains. As for the stretches, let's start with simple neck rotations – gently turning your head from side to side, and tilting your ear towards your shoulder. Hold each stretch for about 20-30 seconds, and repeat 10 times on each side. Also, try chin tucks – gently pulling your chin towards your chest. Do those twice a day, if you can. Don’t push yourself to the point of pain, just a gentle stretch is fine. We're aiming for relief, not injury. I'll write these down for you, and I’ll also give you a leaflet with some more information about tension headaches. We should re-evaluate in two weeks to see if the plan is working. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. Write it all down for me, and I'll follow it to the letter. Two weeks, you say? I can mark it on me calendar right now. You've put me mind at ease, you have. Thank you kindly for takin' the time to listen and explain things so clearly. I appreciate it. Now, about this leaflet… is it somethin' complicated, or just a bit of common sense? I don’t want to be gettin' overwhelmed, you know.
DOCTOR: It's not complicated at all, Mr. Popova. It's mostly a summary of what we discussed – information about tension headaches, tips for relieving tension, and when to seek further medical attention. It also has some relaxation techniques you might find helpful. I think you'll find it quite straightforward. Here you go. I’m writing a note for you to follow up in two weeks. If anything changes or you feel worse, don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've covered everything beautifully. I feel much better now, knowin' what it is and what I can do about it. Thank you again for your time and kindness. I'll see you in two weeks then. Have a good day now, and thank you once more.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a wonderful day, and take care. .
