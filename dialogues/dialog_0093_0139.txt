DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, yes. I... need check for referee. For fitness. I want to... be sure I am okay to do it. It is... important.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. A fitness-for-duty examination, or referee medical check, as you say. Very important to ensure your well-being. To clarify, are you currently training to be a sports referee, or is this for an existing position?
PATIENT: Existing. I... do it for many years. But... they want check now. New rules, I think. Or... maybe new insurance thing. I not so sure. Just need check. Fast, if possible?
DOCTOR: I understand. A routine check to satisfy updated requirements is quite common. We'll certainly do our best to make this as efficient as possible. To start, could you tell me a bit about the demands of your refereeing?
PATIENT: Demands...? Uh... I run a lot. Back and forth. Whistle... a lot. Sometimes players... get angry. I... have to move quick. It is... basketball, mostly. High school games. Not professional. So... not so much running as the big guys. But... still. I am... not young anymore.
DOCTOR: Basketball refereeing, primarily high school games. Running, quick movements, and occasionally dealing with potentially agitated players. And you mentioned you’re feeling the effects of time, specifically in your knees. That's helpful information, thank you. Before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me about any current or past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Uh... long time ago... I had... bad back. Many years ago. Physical therapy. Okay now. And... my wife... she passed away two years ago. She had... heart problem. I... sometimes get tired. But... I think that is... sadness, you know? Not... heart problem. Nothing else. I don’t think.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Shanor. Losing someone you love is incredibly difficult. And thank you for sharing about your back issue and the fatigue. It’s good to rule things out, and it’s perfectly reasonable that you’re feeling tired given your loss. To be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or any other significant medical condition?
PATIENT: No. Doctor said... normal. When I have check up. Maybe five years ago? I... not sick. Usually. Just... tired. And back. Long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. No history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma. No recent significant medical issues beyond the resolved back problem and the fatigue you’re experiencing. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat… everything. I take… nothing. No pills. No medicine. Just... water. And sometimes tea.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies and currently not taking any medications. That simplifies things nicely. Now, before we move to a physical exam, could you briefly tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Family…? Uh… my father… he had… old heart. Not strong. He… passed away when I was young. Maybe sixty years old? Mother… she was okay. Lived long time. But… I don’t know… many problems with old age. Like… forgetting things. I don’t know the name. She… not remembering. Nothing bad. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had heart disease and passed away at a relatively young age. Your mother experienced age-related cognitive decline, such as memory loss. This is helpful to know, thank you. Now, just a few final questions before we begin the physical examination. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never smoke. Alcohol… sometimes. Very small glass of wine. With dinner. Maybe once a week? Nothing big. And… no. Not those things. No drugs.
DOCTOR: Alright, very good. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. That completes our initial questioning. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam to assess your overall health and suitability for refereeing. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, evaluating your reflexes, and examining your joints, particularly your knees, given your previous back issue and your concerns about fatigue. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Fast? I… have other things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. We will proceed as efficiently as possible. Please have a seat on the examination table, and we’ll begin. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are regular. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I will check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80. Next, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Finally, let’s examine your knees. Please bend your knees for me. Knees exhibit mild crepitus with flexion and extension, but no acute tenderness or swelling detected. Range of motion is slightly limited bilaterally.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, are you feeling unwell?
