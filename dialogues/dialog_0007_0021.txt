DOCTOR: Hi Ricky, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, my foot's been swelling up, see? It started a few days ago, and it just keeps getting bigger. Mostly this one <points to left foot>. It's a bit painful too, especially when I try to walk on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Swelling in the left foot, started a few days ago, and getting worse with walking. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: It's not, like, a sharp pain, you know? More of a dull ache. It throbs a bit, especially at the end of the day. And if I press on it… <presses gently on the top of his foot> …it hurts there. Not awful, but noticeable. I try not to put too much weight on it, that’s why I’m walking a little slow today.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache, throbbing, worse at the end of the day, and tenderness to the touch when you press on it. Good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, not really. And no redness, I don’t think. My skin feels normal, just… puffy. And it feels a little warm, but that could just be from walking, right? I haven’t noticed anything else, no. It just swells up and aches. I did twist it a little, maybe a week or so ago, getting out of the car, but it didn't hurt that bad then. I figured it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever or redness, skin feels puffy and slightly warm. You twisted it a week ago, but it didn't seem serious at the time. Okay. Let’s take a look at it. Could you please sit on the examination table and I’ll take a quick look and feel around?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. <sits carefully on the examination table, swinging his legs slightly> Here you go, Doctor. Be careful, it’s a bit tender.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm feeling around now. I notice some swelling around the ankle and the top of your foot. Your pulses feel good – strong and regular. And moving your ankle… there's some discomfort when I bend it downwards, and a little bit upwards. I don’t see any obvious deformities or open wounds. It’s definitely tender to the touch along the outside of your ankle. It doesn't feel like a broken bone, but there’s definitely some inflammation going on. Now, do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. <taps his knuckles on the table> I had a bit of trouble with high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was okay now, just needed to watch my salt. And my knees are a little creaky sometimes, but that’s just old age, I guess. Other than that, nothing major. I don’t take any regular medicine. And I haven’t had any surgeries.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. History of high blood pressure that’s currently managed, some knee discomfort, and no medications or surgeries. And no allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat everything, pretty much. <chuckles softly> Except maybe beets. I don't really like beets, but that's not an allergy!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, Ricky, just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I’m retired now, used to work in a bank, doing loans. Mostly desk work. Now I mostly just take it easy. I walk a bit, go to the market, visit with friends. I don’t do much heavy lifting. I try to eat healthy, but I like my sweets, I won’t lie. <grins sheepishly> And I don’t exercise much, if that’s what you mean. Mostly just walking around.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, mostly sedentary lifestyle with some walking. And you enjoy sweets. That's good to know. Given what you’ve told me, it sounds like this could be a sprain, possibly aggravated by the initial twist you mentioned. However, to rule out anything more serious, like a fracture or a blood clot, I'd like to get an X-ray of your foot. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Yeah, that’s okay. If it makes sure it’s not anything bad, then yeah, go ahead. I just want to be able to walk again without it hurting, you know? How long will that take? And will it be expensive? I don’t have insurance, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll get it done as quickly as possible. The X-ray itself won’t take long, maybe 10-15 minutes. As for the cost… I’ll be honest, without insurance it can be a bit pricey. I'll check with the billing department to see what the cash price is and let you know. We can also explore options for financial assistance if needed. In the meantime, let’s go ahead and get that X-ray done. I’ll have the technician take a look and we’ll go from there. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good. Just want to get this figured out. Where do I go for the X-ray? And will I need to change clothes or anything?
DOCTOR: Great. The X-ray room is just down the hall, third door on the left. You don't need to change clothes, but you may want to remove any metal jewelry or anything with metal on your foot. The technician will guide you through the process. They’ll position your foot and take a few pictures. It doesn’t hurt. I’ll meet you back here once it’s done, and we’ll discuss the results. Do you think you can manage to walk down the hall okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can walk. It’s slow, but I can do it. I’ll just shuffle along. <starts to slowly get off the examination table> Thanks for explaining everything, Doctor. I appreciate it. I’ll see you back here. <hobbles slowly towards the door>
DOCTOR: Okay, take your time. And don't hesitate to ask the technician for help if you need it. I’ll be right here when you get back. Let me know if you have any questions along the way.
