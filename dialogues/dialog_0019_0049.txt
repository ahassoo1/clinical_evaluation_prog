DOCTOR: Good morning, Betty. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Land sakes, it's been a while since I’ve been to a doctor. Um… well, I think it's my ears. They just… don't hear so good anymore. It’s hard to follow a conversation, you know? Especially when folks mumble. I don’t remember exactly when it started, just… gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right, gradually getting worse. That’s common, Betty. It is frustrating when it's hard to hear. Okay, so it's primarily difficulty hearing, and you've noticed it over some time now. Has it been worse in one ear than the other, or about the same?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now, let me think... I think… maybe the left one is a little worse? Or is it the right? It’s hard to say. They both seem pretty bad, honestly. I mostly notice it when someone's not right in front of me. If I’m lookin' at ‘em, I can usually get by. But turnin' away… that's when I really miss things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse when you’re not facing the speaker directly. That gives us a bit to work with. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any pain, fullness, or dizziness associated with it?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes, yeah, I think I hear a little… like a high-pitched whine. Not all the time, though. And no pain, no. And I haven't been dizzy, thankfully. I get a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but that's just old age, I reckon. It’s not like… spinning or anything. Just a little wobbly.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little ringing sometimes, no pain or dizziness, just some unsteadiness. Okay. And have you ever been exposed to a lot of loud noises – like working around machinery, or being at a lot of concerts, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, my stars, yes. I worked at the shoe factory for… well, a long time. Fifty years, maybe more. And it was loud. All those machines clatterin’ and bangin’ away. Never thought much about it at the time, you know? Just part of the job. They didn't give us earplugs back then, nothin' like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful to know, Betty. A long history of noise exposure. That certainly could be contributing. Now, let's just quickly go over some other things. Do you have any other medical problems – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart trouble?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago, but I take a little pill for it. Keeps it under control, I think. Other than that… nothin’ much. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old, I suppose. And my knees bother me somethin' awful when it rains. It's a good way to know what the weather's goin' to be!
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some knee pain. Good to know. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I think just that one, but… wait a minute. The nice lady at the drugstore said these were good for my memory. I take two of these every day. And… Oh, and a little vitamin D. The doctor told me to take that a while back. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I have so many little bottles!
DOCTOR: Right, so blood pressure medication, fish oil, and vitamin D. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, allergies… Not that I know of, Doctor. I've never really had any trouble with allergies. Maybe a little sniffle when the pollen's bad in the spring, but that's all. Nothin' serious, never had to go to the hospital or anything. I eat just about anything, too. Not a picky eater, never was. I like my sweets, though! That’s probably not good for my blood pressure, is it?
DOCTOR: Well, moderation is key with the sweets, Betty. Alright, let’s do a quick exam. I'm going to take a look in your ears, check your hearing a little bit, and just do a general check-up. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’ve got no secrets, you know? Just an old woman with bad hearin’. Go ahead whenever you're ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. Let me take a look at your ears first. Okay, your ear canals are a little narrow, which is common as we get older, and there's a little bit of wax buildup in both ears, but nothing major. The eardrums themselves look okay, a little dull, but no obvious holes or fluid. Okay, the Weber test is a little diminished on both sides, and the Rinne test shows some conductive hearing loss in both ears, which isn’t surprising given the wax and your history of noise exposure. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138/82. Everything else looks within normal limits for your age.
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness, you're tellin' me a lot of things I don't understand. Wax buildup? Conducive… what-was-it? Is that bad? And my heart sounds regular… that’s good, isn’t it? I just want to be able to hear my grandkids when they come to visit, Doctor. Is there anything you can do about it? That's all I really care about.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Betty. It is a lot of medical jargon. Let me explain it simply. The wax buildup is pretty common, and it can block sound and make it harder to hear. “Conductive hearing loss” just means that sound isn't traveling through your ear canal and middle ear as well as it should. Your history of working in the shoe factory, with all the loud noise, likely contributed to that. And yes, your heart sounding regular is very good. Now, about your hearing… We can definitely do something. Given the wax buildup and the conductive hearing loss, the first step I'd recommend is a simple wax removal. It's usually quick and painless. After that, we can discuss getting a hearing test to see exactly how much hearing loss you have, and if you’d benefit from hearing aids. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible. Wax removal first, then a test. I don't mind a test. And… hearing aids? Are they… big and noticeable? I don't want everyone knowin' I'm hard of hearin’. I still want to feel… normal, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Betty. That’s a very common concern. Hearing aids have come a long way. They’re much smaller and more discreet than they used to be. Many of them are very tiny and fit right inside your ear canal. They're also much better at amplifying sounds clearly, so you can hear conversations without a lot of background noise. We have several different styles and colors, and we can find one that’s comfortable and suits your needs and preferences. Let’s start with the wax removal, and then we can schedule a hearing test. If you’d benefit from hearing aids, we can talk about all your options and find the best fit for you. We can even do a trial period to see if you like them before you commit to anything. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, a trial period… that does sound good. I wouldn’t want to buy somethin' expensive if it doesn't work, would I? And small ones, you say? Not those big, clunky things? Alright, Doctor, let’s do the wax removal first. When can we get that done? I’m pretty flexible, but Tuesdays are good, or Thursdays. I have my bridge club on Mondays and Wednesdays.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Small ones, definitely. We have several very discreet options. And Tuesdays or Thursdays are perfect. How about next Tuesday at 2:00 PM?
PATIENT: Oh, that's lovely. Tuesday at 2:00 it is. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ve been worryin’ about my hearin’ for a while now, and it’s good to finally have a plan. Is there anything I need to do before Tuesday? Anythin' special?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special at all, Betty. Just come in at 2:00 PM, and we'll take care of it. If you’re currently using any ear drops, avoid using them for a day or two beforehand. Otherwise, just relax and come as you are. I’ll have the nurse print out some aftercare instructions for you. And if you have any questions before Tuesday, don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's all. You've been very thorough and kind. I really appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly, and not makin’ me feel like an old fool. Thank you again, Doctor Renzi. I’ll see you Tuesday.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Betty. I’m glad I could help. I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up before then. Have a lovely day, and be careful walking home.
