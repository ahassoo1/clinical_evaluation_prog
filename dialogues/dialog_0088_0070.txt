DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Piet, you say? Yes. Well... new here, mostly. Just... checking things. Doctor told me to come, you know? Old doctor. Back home. Everything is… blurry now. Lots of moving.
DOCTOR: I understand. A general check-up is always a good idea, especially with a move and changing doctors. Just to make sure everything is as it should be. When you say "blurry," can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Blurry... everything. Head sometimes. And... can’t remember names. Faces, too. Not like… sick blurry, just… old. Like old film, you know? Not sharp. Is that… bad? I don’t even know why I came, really. Just a feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. So, some memory issues and a general feeling of things not being as clear as they used to be. That's helpful. And you mentioned sometimes feeling blurry in your head—can you describe that sensation?
PATIENT: Sensation... hmm. Like fog. Not pain, no. Just… slow. Thinking slow. Like walking through water. And... sometimes I look at people and… I know I know them, but the name… gone. Like a bird flew away with it. Very annoying. I used to remember everything. Makeup, actors, lights… now? Poof.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating. Memory changes can be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. Let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical… hmm. Back home, doctor said… blood pressure. High, he said. Pills. For many years. And… something with the heart. Not bad, he said. Just… old. That's all I really remember. Lots of pills. I don't even know what they were for anymore. Everything is a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and some heart issues. Do you remember the names of any of the medications you were taking?
PATIENT: Names? No. No, I do not. Little white pills, mostly. And one blue one, maybe? I took them for so long… every morning. The old wife, she kept track. She… is gone now. All gone. I just… filled the little boxes. That's all. I don't do good with names. Never did, really. Just faces. And even those… fading.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s okay. We can try to get a list from your previous doctor if possible. Do you happen to have any records with you, or do you remember the name of the clinic back home?
PATIENT: Records? No. Just this. For… groceries. Old clinic… hmm. Big building. Lots of people. Very cold waiting room. Was in… Moscow, I think? Maybe outside of Moscow. Everything looks the same after a while. Lots of grey buildings. No, sorry. Can’t help you with a name. My brain… is not working so good today.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Szmyd. Don’t worry about it. We can work with what we have. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, dementia, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. Mother… weak heart. Died young. Father… strong. Very strong. Farmer. But… drank too much. That’s all I really remember. Sister… lived long life. Normal. No… special problems. No one… crazy or anything. Just… normal people. Lots of sadness, mostly. You know? Life is sad.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, so a history of heart issues on your mother’s side. And you said you've been feeling generally unwell – the blurry vision, memory issues, thinking slowly. Are you experiencing any other symptoms currently – headaches, dizziness, weakness, changes in appetite, or difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleeping… no good. Wake up many times. Dream… bad dreams. About… the old place. About her. Appetite… not so good. Eat small. Feel tired all the time. And… sometimes… little shakes. Hands mostly. Not big shakes. Just… tremble. Not always. When I think too much, maybe? It’s hard to explain. Everything is… mixed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty sleeping, bad dreams, decreased appetite, fatigue, and some occasional tremors, especially when you’re thinking. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological exam—checking your reflexes and balance. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Exam? Fine. Whatever you need to do. I don’t feel so good, but… I guess it’s necessary. Just… be gentle. Old bones, you know? And… I don’t like needles. Never did. But do what you have to. Just… quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible, and we can take our time. No needles today, I promise. First, let's check your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Relax… hard to relax. Everything is… new. New smells. New sounds. New… everything. But okay. I will try. Just… tell me what you are doing. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm just wrapping this cuff around your arm. It will squeeze for a moment, but it shouldn’t be painful. I'm measuring your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 85. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds a bit… muffled, and I hear some mild crackling in your lungs. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Arms… Old arms. Not so strong anymore. Used to be strong. Makeup, you know? Heavy lights. Lots of lifting. But okay. Do what you need. Is… is something wrong? Muffled? Crackling? Those sound… bad. Are you sure it's just old?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon with age. And the muffled heart sound and crackling in your lungs could be due to a few things—fluid buildup, or simply the normal changes that happen with age and a history of heart issues. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is severely wrong, but it does warrant further investigation. I'm going to check your balance now. Could you please stand up, if you feel comfortable, and try to walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Balance… not so good. Always been clumsy. See? Not good. Like… a boat on the water. Too much wine, maybe? When I was younger. Just a little. But yes. Not good. Be careful. I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, I'm here to help. Your gait is a little unsteady, and your balance is slightly impaired. Okay, please sit back down. Given your symptoms – the memory issues, fatigue, elevated blood pressure, muffled heart sound, crackling lungs, and unsteady gait – I think it’s important to do some further testing. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Always tests. Back home, always tests. I don’t… I don’t understand. What do they do? What will they show? Is it… bad? I just want to be normal. Just want to… remember things. And sleep. Is it something serious, Doctor? You can tell me. I’m an old man. I’ve lived a life.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Szmyd. It's never pleasant to have a lot of tests. The blood tests will give us a general overview of your health – check things like your blood sugar, kidney function, and vitamin levels. The EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart and see if there are any irregularities. And the chest X-ray will help us see if there's any fluid in your lungs or any other abnormalities. I can't say for certain if it's something serious yet. It's too early to tell. But your symptoms do warrant further investigation to rule out anything concerning, like heart failure, pneumonia, or early signs of cognitive decline. We need to get a clearer picture before we can determine the cause and the best course of treatment. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: Cognitive… what? Decline? Like… getting worse? Like… forgetting everything? Is that what you think? That I’m… going crazy? My wife… she used to say I was forgetful. But that was just… me. Always been like that. I just… wanted to sleep. And remember her face. Is that what the tests are for? To see if I’m… losing my mind?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Szmyd, that's not what I'm saying at all. “Cognitive decline” simply means a change in your thinking and memory. It doesn’t necessarily mean you're losing your mind. Many things can cause changes in memory – stress, medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, even just getting older. The tests will help us determine the cause of your memory changes. It’s a process of elimination. I understand your fear, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious about this. We're going to take things one step at a time. First, we'll get the test results, and then we'll discuss them thoroughly and create a plan together. We can also consider a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in brain health, if the tests show any concerns. Does that sound more reassuring?
PATIENT: Neurologist… more doctors. Okay. One step at a time. That sounds… better. What do I have to do now? For the tests? Where do I go? Will they… hurt? I don’t like needles, you know. And I don’t like… being poked and prodded. Just tell me what I have to do. Practical things. I don’t understand all the… brain talk.
DOCTOR: Of course. Practical things. That’s perfectly reasonable. You'll need to go to the lab at Suburban General Hospital. It’s just down the street, at 123 Main Street. They will draw a small sample of blood – it's a quick pinch, and it shouldn't hurt much. The lab technician will give you instructions on how to prepare – usually just fasting for 8-12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drink except water. Then, you'll need to schedule an EKG. The hospital scheduling department can help you with that. The number is 555-1234. They’ll put some sticky pads on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. It’s painless. I'm giving you a referral order for both tests. The hospital staff will need this when you arrive. Do you have any questions about the location or the instructions?
PATIENT: 123 Main Street… fasting… sticky pads… So, I just… go there? By myself? What if I… get lost? Or forget what I’m supposed to do? Is there someone… who can go with me? My… I don’t have anyone, really. Just… me. Is it far? Can I take the bus? What if I forget the papers?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Mr. Szmyd. It’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious about going alone. The hospital is only about a mile away – a short bus ride. The number 14 bus stops right in front of the clinic, and it will take you directly to the hospital. I can print out a map with the bus route for you, and I’ll also write down the hospital’s address and phone number on the papers. We can even call the hospital to schedule the tests for you now, so you don't have to worry about that. And don't worry about forgetting the papers. I can make a copy for you, and I'll also fax a copy to the hospital. We'll make sure everything is taken care of. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fax… copy… You would do that? That… that would be very kind. I… I don’t know what I would do without your help. I just… get so confused. And I forget things so easily. If you could just… take care of the scheduling, and make a copy… that would be wonderful. Thank you. Really. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. That’s what I’m here for. Let me just get your date of birth to make sure everything is accurate. And while I'm scheduling, is there a phone number where the hospital can reach you if they need to reschedule?
PATIENT: Phone… hmm. I used to have one. But… it’s gone now. Lost it. Or… maybe I changed it. I don’t remember. Just… don’t worry about the number. They can leave a message here at the clinic. Yes. That would be best. Just… leave a message. That’s all. I don't want to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem at all. We'll just leave a message here at the clinic. Okay, I’ve scheduled your blood tests for tomorrow at 9:00 AM, and your EKG is scheduled for Thursday at 11:00 AM. Here are the appointment slips. Remember, fasting for 8-12 hours before the blood tests. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… 9:00 AM… Thursday… 11:00 AM… No… I think that’s everything. Thank you. Really. Thank you very much. You’ve been… very kind. I don't know what I would do without you. I suppose I should go now. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll see you tomorrow.
