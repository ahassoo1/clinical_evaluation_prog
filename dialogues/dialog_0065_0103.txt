DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my back, you see. Lower back. Been botherin’ me for…oh, a long time now, really. Not a new thing, but it’s gettin’ worse, I think. Hurts to bend over, especially. And standin’ for too long, that’s bad too.
DOCTOR: “A long time now,” you say. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… Specific? Okay. Let me think. It started… maybe five years ago? A little twinge here and there. Didn’t pay much mind to it. Then, maybe two years ago it started hurtin’ more regular. Not every day, but most weeks. Now, the last few months...it’s pretty much constant, ya know? Just a dull ache most of the time. Sometimes it gets sharp, if I move wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say "sharp," can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Well…it’s not like a shootin’ pain, not exactly. More like… a really bad cramp. Like someone’s twistin’ a knife a little bit. It doesn’t last long, usually. Just a second or two. But it makes me grab onto somethin’ for sure. It’s mostly when I bend, or try to lift somethin’. Even just gettin’ outta a chair sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cramping, sharp pain with bending or lifting. Have you noticed anything that relieves the pain, Mr. Vankampen?
PATIENT: Relieves it… let me think. Layin’ down helps. That takes the pressure off, for sure. And…warm baths. A nice, warm bath does feel good. I don’t know if it fixes it, but it makes it feel better for a little while.
DOCTOR: Alright, lying down and warm baths offer some relief. Now, have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no numbness or tingle. Legs are fine. I can walk okay. Sometimes…sometimes they feel a little stiff in the mornin’, but that’s just bein’ old, I reckon. Nothin’ bad, nothin’ that doesn't go away after I get movin'.
DOCTOR: “Just being old,” you say. We shouldn’t dismiss things so readily, Mr. Vankampen. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions, like arthritis, osteoporosis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well… my ex-wife’s doctor, years ago, she told me… she said somethin’ about my bones bein’ a little thin. Osteo… osteo-whatever it was. She said I should take calcium. I think. It was a long time ago, and frankly, I didn’t listen too good. She was… well, never mind. Didn't see a doctor myself for it, just what she said. Never had arthritis, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: “Osteo…” likely osteoporosis. And you haven’t had it officially diagnosed, just a comment from your ex-wife’s doctor. Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been cut open, thank goodness. Just a few broken bones when I was a kid, runnin’ around like a fool. A wrist, I think. And an elbow once. Nothin’ serious. Healed up fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had a bad back when she got older. Couldn’t stand for long periods. Always complainin’ about it. But she just thought it was old age. She didn’t go to the doctor much either. And my father… he broke his hip when he fell, but that was when he was really old. I don’t know if that’s relevant or not.
DOCTOR: Alright, a family history of back pain and a hip fracture. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothin’ at all. I don’t like takin’ pills, if I can help it. Just a little aspirin now and then for a headache. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I can take most things, I think. Though, like I said, I don't take much, so I don’t really know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to perform a physical examination to assess your back. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with some range of motion tests and palpation to identify the source of your pain.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Range of motion… that sounds…fancy. Alright, I’ll lie down. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen, if you could lie face down, please. I'm going to gently press on your back to feel for tenderness. Then, I’ll ask you to move your back in different directions. Please let me know if anything causes pain. Okay, does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh. Yes… that’s a little tender. Right… there. Not terrible, but… yeah, that’s it. That’s where it hurts most of the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, tenderness localized to the right lumbar region. Now, can you gently bend forward, trying to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… not easy. That really hurts. Right in my lower back. Can't go much further without really makin’ it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you gently lean back, as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… better, actually. Still a little pain, but not as bad as bendin’ forward. Just a little stretchin’ sensation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you lie on your back, and gently lift your right leg, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Ooh. That’s… difficult too. Can't lift it very high without pain shootin’ down my leg. Just a little bit… is all I can do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen, that's enough for now. Please lower your leg slowly. Based on the examination, you have tenderness in your lower back, limited range of motion with bending forward and backward, and pain when lifting your leg. This suggests a musculoskeletal issue, likely a strain or sprain, but the limited range of motion and pain with leg lift also raises concern for possible nerve involvement. To rule out other potential causes, I would like to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine. We will also check your reflexes and sensation to assess nerve function. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: X-ray… Hmm. Sounds… serious. But if it’ll find out what’s wrong, I suppose. Nerve… that doesn’t sound good. Alright. Yes. Yes, I consent. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… get it over with, if you can.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will send you to the radiology department to have the X-ray performed. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. I will also have the nurse check your reflexes and sensation before you leave. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to help manage the pain. You should also avoid strenuous activity and lifting heavy objects. Once we have the X-ray results, we can discuss a more definitive treatment plan, which may include physical therapy or other interventions. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… not really, I guess. Just… how long will I have to wait for the results? And… is it gonna hurt? The X-ray, I mean. I don't like bein’ poked and prodded. And… will this take long to fix? I just wanna get back to normal.
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself should only take a few minutes and shouldn’t cause any significant pain. It involves simply standing or lying still while the machine takes pictures of your bones. You won't be poked or prodded. As for how long it will take to “fix,” that depends on the results. A simple strain may resolve within a few weeks with conservative treatment, but if there's something more serious, it may require a longer course of therapy. I understand you want to get back to normal, and we'll do everything we can to make that happen. We need the X-ray results to determine the best course of action. The nurse will be in shortly to check your reflexes and sensation and escort you to radiology. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… no, I don’t think so. Never had any dye. Just… regular medicines, if anything. I just get a little sleepy sometimes when I take somethin’, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's good to know. Just to be clear, we aren’t planning on using contrast dye at this time, but I always ask. The nurse will be with you shortly. If you experience any severe pain, numbness, or weakness in your legs or feet, please let the nurse know immediately. Do you have any other questions before I leave you to prepare for the X-ray?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you. I appreciate you takin’ the time to look at me. I just hope it’s nothin’ too serious.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Vankampen. We'll get to the bottom of it. We will review the X-ray results as soon as they become available and contact you with the findings. Please follow the nurse's instructions, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor.
