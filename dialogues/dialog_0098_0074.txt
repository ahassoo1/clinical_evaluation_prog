DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. My blood pressure’s been a little high, my regular doctor said I should get it checked out. Don’t really like comin’ to doctors, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna. I understand that. It’s good you're getting it checked though. High blood pressure is something we want to keep an eye on. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it being high?
PATIENT: Well now… that’s a good question. I reckon it was… maybe a couple months ago? My son, Dale, he bought me one of them machines, you know, for checkin’ it at home. He was worryin’. It seemed a little high then, but I didn't pay much mind. It’s been goin’ up and down since. Sometimes fine, sometimes… not so much. I mostly feel alright though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months ago, with some fluctuations. And you said you mostly feel alright?
PATIENT: Yep, mostly alright. A little tired sometimes, but I’m ninety years old, Doctor! That’s gotta count for somethin’. I still do my bakin’, though. Makes pies for the whole town, practically. Keeps me busy. Don't want to sit around doin’ nothin’.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! Staying active is the best medicine. A little tiredness is understandable at ninety, but we still want to make sure everything is okay. Do you notice the tiredness being worse at any particular time of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really, I don't think so. Just kinda… general tired. Like an old quilt that’s been patched a lot. Still warm, still useful, but not like new, you know? Mostly happens in the evenin', I reckon. After I’ve been on my feet all day bakin’. But even then, it ain't terrible. Just… tired. I mostly just sit and watch some television then.
DOCTOR: Okay, general tiredness, more noticeable in the evening after being on your feet. That’s helpful. Now, have you been experiencing any other symptoms along with the tiredness and the blood pressure concerns?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. Maybe a little… lightheaded sometimes. But that could be from gettin’ up too fast. Happens every now and then. I don't fall or nothin’. And my eyesight ain’t what it used to be, but that’s been goin’ on for years. No, I can't think of anything else, Doctor. Not really.
DOCTOR: Alright, lightheadedness occasionally, which you attribute to getting up quickly. And your vision has been declining for some time. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… Well, I had a touch of arthritis in my hands years ago. Makes bakin’ a little harder sometimes, but I manage. And I had the flu pretty bad one winter, back in ‘98, I think. Spent a week in bed with that. Other than that… not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Don't think I've ever been in the hospital for anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the hands and a case of the flu in ‘98. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Always tried to avoid ‘em if I could. My mama always said, "If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it." And I’ve mostly lived by that rule. I’m a practical woman, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. A good philosophy! Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just somethin’ for the arthritis, Doctor. Little pills, keeps the pain at bay. And vitamins, Dale makes me take vitamins. He worries somethin’ fierce. Other than that, no. I try to stay natural, if I can. Don’t like fillin’ my body with too much stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for the arthritis and vitamins as prescribed by your son. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat just about anything Dale puts in front of me. He’s a good cook, bless his heart. And I’ve been eatin’ for ninety years, so I reckon I'd know if I was allergic to somethin’ by now.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do you know if anyone in your family has had high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. My mama, she had a weak heart, I think. Didn’t live to be very old. And my grandpa on my daddy’s side, he had somethin’ with his heart, too. But I don’t know much about it, to be honest. Back then, folks didn’t talk much about these things. My daddy, he was strong as an ox. Never had a day of sickness in his life. So it’s kinda mixed, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of weak heart in your mother and something with the heart in your grandfather. And your father was healthy. Now, lastly, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I told ya, I bake. That takes up most of my time and energy. I mostly stay here in town, seein' friends and neighbors. Don’t do much travelin’ anymore. Used to love fishin’ with my husband, but he’s been gone a long time. I don’t drink or smoke, never have. And I don't have much of a sweet tooth, funny enough, considerin’ my profession! Mostly just try to live a simple life. Keep busy, stay positive. That’s what I always say.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venna, that gives me a good picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just take a general look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine with me, Doctor. Get it over with, I say. I got a pie crust needin’ rolled. Long as it don’t take too long.
DOCTOR: It won’t. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 152 over 88. A little elevated, as your son mentioned. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Nothing too concerning at this point, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Good circulation to all extremities. No swelling. Overall, you appear to be in good health for your age, Venna, but the elevated blood pressure and the murmur do warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Murmur, you say? Never heard nothin' about a murmur before. What does that mean, exactly? And what kinda "investigation" are we talkin’ about? I ain’t one for pokin’ and proddin’ if I can help it.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question. A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes when blood flows through it. Many murmurs are harmless, especially in older adults. But it’s good to investigate to rule out anything serious. The investigation I’m thinking of would be an electrocardiogram, or EKG, which is a quick and painless test to check your heart’s electrical activity, and possibly an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart. That will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. We can do both tests here in the clinic, and they shouldn’t take long at all. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An… echo-what-now? Sounds complicated. And you said electrical activity? I don’t like the sound of that. But… I reckon I don’t want nothin’ sneakin’ up on me neither. Alright, Doctor. Do your… echo-thing. And your electrical thing. But hurry, if you please. I got pies to bake! And tell me what all this means afterwards, understand? No medical mumbo-jumbo. Plain English.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. I promise, plain English. The echocardiogram is just an ultrasound, like what they use when someone’s expecting a baby, but we use it to look at your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all. And the EKG is just a few stickers we put on your chest to check your heart’s rhythm. It’s quick and painless, too. We’ll get those done right away. Let me go get the nurse to start with the EKG. She'll explain everything in more detail. And I assure you, we'll do everything as quickly as possible so you can get back to your pies.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. The sooner I’m back to bakin’, the better. And tell that nurse to be gentle with them stickers. My skin ain’t what it used to be. .
