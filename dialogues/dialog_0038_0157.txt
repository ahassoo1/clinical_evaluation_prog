DOCTOR: Hi Tasmia, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand you're concerned about your time, and I'll do my best to be efficient. High blood pressure is definitely something we want to look into. To start, can you tell me a bit more about when you found out your blood pressure was high?
PATIENT: Found out? I guess at that clinic back in Gallup. They just…told me. Some machine beeped and a nurse said something about numbers being too high. I didn’t really listen, to be honest. I was trying to get my kids out of there. Is that enough information for you?
DOCTOR: That's okay, it happens. It's not always easy to focus when you're juggling a lot. So, the reading was taken at a clinic in Gallup… do you remember when roughly that was?
PATIENT: Ugh, dates. Let me think… it was… before the kids started summer break. So, sometime in May, maybe? It was definitely before June. Look, I really don’t keep track of things like that. Is it important? Because if it's not going to change anything, I don't see the point in racking my brain.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have a timeframe, thank you. Knowing it was in May gives us a starting point. And it's perfectly alright that dates aren't your priority! We can work with estimates. Okay, so you were told your blood pressure was high at that visit. Have you had any symptoms since then that you've noticed?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I feel… normal. Tired, mostly. But that’s just kids, you know? Always needing something. No headaches or anything dramatic like you see on TV. Does feeling stressed count as a symptom? Because I am. Very stressed.
DOCTOR: Feeling stressed absolutely counts! That can definitely play a role. When you say "tired," is that just general fatigue, or are you finding it difficult to do your usual activities?
PATIENT: It’s just…everything feels harder. Work’s been busy, the kids are…kids. Even getting out of bed is a struggle some days. I used to be able to do everything, you know? Now I just want to sit down. It's probably just getting old. I’m not that young anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot, and that level of fatigue can be really draining. It’s good you’re bringing this up. Let's not assume it’s just getting old, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Look, can we just get this over with? I have a lot to do today. Are you going to give me a pill or what? I don’t have time for a lecture about self-care.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Tasmia. We can get through this quickly, but I do want to make sure we have enough information to make the best decision for you. Before we talk about potential medications, would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. The quicker we do this, the quicker I can leave. Honestly, I don’t even know why I bothered coming in. A machine can do all this, right? It's just a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated – 148/92. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some slight crackling in your lungs when you take a deep breath. Do you have any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Asthma? No. Bronchitis… maybe once, a long time ago? When I was a kid, I think. It was a long time ago, I barely remember. I don’t go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to, so I don't really keep track of these things. Is that crackling serious? Are my lungs broken? Don’t tell me I need oxygen.
DOCTOR: No, your lungs aren't broken, and you don't need oxygen. Crackling can be caused by a lot of things – sometimes it’s just a bit of fluid, sometimes it's nothing to worry about. Given your blood pressure reading and the crackling, I’d like to ask a few more questions to get a better picture of what's going on. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. My grandmother smoked and she died young. Horrible habit. My husband used to, but he quit years ago. He says it was the hardest thing he ever did. Why are you asking? Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Good to hear. I'm asking because smoking can affect your lungs and blood pressure. We're getting there. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. Let me think… My mom had diabetes. And my dad… he had heart problems, I think. Something about his cholesterol. He didn’t take care of himself. Never ate right, always stressed. Honestly, it's not something we talked about much. It’s just… sad. Is that helpful? Or are we just digging up old problems?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Knowing about the diabetes and heart problems is important. It's understandable that it's not something you've talked about much. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: Typical day? Chaos. Wake up, get the kids ready for school, get them to school, go to work, come home, make dinner, help with homework, try to get the kids to bed, clean up, collapse. Repeat. I work construction, so it's pretty physical. Lots of lifting, walking, being outside. It's not glamorous. And I'm always tired. Does that answer your question? It's not exactly a relaxing life.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly demanding, physically and mentally. It's no wonder you're tired. Okay, one last thing for now. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen, when my back hurts. Construction, you know? And sometimes I take something for a headache. That's it. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. They just make me feel worse. Honestly, I don't trust them.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, ibuprofen as needed for back pain and occasional headache relief. Alright, Tasmia, I think I have enough information for now. Based on what you’ve told me – your blood pressure reading, the crackling in your lungs, your family history, and your demanding lifestyle – it seems like we need to address a few things. First, your blood pressure is elevated, which, if left untreated, can lead to serious health problems. Second, the crackling in your lungs warrants further investigation to rule out anything serious. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not a doctor. I just know I’m tired and stressed and I need to get back to work. So, what are you going to do about it? Are you going to give me a pill or what? I don't want to sit here all day discussing this. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I promise I’ll be as efficient as possible. We can start with a medication to help lower your blood pressure. It's likely a low dose to start, and we'll monitor how you're feeling. However, I also want to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. And I'd like to run some blood tests to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Can I at least get a referral to someone who can watch my kids while I'm doing all this? This is ridiculous. Work is going to fire me if I keep taking time off. Can you at least write me a note?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I can definitely write you a note for work explaining your absences for the tests and follow-up appointments. I understand how important it is to maintain your job. As for childcare, let me see if we have a list of local resources that might be able to help. Unfortunately, we don't have a comprehensive list, but I can give you the number for the county social services department. They should be able to connect you with programs in the area. Okay. I'm going to write you a prescription for Lisinopril 10mg once daily. It’s a common medication for high blood pressure. And I’ll get the orders in for the chest X-ray and blood tests. The front desk will schedule those for you before you leave. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it done. I have things to do. And make sure that note for work is good. I don't want any trouble. Is that all? Can I go now? Honestly, this whole thing has been a waste of my time. I should have just stayed home and taken some ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Here you go. The note explains your need for medical appointments, and the prescription is for Lisinopril 10mg, as we discussed. The front desk has already scheduled your chest X-ray and blood tests. They’ll contact you with the details. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I want to assure you that we're taking your concerns seriously and working towards a solution. It’s important to address this high blood pressure, and we will work together. If you have any questions or concerns after you leave, please don't hesitate to call the office. And Tasmia, please, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headaches, go to the emergency room immediately. You’re free to go now.
PATIENT: .
