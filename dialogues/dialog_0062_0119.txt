DOCTOR: Hi Jinnie, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I’ve noticed a… discharge. A problem down there, if you understand me. It’s not pleasant, I assure you. And frankly, at my age… one expects better.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jinnie. It’s not embarrassing at all to discuss these things – it’s very common, and we’re here to help. Thank you for being so open with me. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must you be so… detailed? It’s… slimy. And sometimes there’s a bit of… odor. Not a strong odor, mind you, but noticeable. It’s just… not right. And I haven’t… well, I haven’t been with anyone for quite some time, so it’s not like it's from that. Is that relevant? I mean, really.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful information, Jinnie, thank you. It is relevant, yes. We need to rule out a number of possibilities. So, the discharge is slimy, with a slight odor, and you haven't been sexually active recently. Has the amount of discharge changed at all – more or less – over time?
PATIENT: Well… it seemed to start small. Just a little bit on my undergarments. Now… now it’s more noticeable, I suppose. Enough that I had to change my clothes. It's not a flood, Doctor, don't get any ideas. But certainly… more than comfortable. And it's been going on for, oh, a week or so now. Perhaps a bit longer. I really don't keep track of these things, you understand. It's dreadfully vulgar.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it started small, has increased over the past week or so, and it’s causing you enough discomfort that you’ve noticed a change in your clothing. Okay. Have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. No pain, Doctor. I’m not that sort of woman. A bit of… irritation, perhaps. A mild discomfort. Like… a slightly too-tight girdle, if you follow. But no burning. Absolutely no burning. And definitely no itching. That would be… simply dreadful. Are you quite certain you need to ask such things? It’s all very… invasive.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions feel invasive, Jinnie. It's important to get all the details to understand what's going on and rule out different possibilities. No pain or burning is good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history a little bit. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Good heavens, no! I watch my figure, Doctor. Always have. A little extra weight wouldn't do, you understand. I do have… a touch of arthritis in my hands, but that's just old age. And my blood pressure sometimes runs a little high at the doctor's office, but that's just nerves, I assure you. I take a little something for that, but nothing serious. Mostly, I'm quite healthy, thank you very much. I've always been very particular about my health. Unlike some people.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a touch of arthritis and sometimes elevated blood pressure, managed with medication. Thank you for letting me know. And no other significant medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… years ago, when I was a young woman, I had my tonsils out. A dreadful experience, it was. And… oh, I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. A silly thing, really. I shouldn't have been attempting tricks. Other than that… no. No hospitalizations, no other surgeries. I've always been very careful. Prone to accidents, perhaps, but never anything serious. I’m not the type to be under a doctor's care for long, you see. I prefer to be independent.
DOCTOR: Tonsils out as a child and a broken wrist. Good to know. And no significant family history of any major medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, goodness. My mother… she had a touch of the nerves, always worrying about something. And my father… he worked himself to death, really. Always stressed. And my brother… well, he was a bit of a rogue, if you understand me. Let’s just say he wasn’t known for his healthy habits. Nothing serious, mind you. Just… regrettable choices. I’ve always made very different choices than my family, thank you very much. I’ve always prided myself on my good sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of some anxiety and perhaps some lifestyle factors. Thank you for that. And just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, other than the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… well, I take a little something for my arthritis, of course. And a vitamin supplement, to keep my energy up. And sometimes, if I’m feeling particularly anxious, I take a little something to calm my nerves. But nothing regularly, you understand. Just as needed. And I’ve been taking a natural remedy for my sleep lately. It’s an herbal blend, very soothing. I’m trying to avoid anything too… artificial, if you follow. Is that important, Doctor? All these questions. It's rather exhausting.
DOCTOR: It is important, Jinnie, thank you for being so thorough. Knowing everything you take helps me understand the complete picture. Alright, I think I have a good understanding of your history now. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Good heavens, Doctor! Must you? I mean, really. I’ve already told you everything. And I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. I don't see the point of… prodding. Is it absolutely necessary? I’d prefer not, if you don’t mind. This is all very undignified. I came to discuss a problem, not to be… examined. I simply don’t understand why this is required.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jinnie, and I apologize if it feels undignified. It’s true that you’ve been very descriptive, which is helpful. However, to properly assess the situation and rule out potential causes, a brief exam is really the best course of action. I would be looking at the external area only, and it would be quick and discreet. It’s standard practice, and it helps me ensure we're on the right track for finding the best solution. We don't have to do anything you're uncomfortable with, of course. However, without a look, it’s difficult to know if, for example, there’s any irritation, inflammation, or anything else that might indicate a specific cause. If it’s alright with you, it will only take a few moments. If you're still uncomfortable, we can discuss a referral to a gynecologist instead, but that may involve a similar examination there as well.
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is simply dreadful. A gynecologist? Absolutely not. I don’t even know those people. And a referral… all that waiting… No. I suppose… if you must… and it’s just a quick look… and you promise it won’t be… intrusive… I suppose I can allow it. But be gentle, Doctor. And quick, please. Very, very quick. And explain everything you’re doing as you go. I don’t want any surprises. This is most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jinnie. I appreciate your trust. I promise to be as gentle and efficient as possible, and I will explain every step as I go. It will be a quick external examination only. Okay, if you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’m just going to take a look at the external area, checking for any signs of irritation, inflammation, or anything unusual. I will be careful and respectful throughout the process. Okay… I do see some slight redness and some mild swelling, but no obvious sores or lesions. There's a small amount of whitish discharge visible. It doesn't have a strong odor at this time. Alright, everything seems relatively normal visually, but the redness and discharge indicate some inflammation. It’s possible this is a mild case of vaginitis, which is a common inflammation of the vagina. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a simple urine test and a vaginal swab to check for infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Good heavens, Doctor! Are you quite sure? All this poking and prodding… it's simply appalling. Vaginitis? Is that… serious? Will I need… medication? I don’t want anything too strong, you understand. I’m very sensitive. And what if it’s something… worse? I don’t like the sound of this at all. Honestly, I think I would have been better off just ignoring the problem. Are you certain these tests are absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jinnie, and I apologize for any discomfort or anxiety this is causing. The tests are important to identify the cause of the inflammation, and that will determine the best course of treatment. Vaginitis itself is usually not serious, and it's often caused by a common yeast infection or a bacterial imbalance. It's easily treatable with medication, usually a topical cream or a mild oral medication. We would start with the least invasive treatment first, and we can discuss all options before starting anything. The swab is a very quick and simple procedure, it’s just a small sample to analyze in the lab. It will help us determine if it's a yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, or something else. If it is something else, knowing that will allow us to address it promptly and effectively. I wouldn't recommend these tests if they weren't necessary to ensure your health and peace of mind. Would you like me to explain the test procedures in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you insist. But be quick about it, Doctor. And explain everything beforehand. I don't like surprises, as I've said. And I want the mildest possible treatment. No strong medications, please. I’m very prone to side effects, you understand. And what if the tests are… unpleasant? Honestly, this is all very distressing. I think I need a cup of tea. Do you have any tea here, Doctor? Perhaps with a biscuit? I'm feeling quite faint. This whole ordeal is simply too much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. I completely understand. It's perfectly reasonable to feel distressed. Let me call the nurse to bring you a cup of tea and a biscuit right away. And I will explain everything about the tests in detail. For the urine test, you will simply need to provide a small sample in a cup – the nurse will give you instructions. It’s non-invasive and doesn’t require any special preparation. For the vaginal swab, the nurse will gently insert a small cotton swab into your vagina to collect a sample. It may feel slightly uncomfortable, but it should be quick – less than a minute. It’s important to relax during the procedure, and the nurse will guide you through it. The samples will be sent to the lab, and we should have the results back in a few days. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best treatment options for you. I assure you, we will start with the mildest possible approach. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. But I want a very gentle nurse. And I want to know exactly what she’s doing before she does it. No surprises, as I've said repeatedly. And what if the results are… bad? What if it’s something… serious? I don’t want to know too much detail if it is. I’m a delicate woman, Doctor. Honestly, I’m beginning to regret coming here at all. This is all very upsetting. Is there any chance this could be… stress related? I’ve been rather anxious lately, what with everything. Perhaps a soothing cream would be enough. And definitely no strong medications. I repeat, no strong medications. Just a quick swab and a little cream, if possible. And a gentle nurse. That’s all I ask. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Jinnie, that is not too much to ask at all. I will personally ensure you have a very gentle and understanding nurse. I will also explain everything to her beforehand so she knows to take extra care and explain each step to you before proceeding. Regarding your concerns about the results, we will discuss them in detail, but I will tailor the information to your comfort level. If you don’t want to know specific details, that is perfectly fine. We can focus on the treatment plan and what we need to do to get you feeling better. It is possible that this could be related to stress, and we will certainly consider that as part of the overall picture. If the results come back negative for any infection, we can explore other potential causes and discuss stress management techniques. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done. The nurse should be here shortly with your tea. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I will be here to support you throughout the process. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Alright. One step at a time. Yes, that sounds a little better. And please, tell the nurse to be very gentle. And bring a biscuit with my tea. A plain biscuit, if possible. Nothing fancy. And tell her to explain everything slowly and clearly. I don't want any surprises, as you know. Honestly, this whole ordeal is simply too much for a woman of my age. I think I need a lie-down after this is all over. A long lie-down. And a cup of chamomile tea. Perhaps with a little honey. This is just dreadful. Absolutely dreadful. But one step at a time, you say? Alright. One step at a time.
DOCTOR: Yes, Jinnie, one step at a time. I’ll make sure the nurse knows to bring you a plain biscuit with your tea, explain everything slowly and clearly, and to be very gentle. I'll also mention the chamomile tea and honey. Let me call her now and let her know you’re ready. Then we’ll get the tests done, and you can relax. I assure you, we’ll take care of everything. And Jinnie, please don’t hesitate to let me know if you feel uncomfortable at any point. I’m here to help.
