DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some…pressure in my bladder, and it’s become quite bothersome. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, and I wanted to get it checked out, just to be sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure for a few weeks. Can you tell me a little more about that pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…difficult to describe precisely. It isn’t painful, exactly, but it’s a constant feeling of fullness, even after I’ve just used the restroom. It’s almost like I can’t completely empty my bladder, if that makes sense? And sometimes, I feel a bit of urgency, even when there shouldn’t be any. It’s just…uncomfortable, and a little worrying.
DOCTOR: That does sound uncomfortable, and it's good you're getting it checked out. So, constant fullness even after voiding, and some urgency when you wouldn’t expect it. About how often are you urinating during the day, on average?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… normally, I would say about five or six times a day. But lately, it’s been more like every two or three hours, even if I haven’t had much to drink. At night, I usually don’t have to get up, but I did wake up once last week needing to go. Which is unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency – five or six times a day now more like every two to three hours – and you had one instance of waking up at night to urinate last week. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I haven't noticed a change in color, thankfully. And no blood or anything concerning like that. It seems to be the same as usual, just…more of it, more often. No burning when I go, either. Just the pressure and the frequent need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in color, no blood, no burning. Just the increased frequency and the sensation of fullness. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully none of those. No fever, no chills, and no pain in my back or sides. It really is just focused on the bladder area – that constant pressure and the feeling of needing to go frequently. I’m a bit worried it could be something serious, but I'm trying not to jump to conclusions.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you’re not jumping to conclusions. Let's go through a little bit of your medical history to get a better picture. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I do have slightly high blood pressure, which I manage with medication – a small dose of Lisinopril, once a day. Other than that, I’m generally very well. I’ve never had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension managed with Lisinopril. That's good to know. Any family history of bladder problems, kidney issues, or frequent UTIs that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My mother had a few urinary tract infections when she was older, but nothing consistent or severe. My grandmother, on my father’s side, did have some kidney stones, but that was quite a long time ago. Nothing else that I’m aware of, really. No one in my immediate family has ever had any significant bladder problems.
DOCTOR: Alright, some UTIs in your mother, kidney stones in your grandmother. And you said you're currently taking Lisinopril. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, food, or anything else, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I haven't had any issues with environmental allergies either. So, no allergies to report, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I’ve never smoked, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to live a healthy lifestyle – I eat a balanced diet and get regular exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all very helpful information, Marialena. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I’d also like to do a quick neurological exam, just to rule out any issues there. Then, I’d like to collect a urine sample for testing. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please proceed. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary to figure out what’s going on. Listening to my abdomen and the neurological exam sound fine, and I’m ready to provide a urine sample when you’re ready. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Everything seems normal there as well. Now, if you could please follow me to the restroom, I’ll give you a cup to collect a urine sample. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-stream in the cup, and finish urinating. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Start, then mid-stream… I understand. I'll follow you to the restroom and collect the sample as you described. Thank you for explaining it so clearly.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, I'll send this off to the lab for a urinalysis and culture. That will help us rule out an infection and check for any other abnormalities. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, let’s discuss a possible plan. Given your symptoms and the initial exam findings, it’s possible this could be a case of overactive bladder or interstitial cystitis. However, we need to rule out other causes first. I'm going to recommend a bladder diary for the next three days. Please record the time and amount of each urination, and any episodes of urgency or leakage. This will give us a better understanding of your bladder habits. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly manageable. A bladder diary for three days… I can definitely do that. I’ll record the time and amount of each urination, and any urgency or leakage. I understand the purpose – to get a better understanding of my bladder habits. I’ll start that right away. And I’ll await the results of the lab tests. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll also give you a pamphlet with more information about overactive bladder and interstitial cystitis, just so you have some additional resources. If the urinalysis and culture come back negative, we can discuss further testing options, such as a post-void residual test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate, or a referral to a urologist if necessary. But let’s start with the bladder diary and see what that reveals. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That all sounds very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You’ve explained everything so well, and I feel much more informed. I’ll diligently keep the bladder diary for the next three days and await the results of the lab tests. If anything comes to mind, I’ll be sure to contact the office. Thank you again for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will, and I appreciate your kindness.
