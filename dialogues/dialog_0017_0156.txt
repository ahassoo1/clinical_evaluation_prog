DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nahrwold. I am Dr. Blim. Please, have a seat. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Dr. Blim. It's... well, it's my stomach. I've been having a lot of trouble with diarrhea, and it just... won't stop. It's been going on for a while now, and honestly, it's really annoying. I think I mentioned it on the phone? It’s… hard to explain exactly how long, everything feels a bit blurry lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I see a note about “gastrointestinal distress.” “A while now” is not particularly helpful, Ms. Nahrwold. We need specifics if I am to assist you. Can you pinpoint approximately when these symptoms began?
PATIENT: Ugh, right, specifics. Sorry. It's… maybe a month? Or six weeks? It feels like it started around… the time my husband got that new job, actually. He started on June 15th, I think? So, maybe around then. It's hard to remember everything, honestly. I just know it’s been a while, and it’s not getting better. I’ve tried… I don’t even know what I’ve tried, just things I read online.
DOCTOR: Online, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah… not the best idea, probably. My sister told me off for it. I just… I was hoping to find something quick to help, you know? Like, what to eat, what not to eat. It didn't really do anything, though. Mostly just made me more confused. Is that bad? Should I not be looking things up online?
DOCTOR: It is… generally ill-advised to self-diagnose, Ms. Nahrwold. The internet is rife with misinformation. Now, let's focus on the diarrhea itself. Is it frequent?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yeah, you're right. It probably wasn't the smartest thing. And yes, it's… frequent. Like, multiple times a day. At least five or six, sometimes more. It’s… really inconvenient. And it's not like just a little bit, you know? It’s… watery. Sorry, that's probably too much information. But it’s definitely not normal.
DOCTOR: “Watery, multiple times daily.” And is there any blood present in the stool?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I… I think so? Sometimes. It’s not like, a lot, but I've noticed it a couple of times. It kind of… mixes in. It's hard to tell sometimes, honestly, everything looks a bit… messed up. It definitely worried me, which is why I finally came in.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nahrwold, the presence of blood is concerning. Have you experienced any fever, abdominal pain, or nausea with these episodes?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Sometimes I get a bit of a tummy ache, like cramps. Not really bad, just… uncomfortable. And I think I’ve been a little warmer than usual, maybe a low-grade fever? It's hard to tell, I don't usually check my temperature. And… I think I've felt a little nauseous sometimes, but I haven’t actually been sick, if that makes sense. Just… queasy. Does that sound bad?
DOCTOR: It suggests a possible inflammatory process. Now, let’s review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I think… I think the doctor mentioned something about my gut when I was younger? Like, it was sensitive? My mom always said I had a delicate stomach. And I think… I think she mentioned celiac disease once? But I don’t remember ever getting officially diagnosed with anything. It was a long time ago, and I’ve moved around a lot. It’s all a bit blurry. Honestly, I’m not sure. I don't really keep track of all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Vague family history is… unhelpful. Have you had any recent travel?
PATIENT: Recent travel? Hmm… No, not really. We went to visit my husband’s parents in… Ohio, a couple of months ago? But that wasn't very far. And before that… I can’t really remember. I’m really sorry, I’m not very good at remembering dates or details. Everything just feels a bit… foggy.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Um, let me think… Just this, really. It's for my blood pressure. My doctor prescribed it last year. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that’s not very often. Oh! And I tried some probiotics a while ago, when I was reading about my stomach online, but they didn't seem to do anything. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Afterwards, I’ll order some stool samples to rule out any bacterial or parasitic infections. This is standard procedure, Ms. Nahrwold. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. No, that’s… that's fine. I mean, I trust you. A stool sample… right. Sounds… unpleasant, but if it helps, then sure. Let me just… I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat on your back, Ms. Nahrwold. I’ll begin with auscultation. Take deep, regular breaths… yes… yes… Increased bowel sounds present. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please inform me if you experience any discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Um, no, not really. It's… a little tender, maybe, on the lower left side? But not like, painful. Just… sensitive. Like if you press a little too hard. Ooh, yeah, right there. That’s a little uncomfortable. But it’s okay, I guess. It’s just… my stomach is always a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the left lower quadrant noted. I’ll need to collect a stool sample for analysis. The nurse will provide you with the necessary container and instructions. It’s crucial you follow those instructions carefully for accurate results. I will also order a complete blood count to assess for any signs of infection or inflammation. We will review the results once they are available. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Nahrwold?
PATIENT: Um, okay. A stool sample… and blood work. Right. I guess… how long will it take to get the results? And… will I need any more tests after that? I just… I’m a little worried about what it could be, you know? I just want to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: The results typically take 2-3 business days. As for further testing, that will depend on the outcome of these initial analyses. We will cross that bridge when we come to it. It’s important not to jump to conclusions prematurely. I suspect this is likely a case of gastroenteritis, possibly exacerbated by your… dietary indiscretions. But we must rule out more serious conditions. The nurse will provide you with after-visit summary with specific instructions. Do you have any other questions before I conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. Thank you, Dr. Blim. .
