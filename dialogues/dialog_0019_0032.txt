DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Renzi, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. A delicate matter. My wife insisted I come. Something about… a bit of leakage. Yes, leakage. Down there. It's been going on for… some time now, I suppose. Though I couldn't tell you how long. Time slips away, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does. And you're right to come in, it’s good you are. There’s no need to be embarrassed at all, Mr. Krok. These things are quite common, especially as we get older. “Leakage,” as you put it… is that happening constantly, or does it happen with certain activities, like coughing or sneezing?
PATIENT: Coughing, yes. That's it, definitely coughing. And… when I strain myself, lifting things. Though I don't lift much these days. My back isn’t what it used to be. It’s not a flood, mind you. Just… a dampness. A bothersome dampness. And sometimes… a bit of… discharge. Though I haven’t paid that much attention to it, frankly. My wife is the one who notices these things. She has a very keen sense of smell, you see. A blessing and a curse, that woman.
DOCTOR: A keen sense of smell is a useful thing! It sounds like it's related to effort – coughing and straining. Okay, so dampness and some discharge with those activities. And it's not constant?
PATIENT: No, not constant. Definitely not constant. Mostly just when I… exert myself. Or when I have a particularly robust cough. This weather, you know? The humidity. It plays havoc with my sinuses. And everything else, I suspect. It's been a long winter, followed by a sticky summer. Honestly, I don't know what’s normal anymore. I just want it to stop, really. It’s… undignified.
DOCTOR: I completely understand wanting it to stop, and feeling like it impacts your dignity. We’ll try to figure out what’s going on. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Not… acute pain, no. A bit of discomfort, perhaps. A stinging sensation, sometimes, at the very end. But I thought that was just… age. Everything stings a little when you get to my age, doesn’t it? Everything aches and creaks and stings. I've learned to live with it. It’s not enough to bother me, generally. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. It’s good to know what you’ve been experiencing, even if it's something you've become used to. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or any prostate problems before?
PATIENT: Prostate problems? Goodness. My doctor, Doctor Habib, he mentioned something about the prostate… years ago. Something about it enlarging, as men get older. He said it was perfectly normal. I don’t recall any specific diagnosis, though. Just… a routine check, I believe. Diabetes? No, never. I enjoy a sweet pastry now and then, but I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. My wife keeps a close watch on my diet, you see. She's very particular.
DOCTOR: It sounds like Dr. Habib likely mentioned benign prostatic hyperplasia – BPH, or an enlarged prostate. That's very common as men age, as you said. And that's good to hear about no diabetes. Do you recall if you’ve ever had any surgeries, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Ah, yes! My appendix, when I was a young man. A rather unpleasant affair, I remember. And… a hernia repair, many years later. That was less bothersome, thankfully. A routine procedure. And… I had a rather nasty bout of shingles, a few years back. They had to do something about that, I suppose. Though I don’t recall the specifics. It involved needles, as most things do.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix, hernia repair, and shingles. Thank you. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill. My wife handles all of that, you understand. She keeps a chart, a very detailed chart. And… something for my cholesterol, perhaps? I’m not entirely sure. Honestly, I just take whatever pills she gives me. She insists it’s important. And… occasionally, an aspirin. For my knees, when they act up. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, something for blood pressure, cholesterol, and aspirin as needed. We’ll definitely confirm all of that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental things?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather robust, constitutionally. I can tolerate most things. A bit of a stuffy nose in the spring, perhaps. Pollen, you know. But nothing serious. Nothing that requires a doctor’s attention. My wife tried to get me to avoid shellfish once, but I refused. I enjoy a good shrimp scampi far too much.
DOCTOR: I understand completely! Alright, Mr. Krok, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief abdominal exam. Then I’d like to do a rectal exam, which will allow me to check your prostate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… rectal exam? Goodness. Well. I suppose it’s necessary, if you think so. I'm not particularly fond of the idea, mind you. It sounds… invasive. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. As long as it won't take too long. And… be gentle, if you would. This isn’t exactly a pleasant topic, you understand. My wife will be most relieved when this is over.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Mr. Krok. It’s not the most comfortable exam, I agree, but it’s a very important part of evaluating the problem. I promise to be as gentle and efficient as possible. It won't take long. First, let's just check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we'll move on to the exam when you're ready. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… acceptable. As long as it’s quick. And you promise to be gentle. My wife will want a full report, you see. She’s very thorough. And she’ll undoubtedly ask all sorts of questions. I just want this over with, honestly. It’s a most undignified situation.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krok. We'll get through this quickly and thoroughly. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: There. Be careful, if you would. It's a bit tender. Old age, you know. Everything aches. And please, try not to take too long. This is all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, just relax your arm for me. It might feel a little tight. I'm getting a reading of 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. His heart sounds regular, and lungs are clear, but with some diminished breath sounds bilaterally. That's not unexpected at your age, though. Everything sounds… reasonable so far. Now, are you ready to proceed with the brief abdominal exam?
PATIENT: Reasonable. Yes, that's a good word for it. Reasonable. As long as everything is… reasonable. Very well. Proceed. I suppose it’s best to get it over with. Though I confess, I’m not looking forward to it. Try not to poke too much, Doctor. I bruise easily, you know. My wife will have a field day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Just let me know if anything feels tender. I am noticing some mild tenderness when I press on your lower abdomen. Nothing alarming, but it's good to note. Now, if you're comfortable, we can proceed with the rectal exam. I'll need you to lie on your side with your knees bent. It will only take a moment, and I will be as gentle as possible. We can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Questions? Goodness, yes. Is it… painful? And how long will it take? My wife will want to know exactly what you’re doing. She’s very inquisitive. And… will it be cold? Everything seems to be cold these days. I'm a bit chilly, you know. And… will I feel any… pressure? I’m just trying to prepare myself, you understand. It’s all rather… daunting.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Mr. Krok. It shouldn’t be painful, but you might feel some pressure, similar to needing to have a bowel movement. It will only take a minute or two, I promise. I use a warm, lubricated glove, so it shouldn’t be cold. I'll be checking for any abnormalities in your prostate and rectum. I'll explain everything as I go. Just let me know if you need me to stop at any time. Now, if you're ready, you can lie on your side with your knees bent, and I’ll proceed. Remember, you’re in control here, and we can stop at any moment.
PATIENT: Very well. Get it over with. Quickly, if you would. And gently. Very gently. My wife… well, she’ll want details. She always does. Just… hurry, Doctor. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, just relax as much as you can. I'm just checking… Okay, I'm finished. That wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: Not… pleasant. That’s the best I can say. Not pleasant at all. It felt… invasive. And a bit cold, despite your assurances. It certainly wasn't comfortable. But… I suppose it’s over now. Will you tell me what you found? My wife will be expecting a full report. And please, be thorough. She’s very… particular.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s over now, Mr. Krok. And you were very brave. I understand it wasn’t comfortable. What I found is that your prostate is enlarged, which is very common for men your age. This is called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It’s not cancer, and it doesn’t necessarily mean you need treatment. However, it can cause the symptoms you've been experiencing – the leakage, the dampness, and the discomfort. Your rectum was clear, which is good. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? Like a balloon? Is it… dangerous? My wife always worries about everything. She reads those medical articles online, you know. Dreadful things, some of them. She’ll want to know if it’s going to… spread. Or cause problems. And what does “treatment” involve? Will I need… surgery? I’m not fond of surgery. I’ve had enough of that, thank you very much. And will it affect… other things? She’ll undoubtedly ask about that as well.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Mr. Krok. It's not like a balloon, exactly. It's more of a gradual enlargement. It’s not dangerous in itself, but it can cause bothersome symptoms, as you've experienced. It's unlikely to "spread," as it's not an infection or cancer. As for treatment, there are several options, and surgery is rarely the first step. We can start with more conservative measures, like lifestyle changes – reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, and practicing pelvic floor exercises. We can also consider medication to help relax the muscles in your prostate and improve your urine flow. We'll discuss the risks and benefits of each option and decide together what's best for you. There are medications called alpha-blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. They help to shrink the prostate and make urination easier. Those are options we can consider if conservative measures don't work. Do you want me to explain how they work in more detail?
PATIENT: Medications… and exercises? It sounds… complicated. My wife will want to know the side effects of these… alpha-blockers and… inhibitors. She’ll make a chart, I’m sure of it. A very detailed chart, with all the pros and cons. And she’ll want to know if they interact with my other pills. She’s very thorough, you understand. And she’ll want to know… if they’ll affect my… vitality. She always asks about that. Honestly, I just want this to go away. Is there nothing simpler? No magic potion, or… something? This is all rather overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krok. It does sound overwhelming, and you're right to be concerned about side effects and interactions. We'll definitely review all of that in detail. Let's start with the simplest approach – lifestyle changes and pelvic floor exercises. These can often make a significant difference, and they have no side effects. As for pelvic floor exercises, they strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and prostate. They’re like exercises for your pelvic region. A physical therapist can teach you how to do them correctly. As for a "magic potion," I wish there were one, but unfortunately, there isn’t. These medications aren’t cures, but they can help manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. We'll start with the lowest effective dose and monitor your progress closely. We can always adjust the treatment plan if needed. To be sure, I will order a PSA blood test to rule out other conditions. I'll also send a urine sample to the lab to check for infection. This will help me make a more informed diagnosis and tailor the treatment plan to your specific needs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Well, I suppose it’s necessary. My wife will want all the data, you see. She likes data. And she’ll want to know what a… “PSA” is. And what, precisely, it measures. And she’ll want to know the normal range. And if my results are outside of that range. Honestly, it’s exhausting just thinking about it. Very well. Do the tests. And tell your nurse to explain everything to my wife. She has a very inquisitive mind, you see. And she doesn’t like to be left in the dark. She'll want a full report, with all the details. And she'll want to know when the results will be available. Honestly, I just hope this doesn’t take too long. I’m a bit tired, you see. All this talk about prostates and medications and tests… it’s quite draining.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krok. I'll make sure the nurse explains everything to your wife in detail, and we’ll provide you with a copy of the results as soon as they are available. The PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. It's a marker for prostate health, and the results can help us determine if further investigation is needed. The normal range varies depending on your age and ethnicity, but we’ll discuss your specific results with you in detail. I will have the nurse draw the blood and collect the urine sample before you leave. And I'll write a note to the lab to expedite the results. You should receive them within a few days. In the meantime, try to reduce your caffeine and alcohol intake, and I'll give you a handout with instructions for pelvic floor exercises. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Enough talk about prostates for one day, thank you very much. Just… get the tests done, and tell your nurse to explain everything to my wife. She’ll take it from there, I’m sure. Honestly, I just want to go home and rest. All this talk… it’s quite draining. Thank you, Doctor. For your time. And your patience. My wife will be very grateful. She worries about everything, you see. And she likes to be informed. So thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krok. It was my pleasure. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood and collect the urine sample. You take care of yourself, and try to rest. And please, tell your wife I said hello. I’m glad she’s involved in your care. It sounds like she’s a wonderful partner. Have a good day, Mr. Krok.
