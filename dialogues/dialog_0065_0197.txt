DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarotta. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about getting a card… a medical card for driving, you see. I do some ridesharing now and then, and I think I need to be up to date with everything. It's just to be safe, you know? I want to make sure I'm allowed to keep doing it.
DOCTOR: A medical card for ridesharing…right. So, you’re requesting a medical evaluation to ensure you meet the requirements for commercial driving, specifically ridesharing. And you want to confirm your eligibility. Just to be perfectly clear, this isn't because you're experiencing any difficulties driving, correct?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no difficulties at all! Not a one. I’ve been driving for… well, a very long time. It’s just that the rules change, don't they? And I got a notice saying I should update my card. Better safe than sorry, as they say. I don't want any trouble with the company or anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, regulations do change frequently. Alright. To properly complete this evaluation, I'll need to gather some information. Let's start with a review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or anything else that requires ongoing treatment?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed about ten years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. And… oh! I had my gallbladder removed, maybe fifteen years ago? Other than that… no, I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. I see my regular doctor every six months for checkups.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. Every morning, with my breakfast. I haven’t changed the dose in… oh, goodness, probably five years now. My doctor keeps a good record of everything. If you need more details, I can get you his information.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. None at all. I eat just about anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. Though I try to watch my sugar these days, just to be healthy.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, dementia, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see. My father had heart disease, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young, maybe in his sixties. And my aunt, on my mother's side, had some memory problems when she got older. Not sure what exactly, but she needed a lot of care. Other than that… not that I can recall. We weren’t a family that talked about illnesses much. Mostly just focused on getting through the day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And regarding your lifestyle… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not any of those. I used to drink a little wine with dinner, years ago, but I stopped that a long time ago. Never smoked a day in my life, and I certainly don't take any… recreational drugs. I prefer a nice cup of green tea, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination to assess your overall health. We’ll check your vision, hearing, reflexes, and basic neurological function. It's standard procedure for this type of evaluation. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s perfectly fine. I figured there would be some sort of examination. I’m ready whenever you are, Doctor. Just try to be gentle, please. My joints aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please follow me to the examination table. We'll start with your vision. Please sit facing the chart. I'll need you to read the smallest line you can see on this chart, with each eye separately. Now, please cover your left eye with your hand…
