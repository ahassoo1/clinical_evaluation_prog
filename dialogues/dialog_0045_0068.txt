DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha Queener, 59 years old. Good. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. It’s this… swelling. After the cancer, you know? It’s in my leg. It’s not painful, exactly, just… big. It bothers me when I walk.
DOCTOR: Right. "After the cancer." Okay. And this swelling… in which leg, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh! Sorry. The left one. My left leg. It started, oh… maybe a month ago? It gets worse if I stand too long. It’s just… annoying, really. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: A month ago, you said. And it's progressively gotten bigger with prolonged standing. Hmm. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg, Sasha?
PATIENT: No, no redness. And not really warm, no. Just… puffy. Like a balloon, almost. It doesn’t hurt to touch, either. I checked. I was worried it was… something bad. It’s just… hard to explain. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Puffy, not red, no pain to the touch. Okay. And have you had any changes in your skin texture – any pitting when you press on it, or thickening?
PATIENT: Pitting? Oh dear… I don’t… I don't know what that means. I just know it’s swollen. Like… if you push on it, it leaves a little dent? Is that… pitting? I’m not good with medical words, sorry. I just want it to go away.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's pitting. Alright. So, you do notice some pitting when you press on the swollen area. Okay. Now, after your… cancer treatment, have you had any issues with blood clots, or have you been on any blood thinners?
PATIENT: Oh… blood clots… the doctor gave me something, a shot, to prevent them. After the surgery, I think. It was… every day for a while. Then stopped. I don’t remember what it was called. Everything is a bit fuzzy, honestly. It was a long time ago. Medicare paid for it, so… I just did what they said.
DOCTOR: Right. A preventative shot for clots after surgery. Okay. And when was this surgery, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… let me think. It was… three years ago, maybe? In the spring, I think. April, maybe? It feels like a lifetime ago. It was for… breast cancer. They removed… you know. Everything. I just… want this swelling to stop. It’s making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha. Three years post-breast cancer surgery with preventative clot medication. We need to rule some things out. Let’s take a look at the leg, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. It’s… it’s right here, you see? <gestures to her left leg> It’s hard to hide, really. Is it something bad? I’m getting scared now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's feel that… Yes, there's definitely edema, pitting edema, as you mentioned. No obvious signs of infection – no redness, no warmth. Pulse is present in the foot, good. Now, let me check the circumference of your leg to get a baseline measurement. <Begins measuring the circumference of Sasha's left leg with a tape measure, then compares it to her right leg> Hmm. Significantly larger than your right leg, as expected. It's soft to the touch, but… it's concerning, given your history.
PATIENT: Oh. Concerning? What does that mean concerning? Is it the cancer back? I thought… I thought I was finished with all of that. <fidgets with her hands> Please tell me it's not the cancer. I can't go through that again.
DOCTOR: Now, Sasha, let’s not jump to conclusions. It doesn't necessarily mean the cancer is back. Swelling like this can have several causes. However, given your history, we need to investigate further. It could be lymphedema, which is common after removing lymph nodes. But we need to rule out a deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot – first. I'm going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your leg to check for clots. It's a non-invasive test.
PATIENT: A Doppler… ultrasound? Is that… painful? I don't like needles, Doctor. And I really don't want another shot. Will it take long? I have a bridge game this afternoon. And will Medicare cover it? I worry about all these costs…
DOCTOR: No needles, Sasha. It's completely painless. It uses sound waves to create an image of the veins in your leg. It shouldn't take more than 30-45 minutes. And yes, Medicare should cover it, but we'll have to verify your coverage. We have a technician here in the clinic who can perform the test right away. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. Do you want me to schedule that for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. As soon as possible. I want to know what’s going on. And… please make sure they know about Medicare. I don’t want any surprises. I really need to get to my bridge game, though. It’s… very important. <fidgets nervously>
DOCTOR: Alright, I've scheduled you for a Doppler ultrasound with the technician, Mrs. Queener. They're aware of your Medicare coverage. It’s booked for 2:00 PM today, which should give you plenty of time to get to your bridge game, assuming everything goes smoothly. The technician will explain the procedure to you before they begin. They’ll give you a gown to change into. In the meantime, try to elevate your leg as much as possible. And avoid prolonged standing. Once we have the results of the ultrasound, we’ll know what’s causing the swelling and can discuss a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing serious. And… thank you for fitting me in. I really appreciate it. <stands up slowly> I guess I'll go wait for the technician then. I hope this doesn’t take too long. <shuffles towards the door>
DOCTOR: Alright. You're welcome. The technician will call you when they're ready. Try not to worry. We'll get to the bottom of this.
