DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. My name is Dr. Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see you're here today with Medicare. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Yes, Medicare is what I use. Well, it’s a bit… awkward to talk about, honestly. I've noticed a change in my body odor lately, and it's worrying me. It just doesn't smell like me anymore, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright to discuss anything that's concerning you, Kerriann. Changes in body odor can be a little unsettling, and it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. It's not uncommon, and often there's a straightforward explanation. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this change?
PATIENT: Okay, good. It’s just… it’s stronger, and… different. Not necessarily bad, just… not right. I usually have a pretty mild scent, if any at all, but this is noticeable. I noticed it about… oh, maybe three weeks ago? At first I thought it was just because of the heat, you know? It's been so warm lately, but it hasn’t gone away even when it’s cooler. And it seems to be… all over? Like not just under my arms, but… everywhere. I’m not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Kerriann. It's helpful to know it's not localized to just one area. And that it started about three weeks ago despite the heat. “All over” is good information. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the scent itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. It’s… not like sweat, exactly. It’s… kind of musky? Almost… metallic, a little? It's faint, but definitely there. It's not like a strong, overpowering smell, but if I smell my clothes, or even just my skin, I can detect it. It's not like a typical body odor smell, that's what's bothering me the most. I've tried different deodorants, but nothing seems to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, “musky” and “metallic” – that’s helpful. And the fact that different deodorants aren't making a difference is also important. It does sound different than typical body odor. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been a little more tired than usual, maybe? Just a general feeling of being run down, I guess. Nothing major. And I've been sweating a little more, even when I’m not doing much. But I figured that was just because of the heat, too. No weight loss or fever or anything like that. I'm still eating pretty normally, and I haven’t changed anything about my diet. Oh! And my periods have been… irregular. A little later than usual, and not as heavy. I’m 49, so I figured that might be starting, you know? Perimenopause.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kerriann, thank you for sharing all of that. The increased fatigue, the sweating, and the irregular periods are all definitely things we need to consider. Given your age and the changes you're describing, perimenopause is a very plausible explanation. However, we should rule out other potential causes as well. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. But nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I broke my arm once, but that’s it. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I haven't been to the doctor in… oh, goodness, probably five years. Just for a check-up. Everything was fine then. I do have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but it's not too bad. I take ibuprofen for it sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant medical history besides childhood illnesses, tonsillectomy, a broken arm, and some arthritis in your hands. And you take ibuprofen as needed for the arthritis. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen, when I need it. And I take a multivitamin every morning, just a basic one. Nothing else. I don't really like taking a lot of pills, so I try to avoid it if I can. I drink a lot of water, and I try to eat healthy, but other than that, I don’t really have any habits that I think would be contributing to this. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed, a multivitamin daily, no smoking, minimal alcohol. That's all very helpful. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, and she had arthritis, like me. My father had heart problems, he had a stroke a few years before he died. My sister has diabetes, type 2. And my grandmother on my mother’s side had thyroid problems, I think. She had to have surgery on it. Other than that… not that I know of. We don’t really talk about medical history much in my family, to be honest. It’s kind of a taboo subject. But those are the things that come to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so family history of high blood pressure, arthritis, heart problems, and thyroid issues. That’s useful information. Now, I'd like to ask about any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I’m not allergic to pollen, I spend a lot of time outdoors working, and I haven’t had any problems with that. I like animals, and I haven't ever had a reaction to them either. No food allergies. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I haven’t had any trouble with any medications either, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Kerriann. No known allergies. Okay, so we've covered a lot of ground. Given your symptoms, your past medical history, your family history, and the fact that you’re 49, several possibilities come to mind. Perimenopause is certainly one, and it can definitely cause changes in body odor. However, we need to rule out other potential causes, such as thyroid issues, or even less common things. I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve checking your thyroid, listening to your heart and lungs, and a general assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I understand. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you think it’s best to do a physical exam, then please do. I want to figure out what’s going on, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I'd rather be safe than sorry. Where would we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I appreciate your cooperation, Kerriann. We'll start with your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your thyroid gland in your neck. I’ll also take a quick look at your skin and check for any unusual findings. If you could please have a seat on the table, we can get started. I’ll try to make it as comfortable as possible.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I'm not used to this, so I might be a little… tense.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Please don't hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. That's perfectly alright. We'll go slowly, and I'll explain everything as I go. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not significantly. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your temperature is normal at 98.6. Your lungs sound clear, and your heart rhythm is regular, though I do hear a slight murmur, which we should investigate further. It’s likely benign, but it’s good to note. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, and there’s a small nodule on the left lobe. It’s small, but we’ll want to get an ultrasound to evaluate it further. Your skin looks generally healthy. No rashes or unusual findings.
PATIENT: Oh. A nodule? Is that… bad? The murmur too… I'm starting to get a little worried now. Is it something serious, Doctor? I didn't even know I had a murmur. I haven't felt sick or anything, so this is all… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Kerriann, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel worried. Let’s take things one step at a time. The nodule on your thyroid is small, and many thyroid nodules are benign – meaning they are not cancerous. However, we need to get an ultrasound to determine its size, shape, and characteristics, and potentially a biopsy to be certain. As for the heart murmur, it’s often harmless and doesn't require treatment, especially if you’re not experiencing any symptoms. But because it’s new, we should get an echocardiogram—an ultrasound of your heart—to assess its severity and rule out any underlying problems. We're going to run some blood tests as well. I want to check your thyroid function, your complete blood count, and your hormone levels. This will help us get a more complete picture of what’s going on and determine the best course of action. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, that sounds… thorough. Blood tests, ultrasound, echocardiogram. It’s a lot, but I’d rather know, you know? I guess I was hoping it was just… perimenopause or something simple. But it sounds like it could be more complicated. So, the blood tests first? Where do we do those? Will I have to come back another day? And how long will it take to get the results? I just have a lot of appointments already, so I’m trying to plan things.
DOCTOR: You're right, it is a lot, and it’s good you’re asking questions. I want to be as thorough as possible to get to the bottom of this. Yes, we'll start with the blood tests. The phlebotomist is available right now, so we can do them today. It’s just a standard blood draw, and shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes. They’ll draw a few vials and send them to the lab. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have those, we can schedule the ultrasound and echocardiogram. Those will likely be done at the imaging center across town. I’ll have my nurse schedule those appointments for you once we have the blood test results. I'll also give you a prescription for a multivitamin with selenium, as selenium deficiency can sometimes contribute to thyroid issues. Let’s get the blood draw done, and then we can talk about scheduling the imaging tests. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it for now. Selenium… okay, I’ll take that. Blood draw first, then scheduling. Alright. Lead the way, Doctor. I’m ready to get this over with. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kerriann. That’s exactly what we’re here for – to help you feel like yourself again. It’s a process, but we’ll get there.
