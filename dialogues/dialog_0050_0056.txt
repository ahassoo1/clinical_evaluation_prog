DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Though I must say, I find these appointments rather… inefficient. I was informed this was necessary, something about… stress. Honestly, it’s the young people. They simply don’t understand the value of a well-ordered library. It’s quite tiresome, really. I suppose that’s what they want to hear.
DOCTOR: Indeed. While I appreciate your…perspective, Mr. Schlatterer, we do strive to address all concerns a patient may have. “Stress,” as you say, can manifest in a variety of ways. To best understand what’s going on, perhaps you could elaborate on what specifically led you to schedule this appointment?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Honestly, it’s a… a general state of affairs. Constant disruptions, requests for… frivolous materials. They want graphic novels, Doctor! Graphic novels instead of proper literature. And the noise. It’s simply dreadful. It interferes with… with the quiet contemplation one requires for scholarly pursuits. My assistant suggested I come. Said I was… “irritable.” A ridiculous notion. I believe that’s the gist of it. A lack of respect, that’s what it is.
DOCTOR: I see. So, primarily disturbances at your place of work – the library, you said – are causing you… distress. And your assistant noted a change in your temperament. To clarify, Mr. Schlatterer, are these disruptions a recent development, or have they been ongoing for some time?
PATIENT: Ongoing. Oh, yes, quite ongoing. Though it's… worsened recently. New students, I believe. A particularly… undisciplined cohort. They seem to believe the library is some sort of social club. Honestly, the standards have simply plummeted. I can’t recall precisely when it became so… pronounced. Time rather slips away, you understand. Important dates… they aren’t always top of mind when one is dedicated to preserving knowledge.
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual increase in stressors at work. Now, aside from the irritability and disturbances, have you noticed any other changes in how you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… my sleep hasn’t been particularly restful. I find myself… waking up. Thinking about… arrangements. The Dewey Decimal System requires constant vigilance, you know. Ensuring everything is properly categorized. It’s… exhausting. And my appetite… isn’t what it once was. Though that could simply be the quality of the cafeteria food. Dreadful stuff, truly. One can’t expect a proper meal these days.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty sleeping, and a decreased appetite. Do you find yourself losing weight, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Losing weight? I haven't bothered to check. Honestly, Doctor, I have more pressing matters to attend to. The state of the periodical section is simply appalling. But… yes, my trousers may be a bit looser. It’s hardly a matter of concern. I'm not one to indulge in… frivolous self-observation. It's likely just the stress. A temporary fluctuation, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, while I appreciate your dedication to your work, these symptoms – difficulty sleeping, decreased appetite, and unintentional weight loss – warrant further investigation. It's possible this is simply stress, but it’s important to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. And I’d also like to order some routine blood work. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? A physical exam? Doctor, with all due respect, I came here to discuss workplace frustrations, not to be subjected to… indignities. I assure you, my health is perfectly adequate. A bit of sleeplessness is hardly cause for alarm. Honestly, this is precisely the sort of bureaucratic nonsense I was hoping to avoid. Is this absolutely necessary? I have a rather important cataloging project to resume this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, while I respect your time and dedication, my primary concern is your well-being. These symptoms, taken together, could indicate a number of underlying conditions. I understand your reluctance, but refusing a basic assessment would be… imprudent. It's a standard procedure, and it will allow us to determine the best course of action. Furthermore, as your physician, I am recommending these tests. While I value your opinion, I am obligated to provide you with the best possible care. So, yes, it is absolutely necessary. We can begin with a brief examination of your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then proceed from there. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well. Do what you must. But I assure you, it will be a waste of time. A complete and utter waste. I haven't felt this… bothered since they rearranged the biography section. Honestly, the inefficiency… But proceed. Just… be quick about it. I have important work to do. And please, don't touch the cataloging system. It's a delicate balance.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please remove your jacket and roll up your sleeve. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Systolic 148, diastolic 86. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I’m listening now for any murmurs or irregularities... No obvious abnormalities detected. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable at this point. However, given your reported weight loss and change in appetite, I still recommend the blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Unremarkable. Precisely what I expected. A complete waste of valuable time. Very well, proceed with your… blood work. But I must insist, Doctor, if this delays my return to the library, I will be most displeased. Honestly, the Dewey Decimal System doesn’t maintain itself. Just… get it over with. And please, be gentle. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a quick prick. I’ll send the sample to the lab, and we should have the results back within a few business days. In the meantime, I'll review your chart and consider potential causes for your symptoms. Here you go. Please keep this bandage on for at least an hour. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I would recommend trying to get some extra rest and maintain a balanced diet, despite your… reservations about the cafeteria food. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. I believe this entire exercise has been rather… unproductive. However, I do have a request. When you review my chart, please note my concerns regarding the new graphic novel acquisitions. They are simply unsuitable for a scholarly environment. Now, if you’ll excuse me, Doctor, I have a library to run. And a cataloging system to maintain. Don’t call unless absolutely necessary. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. I will make a note of your concerns. Please, take care, and don't hesitate to contact us if anything changes. .
