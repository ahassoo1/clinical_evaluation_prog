DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Emiliano. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my foot. It’s… hurtin’ real bad. Been hurtin’ for a little while now, and it’s gettin’ worse. It’s a sore, you see, and it won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano. I appreciate you sharing that with me. “Hurtin’ real bad” and a sore that’s getting worse… could you tell me a bit more about when this pain started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, maybe two, three months ago? I’m not so good with dates these days. It started as just a little owie, you know? Like a scrape. But it didn’t get better like scrapes usually do. It just… stayed. And now it’s a real bother. It hurts to walk, even with slippers. I try to stay off it, but… well, I gotta get around, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand. Two to three months ago, starting as a small irritation that hasn’t improved and is now causing you difficulty walking… That’s helpful to know. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a sharp pain, not like when I stub my toe. It’s more… a deep ache. And sometimes it feels like… pins and needles, you know? Especially at night. It keeps me awake sometimes. And it’s red around the sore, very red. I try to keep it clean, but… it just doesn't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: A deep ache with some pins and needles, worse at night, and redness around the area… Thank you for that detailed description, Emiliano. Now, can you tell me where exactly on your foot is this pain located?
PATIENT: It’s on the bottom of my foot, Doctor. Right here… … under where my big toe bends. It’s kinda hard to see ‘cause of my skin, but it’s right there. It’s not on the toe, but right under where it bends. And it’s gotten bigger, the red part, you see? I worry about it.
DOCTOR: I see. Located on the arch of your right foot, under the big toe joint, and the redness is increasing. Thank you. Now, have you noticed any drainage or pus coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Hmm… sometimes. It’s not a lot, but… a little bit. It’s kinda… yellowish, I think. Not bright yellow, but kinda pale. And it smells… not good. I try to keep it covered with a clean bandage, but it still happens sometimes. It makes the bandage sticky, you know? I change it a couple times a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish drainage with an odor… Thank you for sharing that, Emiliano. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or swelling in your leg or ankle?
PATIENT: Fever… not really. I haven’t felt hot or anything. And no chills, no. My leg… it’s a little puffy sometimes, but I thought that was just ‘cause I don’t move around much. Swelling… maybe a little, but not much. It's hard to tell, you see? My legs swell up sometimes just from sittin’ too long. I don't know if it's different this time.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be hard to tell. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have diabetes, or have you ever been told you have problems with your blood sugar?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That's… that’s why I’m worried about this foot. The doctor told me… a long time ago… that I have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, that’s what they call it. I try to watch what I eat, but… it's hard. And I take the pills he gave me, every day. Sometimes I forget, but mostly I remember. It's been a long time since he checked it, though. Maybe a year? I don’t remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for telling me, Emiliano. Diabetes is important to know, especially with a foot sore. And you take pills for it… roughly once a year you see your doctor to monitor this?
PATIENT: Yes, about once a year. Sometimes a little longer if I feel okay. I should probably go more often, I know. I just… don't like going to the doctor. It reminds me of my wife, she used to take me to all the appointments. But yes, once a year for the sugar. He checks my numbers and gives me more pills. He told me to watch my feet, because of the sugar. That’s why I got so worried when this sore showed up. I didn’t want it to get bad.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re aware of the importance of foot care with diabetes, and it’s perfectly alright to feel that way about doctor visits. Now, apart from diabetes, do you have any other medical conditions, like heart problems, kidney issues, or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My heart… the doctor said it was a little weak a long time ago. He gave me some pills for that too. I take those every day with the sugar pills. And my legs… sometimes they feel cold and numb. The doctor said it was my circulation. Something about the blood not gettin’ to my feet very well. He said that was from the sugar too, I think. I don’t remember all the details. I just know my legs get cold easy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano. Heart condition and circulation problems… That’s helpful to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. When I was younger, I had my appendix taken out. That was a long time ago, maybe sixty years? And… when I broke my hip a few years back, I had to stay in the hospital for a while. They fixed it with a new hip, though. It still bothers me sometimes, but it’s better than it was. That was about five years ago, I think. I don’t remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Appendectomy and hip replacement… I appreciate you sharing that. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the pills for your diabetes and your heart?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, I take something for my arthritis. My joints get real achy, you know? Especially in the mornings. The doctor gave me a little white pill for that. And… sometimes I take something for pain, if the arthritis is real bad. But not every day, just when I need it. Oh, and sometimes I take something for my sleep, ‘cause I can’t sleep very well. But not every night, just when I’m really restless. It's hard to keep track of them all.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be a lot to keep track of. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat most things, although I try to stay away from too much sugar, you know, because of my… the sickness. And I haven’t taken any new medicines lately, so I don’t think I have any new allergies. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. I haven’t had much trouble with allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Emiliano. Finally, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I don't do much these days. I live alone since my wife passed away. I used to be a teacher, preschool teacher. Retired now, though. Mostly, I stay home and watch television. I used to like to garden, but it’s hard to get around now, with my hip and my feet. I try to eat healthy, but… it's hard. I like my sweets, you know? I don't smoke, and I don't drink much alcohol. Mostly, I just take it easy. A quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano, that gives me a very good understanding of your overall health. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to examine your foot. It will help me to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. It does hurt, though, so please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emiliano. I’m just going to gently feel around the area. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay, that’s tender, as expected. I see some redness and swelling, and there's a small open area. There's some warmth to the touch. I'm also checking your pulses in your foot. Your pulses are present, but somewhat diminished. I'll also check the sensation in your foot. Your sensation seems a little reduced, especially around the area of the sore. Finally, I'm going to check the flexibility of your ankle. There's some stiffness there. It seems you have some limited range of motion, as well. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam, Emiliano.
PATIENT: Oh, my. It feels… a little bit numb, you know? Especially when you touch it. And yes, it’s stiff. I haven’t been able to bend it very well lately. It’s just been too painful. What do you think, Doctor? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it appears you have a foot ulcer, likely complicated by neuropathy – that's the reduced sensation I found – and possibly some early signs of infection, given the redness, warmth, and drainage. The diminished pulses also suggest some possible issues with circulation, which is common in people with diabetes. It's concerning, but it’s important to address it promptly to prevent it from getting worse. We need to get a better understanding of the extent of the infection, if any, and assess the circulation to your foot. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar, kidney function, and for signs of infection. I'll also want to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any bone infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best. Blood tests and an X-ray. Alright. I… I just want it fixed. It hurts, and I don’t want to lose my foot. Is it going to be a long process? And will it be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Emiliano. It's good that we're addressing this now. We will do everything we can to get this under control. The blood tests and X-ray will give us a clearer picture, and then we can develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, it's very important to keep all weight off your foot as much as possible. I’m going to order you a special walking boot to help with that. We also need to keep the wound clean and protected. The nurse will give you specific instructions on wound care before you leave. As for cost, I will have the billing department contact you to discuss your insurance coverage and any potential out-of-pocket expenses. We can also explore options for financial assistance if needed. I'm also going to write a referral to a podiatrist – a foot specialist – for further evaluation and management. They are particularly skilled in treating diabetic foot ulcers. Would you be comfortable seeing a podiatrist?
PATIENT: A special boot… and the nurse will show me how to clean it? That sounds good. I’m not very good at things like that, so I’ll need the nurse’s help. And a foot specialist? Yes, that sounds… wise. If you think it’s best, I’ll see the specialist. So… blood tests, an X-ray, a special boot, and see a specialist. And the nurse will help me. Is there anything I need to do besides that? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: That’s right – blood tests, X-ray, special boot, and a referral to the podiatrist. The nurse will go over wound care instructions with you in detail, and she can answer any questions you have. Besides that, the most important thing is to monitor your blood sugar closely. If you have a glucose meter, check it regularly and keep a record of your readings. Avoid walking on your foot as much as possible, even with the boot. And keep the wound clean and dry. Also, be aware of any signs of worsening infection, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, drainage, or fever. If you notice any of those symptoms, contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Increased pain, redness, swelling, drainage, fever… I’ll remember that. I do have a meter, yes. I check it sometimes, not as often as I should. I’ll try to do better. I think… I think that’s all the questions I have right now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience with an old man like me. What happens next? When will I get the blood tests and the X-ray? And when will I see the podiatrist?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emiliano. It's my job to help, and I’m glad I could explain things clearly. The nurse will draw your blood right after this consultation. The X-ray can be done in the imaging department across the hall. They'll schedule that appointment for you before you leave. As for the podiatrist, I’m going to fax over the referral right now. Their office will contact you within a few business days to schedule an appointment. They’re located about ten minutes from here. I'll also send your primary care physician a summary of our findings and the plan of care, so they’re aware of what’s going on. Do you have any transportation concerns getting to the imaging department or to see the podiatrist?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I have a friend who drives me around sometimes. He’s a good friend. He can take me wherever I need to go. So… blood tests now, X-ray after that, podiatrist will call me. And my doctor will be informed. That sounds… manageable. Thank you, Doctor Chagaris. You’ve put my mind at ease. I think that's everything. Unless… is there anything you need from me before I go? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emiliano. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. And no, I don't need anything else from you at this time. Just remember to follow the instructions the nurse provides, and don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. The nurse is ready for you now. She’s just outside the door. It was a pleasure meeting you, Emiliano. I wish you all the best with your recovery. Please take care, and we'll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Chagaris. You too. And thank you again for everything.
