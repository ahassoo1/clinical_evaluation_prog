DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… the hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Over two days, that is quite persistent. And I understand how disruptive hiccups can be. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, you have no idea. They started… let me think… Tuesday afternoon, I believe. I was having tea with my friend, Fatima, and I just… hic… started. At first, it wasn’t a big deal, you know? A few little hiccups here and there. But then they just kept going. And going. Hic… It’s pretty much constant now. Not every second, but… frequently. I haven’t been able to sleep properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they started Tuesday afternoon while you were having tea with Fatima, and they’ve been pretty consistent since then, interfering with your sleep. Can you describe what the hiccups feel like?
PATIENT: Well, they feel like… a normal hiccup, I suppose. You know, that little jolt in your chest and then you hic… gasp for air? It's not painful, not at all. Just… annoying. And tiring. I keep trying those things people tell you – hold your breath, drink water quickly, get someone to scare me… nothing works. Hic… I even tried putting a spoonful of sugar on my tongue!
DOCTOR: I appreciate you trying those remedies – it shows you’ve been actively trying to get relief. It’s good to know it's not painful, though. And it sounds like you’ve explored quite a few common suggestions. To get a better understanding of what might be causing this, could you tell me about anything else that’s been going on recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my divorce was finalized about six months ago. That’s been… difficult. Not that I’m still upset, exactly. It was a long time coming, and it’s probably for the best. But it is a big change, you know? And I’ve been a bit stressed with getting everything sorted out, the paperwork, the house… things like that. Other than that… nothing major. I've been eating normally, I think. I had some spicy food last week, but I eat spicy food all the time. Hic… I don't think that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the divorce was finalized six months ago and that has been a source of stress, even though it was a long time coming. That's certainly a significant life event and can absolutely contribute to physical symptoms. You mentioned eating normally and having spicy food, but no other changes in your diet. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no chest pain, no trouble breathing. Just the hiccups. Hic… and maybe a little bit of tiredness, but that's probably from not sleeping properly, isn’t it? I haven’t felt nauseous or anything like that. My stomach feels okay. I guess… no. Just the hiccups. They're driving me mad!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Redeye. It sounds like, thankfully, there aren’t any other concerning symptoms. It’s good to hear you’re not experiencing fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Let’s see… I had pneumonia when I was a child, but I recovered fully. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. No major illnesses since then, really. I don’t take any regular medication. I’m allergic to penicillin, if that’s important. And… oh! I had a bad fall last year, twisted my ankle, but it healed okay. Hic… I think that’s everything. I've seen doctors regularly for check-ups, but nothing serious ever came up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pneumonia as a child, gallbladder removal ten years ago, a twisted ankle last year, and a penicillin allergy. No regular medications, and routine check-ups with no significant findings. That’s very helpful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. And her mother… my grandmother… she had high blood pressure. My father… he had a weak heart, I suppose. He died of a heart attack when he was fairly young. And my brother… he has asthma. Hic… That’s about all I can think of, really. Nothing too… dramatic. Mostly just the usual things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of type 2 diabetes in your mother, high blood pressure in your grandmother, a heart condition and early heart attack in your father, and asthma in your brother. That provides some useful information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. My husband smoked, bless his soul, but I always refused. It gives me a headache just being around it. Hic… I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe three or four times a week. Not a lot, but… a little. And I try to walk as much as I can, but it’s been hard lately with the hiccups, you know? Makes it difficult to breathe properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, occasional wine – three or four times a week – and you try to walk when you can. It makes sense that the hiccups would make walking more difficult. Finally, and this is just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, I love to cook. I'm Egyptian, so lots of vegetables, lentils, beans, rice. We eat a lot of fish. Chicken sometimes. Not a huge amount of red meat. I use a lot of spices, garlic, onions… and I do enjoy a good dessert now and then! Hic… Baklava is my weakness. I try to eat healthy, but I'm not perfect, you know? I eat a bit of everything. I don't really drink fizzy drinks or a lot of processed food. Mostly home-cooked meals.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Redeye. That gives me a very good understanding of your overall health. It sounds like you have a generally healthy lifestyle, with a balanced diet and regular attempts at exercise. Given the history of persistent hiccups, the recent life stressor of your divorce, and your family history, I suspect these hiccups are likely related to a combination of factors, potentially involving some irritation of the phrenic nerve – the nerve that controls your diaphragm. However, since they've been going on for over two days, it’s important to rule out any other potential causes. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll do a brief neurological exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Absolutely. I just want them to stop. Whatever I need to do. Listen to my heart, do your exam… I’m happy to cooperate. Hic… It's just... exhausting. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check a few of your reflexes. It won't take long. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Everything seems normal neurologically as well. No obvious signs of any nerve compression or other issues. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning given your current stress levels.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good, I suppose. As good as it can be with the hiccups. Hic… I’m glad everything seems normal, but I’m also still hiccuping, so… I’m not entirely relieved. So, what now, Doctor? Do you think it’s just the stress? Is there anything you can give me to make them stop?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Redeye. It’s good that the physical exam didn’t reveal anything concerning, but I agree, the hiccups are still the primary issue. While it’s likely the stress related to your divorce is contributing, hiccups lasting this long warrant further investigation to rule out other possibilities, even if they are less likely. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to check your electrolyte levels and kidney function, just to be sure. I'd also recommend a chest x-ray to rule out any underlying lung issues, though I don't suspect that's the case. In the meantime, I can prescribe a medication called baclofen, which is sometimes used to treat persistent hiccups. It works by calming the nerves that control your diaphragm. It’s not a guaranteed solution, but it can be helpful for some people. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. If you think those tests are a good idea, let's do them. I'm happy to take the medication, too. Anything is worth a try at this point. Hic... I just want to be able to sleep again. And not feel like I'm going to burst a lung every time I take a breath. So, yes, please. Tests and medication. What do I need to do next?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the orders for the CBC, BMP, and chest x-ray now. You can go to the lab downstairs, and they'll draw some blood. The x-ray can be done at the radiology center across the street. You don’t need an appointment for either one. I'll also write a prescription for baclofen. It’s 10mg, three times a day. You can pick it up at your pharmacy. It may cause some drowsiness, so be careful when driving or operating machinery. I also want you to monitor your symptoms. If the hiccups worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or fever – please contact me immediately. I’d like to see you back in one week to discuss the results of the tests and see how you're responding to the medication. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that works perfectly, Doctor. One week sounds good. I'll go to the lab and the radiology center right away. And I will definitely watch for any new symptoms. I appreciate you taking this seriously. Hic… and for prescribing the medication. Hopefully, this will finally put an end to this misery! Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I understand how frustrating this has been. We'll work together to get to the bottom of this. Here are the lab and radiology orders, and the prescription. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember to take it easy. I wish you the best of luck, and I look forward to seeing you next week. Feel free to take your time getting downstairs.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Reisig. You've been very kind. I will. Hic… Goodbye.
