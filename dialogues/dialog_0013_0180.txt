DOCTOR: Hi Hedy, nice to meet you. I’m Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s this tiredness. Just…always tired. And it’s…well, it’s embarrassing, but I keep wanting to eat dirt. Like, actual dirt. Don't look at me like that. It’s awful. I don’t want to, but I do. Is that even a thing?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. No judgment here at all, Hedy. It is a thing – we call it pica, the craving and eating of non-nutritive substances. It can sometimes be a sign of a nutrient deficiency, or something else going on. And the tiredness is definitely something we need to figure out. So, how long have you been feeling this tired?
PATIENT: Long… a while. Honestly, I don't keep track of that stuff. Months, maybe? Seems like forever. And the dirt thing…started around the same time, I guess. It comes and goes. Mostly when I'm really stressed, or…I don’t know. Just…when I feel weak. It's not like I'm eating buckets of it, okay? Just…a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little, when stressed or feeling weak. That’s helpful to know. Months of tiredness and the pica coinciding...that points us in a direction, for sure. Can you describe the tiredness?
PATIENT: Describe it? It's…like being weighted down. Like someone put a bunch of rocks in my shoes and told me to run a marathon. Everything feels…hard. Even getting out of bed. I just want to sleep. All the time. It’s not a restful sleep, either. I wake up tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, weighted down, hard to get going, not restful sleep… that sounds really draining. It definitely sounds like we need to look into why you’re feeling this exhausted. Do you have any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Um…I get headaches sometimes. And my stomach…it’s been off. Not…not sick sick. Just… unsettled. And I bruise easily, I think. My husband… used to say so, anyway. He…passed a while back.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, unsettled stomach, and easy bruising. That's good information. And I'm sorry for your loss. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Not really. I mean, I had the usual childhood stuff. Chickenpox, measles. Nothing major. I haven't really been to the doctor much. My husband took care of all that. He…he liked going to the doctor. I avoided it when I could.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood illnesses, but nothing significant diagnosed as an adult. And your husband handled most of your medical care. That's understandable. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…let me think. Oh! When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out. That's about it. Nothing else. I remember being really sick afterwards, but that’s it. I really don’t like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, and you're not a fan of hospitals, that’s good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family? What do you want to know? My mother…she was always tired too, now that I think about it. She always said she was just “low energy”. She…she passed a long time ago. My father…he was strong, a farmer. Healthy as a horse. Never sick a day in his life.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had similar fatigue, and your father was healthy. That’s helpful. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Heavens, no. Never. My husband didn’t approve. And… I just don't. Don't need any of that. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Not a one. Like I said, I don't really do doctors or pills. My husband had a little blood pressure medicine, but that's it. And I stopped taking that when…well, never mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Hedy, this is a lot of information, and I appreciate you sharing it with me. Before we get to an exam, just one more question. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, maybe not oysters, but that’s just because I don't like them. No reactions to anything, ever. Honestly, I’m pretty boring. Can we just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. You're not boring at all, Hedy, just… resilient. And I promise, we'll get through this as quickly as possible. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Then I’d like to check your skin and maybe do a quick neurological exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just… get it over with. I hate being poked and prodded. But hurry, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll be as quick as possible. Please sit back and relax. Your heart rate is a little fast, but the rhythm is regular. Lungs sound clear… Your abdomen is…soft, but a little tender in the upper right quadrant. Your skin is a little pale, and I notice some bruising on your arms. Neurologically, you seem to be intact, reflexes are normal. Okay, Hedy. Based on this exam and your history, your fatigue, the pica, the bruising, and the tenderness in your abdomen… I'm concerned about a possible iron deficiency anemia. And the pica can definitely be a sign of that. It could also indicate a vitamin deficiency or something else going on. We need to run some blood tests to confirm this. A complete blood count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More poking and prodding? Look, I don’t like needles. And I don't have insurance. This is going to be expensive, isn’t it? I really don’t have the money for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry about the cost and the needles, Hedy. It's completely valid. Let’s talk about the insurance situation first. There are some programs available that can help with lab costs for uninsured patients. I have a list here, and we can see if you qualify for any of them. As for the blood draw, it’s a quick procedure. And we can talk about techniques to make it as comfortable as possible. But these tests are really important to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Ignoring this could lead to more serious health problems down the road. We need to rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to consider getting the tests done, and let's explore the financial assistance options?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But if it’s going to cost a fortune, I’m not paying for it. And don't tell me I need it. I don't like being told what to do. Just… get it over with. What do I even have to do?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No pressure, Hedy. You’re in control here. Okay, I've ordered the blood tests. You’ll need to go to the lab across the street. They’ll draw about two vials of blood. It should take about 30 minutes. Here’s the requisition form. You'll need to take this with you. And here's the lab's address and phone number. Once the results are back—usually in a few days—we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. Do you have any questions about where to go or what to expect?
PATIENT: No. Just…tell me when I can leave. I have things to do. And don’t bother calling me unless it's important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Hedy. You’re free to go whenever you’re ready. I'll have the lab results sent to me, and I’ll reach out if anything concerning comes up. I hope you feel better soon. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before our follow-up appointment. Take care.
