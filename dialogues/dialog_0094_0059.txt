DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been having a bit of trouble with my speech lately. It’s…slurred, I suppose you’d say. It’s a bit difficult to explain, honestly. It just feels like the words aren’t coming out right.
DOCTOR: Okay, slurred speech… that's definitely something we should look into. It is often difficult to describe these things, so don't worry about being precise. When did you first notice this starting?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t the best. It feels like… a few weeks now? Maybe a month? It wasn’t sudden, more like it gradually got worse. I really can’t pinpoint a specific date, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That's alright, a gradual onset is helpful to know even without a specific date. And don’t worry about the memory, it happens. Has anything changed in your life around the time you noticed this—any illness, injury, new medications, or increased stress, perhaps?
PATIENT: Let me see… illness, no, not really. No new injuries either. Medications… I take a daily vitamin, that’s all. And stress… well, work is always a little stressful, isn’t it? I’m a construction manager, so there’s always something to worry about, deadlines and all. But nothing major that I can think of. My husband and I have been quite settled, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major changes in your health or life circumstances. That’s good information. Now, can you describe the slurred speech a little more?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. It’s like my tongue feels heavy sometimes, and the words just don’t come out clearly. It's not all the time, it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s worse when I’m tired, or if I’m talking quickly. Does that make any sense? It’s frustrating because I know what I want to say, but it doesn’t always sound right when I actually say it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. “Heavy tongue” is a helpful description. And it being worse with fatigue is also important. Are you experiencing any difficulty swallowing, or any weakness in your face or limbs?
PATIENT: Weakness… no, I don’t think so. I haven't noticed anything like that. Swallowing… No, not really. It doesn't feel difficult, if that makes sense. Sometimes I do cough a bit when I drink something quickly, but I always just put that down to going too fast. Is that something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t noticed any weakness. The coughing when drinking quickly is something we'll keep in mind. Let's do a quick examination, if you don’t mind. I'll check your cranial nerves, reflexes, and strength, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to ask you to follow my penlight with your eyes, keeping your head still. Just look at the tip of the pen as I move it around. Good. Eyes are tracking smoothly. Now, I’m going to ask you to smile for me, raise your eyebrows, and puff out your cheeks. This helps me assess the muscles in your face.
PATIENT: No problem at all, Doctor. Is that alright? It feels a bit silly, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: That's good. Everything looks normal so far. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your reflexes. Heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you relax your arms for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m trying to stay as relaxed as possible. It's just a bit unusual, being examined like this, but I understand it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. I’m also going to quickly test your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that enough pressure? I don’t want to hurt you!
DOCTOR: That's perfect, no need to worry about hurting me. It feels perfectly normal. Everything seems normal on the initial examination, which is reassuring. However, given your reported slurred speech, it’s important to investigate further. I'd like to order a few tests just to rule out any underlying causes. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything before. I'm perfectly fine with having tests, if it helps to figure out what's going on. What sort of tests are you thinking of, if you don't mind me asking?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll start with a basic blood work panel to check your overall health and rule out any vitamin deficiencies or infections. I also want to order an MRI of your brain, with and without contrast, to get a detailed look at the structures and rule out any neurological issues. It’s a fairly standard procedure and will give us a lot of information. The MRI will take about 30-45 minutes. Do you have any metal implants or anything like a pacemaker?
PATIENT: Metal implants… no, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I had braces when I was younger, but those were removed years ago. And no pacemaker or anything like that. I’ve never had any surgery that involved metal, to my knowledge. An MRI sounds a bit… intense, doesn’t it? Is it uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: No, it's not usually uncomfortable, though it can be a bit loud, so we'll provide you with earplugs. You'll be lying flat for the scan, and it's important to remain still. The technician will be able to communicate with you throughout the procedure. To prepare for the MRI, you'll need to remove any jewelry or metal objects. We'll give you a questionnaire to fill out regarding any potential contraindications. I’ll also refer you to a neurologist for a consultation. They are specialists in the nervous system and will be able to interpret the MRI results and provide further guidance. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds alright, I suppose. A neurologist, right. And the MRI… lying flat, with earplugs. I can handle that. A questionnaire… yes, that makes sense. It all sounds a bit daunting, but I understand it's necessary to figure out what's going on. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. When would I be able to schedule these appointments?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I'm glad I could clarify. Let me see… I can schedule the MRI for you at the imaging center downtown. They have availability next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10:00 AM… yes, that should be fine. No prior engagements that I can remember. That gives me a few days to prepare, too. Yes, Tuesday at 10:00 AM works perfectly. And what about the neurologist appointment? How long will I have to wait for that?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm scheduling the MRI for you now. As for the neurologist, the soonest appointment I can get you in with Dr. Anya Sharma is on August 12th at 2:00 PM. It's a little over a week out, but she's a highly recommended specialist. I’ll send you discharge instructions with details about the MRI preparation and the neurologist appointment. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: August 12th… a little over a week. That's alright, I suppose. I can wait. Thank you for getting me in so quickly. Hmm… actually, yes. What exactly are we looking for with all these tests? Is it something serious? I know you probably can't give me a diagnosis yet, but just a general idea would be helpful.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Adyn. Given your slurred speech, we’re looking for any possible cause that could affect your nervous system. This could range from something relatively minor, like a vitamin deficiency, to something more complex, such as a lesion or inflammation in the brain. The MRI will help us rule out any structural abnormalities. The neurologist will be able to interpret the results and determine the best course of action. It's important to remember that we're still in the early stages of investigation, and it's far too early to jump to any conclusions. We're simply gathering information to get a clearer understanding of what's going on. I want to assure you that we will work through this together, and I will keep you informed every step of the way. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: That… that makes sense. Gathering information. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly, Doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease. No, I think that’s all for now. I’ll just focus on getting to my appointments and following your instructions. Thank you again for everything, Doctor Gegan. I truly appreciate your time and patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. I'll see you next Tuesday, and I wish you all the best. .
