DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Well, it's...family history, really. My mother’s side…a lot of heart trouble. And her brother, he didn't even make it to sixty. I just…I want to know I’m not heading that way, you know? Get some peace of mind, I guess. It’s probably nothing, but…better safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: Right. “Better safe than sorry” is always a reasonable approach. A family history of cardiac issues is certainly something to take seriously. You're quite young, thankfully, but preventative measures are important. Let’s start with you then. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Not really. I mean, sometimes after a really big meal I feel a little…full, I guess? But that’s it. I try to eat healthy, mostly. And I walk…when I have time. Look, I’m an engineering teacher. Not a marathon runner. I spend a lot of time at a desk, if I’m being honest. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: “Bad” is a strong word. Sedentary lifestyles can contribute to cardiovascular risk, yes. It’s not ideal, but we can work with that. It's good you're aware of it. So, no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no palpitations… and this fullness after meals – is that accompanied by any nausea, indigestion, or bloating?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s just…like a pressure, I guess? Like I ate too much. It goes away pretty quickly. Look, I'm not here because I feel sick. I feel fine. I just want to know if I’m doomed, basically. Is that so much to ask? My ex-wife always said I worry too much.
DOCTOR: “Doomed” is rather…dramatic, Mr. Theriot. But I understand your concern, given the family history. We’ll explore this rationally. Let’s move on from symptoms for a moment. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I take nothing, really. Maybe an occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. I'm generally pretty healthy. Honestly, this whole thing is…a waste of my time, probably. But my sister insisted. She's the one who convinced me to come. She worries even more than I do.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, no regular medications. And you say you’ve never been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I had chickenpox as a kid, obviously, but that’s it. I’ve always been…lucky, I guess. Which is why I’m starting to think this whole thing is a big overreaction. My blood pressure was good at the dentist last year, I remember that. Is there a point to all this, or are you just trying to fill out paperwork?
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I assure you, I am not simply “filling out paperwork.” A thorough assessment is necessary, despite your excellent health history thus far. Now, let’s discuss your family history in a bit more detail. You mentioned your mother’s side. Can you tell me specifically what cardiac issues your mother and uncle experienced?
PATIENT: Fine. My mother had…high blood pressure, I think? And then…something with her cholesterol. She was always on pills for it. And my uncle…he had a heart attack. A big one. That’s why I’m worried. He was only fifty-eight. Didn't even make it to sixty. It was…quick. They said it was unexpected. He seemed fine before that.
DOCTOR: I see. High blood pressure and hypercholesterolemia in your mother, and a myocardial infarction in your uncle at a relatively young age. That is concerning. Now, just to be thorough, do you know if anyone else in your family has experienced any cardiac issues, such as arrhythmia, heart failure, or stroke?
PATIENT: Honestly, I have no idea. My mother didn't really talk about family history much. It wasn't a big thing. We weren't close, okay? And my uncle’s side…I barely met them. I wouldn’t know a stroke from a…a chipped tooth. Look, I’m an engineer. I deal with facts and figures, not…family drama and medical mysteries. Is this going somewhere, or are we just digging up old ghosts?
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, while I appreciate your directness, a complete medical history requires gathering as much information as possible. Alright, we'll proceed based on what you do know. Let’s switch gears then. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never. I mean, my mother smoked for a while, but I always thought it was disgusting. I exercise occasionally, and eat a reasonably healthy diet. I’m not a complete wreck, you know? I’m not some chain-smoking, couch-potato engineer.
DOCTOR: Very well. And how much alcohol do you consume, if at all?
PATIENT: Not much. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe once or twice a week. Nothing excessive. I need a clear head for my work, okay? I’m not going to be a brilliant engineering teacher if I’m constantly hungover. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m being interrogated. Is there a reason you’re asking all these questions? Are you expecting me to confess to some secret, unhealthy lifestyle?
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I am gathering information to assess your cardiovascular risk, as you requested. It is standard procedure. Now, let’s move on to physical activity. You mentioned exercising “occasionally.” Can you describe your typical exercise routine?
PATIENT: Look, it’s not a routine. It’s…when I have time. I walk sometimes. Maybe a couple of miles. And I’ll occasionally go for a hike with my sister. But it’s not regular. I have a demanding job, okay? I don’t have hours to spend at the gym. It’s…sporadic. Does that make sense? It’s not like I’m training for the Olympics, if that’s what you’re getting at. Is this really necessary? I just want to know if I’m going to die of a heart attack, not give you a detailed account of my leisure activities.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I understand your frustration. However, even sporadic exercise is relevant information. Alright. Let’s perform a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your pulse. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. I have things to do, you know? This is really cutting into my afternoon. But make it quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please remove your shirt and lie back on the examination table. Your heart rate is 72 beats per minute and regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 128/80. No murmurs, rubs or gallops auscultated. Pulses are 2+ bilaterally and symmetrical. Now, let’s check your weight and height.
PATIENT: There. Happy now? I told you I wasn’t a wreck. Can we please get to the point? Is there something wrong, or am I wasting my time? I really need to get back to grading papers. This is a terrible time of year for this.
DOCTOR: Your weight is 60 kilograms and height is 181 centimeters, giving you a BMI of 19.6. That is within the normal range. Based on the information you’ve provided and my brief examination, your cardiovascular risk appears to be relatively low at this time. However, given your family history of early cardiac events, I recommend a few preventative measures. I’d like to order a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels, and an electrocardiogram to evaluate your heart’s electrical activity. Additionally, I recommend you continue to monitor your blood pressure regularly, and incorporate regular physical activity into your routine, even if it’s just 30 minutes of brisk walking most days of the week. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A lipid panel and an ECG? Seriously? All this for…what? Peace of mind? It seems like a lot of hassle for something that you’re already saying is “relatively low” risk. And "regular physical activity"? I already told you I walk when I have time. What’s the point of all this? Is there anything wrong with me that you’re not telling me? I suppose…fine. I’ll get the tests done. But honestly, I still think this is a complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, the purpose of these tests is not to find something that is currently wrong, but to establish a baseline and monitor for any future changes. Early detection is key, especially given your family history. I will write you a referral for the lipid panel and ECG. The results will be sent to me, and we can discuss them at a follow-up appointment in two weeks. In the meantime, continue to monitor your blood pressure and try to incorporate more regular physical activity into your routine. I also recommend you discuss your family history with your sister, and encourage her to get screened as well. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
