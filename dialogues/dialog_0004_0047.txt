DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin' Doc. Uh… well, it’s about… insurance. Long-term care, I think? My daughter, she set this up. I get kinda mixed up with paperwork these days. It’s somethin' about makin’ sure… well, I forget. She said I need to come talk to someone. About… gettin’ help later on, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Right. Insurance paperwork can be… frustrating. And it’s perfectly alright to be unsure. So, to clarify, your daughter scheduled this appointment because she's concerned about planning for potential long-term care needs, and wants to make sure you have adequate coverage?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. She worries a lot. Good girl, my Leona. I… I don’t really think about things like that too much. Just kinda take things as they come, you know? But she said it's important. Somethin' about… if I needed help with… stuff. Bathin’ and… eatin’? I dunno. It feels a long way off, if you get what I mean. I’m still pretty… capable, I think. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to not want to focus on possibilities that seem distant. And it’s good that Leona is being proactive. Just to be thorough, even if things are manageable now, let's get a clear picture of your current health status. It will help us determine the best course of action regarding potential long-term care planning. Could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My… medical history? Hmm. That’s a tough one. I… I been to the doc a few times, of course. Old age comes with aches and pains, ya know? I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And… I broke my wrist a couple years back, fallin’ on the ice. That was a mess. Other than that… not much, I don’t think? I get a little… short of breath sometimes, when I walk uphill. And my knees… they ain’t what they used to be. But everyone gets old, right? I… I forget what the doc said about all that. He talked fast. Is there somethin' specific you're lookin' for?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Rover, something specific. We need a more complete picture. Let’s start with chronic conditions. Do you have high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or anything else a doctor has diagnosed and you’re currently being treated for?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? Oh boy. Let me think… High blood pressure… the doc mentioned somethin’ like that once. He wanted me to watch my salt intake, I remember that. And… diabetes? I don’t think so. I like sweets, but Leona keeps me in check. Heart disease… I… I don’t know. I’ve never been told I have heart trouble. I get a little chest pain sometimes, but I figure it’s just… old age. It comes and goes. Is that… bad? Honestly, I mostly just take a couple of pain pills for my knees and try to stay busy. It's hard rememberin’ all the doctor talk.
DOCTOR: “Couple of pain pills.” What kind, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: Oh. Uh… let me see… They’re… white. Small, kinda round. Leona gets ‘em for me. She fills that little pill box every week. I… I don’t know the name. Something with a “C”? Or maybe a “V”? I just take ‘em when my knees are botherin' me. Two at a time, usually. I don’t like takin’ too many pills, if I can help it. Makes me feel… foggy. You know? I can't remember the name, I’m sorry. She’s really good at keepin' track of these things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, it's important to know exactly what medications you are taking. Let me access your EHR. It shouldn't be difficult to pull up your prescription history. Ah, here we are. It appears you've been prescribed Celecoxib 200mg daily for osteoarthritis. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Cele… Celecoxib? That sounds… right. Yeah, that’s probably it. She does call it somethin' fancy. I just tell her my knees hurt and she gives me the pills. I guess I just never bothered to learn the names. It’s… a lot to keep track of. Is that bad, Doc? That I don't remember what I'm takin'? Maybe I should write it down… Leona says I should, but I always forget where I put the paper. I’m sorry, I’m just… not good with this stuff. It feels like a lot of trouble for nothin’. Is that gonna change things?
DOCTOR: It’s not ideal, Mr. Rover. And frankly, it does change things. Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug – an NSAID. It can have side effects, especially with long-term use. We need to be aware of potential interactions with other medications, and monitor your kidney and cardiovascular health. Now, besides your knees and the occasional chest pain, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… Well, I get kinda tired sometimes, even after a good night's sleep. And… I’ve been a little more clumsy lately, droppin’ things. That happened a lot more this past winter. My hands feel kinda… numb sometimes, too. Not all the time, just… now and then. And… I’ve been forgettin’ things. More than usual, Leona says. But I’m an old man, Doc. I figure that’s just part of gettin’ old. Is that a symptom? I… I don't know. I’m probably just ramblin’ now. Is this makin' things worse? I’m sorry, I just don’t know what you want me to say.
DOCTOR: It's not making things worse, Mr. Rover. It's good that you're telling me all this. These symptoms – the fatigue, clumsiness, numbness, and increased forgetfulness – do warrant further investigation. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Now, let's do a brief physical exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, balance, and strength. And I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, kidney function tests, and a thyroid panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. I don’t like needles, but… if you think it's important, I guess. A physical exam… alright. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. My knees ain’t what they used to be, ya know? And I got an errand to run for Leona after this. She needs me to pick up some… somethin' at the store. I forget what. She told me, but… it slipped my mind. But yeah, blood work and exam. Whatever you need, Doc. Just please be gentle with my knees. Is this gonna be a long process? I’m worryin’ about Leona, now, if I take too long.
DOCTOR: We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible, Mr. Rover. I understand your concerns about Leona. Let’s start with your reflexes. Could you please sit on the edge of the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright. There. Is that good? It's a little hard to get up and down, you know? Old knees. Just… let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm ready when you are. What are you lookin' for exactly? Is somethin' wrong? I hope it's not somethin' serious. I just wanna get home to Leona. She worries when I'm gone too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rover, I'm checking your reflexes in your knees and ankles. Just relax. Hmm… diminished reflexes bilaterally. Now, let’s check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly, if you’re able, and try to balance for a few seconds without holding onto anything?
PATIENT: Woah there. Easy does it… Okay… I think I’m okay. Just a little… wobbly. My knees… they feel kinda weak. I don’t like standin’ for too long. Is this bad, Doc? Am I gonna fall? I don’t wanna fall. It scares Leona somethin’ awful when I fall. Just… let me sit back down, okay? I'm feelin' kinda lightheaded now. Is this because of the blood work?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rover, please sit. Yes, it's good you sat down. It’s not uncommon to feel a bit lightheaded when standing for prolonged periods, especially with a history of knee issues. Diminished reflexes, mild balance impairment… Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Breathing seems a little labored…and I detect a slight murmur. Now, a quick neurological exam. Could you please tell me your name, and today's date?
PATIENT: My name is… Cleo… Cleo Rover. And today’s date… hmm… August… uh… August the… second? Is that right? It’s August, I think. I get my days mixed up sometimes. Especially lately. I’m sorry. It’s just… hard to remember. Is somethin’ wrong, Doc? You look… serious. Is it my knees? Are they gonna have to… operate? I don't want to have an operation. Leona would be worried sick.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, it's important to be honest with you. Based on this brief exam and your symptoms, I’m concerned about possible cognitive decline and a possible cardiac issue. The diminished reflexes, balance issues, the slight murmur, and your difficulty remembering the date are all red flags. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but I strongly recommend further investigation. We need to rule out a stroke, a transient ischemic attack , and assess the severity of your heart murmur. I want to order a CT scan of your brain, an electrocardiogram , and a referral to a cardiologist for a comprehensive evaluation. This doesn’t necessarily mean something serious, but we need to get answers. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… CT scan? An… ECG? A… cardiologist? What… what does all that mean? I don’t understand. All I know is my knees hurt, and I forget things. Is… is something wrong with my brain? Am I… am I losing my mind? I… I just want to go home to Leona. What's happening to me, Doc? Tell me… please, just tell me what’s happening. It sounds scary. Very scary.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, please try to remain calm. It sounds scary, I understand that. But we’re going to figure this out, step-by-step. A CT scan is an imaging test that takes pictures of your brain – it helps us rule out any structural problems, like a stroke. An ECG checks the electrical activity of your heart, to see if there's any irregularity. And a cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in heart conditions. The fact that you’re experiencing forgetfulness and some physical instability doesn't automatically mean anything serious, but it warrants a thorough investigation to determine the cause. I’m going to order these tests as a precaution. We need to rule out any urgent conditions, like a stroke, and then we can discuss possible causes and treatment options. I will also discuss a referral to a neurologist for a cognitive evaluation. Right now, I'm concerned about your well-being, and I want to ensure you receive the best possible care. We’re going to take things one step at a time. Do you want me to call Leona to come and be with you?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Call Leona. I… I need her. I’m scared, Doc. Really scared. I don't… I don’t understand all those words… stroke, neurologist… it sounds like something awful. Just… just call Leona. I need her to explain it to me. And… and hold my hand, maybe? I feel… dizzy. Very dizzy. Please, just call Leona.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rover. I will call Leona immediately. And I’ll stay here with you until she arrives. Hello?
