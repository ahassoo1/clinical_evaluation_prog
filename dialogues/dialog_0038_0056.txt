DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly? I haven’t much time for this. Work, you see. It’s… draining. Utterly draining. I believe my assistant made the appointment regarding… stress. Though frankly, I don’t recall the specifics. It’s all a bit of a blur these days. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Your assistant did mention stress as the primary concern. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about how this stress is affecting you?
PATIENT: Affecting me? Really, Doctor. It’s quite obvious, isn’t it? I’m… fatigued. I lack… enthusiasm. The students are… less attentive than they used to be, and I find myself… correcting their grammar constantly. It’s terribly disheartening. It’s not new, mind you, just… amplified, I suppose. And honestly, dealing with the… administration is a trial. A complete trial. Is there a quick solution to all this, or must we delve into tedious details?
DOCTOR: I understand you're looking for a swift resolution, Mr. Schlatterer. While I wish there were a quick fix, understanding the details is important to ensure we address everything properly. You mentioned fatigue and a lack of enthusiasm, and frustration with the students and administration. Let's start with the fatigue. Can you tell me a little more about how fatigued you are?
PATIENT: How fatigued? Doctor, I require a significant amount of… restorative sleep, shall we say. More than I used to. And even with the sleep, I feel… depleted. It’s not merely physical, though I do ache. It’s… mental exhaustion. A constant weight. I find it difficult to concentrate on anything for prolonged periods. The Dewey Decimal System, which I once found so… elegant, now feels… cumbersome. Is that sufficient detail, or must I list every minor inconvenience?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. The mental exhaustion is particularly important to note. It sounds like it's impacting your ability to focus and enjoy things you used to find fulfilling. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and mental exhaustion?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, where to begin? My appetite has… diminished. I’ve lost interest in… social engagements. And I find myself… irritable. Terribly irritable. People seem to say and do the most… foolish things these days. It’s a wonder anyone gets anything done correctly. Though, to be fair, most don’t. My wife… well, never mind that. It's all rather… unpleasant. Is this what you require? A comprehensive list of my failings?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schlatterer, not failings at all. Just information to help me understand what’s going on. The decreased appetite and loss of interest in social activities are important pieces of the puzzle. And the irritability as well. To get a clearer picture, have you noticed any changes in your sleep besides needing more of it?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I… sometimes have difficulty falling asleep. My mind races, you see. Revisiting… past grievances, mostly. And I wake up several times during the night. Though I wouldn’t call it restlessness, exactly. More of a… a general unease. It’s a subtle distinction, I realize. Really, it's all quite bothersome. Are we nearing the end of this interrogation, Doctor? I have papers to grade, you know.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Schlatterer, and I appreciate your patience. Difficulty falling asleep and waking during the night are both very helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Doctor, at my age, one accumulates things. High blood pressure, perhaps. My general practitioner mentioned it, years ago. Though I haven’t taken any medication for it, I distinctly recall. And my wife… well, she was always concerned about my cholesterol. But honestly, I pay it no mind. I lead a… relatively sedentary lifestyle, if that’s what you’re implying. It’s the price one pays for intellectual pursuits, I suppose. Do we need a detailed recitation of every minor ailment? I assure you, it’s a lengthy list.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Schlatterer, we don’t need every detail. Knowing about the high blood pressure is helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Once, as a child, for…appendicitis, I believe. A rather unpleasant experience. And many years ago, a minor procedure on my…knee. A sports injury, of sorts. Though I wouldn’t classify myself as “sporty.” It was a…a misguided attempt to impress a young lady. A foolish endeavor, in retrospect. Really, I prefer the quiet solitude of the library. Is this getting us anywhere, Doctor? I feel as though I’m reliving my entire life. .
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Schlatterer. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or mental health conditions?
