DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this shaking. Been happening for a bit now. Not sure how long, exactly. Time… slips away, you know? It’s mostly in my hands, I think. Makes things… difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Time can certainly feel… different as we get older. This shaking, you say it’s mostly in your hands?
PATIENT: Mostly, yes. Though… sometimes my leg, too. Just a little. It’s not constant, you understand. Comes and goes. It’s more… noticeable when I’m trying to do something. Like, holding a cup of coffee… or tightening a bolt. I used to work with… pipes, water systems. Lots of bolts. It’s… hard to remember the details these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Don’t worry about remembering every detail. So, it’s primarily in your hands, occasionally your leg, and it’s more pronounced when you're actively doing something?
PATIENT: That's right. Doing something... needing to be precise. That makes it worse. Resting… it’s usually okay. Not always, but mostly. Does that… make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. You're explaining it very well. It sounds like it’s related to activity. Now, have you noticed anything else along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Hmm… anything else… Let me think. I… I feel a little stiff sometimes, in the mornings. Mostly my hands, again. And… maybe a little tired, but I’m seventy-nine! So, that’s not much of a surprise, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not surprising at all, Mr. Jezik. Stiffness in the mornings and feeling tired are very common. And it’s good you’re aware of these things. Now, have you noticed any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: Balance… Not really. I haven’t fallen or anything. I used to be a pretty good dancer, you know. Polka, waltz… But that was a long time ago. I wouldn’t say I’m unsteady, exactly. Just… careful, maybe. I don’t rush things anymore. Old age has that effect on you, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Jezik. It's important to know if there's been any changes in your balance. And being careful is always a wise approach. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Other conditions… Not that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Probably should have, but I always figured I was tough enough to get by. Divorced, you see. No one to… remind me. Mostly just aches and pains, like everyone else. I don’t take any regular medications, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Alright. And no allergies to any medications that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I’ve ever noticed. I used to help my wife with her garden, lots of flowers… never had a reaction to anything. But she’s gone now, so it’s been a while since I paid attention to those things. It's hard to keep track of these things when you're… on your own.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Anything to… figure this shaking out. Don’t mind my hands, they might… tremble a bit. You’ve probably seen worse, I imagine. Let’s get it over with. The sooner the better, really. I have… things to do. Though I can’t remember what they are.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. That’s perfectly alright. We'll just take our time. If you’d be comfortable, could you please extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. Like that? Don’t mind the shaking. It’s worse when I’m… being looked at, I think. It’s a silly thing, but… it is what it is.
DOCTOR: I see. And if you make a fist and then relax your hand, can you do that for me a few times?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels… stiff. Not painful, exactly, but… resistant. It's harder than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And if you could try tapping your fingers against your palm, just like this…
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… difficult to get it going. Feels like my fingers have a mind of their own. Not as quick as they used to be, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright Mr. Jezik, would you mind standing up and walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s not much of a walk, I’m afraid. Getting old takes its toll, you know. Be careful… don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Jezik. Please, have a seat. Now, based on what you've told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with a condition called essential tremor. However, to be sure, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Essential tremor? Never heard of it. Sounds… serious. Blood tests? Oh dear. I don’t like needles. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose. I just want to know what’s going on. This shaking is… unsettling. Anything to get to the bottom of it. Yes, blood tests are fine. When do I have to go? And… will it hurt much?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mr. Jezik. Essential tremor is very common, and in most cases, it's not serious. It's not life-threatening, but it can be bothersome. As for the blood tests, it's a standard procedure to rule out other potential causes, like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. And as for the pain, it’s usually just a quick pinch, and it's over very quickly. The phlebotomist is very skilled. I’ll write you a requisition form for the lab. It's located just down the hall. You can go whenever it's convenient for you. They’re open until 5 PM today. Once you have the results, you can either bring them back to me, or have them faxed to the clinic. The fax number is on the form. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding caffeine and excessive stress, as these can sometimes worsen tremors. We can discuss potential treatment options once we have the blood test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood tests… less stress… no coffee. Easier said than done. But I’ll try. I’ll try my best. Fax them… I think my neighbor has a fax machine. I'll have to ask. Treatment options… what kind of treatments? Pills? Injections? I don’t like either of those. But… I suppose I have to do what I have to do. Just get it over with. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… figuring things out. Is that all? I have… things to do, you know. Though I can’t remember what they are.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. It’s important to remember that we’ll take things one step at a time. There are several treatment options available, including medication, lifestyle modifications, and in some cases, therapy. We’ll discuss all of those in detail once we have the blood test results and can get a clearer picture of your condition. For now, just focus on getting the tests done, and try to avoid caffeine and stress. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or if you develop any new ones, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And yes, that's all for today. Please take your time getting out of here, and don't hesitate to ask if you need any assistance. Take care, Mr. Jezik.
