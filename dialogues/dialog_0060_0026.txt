DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I’m Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s this… tiredness. Just awful tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it comes… well, I just can’t do a thing. Like being made of lead. My husband keeps fussing, says I need to… what was it? Keep busy? But how can I, when I feel like this? It's not like I'm lazy, you know. I used to be a strong woman. Commercial diving isn’t for the weak!
DOCTOR: <stage>I raise an eyebrow slightly, a small, dismissive gesture. Commercial diving… really?
PATIENT: Yes, diving! For years. Salvage mostly. Though I haven't done it in… oh, goodness, a long time now. My joints aren't what they used to be, that's for certain. It was a proper job, though. Not like these… desk jobs people have nowadays. You wouldn't understand, I suppose. It takes a certain… grit. Though, it doesn't seem to matter much now, does it? All this tiredness… makes it hard to even remember the good parts.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “grit” is certainly one way to put it. So, this tiredness… when did it start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… that’s a difficult one. It’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose. Not all at once. Maybe… six months ago? A year? It's all a blur these days. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for remembering dates and times. My mind just doesn't work that way. It's like trying to hold water in a sieve.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, roughly six to twelve months. Has anything changed in your life around that time?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… well, my granddaughter, bless her heart, she had a baby. A little boy. Lovely child, but… she lives quite far away, and my husband and I haven’t been able to visit as much as we'd like. It's a shame, really. Other than that… not much. Same routine, mostly. Husband keeps puttering in the garden, I keep house… or try to, when I have the energy. It’s all rather dull, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: And this tiredness… is it all day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It's not a constant thing, thank goodness. Some days I feel… well, not good, exactly, but functional. I can manage. But then… then it hits me. Like a wave. And I just have to lie down. Sometimes for a whole day, sometimes just a few hours. It’s unpredictable, really. Drives my husband mad, it does. He says I need to “push through it,” but honestly, it feels impossible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you’re feeling tired, are there any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, my muscles ache a bit. Not a sharp pain, just… heavy. Like they've been working very hard. And sometimes I feel a bit… weak, I suppose. Not shaky, but like I have no strength. It’s hard to explain. And, now that you mention it, sometimes my skin feels a bit… itchy. It’s not constant, and it’s not a terrible itch, but it's there. Oh, and I’ve been feeling a bit… out of breath lately. Just with normal things, like walking up the stairs. Nothing dramatic, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay. Muscle aches, weakness, itchy skin, shortness of breath… Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it comes and goes, just like everything else. Some days I could eat a horse, other days I barely touch a thing. And my weight… well, I haven’t really been paying attention. I’m always a bit thin, you see. Never been one for putting on weight. Husband keeps trying to get me to eat more, but honestly, sometimes I just don't have the appetite for it. He worries too much, that man.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just the usual. A little something for my blood pressure, nothing fancy. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. Husband makes sure I take it every day, he’s very diligent about these things. Aside from that, no. I don't like taking too many pills, you see. It feels… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I'm aware of. Never been allergic to anything, thankfully. Husband always asks, of course, but I always tell him no. I've had all sorts of things in my life, you know? A proper outdoor life. Never had a reaction to anything. Though, I did have a bit of a rash once after touching a certain plant… but that was years ago, and it wasn't a serious allergy. Just a bit of itching, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Oitker, it sounds like you’ve been dealing with this tiredness for quite some time. Let's do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and maybe take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. If you think it's necessary. I'm not one for fussing, but I do want to get to the bottom of this tiredness. It's just so… draining. Honestly, I haven’t felt myself for months. Just do whatever you need to do, dear. As long as it doesn't take too long, my husband is expecting me home for tea.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up here for me. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Your heart sounds regular, but I am picking up some slight crackles in your lower lungs, mostly on the right side. Nothing terribly concerning, but we'll need to investigate further. Now, let's check your thyroid. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, and there is a bit of tenderness to the touch.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Enlarged, you say? Is that bad, Doctor? My mother had something wrong with her thyroid, I think… but it was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details. It made her… a bit shaky, if I recall correctly. And tired, of course. Very, very tired. Is that what’s happening to me? I do feel rather shaky sometimes, now that you mention it. Not constantly, but… enough to notice.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say, Ms. Oitker. A slightly enlarged thyroid can be caused by a number of things, not all of them serious. We'll need to get some blood work done to check your thyroid levels and see what's going on. It’s probably nothing, but it's best to rule things out. Now, let me take a look at your skin. Your skin is a little dry and pale, which could be related to the tiredness.
PATIENT: Pale, you say? Well, I haven’t been getting out much, have I? It’s been too hot to go walking, and I haven’t felt up to visiting my granddaughter as much as I’d like. My husband says I’m losing my color. He’s always fussing over my appearance. I suppose it doesn't matter much, does it? It’s not like I’m going anywhere. But still, it’s good to know what’s going on. All this… checking. It’s a bit much, really, but I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. We’ll also check your Vitamin D levels, just to be thorough. This will give us a better picture of what’s going on. I’m also going to order a chest X-ray to investigate those crackles I heard in your lungs. The lab should be able to draw blood right away. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So many tests… Is it something serious, Doctor? My husband will be terribly worried. He’s very protective, you see. He doesn’t like it when I’m not feeling well. Chest X-ray, you say? That sounds… rather frightening. Is it something in my lungs? I used to be a strong diver, remember? But it was a long time ago. I haven't been in the water in years.
DOCTOR: Now, now, Ms. Oitker, there's no need to worry. It’s standard procedure to run these tests when someone is feeling fatigued and we've detected a few things on examination. The chest X-ray is just to rule out anything serious, like pneumonia. It doesn’t necessarily mean there's anything wrong. And as for the blood work, it will simply give us a more detailed look at your overall health. It’s better to be proactive and get a clear picture of what's going on, so we can address it properly. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule out all possibilities. Here are the orders for the lab. They're just down the hall. The nurse will help you get everything done.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. My husband will be relieved to hear you’re being… thorough. He always says I worry too much, but honestly, it's hard not to, when you’re feeling like this. Just… please don’t let it be anything too serious. I'm not one for hospitals or… complicated things. I just want to feel like myself again. And please, try to explain it to him gently, will you? He gets terribly flustered.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Oitker. I’ll explain everything to your husband in a way he’ll understand. It’s likely just a vitamin deficiency or a mild thyroid issue, and we can easily address those with medication. Try not to worry too much. The nurse will take good care of you. Once you've had the blood work done, we can discuss the results and come up with a plan. I have another patient waiting, so I'll leave you to it. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Thank you. I suppose. .
