DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's… it's about my water. I’m havin’ trouble… gettin’ it all out, you know? Like it just… stays in there. It’s been goin’ on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re having difficulty completely emptying your bladder, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Completely emptyin’ it. It's… uncomfortable, mostly. Not pain, just… full. And I gotta go back more often, it seems. It's botherin’ me, but I didn’t know what to do 'til now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a month or so ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little bit. But the last week or so it's gotten worse. I didn’t think much of it at first, you know, just figured I was gettin’ old. But it’s not goin’ away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month, with it worsening in the last week. And you mentioned it’s uncomfortable, not painful… is it constant discomfort, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. After I try to go, there’s a little bit left, and that’s uncomfortable for a little while. Like somethin’ is still there. Then it goes away, and I feel fine… 'til I gotta go again. It doesn’t hurt, just… a feelin’. A full feelin’. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. A residual fullness after voiding. Have you noticed any changes in your urine stream – is it weaker, slower, or does it spray in different directions than usual?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, I think so. It's not as strong as it used to be. It used to be, well, a good stream, you know? Now it’s more… dribbly. And I gotta push a little to get it goin’. It doesn’t hurt, but I gotta… work at it, I guess. Sorry if that's too much information.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Hilber. That's important information. And have you noticed any fever, chills, lower back pain, or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. My back feels alright, normal aches, but nothin’ different. And no, I haven't seen any blood. Just… the trouble gettin’ it all out, and the weak stream. That's all. I was gettin’ worried somethin’ serious was wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'd like to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll do a brief neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. And then, I’d also like to check a post-void residual – that's where we measure how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to get this figured out. Listening and checkin’ reflexes… and measurin’ the leftover water, you said? Yes, that's fine with me. Do I need to do anything special? Like drink somethin’ before?
DOCTOR: No, no need to drink anything special beforehand. Just try to relax. If you’ll just lie down on the table, we’ll start with listening to your abdomen. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. Breathe normally, you said. Yes, I can do that. It's a little cold, but I'll be alright. I've been through worse, I reckon. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs. Just relax your legs, and I’ll tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Reflexes are also normal. Now, we'll just need you to empty your bladder as completely as you can. Then, we'll use a small, handheld ultrasound device to measure the amount of urine remaining. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. Empty my bladder, and then the… ultrasound thing. I can do that. Is there a bathroom nearby? And how long should I try? I don’t wanna be here all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, the bathroom is just through that door. Take your time, and try to empty your bladder as completely as possible. There’s no rush. Once you’ve done that, just let me know, and we'll proceed with the ultrasound. It shouldn’t take long at all.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back. I'll try my best to get everything out. It's just… sometimes takes a little extra effort these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, take your time, Mr. Hilber. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Alright, I think I got everything out. It took a little while, but I did my best. Ready when you are, Doctor. Hopefully, there’s nothin’ left in there. I was startin’ to worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, I’m just going to move this device around on your abdomen. It uses sound waves to create a picture of your bladder. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Okay… Hmm. It appears there is a significant amount of residual urine remaining – approximately 300 milliliters. Which is higher than we’d like to see.
PATIENT: 300 milliliters? That sounds like a lot. What does that mean, Doctor? Is that bad? I was hopin’ there wasn't much left. What’s gonna happen now? Is somethin’ broken? I'm gettin’ a little worried again.
DOCTOR: It is a bit higher than normal, Mr. Hilber. A normal post-void residual is usually less than 50 milliliters. 300 milliliters suggests your bladder isn’t emptying completely, which can lead to urinary tract infections and, over time, bladder problems. It doesn't necessarily mean something is broken, but it does indicate we need to investigate further. It could be a few things – a weakened bladder muscle, a blockage in the urinary tract, or even nerve problems affecting bladder control. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a bladder scan to evaluate bladder function. I’m also going to recommend a referral to a urologist - a specialist in urinary health. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A specialist… and more tests… That sounds like a lot, Doctor. But I guess if that's what you think is best. A urinalysis… and a bladder scan… Okay. I just want to get this fixed, you know? I don’t want this gettin’ worse. And I really don’t want an infection. Is the urologist gonna do more tests? And will my insurance cover all this? I'm on Medicare, and I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Hilber. It is a bit overwhelming, but we want to get to the bottom of this. The urologist will likely perform further tests, such as a urodynamic study to assess bladder function and possibly a cystoscopy to look inside the bladder. Regarding your insurance, Medicare should cover these tests and the visit to the urologist, but it’s always best to verify with your insurance provider to confirm your coverage and any potential out-of-pocket costs. I can have my staff provide you with the necessary paperwork and contact information to assist you with that. For now, let's focus on getting those initial tests scheduled. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly-rated urologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids – about 8 glasses a day – to help keep your urinary tract flushed. And if you experience any fever, chills, lower back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact my office immediately. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a plan, Doctor. Dr. Sharma… I'll remember that name. Plenty of fluids… I can do that. Eight glasses a day. And I’ll contact Medicare to make sure everything is covered. I appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly. I was really worried, but I feel a little better now knowin' what's goin' on. I guess there’s nothin’ else I need to do today? Just wait for Dr. Sharma’s office to call? And drink lots of water?
DOCTOR: That’s correct, Mr. Hilber. Just wait for Dr. Sharma’s office to contact you to schedule an appointment. And drink plenty of fluids. My staff will also provide you with the referral paperwork and information on how to contact Medicare. We'll follow up with you after your appointment with Dr. Sharma to discuss the results and any further treatment recommendations. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you very much for your time and for explainin’ everything so well. I feel a lot better now, and I appreciate your help. I'll go talk to your staff about the paperwork and the phone number for Medicare. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day as well. .
