DOCTOR: Good morning, Antoine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Frankly, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s… a bit embarrassing, really. It's something in my mouth. A white coating. It’s rather unpleasant, and my wife insisted I come get it checked. I haven’t been to a doctor in years, and I doubt it’s anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand, Antoine. It's perfectly alright to feel a bit embarrassed, and I appreciate you coming in despite that, and despite being short on time. Many things can cause a white coating in the mouth, and we'll figure out what's going on. “Not serious” is good to hear, but it's always best to check. Let’s start with this coating. Where exactly in your mouth is it?
PATIENT: It’s mostly on my tongue, Doctor. And the inside of my cheeks, a little. It’s… well, it looks like milk. Not painful, just… there. And it makes it difficult to taste things properly, which is rather irritating. I eat very well, you understand. I don’t appreciate bad food.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly on the tongue and some on the insides of your cheeks, looking like milk. And it’s affecting your taste. That's good information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this coating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. I’ve been a little tired lately, but that’s probably just work. Long hours, you understand. And I haven't been sleeping well, but that’s my wife's snoring, not this… this problem. No pain, no fever, no sores. Just the white stuff. Really, I suspect it's nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, fever, or sores, just the white coating, tiredness, and some sleep issues. We'll keep those other things in mind. Now, have you noticed this coating getting worse at any particular time of day, or after eating certain foods?
PATIENT: No, not really. It seems to be… constant. Doesn’t matter what I eat, doesn’t matter when. It’s just always there. I had a very nice steak last night, and it was still there this morning. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to think my wife is overreacting. She worries about everything. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Antoine. It's good to know it's constant and not linked to anything specific. We'll still investigate to rule things out and give you peace of mind. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: No, I do not. Perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Never had any serious illnesses. A cold now and then, of course, but nothing that required a doctor. I work hard, eat well, and generally avoid… well, avoid unnecessary things. I don't smoke, I drink occasionally, and I definitely don’t do anything… questionable. I assure you.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Antoine. A healthy lifestyle is a great foundation. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never. I broke my arm as a child, climbing a tree, but that was… decades ago. A simple cast, and it healed perfectly. Aside from that, I’ve always been remarkably fortunate. I take good care of myself, you understand. I don’t need doctors.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea. My parents are… were… both quite old when they passed. Various aches and pains, I suppose, the usual things. My wife handles all the family history details. She's very organized, unlike me. I wouldn't know where to begin with that sort of thing. I suspect it’s mostly nothing relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can work with that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Absolutely nothing. I prefer to let my body handle things naturally. Vitamins are a waste of money, and I avoid pills whenever possible. I get everything I need from my diet. A good steak, a glass of wine… that’s all I require. I don't believe in artificial… assistance. Frankly, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this? It’s a white coating, I haven’t got a fever, and I’m perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Antoine. You're right, you seem very healthy. And it’s good you’re so mindful of your overall wellness. To be thorough, though, let’s just do a quick examination. It will only take a few minutes, and it will help me rule out a few possibilities and provide you with a more definitive answer. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick, Doctor. I have a very important meeting this afternoon. Honestly, all this fuss over a little white coating… it’s rather ridiculous. But… alright. Proceed. Just… be gentle. I haven't had anyone poke around in my mouth in decades.
DOCTOR: Of course, Antoine. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Just relax and open wide for me. Okay… I’m seeing a fairly uniform white coating on your tongue and buccal mucosa. There’s no evidence of any sores, lesions, or significant inflammation. Your gums look healthy, and your throat appears normal. It doesn't appear to be anything alarming, but the coating is definitely present. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it's most likely oral thrush, also known as candidiasis. It's a common fungal infection that can occur when there’s an imbalance in the bacteria in your mouth. It often presents as a white, slightly raised coating, like you’re describing. It can affect taste, but isn’t usually painful.
PATIENT: Thrush? Like… a baby gets? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds… preposterous. I assure you, I am not a baby. And I am perfectly hygienic. I brush my teeth twice a day, I floss… What causes it? And what, pray tell, does one do about it? I don't want to be taking any… medications. Is there anything else it could be? I suspect my wife is exaggerating, as usual.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Antoine, babies can get thrush, but it’s not exclusive to them. It can happen to anyone, and it's often not a sign of poor hygiene. Sometimes it occurs after taking antibiotics, which disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the mouth. Other factors can include dry mouth, smoking, or certain medical conditions, though in your case, none of those seem to apply. It's understandable you're skeptical, and we can consider other possibilities, but the presentation is very consistent with thrush. It’s also possible it’s a form of geographic tongue, which can sometimes appear as a patchy white coating, but the uniform nature of the coating makes that less likely. As for treatment, usually an antifungal mouthwash or lozenge is all that’s needed. We can start with a mild, over-the-counter antifungal mouthwash, like nystatin, which you can use a few times a day for a week. It's generally very effective. It isn’t a medication that requires a prescription and is readily available at most pharmacies. If it doesn’t improve after a week, or if it gets worse, we can revisit this and consider other options, like a prescription antifungal. Would you be willing to try the over-the-counter mouthwash?
PATIENT: An over-the-counter mouthwash… Fine. But if it doesn’t work, I’m not wasting any more time on this. My schedule is very demanding, you understand. And frankly, I still suspect my wife is overreacting. But… alright. Nystatin, you say? Very well. Just tell me where I can find it. And please, keep it brief. I have a meeting to prepare for. I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Antoine. Nystatin is available at most pharmacies, usually over the counter. You should be able to find it in the oral hygiene section. Just ask the pharmacist if you have any trouble locating it. Here’s a note to present to the pharmacist, just to ensure they give you the correct formulation. Use it as directed on the package – usually rinsing with the mouthwash a few times a day for a week. If it doesn’t improve after a week, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can explore other possibilities. And don’t hesitate to call if you experience any adverse effects. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Honestly, Doctor, I still find this entire situation rather… absurd. But I appreciate your time, I suppose. Thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a very important meeting to prepare for.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Antoine. I understand your time is valuable. I appreciate you coming in, and I hope the mouthwash helps. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a productive meeting. .
