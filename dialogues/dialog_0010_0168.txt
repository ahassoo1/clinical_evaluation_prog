DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s a bit delicate, actually. I’m dating someone new, and I just want to be absolutely certain everything is…as it should be, you understand. One can’t be too careful these days. I’ve been married before, and frankly, I don’t intend to repeat any…unpleasant surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. That’s very sensible. It’s always best to be proactive about your health, especially when starting a new relationship. We’ll get everything checked out to give you peace of mind. To start, can you tell me a little more about what specifically you're concerned about?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s not that I expect anything to be wrong, naturally. It’s simply…a matter of due diligence. He’s…older than my previous husband, and while that isn’t inherently a problem, one has to consider the possibilities, doesn’t one? I just want to know everything is functioning correctly, and there are no…hidden issues. I suppose I’m most concerned about…well, the usual things. You know. Things a woman of my age would be concerned about. I’m sure you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. I understand perfectly. It’s responsible to be thorough, and your concerns are very common. “The usual things” as you put it, generally means we'll want to discuss your sexual health, and perhaps some general health screening relevant to your age. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s rather extensive. My previous marriage was…a long one. And not particularly healthy, if I may be frank. I had a rather difficult childbirth with my son, which led to several complications. And I’ve been managing my blood pressure for the last fifteen years. I’ve always been quite diligent about my annual check-ups, though. I can provide you with a list from my primary care physician if you like. It’s rather lengthy, I’m afraid. I don’t wish to bore you with unnecessary details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Pandolfi. Actually, it looks like we do have some records from your previous physician on file – thank you for being so diligent about your care. I see here a history of hypertension, as you mentioned, and some notes regarding a complicated delivery. Is that an accurate summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that is quite accurate, Doctor. And good of you to have those records. It saves me the trouble of recounting everything. Though, I must say, my primary care physician isn’t always the most…thorough. He tends to dismiss my concerns as “women’s problems” if I may be so blunt. Which is precisely why I’m here, seeking a more…discerning opinion. I want to be certain nothing has been overlooked.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Pandolfi. It’s important to feel heard and taken seriously by your healthcare provider. That’s precisely what we strive for here. To continue, have you had any previous surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the C-section, Doctor. And the removal of my wisdom teeth, many years ago. Nothing else. And truthfully, the C-section recovery was…traumatic. It’s a rather sensitive subject, if you don’t mind my saying so. I’ve always been rather…delicate, constitutionally. It’s one of the reasons I’m so cautious about this new relationship. I simply don’t want to repeat past experiences.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. You absolutely don’t need to share anything you’re uncomfortable with. We can move on if you prefer. However, understanding the details of your previous C-section could be helpful. Were there any complications beyond the typical recovery period?
PATIENT: Well…there was an infection. A rather severe one. It required several rounds of antibiotics, and…a rather lengthy hospital stay. And the scar tissue…it’s quite painful, even now. I’ve always been…sensitive to pain, you see. And frankly, the entire experience was…debilitating. It took me months to recover fully. I’m still hesitant to…well, you understand. It’s a rather…personal matter. I'm not sure I want to delve into such unpleasant details if I’m honest. It's quite upsetting to relive it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Pandolfi. It sounds like you went through a great deal, and it’s perfectly alright if you’re not comfortable discussing every detail. Knowing there was a post-operative infection is helpful. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me see…my mother had diabetes, though she managed it quite well with diet and exercise. My grandmother, on my father’s side, had heart disease. And…there was a case of breast cancer, several generations back. Though, it wasn't a direct relative, if you understand. A distant cousin, I believe. And truthfully, my family isn’t particularly forthcoming about medical history. They tend to…avoid unpleasant topics, if I may be so blunt. It’s rather frustrating, actually. I’m always left to piece things together on my own.
DOCTOR: That's quite common, Ms. Pandolfi. It can be difficult to gather accurate family history. Knowing about the diabetes, heart disease, and the history of breast cancer is helpful. Now, just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take Lisinopril for my blood pressure, as you saw in my records. And I take a daily multivitamin, naturally. And…occasionally, I take ibuprofen for headaches. Though, I try to avoid it as much as possible. It upsets my stomach. And…I’ve been taking a calcium supplement lately, to strengthen my bones. My doctor suggested it, given my age. Honestly, that’s all. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible. I’m not one for unnecessary medication, if I may be so blunt.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Pandolfi. Lisinopril, a multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen, and calcium supplements. And you have no known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I pride myself on being quite…robust, constitutionally. Though, as I mentioned before, I am rather sensitive to pain. But that’s a general sensitivity, not an allergic reaction, if you understand. Honestly, I’m quite healthy for my age, if I may be so blunt. I take very good care of myself. Though, this new relationship…it’s just made me want to be extra cautious, you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. It's excellent that you're proactive about your health and take such good care of yourself. And it’s perfectly reasonable to want to be extra cautious. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. Is that absolutely necessary to discuss? I mean, I understand it's your job, but…it feels rather…impersonal. However, if you must know, yes, I am. And I assure you, I am quite…discreet. It's not something I readily share with everyone, if you understand. It’s a private matter. And frankly, I find the question rather…forward. Though I suppose it’s necessary, given the circumstances.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question that, Ms. Pandolfi. I apologize if that felt too forward. It is a necessary question, purely from a medical perspective, to assess any potential risks and ensure your well-being. It’s essential for understanding your overall health and providing appropriate care. I assure you, everything discussed is completely confidential. Knowing you are sexually active helps me determine what screenings and preventative measures would be most beneficial. Now, may I ask if you have multiple partners or are you in a monogamous relationship?
PATIENT: Monogamous, Doctor. Very much so. I am not one for…complications. And frankly, I have no interest in discussing such…intimate details. It feels rather…vulgar, if I may be so blunt. I came here seeking peace of mind, not a lecture on responsible behavior. I simply want to ensure everything is as it should be, given my…new circumstances. And frankly, I find this line of questioning rather intrusive. Though I suppose it’s necessary, given the circumstances. It’s simply…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel that way, Ms. Pandolfi, and I apologize again if I’ve made you uncomfortable. I am truly not trying to be intrusive, and I assure you, I can stop asking these questions immediately if you prefer. It’s simply that this information helps me to provide the most appropriate care. Since you are in a monogamous relationship, that does reduce some of the risks. Now, just one final question regarding your sexual health, and then we can move on to the physical exam. Have you ever been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. And I find that question particularly…offensive, if I may be so blunt. I have been a faithful wife, and now a…discreet companion. The implication that I would…engage in risky behavior is quite insulting. I came here seeking reassurance, not judgment. Frankly, I’m starting to regret coming here at all. It feels like I’m being interrogated, not cared for. I simply wanted a routine check-up, and now I’m subjected to…this. I find it utterly unacceptable. I think I'm ready to stop the consultation at this point.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, you are absolutely right to feel upset, and I sincerely apologize for making you feel judged or interrogated. That was never my intention, and I have clearly failed to make you feel comfortable and respected. I understand your frustration, and I completely respect your decision to stop the consultation. My goal is always to provide compassionate and patient-centered care, and it’s clear I have not met that goal today. I truly apologize for causing you any distress. Would you like me to document the things you have mentioned in your chart so it is available for future providers?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Document everything. My medical history, my medications, and…my displeasure with this consultation. Perhaps another doctor will be more…sensitive. And frankly, I’m quite shaken. I simply wanted peace of mind, and now I’m feeling more anxious than ever. Thank you for your time, though I must say, it was not a pleasant experience. I think I’ll be seeking a second opinion.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. I will document everything thoroughly. Again, I sincerely apologize for the distress I’ve caused you. Your comfort and well-being are my top priority, and I’m truly sorry I didn’t meet your expectations today. I wish you all the best in finding a healthcare provider who is a better fit for your needs. Please let the receptionist know you're leaving, and feel free to contact the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns.
