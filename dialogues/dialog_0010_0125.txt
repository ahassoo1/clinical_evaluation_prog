DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I'm Dr. Annesley. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I just... I want to get tested for, you know, the thing. HIV. Better safe than sorry, right? My wife and I... well, it’s a long story, but I thought it was best to just get it checked. No point in worrying about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "Better safe than sorry" is a very sensible approach, Mr. Belan. And it’s good you’re thinking about this. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little more about the “long story” you mentioned?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's probably nothing. But we were travelling, see? Nepal, obviously, then a bit through India. Met some… interesting people. I’m not saying anything happened, exactly, but we weren't always careful with everything. You meet people, you have a drink, you… get carried away. My wife doesn't need to know all the details, if you get my meaning. It’s probably just my nerves talking. But I'd rather be sure, wouldn't you?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mr. Belan. It’s very responsible of you to be proactive about this, and it’s quite common to want to be cautious after travel, especially with potential exposures. And confidentiality is, of course, a priority here. So, to clarify, you’re concerned about a possible exposure to HIV while travelling in Nepal and India?
PATIENT: Yes, that's exactly it. Concerned is a strong word, maybe. Aware. Aware of the possibility. It wasn’t like a one-night stand, you understand. It was… interactions. Multiple interactions. With different people. And, honestly, the healthcare standards in some of those places… let's just say I wouldn't trust them to change a lightbulb, let alone give an accurate result. So, here I am, wasting my time, but better this than… well. You understand. It’s just a precaution.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Belan. Multiple interactions with varying levels of risk certainly warrants getting tested, and your concerns about healthcare access abroad are perfectly valid. We'll get you tested and provide you with peace of mind. Let's go through some details to get a full picture. First, can you give me an approximate timeframe for these interactions?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... It was, oh, probably starting around November of last year. November 2024. And it went on… intermittently, until about February this year. February 2025. It wasn’t constant, you know? A few weeks here, a week there. Mostly Nepal, some in Delhi, a little bit in Goa. Does that help? It's not like I'm keeping a diary of these things, Doctor. It's just… hard to be precise.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Belan. November 2024 to February 2025. That gives us a good window. Now, have you had any symptoms that have been concerning you since then?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Nothing at all. Honestly, if anything, I've been feeling too good. A bit tired, maybe, but that’s just work, you know? Long hours, stressed. Nothing that would make me think… that. I eat well, exercise a bit. I'm a pretty healthy guy, all things considered. It's just… being sensible, that's all. Wouldn’t want to be bringing anything home to my wife. She'd kill me. Figuratively, of course. But still.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s reassuring. No symptoms to report, which is good. Now, let’s quickly go over some medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had a problem with anything. Penicillin, codeine, the usual stuff. I can take pretty much anything without a reaction. My wife's the one with the allergies, constantly sneezing and itching. I just get on with things. I'm pretty robust, as I said. No medical conditions to speak of, either. Blood pressure's a little high sometimes, but nothing a bit of walking can't fix. And I've had all my shots, obviously. Used to travel a lot even before this trip. Sensible, you see?
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies, and you’re up to date on your vaccinations. And just to confirm, you’ve had no significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing. A few colds, maybe. The occasional stomach bug when travelling, but nothing serious enough for a doctor. I’m not one for sitting around waiting rooms. I just… get on with it. Take some medicine, drink some water, and I’m fine. I don’t like to make a fuss, Doctor. Honestly, I’m probably wasting your time. It’s probably nothing. But you have to be sure, right? My wife would say the same thing. “Better safe than sorry.” She's a very sensible woman.
DOCTOR: You’re not wasting my time at all, Mr. Belan. It’s my job to assess these situations, and you're doing the right thing by being proactive. Just one more section of history before we move on to the physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I really don't like taking pills. I tried some vitamins for a while, but they made me feel sick. So I stopped. Just eat a good diet, that's what I believe in. And drink plenty of water. My wife keeps trying to get me to take something for my blood pressure, but I refuse. I'd rather just walk more. It's healthier, you know? Natural. I don't trust all those chemicals they put in pills. Honestly, it’s probably all in my head. But still. Better safe. You understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. No allergies, no medications, and no significant medical history. That’s all very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a meeting this afternoon. And I really need to get back and… well, never mind. Just get it over with, please. Honestly, I'm starting to feel a bit silly now. It's probably nothing. But if it gets me off my wife's back, it's worth it. Get on with it, Doctor. The quicker we finish, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. We'll keep it quick and efficient. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I'll just check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 135/85. A little elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Finally, I'm going to check your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are not swollen. Everything appears normal on the physical exam. Now, to be thorough, we'll need to draw some blood for an HIV antibody test. It's the most accurate way to determine if you have been exposed. Would you like me to explain the process?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, honestly… everything normal? Really? That’s… surprising. I mean, with all the… interactions. But fine. Blood test, then. Get it over with. Just explain it quickly. I don't really like needles. And try not to poke me too many times, please. I have a very low pain threshold. And honestly, if it comes back negative, I’m not telling my wife about any of this. Got it? It'll just cause trouble. Just negative, and we move on. That’s all I want. No fuss, no drama. Just a simple negative result. Can you do that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Belan, I understand. Everything appears normal on the physical exam, which is reassuring. And I assure you, I will be as quick and gentle as possible with the blood draw. We'll just need a small sample. The blood test will detect antibodies your body produces to fight HIV. It can take a few days to a week for antibodies to develop after exposure, so we typically recommend a follow-up test three months after your last potential exposure to confirm the results. We'll send the sample to the lab, and I'll contact you with the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, it's important to practice safe sex and avoid any further risky behaviors. Do you have any questions about the testing process or the follow-up?
PATIENT: Three months?! Three months of worrying? Honestly, that's ridiculous. I thought these things were quicker these days. Fine. Three months, then. But if it comes back positive, I’m blaming the lab. It must be a mistake. I mean, I was careful. Relatively careful. Look, Doctor, I don’t want a lecture. I just want a negative result. And I want it quickly. Can you expedite it, maybe? Bribe someone? I don’t know. Just do something to speed it up. And honestly, if my wife finds out about this… well, let's just say I’m sleeping on the sofa for a very long time. So, a quick result is very important. Do you understand? Very important.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your anxiety and your desire for a quick result. However, the three-month window is based on established medical guidelines to ensure accurate testing. It takes time for the body to produce detectable antibodies, and testing too early can result in a false negative. I'm afraid I cannot expedite the process or influence the lab results. I can, however, assure you that we'll process the sample as quickly as possible, and I will personally contact you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, I would like to emphasize the importance of practicing safe sex to protect your health and the health of your wife. We can discuss strategies for reducing your risk if you'd like. Would you like me to provide you with any resources on HIV prevention or support services?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Don't need resources. Don't need a lecture. Just get the test done, get me the results, and let's forget this whole thing ever happened. Safe sex... I've been practicing some form of safe sex for years. Honestly, you're starting to annoy me. I came here for a test, not a life lesson. Just do your job, Doctor. Process the sample. Call me in three months. And don't bother me until then. Is that clear? Just… get on with it. I have a meeting to get to. And frankly, I need a drink. A strong drink.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Belan. That is perfectly clear. I'll have the lab technician draw your blood now. Please sit here, and they’ll be with you shortly. I will be in contact in three months with the results. Please take care of yourself. .
