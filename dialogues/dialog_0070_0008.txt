DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, good morning. It’s… well, it’s my ear, mostly. Feels blocked, you know? Like something's full of cotton. Been like that a bit. I don’t… I don’t really remember exactly when it started, to be honest. A while now, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a feeling of fullness in your ear, has been present for some time. Could you describe the sensation a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s not painful, exactly. Just… muffled. Like when you go up high in a plane, that feeling? Sort of like that, but not as bad. And it doesn't come and go, really. Just… there. It's mostly in my left ear, I think. Or is it the right? Oh dear. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It can be difficult to pinpoint these things. So, it's a consistent muffled sensation, primarily in one ear – you suspect the left, but are unsure. Has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. No… not that I recall. Maybe a little tired, but that's just… life, isn't it? I haven’t noticed any dizziness or… anything falling out. No ringing, I don’t think. My wife… well, she used to point things out, but… it’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. No dizziness, no discharge, no ringing, and no recent changes noted by your wife. Let's talk a bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any previous ear infections, or any problems with your hearing in the past?
PATIENT: Ear infections… Oh, goodness. When I was a boy, maybe? I had everything as a boy. Scarlet fever, measles… I really can’t recall specifically about my ears. I’ve always just… gotten on with things. And hearing… I suppose it’s not amazing these days, but I never really paid it much attention. Everyone gets a bit deaf when they get older, don’t they?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my appendix out, a long time ago. And… oh, yes, a small operation on my knee, years and years ago. Nothing major. Aside from that, I’ve mostly been lucky, I suppose. No hospital stays that I can remember, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my wife, she passed away a few years back. No children, unfortunately. My brother lives up north, but we don’t see each other much. He’s always been… busy. As for medical problems in the family… my mother had some trouble with her heart, I think. And my father… he just sort of faded away. Nothing specific, really. I don’t recall any hearing problems on either side of the family.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I’m a agricultural inspector, so I’m out in the fields a lot. Lots of walking, checking crops, that sort of thing. It's… quiet work, mostly. Not much noise. I live alone now, in a small house just outside of town. I enjoy gardening, when I have the energy. Not much excitement, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I… occasionally have a glass of wine with my dinner. Very occasionally. Not much of a drinker, never have been. Mostly water, to be honest. It's better for you, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly is. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had any bad reactions to anything. I take a small tablet for my blood pressure, but that’s all. My wife used to be allergic to cats, but that’s… irrelevant now, isn’t it? No, I can’t think of anything. I really don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very helpful, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a quick examination of your ears. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, if you don't mind. I have… things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Alright, let's take a look at your left ear first. Hmm... there's some cerumen buildup, a bit of earwax. Not excessive, but it could be contributing to the blockage. The ear canal itself appears normal. Now, the right ear. Similar findings here - some cerumen buildup, but the canal looks healthy. Your tympanic membranes—your eardrums—both appear intact, a normal pearly gray color. No signs of fluid or inflammation behind either drum. I'm going to perform a quick hearing test now, just to get a baseline. The results of the Weber test are midline, and the Rinne test is normal on both sides. This suggests symmetrical hearing loss, likely conductive due to the cerumen.
PATIENT: Conductive…? Is that bad? Look, I’m not a doctor, you see. Just tell me what it means. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, it's not necessarily serious. Conductive hearing loss simply means that sound isn't traveling efficiently through the outer or middle ear. In your case, it’s likely due to the earwax buildup I observed. Think of it like having a blockage in a pipe – the sound is getting muffled before it can reach the inner ear. The good news is this is usually very treatable. We can remove the earwax, and I expect your hearing will improve significantly. I wouldn't be overly concerned at this point. Would you like me to go ahead and remove the earwax for you today?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Get it done. The sooner the better. I have… appointments, you see. Things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Alright, this may feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. I'm going to gently warm the water and irrigate your ear canal. There we go. I've removed the bulk of the earwax from both ears. Let's check your hearing again to see if there's an improvement. Alright, that's much better. The results have improved significantly. The Weber test is midline and the Rinne tests are now positive bilaterally. Do you notice any difference in your hearing now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… yes, actually. It’s… clearer. Not perfect, but definitely better. A bit less muffled. I can hear you more easily, I think. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's very good to hear. It sounds like the earwax removal was successful. I would recommend avoiding using cotton swabs in your ears in the future, as they can actually push the wax further in and cause more blockage. I'm going to prescribe a small bottle of ear drops to help keep your ear canals clean and prevent future buildup. I also recommend a follow-up appointment in about six months to check your hearing and ensure everything remains stable. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Six months, you say? Alright. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long. And thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. We'll do our best to accommodate your schedule. Here is the prescription for the ear drops, and a card with instructions on how to use them. Please let the receptionist know if you have any trouble scheduling the follow-up appointment. I’m glad I could help. If you experience any changes in your hearing, or develop any pain or discharge, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, and please be careful.
PATIENT: Right. Good. Thank you. Goodbye.
