DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Just... lab work, I think? The usual? Honestly, it all gets a bit muddled these days. Medicare sent something... a form, maybe? I just need to get it done, if that’s alright. I haven’t been feeling… particularly anything, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “the usual” is rarely quite what it seems, is it?
PATIENT: Tell me about it. Everything's a bit of a blur. I just want to get this over with, if you don't mind. Is there a form I need to fill out? Or do you have everything sorted? I really don't recall what they asked for this time.
DOCTOR: I have a preliminary record here indicating a routine check-up requested by Medicare, but it lacks… detail. Before we proceed, it would be helpful – essential, actually – if you could recall any specific complaints, recent changes in your health, or even medications you are currently taking. It’s quite difficult to assess your wellbeing with such… vagueness.
PATIENT: Complaints… no, nothing specific. I take… a little something for my knees, I think? A small white pill. Honestly, I get them filled at the pharmacy and… that's about all I remember. My daughter usually handles all that. She's very good with these things. Changes... well, I’m getting older, aren't I? Is that a change? I don't know what else to tell you. I feel… alright. Just… tired, sometimes. Is that helpful? This is all a bit much, honestly.
DOCTOR: "Tired" is remarkably unhelpful, Mr. Croonquist. We need specifics. When did this fatigue begin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it begin…? A while ago, I suppose. Months? Years? Everything feels like one long… stretch. I really wish I could be more precise, but my memory… it’s just not what it used to be. I’m sorry. It started… gradually, I think? Just feeling a bit more worn out than usual. I used to be able to walk for miles, and now… well, not so much. But the knees are mostly to blame for that, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's attempt a brief review of systems. Have you experienced any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Weight… hmm. I don't think so? I haven't been weighing myself regularly. My clothes… they probably fit the same. I haven't noticed anything different there. It’s hard to say, really. I eat… reasonably, I suppose. My daughter makes sure I get enough to eat. She worries, you see. So, probably not. No significant weight changes. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… well, that’s a bit personal, isn’t it? Everything seems… regular enough. I haven't really paid much attention, to be honest. Is something wrong? I really don’t like talking about this… If it’s not broken, don’t fix it, that’s what I always say. I suppose no changes, then. Just… normal. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or sweats. Definitely not. I sleep alright, usually. A little restless sometimes, but no soaking-wet pajamas or anything like that. I'm a pretty normal sleeper, I think. Warm enough, not too cold. No, nothing like that at all. Can we… can we just get this lab work done? I’m starting to feel a bit flustered. It’s all these questions…
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. I shall order the standard blood work panel. However, I must strongly advise you to provide a more detailed medical history at your earliest convenience. This cursory examination is… inadequate. We will need to check your complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. The nurse will draw the samples now. And, perhaps, if your daughter is available, she could accompany you to your next appointment to assist with recall of pertinent information?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. The lab work is fine. And, yes, my daughter… she’d be happy to come. She’s very organized. Much better at these things than I am. Thank you, Doctor. Can we just… get it over with? I’m really not good with needles, you know.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be in shortly. Try to remain still. It will be over quickly. I trust you understand the importance of following through with these tests, despite your… discomfort. .
