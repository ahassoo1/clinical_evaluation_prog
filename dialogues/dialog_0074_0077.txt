DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's lovely to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh. Good morning to you too, Doctor. They tell me I gotta come get checked. Something about the old mine... but I feel fine. Always feel fine. Been working down there a long time, you know. Longer than most folks been alive. Don't see what the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your employer requested this check-up, perhaps as a precaution given your years of work in the mine. That’s very responsible of them. Even if you feel fine, it's important to ensure everything is as it should be. To start, could you tell me a little more about what you do down in the mine currently?
PATIENT: Currently? I operate the loading machines. Big things, they are. Move the rock and coal. Been doing that for... oh, a good twenty years now. Before that, it was all hand shoveling, you hear? Real work. Not like today. Mostly just sitting and pushing buttons. Still gets the job done, though. Don’t need all these fancy machines, really. A strong back and a good team… that’s all you need. But they pay me to run it, so I run it. Is that what you want to know? What I do?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Operating the loading machines for twenty years… that gives me a good picture. And before that, the hand shoveling – that was quite a different type of work. Now, while you say you feel fine, can you tell me if you've experienced any changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I'm eighty-six years old, Doctor. Things change all the time! My knees ache more, that’s for sure. Back goes out sometimes. But that’s just getting old, isn’t it? Not because of the mine. I’ve always had a strong constitution. What are you looking for, exactly? You're asking funny questions.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right – changes are a normal part of life, especially as we get older. And a strong constitution is a wonderful thing to have! I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your health. When I ask about changes, I mean things like new coughs, shortness of breath, any chest pain, unexpected weight loss, or perhaps any difficulty with your vision or balance. Have you noticed anything new like that recently?
PATIENT: Hmph. A new cough... no. Always had a bit of a tickle in my throat, especially when the dust is bad. Shortness of breath? Maybe when I’m climbing the stairs, but who doesn’t get winded climbing stairs at my age? Chest pain… no. My weight? I don't weigh myself. Never have. Always been a good size. Vision… a little blurry, maybe. But I got these glasses, didn’t I? Balance is fine, mostly. Don’t fall down every five minutes, if that’s what you’re asking. Honestly, Doctor, I feel alright. They’re making a big fuss over nothing. Just want to get this over with and go home.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. It does sound like you’re doing remarkably well for your age, and I appreciate you being so candid. Just to be thorough, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Listen to my heart? What for? It's been beating just fine for eighty-six years, I reckon. But… alright. If you have to. Get it over with. Don't poke too much, though. I don't like being poked. And hurry up about it. I got things to do. And don’t tell me nothing is wrong if it is wrong. I want the truth, you hear? Not some fancy doctor talk. Straight answer.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. Straight answers, I promise. And I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now… sounds regular, good rate. Now, breathing… I do hear some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, both left and right. And a little bit of… what sounds like some crackling. Have you ever been diagnosed with bronchitis or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Bronchitis… pneumonia… Now you're just throwing words at me. No. Never. I’ve had a cold or two, maybe a bad cough in the winter, but nothing serious. Never been diagnosed with anything. Didn’t have doctors back when I was a young man. You just toughed it out. Crackling, you say? What's crackling? Is that bad? I told you I felt fine! This is what happens when they send you to a doctor for nothing. Makes you think something's wrong when it isn’t. Hmph. What are you going to do now? More poking? I swear…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Bigger, and I apologize if this is causing you anxiety. The “crackling” sound I’m hearing suggests some fluid in your lungs. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but given your history of work in the mine – the dust exposure – and your age, we need to investigate further. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? More machines… more fuss… Look, Doctor, I’m telling you, I feel perfectly fine. I’ve worked hard all my life. A little dust never hurt anyone. My father worked in the mines, and his father before him. They didn’t need no X-rays. This is… ridiculous. But… alright. If it'll get me out of here, I suppose. But I expect a straight answer, you hear? No fancy medical talk. Tell me what it is. And tell me what it means. And hurry up about it. I got things to do, remember? Don't want to be stuck in here all day. Hmph. Chest X-ray… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. I assure you, I will explain everything clearly, and we will discuss the results as soon as they are available. The X-ray technician is just down the hall. They will get you settled and take the images. While we wait, let me ask a few more questions to get a complete picture of your health. Have you ever smoked, or been exposed to asbestos?
