DOCTOR: Hi Danny, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good day to you too, Doctor. Condray, you say? Yes. Well, I’m here… for a check-up. A sports thing. I think. My… someone told me I needed to come in before I try out for… something. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. A physical, I believe they called it. For the team.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-participation physical for a team. That makes sense. No worries about it being fuzzy, we'll get everything sorted out. Let’s start with a little more detail about this team, if you don’t mind. What sport are you trying out for, and what level of competition is it – recreational, school team, something else?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a good question. It wasn’t… a very organized thing, if I recall. More… with some fellas. Older fellas. We play… ball. You know. With a ball. It’s not like school, no. Not professional either. Just… for fun. Sort of. Though, we do keep score. Is that important? It’s… a league, I guess. A men’s league. That sounds right.
DOCTOR: Okay, a men’s league. That helps. And you said you’re here because someone suggested a check-up before tryouts – do you remember who recommended it?
PATIENT: Let me see… It was… Rico, I think. Yes, Rico Vasquez. He’s the… well, he was the captain. Before… things. He said it was… standard. For the insurance. Or maybe the league rules. Something like that. Honestly, Rico handles all the paperwork. I just show up and… play. He's a good man, Rico. Very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, Rico Vasquez. Good to know. So it sounds like this is a fairly informal league, but they do have some insurance or rules requiring a check-up. That's responsible of them. Alright, let’s get some basic information down. Do you have any current medical problems, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart issues?
PATIENT: Medical problems? No, sir. I’m a healthy man. Always been healthy. I… I get a little tired sometimes, maybe. But that's just… age, you know? And… well, my knees aren't what they used to be. But that's from… playing. It's a good pain. A working man's pain. Nothing serious. No doctoring needed, not for that. I’ve always been strong. Still am, for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear you're generally feeling strong. “A working man’s pain” – I understand. Even without major medical problems, it’s important to go through a full check-up before starting a new activity, especially with a team. It helps us make sure everything is okay, and to catch anything we might not be aware of. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions, even in the past?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… hmm. Well, back when I was a young man… maybe thirty? I twisted my ankle pretty bad playing softball. Real bad. They put a cast on it. Does that count as diagnosed? And… my wife, God rest her soul, she always said I had a touch of… nerves. Anxiety, I think she called it. But that was just her worrying, mostly. I never went to a doctor for that. A little stress, that’s all. Nothing a good game couldn’t fix. Other than that… no. Nothing serious. I’ve been lucky, I think. Mostly just bumps and bruises. A working man’s life.
DOCTOR: Okay, a twisted ankle with a cast, and some anxiety that your wife mentioned. That's helpful to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see. No, I don’t think so. Not that I recall. Wait… there was something… a… growth. On my shoulder. Many years ago. Small thing. They… cut it off, I think. Local doctor. Just a little thing. It wasn’t a big surgery. Just… snipped it off. That was… maybe twenty years ago? More? It never bothered me much. Small scar, that’s all. Nothing like a proper surgery. I don’t remember much about it, to be honest. It was quick. Very quick. Mostly just a… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, a growth removed from your shoulder about twenty years ago. That’s good information. We'll make a note of that. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, sir. I eat everything. Anything. I'm a Puerto Rican man, we eat… everything. Spicy, everything. Shellfish, everything. Never had a problem. Not with food, not with pills. I took some pills once for… a cold, I think. Didn’t bother me none. No hives, no swelling, nothing. I'm a strong man, remember? Strong stomach. Strong everything. No allergies. None whatsoever. You can write that down. None.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not a one. I don’t believe in pills. Mess with your system, they do. I used to take something for my… stomach. Years ago. But that was just… for the heartburn. After a good meal. Stopped taking it though. Didn’t need it anymore. Now I just… take it easy. And eat smaller portions. No pills. Absolutely none. A strong man takes care of himself. No need for fancy medicines. Just good food and a good game. That's all you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tough one. My… my mother, God rest her soul, she… well, she had a bad heart. She was very frail. Always complaining of… chest pains. Spent a lot of time in bed. That was many years ago. And my father… he was a strong man, like me. But he… he drank a lot. And… he got sick. Real sick. I don’t remember much about it. It was a long time ago. And my siblings… well, we weren’t very close. I haven’t seen them in years. I don’t know anything about their health. It’s… a complicated family. Long story. Mostly just… sadness. I try not to think about it. Not much help there, I’m afraid. Just… sickness and sadness.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your mother had heart problems, and your father was sick. That gives us something to work with. And finally, just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? What do you mean? Like… parties? I don’t go to many parties anymore. Used to, back when… well, back when I was married. But that was a long time ago. Now I mostly just… play ball with the fellas. And… watch TV. Not much socializing, to be honest. It’s… a quiet life. A simple life. I used to drink a little, maybe a beer after the game. But not much anymore. Doctor, are you asking if I’m a bad man? Because I’m not. I’m a respectable man. A hard worker. I just… prefer my own company. And the company of the fellas on the team. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: No, not at all! I just meant things like whether you smoke, how much alcohol you drink, and what kind of work you do. It helps me get a complete understanding of your health. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never! No sir. A respectable man does not smoke. It’s bad for your lungs. Bad for your health. Bad for everything. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always been a clean liver. My wife, God rest her soul, she used to complain about the smell on other people, but I always kept myself clean. No, sir. No smoking. Absolutely not. I've always been a strong man, remember? Strong lungs. Strong everything. Smoking is for weak people. I’ll have you know I can still run a good game. A very good game.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Never smoked. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well… a little. Just a beer, maybe, after the game. With the fellas. Just to unwind. Nothing fancy. Not like a drunk, you understand. Just… social. A man's gotta have something after running around, right? One or two beers. Maybe. Sometimes none. It depends. If we win, maybe a little more. But mostly just a beer. Or two. And I don’t drink alone. Never drink alone. That’s… not a good thing. Respectable men don’t drink alone. It's just… a little something to help you relax. A little reward. Nothing serious. I assure you. I’m a functioning man. A very functioning man. I can still play a good game, even with a beer or two. A very good game.
DOCTOR: Okay, a beer or two occasionally with the team. That's helpful to know. And what kind of work do you do, Danny?
PATIENT: Well, I’m a… handyman. A builder. Construction, you know? I do everything. Plumbing, electrical… a little of everything. I’ve been doing it for… well, a long time. Since I was a young man. Hard work, but honest work. Keeps me strong. Keeps me busy. I built my own house, you know. All by myself. Well, almost. A little help from Rico, but mostly me. It’s good work. Satisfying work. I like to see something you build with your own two hands. Makes you feel… good. Still do it, sometimes. Not as much as I used to. Getting a little… old. But I can still swing a hammer. A very good hammer. A strong hammer. It's a good life. A hard life, but a good life. A respectable life.
DOCTOR: Okay, a handyman and builder. That explains the strong hands! Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let's quickly review: Any allergies we need to be aware of?
PATIENT: Absolutely none, Doctor. Not a one. I eat everything. I’m a strong man. Never had an allergy in my life. You can write that down in big letters. NONE. I’m telling you, I'm a very healthy man. And I don’t take any pills. Not for allergies, not for anything. A respectable man doesn’t need pills. That’s the truth. None. Understand? None.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, no medications. Alright, Danny. It sounds like you're generally a very healthy man. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything’s as you say it is. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Go ahead. I’ve got nothing to hide. Always been strong. Always been healthy. A respectable man takes care of himself. You’ll see. Just… don’t poke too much. My old bones aren’t what they used to be. But I'm still a strong man. A very strong man. Just… be gentle. That's all I ask. Go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let's check your vital signs. I'm going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Okay, blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning at this point. Pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not loud, but we'll want to make a note of it. Lungs are clear. Good breath sounds. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Good grip strength. Some calluses on your hands consistent with manual labor. Alright, Danny, everything seems generally okay, but the elevated blood pressure and slight heart murmur are things we should keep an eye on. Do you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not really. Sometimes, after the game, maybe. But that’s just from running around, you understand. Old man getting winded. Chest pain? No. Never had chest pain. Swelling in my ankles? Sometimes, maybe. After a long day, maybe a little. But that’s just… gravity. Old man things. It's just… old age, Doctor. That’s all it is. I told you, I’m a respectable man. But I'm not a young man anymore. A little puffiness sometimes. But nothing serious. You’re not telling me I’m sick, are you, Doctor? Because I feel fine. Mostly fine. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just… life.
DOCTOR: No, I’m not telling you you’re sick, Danny. But those symptoms – the shortness of breath, chest pain, and ankle swelling – can be associated with underlying heart issues, and the murmur I heard bears further investigation. Given your family history and slightly elevated blood pressure, I think it’s wise to run some tests. Would you be okay with an EKG – that's a simple test that measures your heart's electrical activity – and a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol and kidney function?
PATIENT: Tests? Electrical activity? Blood panels? What’s all this about? I came here for a check-up, Doctor, not to be… poked and prodded and… tested. I told you I’m a healthy man. Mostly. I don’t like the sound of this at all. Rico didn’t say anything about tests. Is this… standard? Because I don’t trust those machines. They always find something wrong. And I don’t want to be put on pills. I told you, I don’t take pills. Are you sure this is necessary, Doctor? Because I feel fine. Mostly fine. It’s just… old age. That's all it is. Old age and a little tiredness. That's it.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Danny. You’re right, a simple check-up doesn’t always involve tests. But given the murmur I heard, your family history of heart problems, and slightly elevated blood pressure, it’s best to be cautious. These tests aren't meant to scare you, they’re just a way to get a clearer picture of your heart health and make sure everything is functioning properly. Think of it like maintaining a car. You don’t wait for the engine to break down before checking the oil, right?
PATIENT: A car… hmm. Well, I suppose that makes sense. I do take care of my truck. It’s a good truck. A strong truck. But… a human body is different than a truck, isn’t it? It’s… more complicated. And those machines… they always find something. I don’t trust them. But… if you really think it’s necessary… I suppose I can do it. Just… don’t poke too much. And no pills. Promise me, Doctor, no pills. And… how long will this take? I got things to do, you know. I need to get back to work. And… will it cost a lot of money? I'm on a fixed income, you understand. A respectable man has to watch his pennies.
DOCTOR: Of course, Danny. I understand your concerns completely. We'll take things slow, and I promise, no pills unless absolutely necessary and after a thorough discussion. The tests will take about an hour – a quick EKG and a simple blood draw. As for the cost, let me check with the billing department. Your Medicare should cover a significant portion of it, but there might be a small co-pay. I’ll have someone from billing speak with you about that after the tests. The most important thing is to get a clear picture of your health, so we can make sure you stay healthy and active for years to come. And I assure you, we'll discuss all the results thoroughly before making any decisions. Shall we proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Fine. Let’s get it over with. But you promise, no surprises? And no pills. I'm warning you, Doctor, no pills. And make sure that billing person is nice. I don’t like dealing with… paperwork. It gives me a headache. Just… get it over with. And be gentle. My old bones aren't what they used to be. And… tell me what you're doing. I don't like being surprised. Just… hurry up. I got things to do. Important things. A respectable man has to earn a living, you know. Let’s go.
DOCTOR: Of course, Danny. No surprises, I promise. We'll take it slow, and I’ll explain everything as we go. We’ll start with the EKG. The technician, Maria, will come in and place some stickers on your chest and limbs. It doesn't hurt at all. Then we’ll do a quick blood draw. Maria will be right in. Let’s get started. And don’t worry, I’ll be right here the whole time.
PATIENT: Alright. Stickers, you say? As long as they don’t leave a mark. I got a good shirt, you know. A respectable shirt. And no needles, I hope? I don’t like needles. But… fine. Let’s get it over with. Hurry up, will you? I got things to do. Important things. Just… be gentle. And explain everything. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Danny. I'll make sure everything is as comfortable as possible. Maria is very gentle, and she’ll explain each step. The stickers are small and won't leave a mark, and the blood draw will be quick. I'll be right here the whole time, explaining everything as we go. Have a seat. Maria should be here any minute. Just relax, and we'll get through this quickly.
