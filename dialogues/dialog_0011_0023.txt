DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bulaong. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my chest hurts. It’s… it hurts in my breast. Not all the time, but it’s been happening for a few weeks now. It’s… strange. I don't know why.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Bulaong. A few weeks of chest pain is certainly something we should investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. Sometimes it feels like… full feeling, you know? Like my breast is heavy. It’s mostly on my left side, I think. Not always there though, like I said. Sometimes I don’t feel anything at all for a day or two, then it comes back. It doesn’t hurt to touch it, not really.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache and a feeling of fullness, primarily on the left side, with periods of remission… that’s helpful information. Does anything specific seem to trigger the pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question… I don’t think so. Not that I've noticed. I work on roofs, so I'm moving around a lot all day. Maybe when I’m really tired, it feels a little worse. But… honestly, I can’t really say anything makes it definitely worse. It just… comes and goes. My wife asked if it was stress, but things are okay with work and home, so I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: That's good to know – no clear triggers, and you don't believe it's stress-related. Working on roofs is physically demanding, so we’ll keep that in mind. Now, have you noticed any changes to the skin in that area – any redness, dimpling, discharge from the nipple, or any lumps you can feel?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Skin looks normal, I think. No redness or anything. And… no, no lumps. I check sometimes, but it feels… smooth. No discharge, either. Just the ache, sometimes the full feeling. It's weird because… I don't really think men get breast problems, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re right to question that, Mr. Bulaong. While it’s less common, men can certainly experience breast conditions. It's good you've been checking for changes. Now, let’s move on to some other questions to get a more complete picture. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Never been sick much. I do get tired from the work, but… just normal work tired. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothing. My wife keeps telling me to get more rest, but… you know how it is. Gotta work.
DOCTOR: I understand the need to work, Mr. Bulaong. Still, it’s good to know you don’t have any pre-existing medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing with my friends, but that's it. Just a cast for a few weeks. Nothing serious. I try to stay away from doctors as much as possible, to be honest. But this… this pain is worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. Avoiding doctors when you’re healthy is sensible, but it’s good you came in to have this checked out. Now, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like breast cancer, heart disease, or other types of cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her stomach, I think. Cancer, maybe? I don’t really remember. And my uncle, he had heart problems, needed a bypass surgery a few years ago. My wife knows more about the family history, she's good with remembering things like that. I don’t think anyone had… breast problems, though.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, thank you. Stomach cancer in your grandmother and heart problems in your uncle are important to note. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything. No pills, no vitamins, nothing. Just water and sometimes coffee to keep me going. I try to stay natural, you know? I don't like putting things in my body if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. I can eat anything, and I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. My wife is the one with allergies, she has to watch what she eats all the time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That simplifies things. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. Maybe a beer with my wife on a Saturday sometimes, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. I try to stay healthy, like I said. Gotta be strong for work, you know?
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Bulaong. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to examine your chest and breasts. It will involve me gently feeling for any lumps or abnormalities. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay, Doctor. Sounds good. I trust you. Just… it’s a little strange, you know? A doctor looking at my chest… But if you think it’s important, go ahead. I want to find out what’s causing the pain.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bulaong. I understand it may feel a bit unusual, but it's an important step in determining the cause of your discomfort. Now, I'm going to palpate your chest and breasts. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable. I’m not feeling any significant lumps, but there is some tenderness in the upper outer part of your left breast, which may be contributing to your pain. I also note the absence of any enlarged lymph nodes in your armpits. Your nipple is normal in appearance with no discharge noted.
PATIENT: Okay… that felt a little weird, but not too bad. That spot is a little tender, you’re right. I hadn't really noticed it before, but now that you’re pressing on it, yeah, it hurts a little. No lumps though, right? Just tenderness?
DOCTOR: Correct, Mr. Bulaong. Just tenderness to palpation, no discrete masses detected. Given your history of intermittent chest pain, the tenderness on palpation, and your age, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One possibility is musculoskeletal pain, perhaps related to the physical demands of your work. Another, though less common in men, is gynecomastia – enlargement of breast tissue. A third possibility, while less likely given your description, is a benign breast condition. To help narrow down the cause, I'd like to order a mammogram and ultrasound of your left breast. These imaging tests will give us a more detailed look at the tissue and help rule out any concerning abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Mammogram and… ultrasound? Okay. Sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? I mean, what are we looking for? And… how much will that cost? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, Mr. Bulaong, and I understand your concern. A mammogram and ultrasound are imaging tests used to visualize the breast tissue. They are not necessarily indicative of something serious. They are simply tools to help us gather more information. We are looking to rule out any abnormalities, such as cysts, fibroadenomas , or, in rare cases, cancerous tissue. Given your symptoms, the likelihood of cancer is low, but it's important to be thorough. Regarding the cost, I understand you do not have insurance. The cost of a mammogram typically ranges from $200 to $400, and an ultrasound can cost between $100 and $200. However, costs can vary depending on the facility. I can help you explore options for financial assistance or reduced-cost imaging centers in the area. There are often programs available for patients without insurance. Before proceeding with the tests, would you like me to provide you with a written estimate of the costs, and information on local financial assistance programs?
PATIENT: Yeah, please. That would be great, Doctor. A written estimate would be really helpful. And any information about places that might be cheaper… or help with the cost. I work hard, but… that’s a lot of money. I want to get this checked out, but I gotta be realistic too.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bulaong. Here’s a list of imaging centers in the area, with their estimated costs for a mammogram and ultrasound. I’ve also included information on several programs that offer financial assistance to patients without insurance. One is the [Name of Local Charity], which provides free or reduced-cost imaging services to eligible patients. Another is [Name of Hospital Financial Aid Program], which offers financial assistance based on income. I will also print out an application form for each program for you. I recommend calling the imaging centers to inquire about their cash prices, and contacting the financial aid programs to see if you qualify for assistance. I will also write you a referral for a mammogram and ultrasound, which you can present to the imaging center of your choice. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the imaging tests once they are available?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot of information. Thank you, Doctor. This is really helpful. I'll call those places and see what I can find out. And I’ll try to fill out those applications. A follow-up appointment sounds good. Let's… maybe two weeks from now? That gives me time to get everything sorted out.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Bulaong. Two weeks should give you ample time to gather information and potentially schedule the imaging tests. Let's schedule your follow-up appointment for August 16th at 2:00 PM. Does that time work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, August 16th at 2:00 PM works perfectly. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better knowing what to do next.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I’m glad I could provide some clarity and guidance. Remember, if you experience any worsening pain, or develop any new symptoms, such as nipple discharge, skin changes, or fever, please contact my office immediately. Here is your referral for the mammogram and ultrasound, and the contact information for the imaging centers and financial aid programs. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to discussing the results with you on August 16th.
PATIENT: .
