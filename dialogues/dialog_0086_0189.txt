DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Dr. Murtic, is it? Well, it’s about my… well, my business. Down there. Been seeing some red in the, uh, bowl. Not a good sign, I reckon. At my age, you don’t want surprises.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood in the stool is certainly something we need to investigate. At your age, prudence is wise. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want me to do, paint a picture? It’s red, Doctor. Like… well, like blood. Not just a streak, mind you. More than a streak. And it’s not every time, thankfully. But enough to worry a fella. I used to fly these big jets, you know? Seen a lot of things, but this… this is unsettling. And frankly, it's a bit undignified to be talking about this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, with all due respect, I'm a physician. I need details to help you. "Like blood" isn't particularly helpful. Is it bright red, dark red, or… something else?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're questioning me? I told you, I fly planes! Not… not analyze the color of things. Fine, fine. It’s… darker, I suppose. Not bright, like a fresh cut. More like… old. Like… well, like it’s been traveling. Does that satisfy your need for “details”? Honestly, all this fuss over a bit of color. People got real problems, you know.
DOCTOR: Darker red suggests it's originating higher up in the digestive tract, potentially. And it is important, Mr. Rowbottom. We need to rule out anything serious. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – more frequent, less frequent, thinner stools, or any pain or discomfort when you go?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. More like… a bit of a struggle, if you catch my drift. And, yes, they're… thinner. Like a pencil, sometimes. Not always, mind you. It's all very inconsistent, which is what's so frustrating! A man likes routine, Doctor. Routine! Everything’s gone to pot these days, and now this. Honestly, at my age, you expect a bit of… slowing down, but this feels different.
DOCTOR: “Slowing down” and changes in caliber are concerning. And inconsistency doesn't rule anything out, unfortunately. Have you experienced any weight loss recently, or noticed any fatigue?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Now that you mention it… the trousers are a bit looser, aren’t they? Haven't been weighing myself, to be honest. Don’t bother with all that nonsense. As for fatigue… well, I nap more. But I’m eighty-eight years old! Napping is practically a hobby at this point. Can’t be bounding around like a young pup, you know. Honestly, you're making me feel like I'm falling apart.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I'm not trying to make you feel unwell. I'm gathering information. The weight loss and fatigue, combined with the blood in your stool and changes in bowel habits, raise a concern for a potential blockage or, more seriously, a growth in the colon. We need to investigate. Have you ever had a colonoscopy before?
PATIENT: A colon… what-now? Sounds… invasive. Never had one of those. And frankly, I don't want one. I’ve survived eighty-eight years without poking around in there, thank you very much. I flew planes over the North Atlantic in a blizzard, faced down some hairy situations, but this… this sounds utterly unpleasant. Are you sure it's necessary? Maybe it's just… something I ate?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, while it could be something you ate, given your age and the constellation of symptoms, a colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing the cause of rectal bleeding and changes in bowel habits. It’s the safest way to rule out something serious, like a polyp or, heaven forbid, cancer. Yes, it's not pleasant, but the potential consequences of not investigating are far more concerning. We can discuss the preparation process and what to expect, and I'll ensure you're as comfortable as possible. Do you have any family history of colon cancer?
PATIENT: Colon cancer… Oh, bother. My sister, bless her soul, had something. Years ago, though. Didn’t end well, if I recall correctly. She was always a worrier, though. Probably got it from all the stress. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, I really do. But I'm not sure I'm up for all that… poking and prodding. Is there… anything else we can try? A blood test, maybe? Something less… intrusive? I'm a stubborn old man, I admit it, but I don't like the sound of this colon… thing.
DOCTOR: A blood test can give us some information, but it won’t definitively tell us what’s going on. It can indicate inflammation, but it won’t reveal polyps or tumors. Given your sister’s history, and your symptoms, I strongly recommend a colonoscopy. However, I understand your apprehension. We can start with a fecal immunochemical test, or FIT test, to detect blood in the stool. If that comes back positive, or if your symptoms worsen, a colonoscopy would be essential. Would that be acceptable to you as a first step?
PATIENT: A… FIT test? Sounds less… dramatic. And if it’s negative… then maybe it is just something I ate? Alright, Doctor. Fine. A FIT test. But if it comes back positive, I’m holding you personally responsible for the trauma. And I expect a very large dose of… whatever you give to make a man forget. Honestly, at my age, a bit of denial is a perfectly acceptable medical strategy.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. A FIT test it is. I’ll have the nurse give you instructions on how to collect the sample. We’ll send it to the lab, and I’ll call you with the results as soon as they're available. As for “trauma,” we'll discuss options for managing any discomfort or anxiety. And I assure you, we'll do everything we can to make the process as smooth as possible. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. A bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s about it. And a strong aversion to unnecessary medical procedures. Does that count? Honestly, Doctor, you’re a very patient woman. I’d be snapping at everyone if I were you. But thank you. For not yelling at an old man.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Rowbottom. It's my job. The nurse will be in shortly with the FIT test kit and instructions. If you experience any bleeding or significant changes in your bowel habits before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… try not to let that FIT test ruin my day. And please, send a gentle nurse. One who understands the anxieties of an eighty-eight-year-old man. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: I’ll make sure of it, Mr. Rowbottom. We’ll take good care of you. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
