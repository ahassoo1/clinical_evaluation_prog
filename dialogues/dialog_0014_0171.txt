DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Welcome. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi. It's… my nails. They look funny. Not good funny. Just… funny. I don't really remember when they started, exactly. A while ago, I guess. They just… changed.
DOCTOR: Changed how, exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh. Well, they’re… not shiny anymore, you know? And kinda… thick. Like they've got something under them. It’s gross. I tried that polish stuff, the red kind, to hide it. Didn't work. It just looks like red gross.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Thick" and not shiny… and you've noticed some discoloration despite using polish. It sounds like we need to take a closer look. Let's have a look at your hands and nails. Just extend them for me, please. I'm going to gently examine them, feel for anything unusual, and see what we're dealing with. Don't worry, I'll be as quick as possible.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But be gentle, okay? I get nervous when people touch my hands. It’s… a thing.
DOCTOR: Alright… yes, I see what you mean. There is some thickening and discoloration, particularly on several of your fingernails. It appears to be a yellowish hue. And there seems to be some slight pitting of the nail surface as well. No obvious pain with palpation, thankfully. It's definitely not normal. Have you noticed this affecting any other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Other parts? Like… where? I don't know. I just noticed my nails. Maybe my feet? I don't really look at my feet. I wear socks all the time. Honestly, I don't think so. I really don't pay attention to much, to be honest. Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Thut, it could be a fungal infection, which is fairly common. That's why I ask about other areas. Sometimes it spreads. But, we can’t be certain without a test. Now, do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, or a weakened immune system?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. I don’t think so. My doctor… well, I haven’t seen a doctor in a long time. I’m mostly healthy. I eat okay, I guess. And I take my vitamins. A regular vitamin. Not the fancy kind. Immune… what now? I just get colds sometimes, like everybody else. I don’t think I’m weakened.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's important to rule things out. And frankly, Ms. Thut, “mostly healthy” and not having seen a doctor in a long time doesn’t tell me much. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you're just being rude. I said I eat okay! And I take vitamins. What more do you want from me? Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I don't take that many medicines. Just… sometimes for headaches. And a little thing for my stomach, when it gets upset.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Let's try to be productive. What is this "little thing" you take for your stomach?
PATIENT: Uhm… I don't remember the name! It’s… pink. The box is pink. And it has… little pills. I get it at the drugstore. You know, the regular drugstore. It helps with… well, you know. When you eat something bad.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, with all due respect, this is… not particularly helpful. We need to identify what you’re taking. Even a vague description helps. Pink box, little pills… that doesn’t narrow it down. Look, I'm going to order a fungal culture of your nails. It will tell us definitively if that's what we're dealing with. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid nail polish altogether. It can trap moisture and worsen the situation. We'll also do a basic blood panel just to rule out anything else going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Blood panel? Do I have to sit there all day? And… a what-now? A culture? Are you growing something on my nails? That sounds awful. And no polish, you said? But I like my red polish! This is just… a mess.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, a fungal culture means we take a small clipping from your nail and send it to a lab to see if a fungus is growing. It’s not growing on your nails, it’s determining if one is present. It's standard procedure. And yes, a quick blood draw. It will take about ten minutes, tops. We'll get these tests done today. The lab results will take a few days. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood. And honestly, for the health of your nails, skipping the polish is a very good idea right now. We need to get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Ten minutes, you said? And what if it is a fungus? Do I have to take gross pills? I don't want to take gross pills. My friend took a pill once and it made her sick all day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, if it is a fungus, there are several treatment options. Some are topical – creams or liquids you apply directly to the nail. If those aren't effective, yes, there are oral medications. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. We will discuss all the potential side effects, if medication is needed, and find the best option for you. Right now, let's just focus on getting the tests done. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood. Do you have any known issues with blood draws?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, okay. I guess. I don’t think so. I mean, I’ve had blood taken before. But I get a little… dizzy sometimes. Not a lot, just… a little. And I don’t like needles. Everybody hates needles!
DOCTOR: Alright. Just let the nurse know you sometimes feel a little dizzy. They're used to it. They’ll have you lie down if needed. I’ll have the results sent to you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, avoid nail polish, try to keep your nails dry, and please, try to remember the name of that stomach medicine. It might be helpful. Is there anything else before I leave?
PATIENT: Ugh… no. I don’t think so. Just… hurry up with the tests. And please tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle. And no growing stuff on my nails!
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Gentle needle, no growing stuff. I’ll make sure to relay that to the nurse. .
