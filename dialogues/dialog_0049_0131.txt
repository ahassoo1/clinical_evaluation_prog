DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s Mykeisha Sladen, actually. And it's my blood pressure, it’s been a bit high lately.
DOCTOR: Sladen, yes, apologies. “A bit high” is rather vague, Ms. Sladen. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. Well, my neighbor, she checks hers all the time 'cause her mom had problems. She let me use her machine a couple of times, and it was over 140 something, both numbers. I don’t really know what that means, exactly, just that she said it wasn't good.
DOCTOR: Right. And when did you first notice these higher readings?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It was probably... sometime in June, I guess? Maybe the beginning of June. I hadn't checked it before that, honestly. I felt okay, so I didn’t think to.
DOCTOR: And have you been experiencing any symptoms along with these readings, Ms. Sladen?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not really. I mean, sometimes I get a little headache, but I get those anyway, you know? Stress and all. Nothing different than usual. No blurry vision or anything like that. I feel pretty normal, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for anything at all?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills if I can help it. Just vitamins, sometimes, when I remember. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My mom always said I had a strong stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get a better idea of what's going on. I'd like to take your blood pressure now, and we'll do a quick physical exam. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Is it cold up there? I always feel chilly in these places.
DOCTOR: It's a standard temperature, Ms. Sladen. Just sit comfortably and try to relax. Now, try not to talk while I take the reading. It can skew the results.
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. This cuff is a little tight, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It needs to be snug for an accurate reading. Just a moment. 162 over 98. Hmm. As I suspected. We’ll need to repeat that a few times to confirm. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Okay. Feels a bit drafty here, Doctor. Is the window closed all the way?
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… regular, but slightly forceful. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please let your arms relax. This might be a little startling.
PATIENT: Okay, relax… that’s me. I don't like surprises, just so you know.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Alright. Based on these initial findings, and your reported readings, it appears you do have elevated blood pressure. It's too early to give a definitive diagnosis, but we'll need some further testing to rule out any underlying causes. I want you to get a lipid panel and a basic metabolic panel. And a 24-hour urine collection. I’ll write you the orders now.
PATIENT: Wow, that's a lot of tests. What exactly are we looking for with all of that? And… a 24-hour urine collection? That sounds… complicated. I’ve never done anything like that before.
DOCTOR: The lipid panel will check your cholesterol levels. The metabolic panel assesses your kidney function and blood sugar. The urine collection helps us to evaluate your kidney function more comprehensively, and to rule out any secondary causes of hypertension. It is a little involved, yes, but the lab will give you very clear instructions. Essentially, you collect every drop of urine for 24 hours, and then bring the container back to the lab. It's standard procedure. It’s important to get a comprehensive picture. We need to rule out kidney disease, hormonal imbalances… a number of possibilities.
PATIENT: Okay… hormonal imbalances? That sounds serious. Is that common? And what if it is something like that? I don't want anything serious.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Ms. Sladen, but it’s important to investigate. Many things can cause elevated blood pressure. It could be something as simple as stress, or dietary factors. But we need to rule out anything more significant. The lab tests will help us determine the best course of action. I'll also write you a prescription for a low-sodium diet. Here are the orders for the lab tests, and your prescription. The lab is just across the hall. I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Two weeks… okay. Low-sodium diet… that’s going to be hard. I love cooking with salt. And a 24-hour urine collection… I really don't know if I can manage that. Is there anything else I can do? Like… are there any foods I should definitely avoid right now, while I'm waiting for the tests? Just to… start making some changes?
DOCTOR: Reducing your sodium intake is paramount, Ms. Sladen. Avoid processed foods, fast food, canned soups, and anything with added salt. Read the labels carefully. As for other changes… try to reduce stress. Easier said than done, I realize, but stress significantly impacts blood pressure. And moderate exercise is always beneficial, provided you don't overexert yourself. The most important thing is to get these tests done so we can determine the underlying cause. Don't delay. Are there any other questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I’ll go to the lab. .
