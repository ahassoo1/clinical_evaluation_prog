DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Krahn, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Krahn. Brando Krahn. Look, if we could just get this over with… I have things to do, you see. Not important, really, but… things.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, let’s be efficient then. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. The… performance thing. They said I needed a check-up. Something about being… cleared? I usher at the theater, mostly. And sometimes take tickets. It's... a requirement, I think. Honestly, I don't recall all the details. It was a lot of paperwork.
DOCTOR: A performance requirement. I see. And what specifically are you hoping I’ll “clear” you for?
PATIENT: Well… standing, mostly. And… being able to see the tickets, of course. And… not collapsing in front of people. You know, general usher duties. It’s not a strenuous job, really. I’ve been doing it for… a long time. I don’t even remember how long, actually. Is there a form I need to sign?
DOCTOR: Right. Standing, vision, and… general stamina. And you said you’ve been doing this for some time. Any changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Let me think. I… I get tired easier, maybe? But everyone does at my age, don't they? And… my knees sometimes ache. But that's probably just the weather. It’s been awfully humid lately. Honestly, I'm not sure what you're looking for. Is something wrong? I don’t feel sick, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: We're just trying to establish a baseline, Mr. Krahn. It's standard procedure. Now, this fatigue – is it new?
PATIENT: New…ish? It’s… harder to say. Things blur a bit these days, you know? I used to be able to go all day, no problem. Now, I might need a little sit-down during intermission. Nothing major. Just… a little break. My ex-wife used to say I never sat down enough. She was always on my case about resting. But that’s another story.
DOCTOR: Right. And regarding your knees, is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when it’s damp, like I said. And after I’ve been on my feet for a while. It's not… sharp pain. More like a… dull ache. I can usually walk it off. I just… try not to bend them too much. It’s embarrassing to hobble around, you know? Especially in front of the patrons. They pay good money to see the show. I wouldn’t want to ruin their experience.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…? Hmm. Not that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Years, probably. I used to have… something with my stomach, maybe? But that was ages ago. It cleared up on its own. I don’t take any medications regularly. My ex-wife always told me I should be more careful, but… I always figured I was pretty healthy. I eat… reasonably well, I think. Mostly. Do I need to remember something specific?
DOCTOR: Let’s try this a different way. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Oh! I think I was allergic to something as a child. Pollen, maybe? But it wasn't severe. Just a little sneezing. I haven't sneezed much lately. Honestly, I can't recall ever having a bad reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things. My ex-wife was very particular about her food...but that's beside the point. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful information, Mr. Krahn. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss this further. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A physical exam. Yes, of course. Standing. I can do that. There. Standing. A little wobbly, perhaps. But standing nonetheless. Just… don’t mind the creaking. It’s just old age.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs first. Please breathe deeply… in and out. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, but a bit shallow. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. 140/90. A little elevated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. Now, let me check your reflexes. Reflexes are… diminished bilaterally. And finally, let’s take a look at your feet. Some mild edema and onychomycosis present.
PATIENT: Ouch! That little hammer thing startled me. And my feet? Is something wrong with my feet? I wear sensible shoes, I always have. As for the rest… I don’t understand all those words. Diminished… bilateral… onycho… what? Is my blood pressure bad? I just want to make sure I can still usher. And take tickets. Is everything okay?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, your blood pressure is a little high. The diminished reflexes and edema in your feet can be signs of… age-related changes, and potentially some circulatory issues. The onychomycosis is just a fungal infection of the toenails, it's not serious, but it’s worth addressing. Given your age, your slightly elevated blood pressure, and these physical findings, I recommend we order some blood work to rule out anything more significant. Also, an EKG to check your heart. And a consultation with a podiatrist to address the condition of your feet. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? A… podiatrist? That sounds… complicated. And expensive. I don't have insurance, you see. I just need a note saying I’m fit to usher. Is that really necessary? All this… I just want to go back to work. I'm not feeling sick. Are you sure something is wrong? Maybe it’s just the weather.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I understand your concerns about cost, but dismissing potential health issues because of inconvenience is not a responsible course of action. The tests I’ve recommended are standard preventative measures, and will provide a clearer picture of your overall health. While you may not be feeling sick, these findings warrant further investigation. I am not comfortable signing a note stating you are “fit to usher” without first establishing a baseline and ruling out potential problems. I can provide you with a list of low-cost clinics and resources in the area. But I strongly advise you to consider these tests. Do you want me to proceed with the orders?
PATIENT: ...Fine. Do the tests. But please… hurry. And tell me how much it will cost, before you order everything. My ex-wife always said I was terrible with money. Just… please, don't make it too complicated. I just want to get this over with. And get back to work.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let me quickly estimate the costs… the blood work will be approximately $150, the EKG around $100, and a podiatrist consultation… likely $120 to $200 depending on the facility. I'll provide you with the lab requisition and a list of podiatrists in the area. You’ll need to schedule the appointments yourself. Here. These are the forms you need. And this is the list of podiatrists. I recommend calling ahead to inquire about their fees and availability. I'll also write a brief summary for your primary care physician, should you have one. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… thank you. I suppose. I’ll… figure it out. I always do. I really need to get back to work… soon. Just… please don't tell my ex-wife. She’ll never let me hear the end of it. .
