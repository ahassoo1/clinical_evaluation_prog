DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. Though, I must say, this…establishment…is rather…simple. But never mind that. I am here because my husband, bless his heart, insists I prepare one of these…Advance Directives, or POLST forms, as he calls them. He says it’s “responsible.” I find it a bit morbid, frankly, but I suppose it’s best to get it over with. Do you have them here?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Advance Directives, or POLST forms as your husband mentioned, are a very sensible thing to have. It’s not morbid at all, really. It’s about your wishes, making sure they’re known if you ever become unable to communicate them yourself. Let me pull one up… We have several different versions here. Before we get started with the form itself, perhaps we can just talk a little bit about what’s important to you. It helps to clarify things. Do you have any specific concerns or questions right off the bat?
PATIENT: Concerns? Well, honestly, the whole thing feels a bit…presumptuous. I am a perfectly healthy woman. Though, I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu last winter. But otherwise, quite robust, thank you. And I certainly don’t want to be filling out paperwork about…what happens when I’m…incapacitated. It’s unpleasant to even think about. I suppose I’m mostly concerned about…losing control, if that makes sense. My husband is very…opinionated, and I wouldn’t want him making decisions for me that I wouldn’t agree with. Is that…allowed for on these forms? Can I specify who can make decisions, and what they can decide?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Marija, and a common one. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. These forms are absolutely about your control, even when you’re unable to express it directly. They are designed to ensure your wishes are respected. You can definitely specify who you want to make decisions for you – that’s called a healthcare proxy, or durable power of attorney for healthcare. And you can be very specific about what decisions they’re authorized to make. We’ll go through it section by section, and you can dictate exactly what you want. It sounds like you want to ensure your husband, or anyone else, only acts in accordance with your clearly stated wishes. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. My husband means well, truly he does. But he has…strong ideas. I wouldn't want him, for example, insisting on some…aggressive treatment that I would find…undignified. I prefer a…natural approach, if you understand. And I certainly wouldn’t want to be kept alive by machines if there’s no hope of recovery. It’s a waste of resources, and frankly, it's a bit barbaric. So yes, it must be very clear what he—or anyone else—is allowed to do. Is there a section on…comfort care? I want to ensure I receive adequate pain management, should the need arise.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can definitely address all of those concerns. The form includes sections for specifying the level of medical intervention you desire, and for outlining your preferences regarding life-sustaining treatment. We’ll discuss things like mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, and resuscitation. And yes, there’s a very important section on comfort care, or palliative care. You can specify your wishes regarding pain management, symptom control, and emotional and spiritual support. We can document your preferences for hospice care as well, if that’s something you’d like to consider. Before we delve into the specifics of the form, perhaps we can briefly touch upon your overall health. You mentioned a bout of the flu last winter. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, nothing serious, doctor. I do have…sensitive digestion. It’s been a lifelong problem, frankly. And I occasionally suffer from migraines, but I manage them with…herbal remedies. I try to avoid conventional medicine whenever possible. It’s full of…unnecessary chemicals. I also have a touch of arthritis in my knees, but it’s manageable with exercise and…a good rug. I am not diabetic, I do not have high blood pressure, and my cholesterol is perfectly acceptable, thank you very much. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, despite everything. I am quite particular about my diet. Organic, of course. And I walk every day. Though the heat has been rather oppressive lately.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Marija. It sounds like you’re very proactive about your health, and that’s excellent. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is incredibly important. Just to clarify, regarding your migraines, are they frequent?
PATIENT: Not terribly frequent, doctor. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. They are usually triggered by stress or…loud noises. I find chamomile tea and a quiet room are usually sufficient to alleviate them. I've never bothered with doctors for them, frankly. They would only prescribe…pills, and I prefer to avoid those, as I mentioned. I find natural remedies are far more effective, and they don't leave me feeling…foggy. I have a rather sensitive system, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. It sounds like you’ve found a routine that works for you, and that’s wonderful. We always respect a patient’s preference for alternative therapies, provided they aren’t interfering with necessary medical care. Now, let’s get back to the Advance Directive. We’ll start with the section on appointing your healthcare proxy. Would you like to name your husband as your proxy?
PATIENT: Well…yes, I suppose so. He is my husband, after all. And he’s quite capable, even if he is a bit…overbearing at times. But I want it clearly stated that he must consult with…a doctor, before making any major decisions. I don’t want him acting on his own impulses. And I want to be very specific about…end-of-life care. I want to be comfortable, and I want to be treated with dignity. Is there a section for that? Perhaps a space to write…notes?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can definitely document all of those preferences. Naming your husband as your healthcare proxy is a good first step. And we can absolutely include a clause specifying that he must consult with a physician before making any major decisions. That’s a very reasonable request. The form does have a section for additional notes, where you can write more detailed instructions regarding your end-of-life care wishes. You can specify what constitutes “comfortable” care for you, and how you want to be treated with dignity. We can also document your preferences regarding pain management, symptom control, and emotional support. Here’s the section for appointing your healthcare proxy. Do you want to confirm your husband’s full name and date of birth for the record?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. His full name is…Jamal Benali. And his date of birth is…July 14th, 1978. Though, he’s rather sensitive about his age, so please don’t mention it to him. He insists he’s still a young man. Honestly, the vanity. But never mind that. I suppose it’s harmless. Just…please don't mention his birthdate. And do make sure it's clearly stated he must consult with a physician. I cannot stress that enough. I’ve seen him…make rash decisions in the past. It’s…unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marija, I’ve entered Jamal’s information and added a clear note about the mandatory physician consultation before any major decisions are made. Now, let’s move on to the section regarding your wishes for life-sustaining treatment. This is where you can specify what types of medical interventions you want, or don’t want, in the event you’re unable to communicate your wishes. We’ll discuss things like mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition, and resuscitation. Would you like to start with mechanical ventilation – that’s breathing assistance with a machine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds…dreadful. Mechanical ventilation…no, absolutely not. I would not want to be kept alive by a machine, if there’s no hope of recovery. It’s…undignified, and frankly, a waste of resources. I believe in a natural death, when my time comes. No machines, no tubes, no artificial anything. Just…comfort care. Is that clear enough? Can we put that in writing? “No mechanical ventilation under any circumstances?” And perhaps add something about…respecting my wishes, even if my husband disagrees? I know he has…strong opinions about these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Marija. I’ve documented your refusal of mechanical ventilation under any circumstances, and I’ve added a clear statement emphasizing the importance of respecting your wishes, even in the event of disagreement with your husband. Here it is in writing… Do you see it?
PATIENT: Yes, I see it. “Patient explicitly refuses mechanical ventilation under any circumstances. Patient’s wishes must be respected, even in the event of disagreement with healthcare proxy.” That’s…satisfactory. Though, perhaps add something about…quality of life? I don’t want to be kept alive if there’s no chance of a meaningful recovery. If I’m…vegetative, or unable to recognize my loved ones, I would prefer…not to be prolonged. Can we add that? It’s rather important, you see. I have…standards.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I’ve added a clause specifying your preference against life-sustaining treatment in the event of no chance of meaningful recovery, and your desire for a focus on quality of life. Does that accurately reflect your wishes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s…much better. “Patient declines life-sustaining treatment in the event of no reasonable expectation of recovery and prioritizes quality of life.” That’s…precise. Though, perhaps add something about…pain management? I want to be comfortable, and I don’t want to suffer needlessly. I want adequate pain relief, should the need arise. I’ve heard…horror stories. And I want to be treated with…dignity. Is that too much to ask? Please, add something about that. It’s rather important to me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. I’ve added a detailed note regarding your desire for comprehensive pain management, including the use of appropriate medication to alleviate suffering, and your expectation of dignified care at the end of life. We’ll ensure your comfort is a top priority. Does this section now accurately reflect your wishes?
PATIENT: Yes, that…seems adequate. Though, honestly, all this talk is rather…depressing. Perhaps we should move on to something else? I suppose artificial nutrition is next? I…don’t want to be fed through a tube, if I’m unable to eat on my own. It’s…undignified. And frankly, I enjoy my food far too much to be deprived of it. Can we add that? “Patient declines artificial nutrition if unable to eat independently.” And perhaps…something about allowing natural death to take its course? I want to be left alone, if that makes sense. No unnecessary interventions. Just…comfort care. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Marija. I’ve added your preferences regarding artificial nutrition – that you decline it if unable to eat independently – and I’ve documented your desire for a natural death, with a focus on comfort care and avoiding unnecessary interventions. We’re nearing the end of the form. Would you like to review the entire document together before we finalize it?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I’d like to be absolutely certain everything is…correct. I’ve had…unpleasant experiences with paperwork in the past. It’s always best to be thorough, you see. Though, honestly, all this talk is rather…exhausting. But it’s important, I suppose. Very important. Please, let’s review it carefully. And do make sure everything is…legible. My husband has terrible eyesight.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marija, let’s begin. First, we have the section on appointing your healthcare proxy, Jamal Benali, with the note that all major decisions must be made in consultation with a physician. Next, we have your explicit refusal of mechanical ventilation under any circumstances, and the statement that your wishes must be respected even in the event of disagreement with your proxy. Then, we have your preference against life-sustaining treatment in the event of no reasonable expectation of recovery, prioritizing quality of life. Following that, we documented your desire for comprehensive pain management and your expectation of dignified care at the end of life. Finally, we have your decline of artificial nutrition if unable to eat independently, and your preference for a natural death with a focus on comfort care. Does that accurately reflect your wishes, Marija?
PATIENT: Yes…yes, that’s…all correct. You’ve captured everything perfectly. Though, it’s rather…grim to read it all together. But it’s necessary, I suppose. And you were very patient with me. I do tend to…ramble. But everything is correct. Yes, absolutely correct. Do you need me to sign it? And where exactly does one sign? I hope it’s not…difficult. My arthritis is acting up today.
DOCTOR: Yes, all that’s left is your signature. It’s a simple process. Here you are. And don’t worry about your arthritis. You can take your time, and I can help steady your hand if you like. There's also a place for the date and witness signature. I’ll witness it for you.
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. That’s very kind of you. There. Is that…acceptable? And do I need to…initial anything else? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, that is perfectly acceptable. Your signature is clear and legible. No initials are required. Here you are. You have a copy for your records, and I will also place one in your electronic medical file. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very helpful, doctor. Though, I must say, I’m rather relieved to have that over with. It’s…unpleasant to think about these things, but necessary, I suppose. Thank you again for your patience. And do try to avoid mentioning my husband’s age. He’s…sensitive about it. Perhaps I should schedule a check-up? Just to be on the safe side.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marija. I completely understand your feelings. It’s not always easy to confront these difficult topics. And rest assured, I will absolutely respect your request regarding your husband’s age. And yes, a check-up is always a good idea. How about we schedule one for…six months from now?
PATIENT: Yes, six months sounds perfectly reasonable. Though, perhaps avoid discussing the Advance Directive during the check-up? It’s rather…depressing. And I don’t want to upset my husband. He’s already…sensitive enough, you see. Thank you again for everything, doctor. You’ve been very kind and accommodating.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. We can focus on other aspects of your health during the check-up. We won’t revisit the Advance Directive unless you specifically request it. It was a pleasure meeting you. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a wonderful day, Marija.
