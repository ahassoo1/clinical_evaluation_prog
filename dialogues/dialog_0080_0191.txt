DOCTOR: Hi Tierney, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I came in to request an HIV test. I’d like to get tested, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, alright. That’s very responsible of you to want to get tested. We can definitely do that. To start, and just so I have a full picture, can you tell me a little bit about why you're wanting to get tested today?
PATIENT: Well, my husband and I… we’ve been together a long time, but recently we’ve been… exploring a bit, shall we say? New experiences. And I just want to be sure. It’s better to know, isn’t it? Especially at our age. I suppose it's a precaution, really.
DOCTOR: It absolutely is better to know, and you’re right to think of it as a precaution. That's very thoughtful of you. Okay. And just to clarify – when you say "exploring", was this a recent change in your relationship, or has this been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: It’s… recent. Very recent. A few months, perhaps? It wasn’t planned, and honestly, it’s a little unsettling. We haven’t discussed protection extensively, which is why I’m here. I should have thought of this sooner, I suppose. It’s just… difficult to talk about these things.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those conversations can be difficult, no judgment at all. A few months is definitely within the window where testing is important. Have either of you had any symptoms that made you think about getting tested – things like fever, fatigue, rash, swollen lymph nodes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms at all. Neither of us has felt unwell. That’s part of what made me hesitate, to be honest. It feels… silly to worry when everything seems fine. But I know you can have it and not know, so… I thought it best to be cautious. My husband is a bit… resistant to the idea, actually. He says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're prioritizing this, even if your husband isn't on board yet. Sometimes it takes a little time to process these things. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment, just to be thorough. Do you have any existing medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been quite healthy, thankfully. A bit of arthritis in my knees, that's all. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I try to eat well and get some exercise, though with the job… it can be difficult to stay active. Standing all day isn't quite the same as a proper workout, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, standing all day is definitely hard on the body, but it’s still something! And good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And I've only been to the hospital for the birth of my children, thankfully. That was many years ago now. It’s been a long time since I’ve needed to see a doctor for anything serious, really. That's probably why I'm a bit… anxious about all this. It feels like entering unfamiliar territory.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had heart trouble later in life. And my sister, she has asthma. But nothing… nothing major that I’m aware of. We don’t really talk about medical things much in my family, if I’m honest. It’s a bit taboo, you know? Everyone keeps to themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can take most medications without any problems. I did have a bit of a sensitivity to a perfume once, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? Nothing serious like penicillin or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, anything like that?
PATIENT: Just a bit of ibuprofen for my arthritis, when it flares up. Nothing regular, just as needed. And a multivitamin, to keep things topped up. But that’s it, really. I don’t believe in taking too many pills, if I can help it. Natural is best, I always say.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. So, no allergies, just ibuprofen and a multivitamin. Now, before we proceed with the HIV test, I want to briefly talk about risk factors. You mentioned exploring new experiences with your husband. Has this involved any unprotected sexual contact?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… that's why I'm here. We haven’t been using protection, no. It started… innocently, a little experimentation. But now I’m worried, of course. It was foolish, I know, but it happened. I’m regretting it now, terribly. I just… I didn't want to spoil the moment. It sounds silly, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all. It’s very common to feel that way, and it’s good you’re being honest with me. Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready. It’s a little embarrassing, but I understand it’s necessary. Please, go ahead. I'll just... try to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but not alarming – it can fluctuate with anxiety. Heart and lungs sound clear, and your throat looks fine. No visible signs of infection. I'm going to take a small blood sample now for the HIV test. It will only be a quick prick. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A quick prick is fine. I've had worse. Please, go ahead. I’m just… a little nervous, if I'm honest. It’s not the pain, it's… the waiting for the results.
DOCTOR: Alright, all done. Just a little pressure for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. The lab should have the results back within a few days, usually 3-5 business days. We’ll call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I want to emphasize that early detection is key, and we can discuss prevention strategies even before we have the results back. Do you have any questions right now?
PATIENT: No, no questions at the moment, thank you. Just… relief that it’s over. Three to five business days… it feels like a very long time. And yes, prevention strategies would be good. Perhaps something we can discuss even if the results are… negative. I suppose it’s best to be prepared, either way. Thank you, Doctor Rosanova.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Prevention is always a good idea. And you’re right, it’s best to be prepared. I'll also give you some information on safer sex practices to take home with you. Regardless of the results, we can talk about PrEP – it's a medication that can significantly reduce your risk of contracting HIV if you and your husband decide to continue exploring. We can also discuss consistent condom use, of course. Do you have any other concerns, Tierney?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for being so… understanding. It wasn’t easy coming here, and you’ve made me feel much less anxious. I appreciate your kindness. And yes, information on PrEP would be good. Just in case. Thank you again, Doctor Rosanova. I suppose I’ll just wait for the phone call.
