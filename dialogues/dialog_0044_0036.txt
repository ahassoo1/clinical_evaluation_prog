DOCTOR: "Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… good to meet you as well. I am here for the… the check-up. Before the insurance starts, yes? They said I need this done. It is… important, I think.
DOCTOR: "Yes, that's right. A welcome to Medicare check-up. Very good of you to come in and get that sorted. It is important – a good baseline assessment is always helpful. Just so I have a clear picture, is there anything specific that prompted you to schedule it now, or were you just following the insurance recommendation?
PATIENT: Just the insurance, Doctor. They sent the… the paper. Said I must do it. I do not… feel sick. Everything is… fine. I work, I eat, I sleep. Nothing is broken, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: "Okay, that’s perfectly alright. These check-ups are often for people who aren’t feeling sick, to catch anything that might be brewing before it becomes a problem. That’s proactive, and I commend you for that. So, 'work, eat, sleep' is good to hear. Let's just go through some details to get a fuller picture. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about your medical history – anything you’ve been through in the past, any family history, things like that?
PATIENT: Medical… history? I do not… understand. What do you mean? Like… old problems? I had the… the usual childhood things. Maybe? I do not remember. My family… they are in Yemen. It is… difficult to ask them things. We do not talk often. It is… far away.
DOCTOR: "That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Barban. ‘Old problems’ just means anything you’ve been treated for in the past – illnesses, injuries, surgeries. Even if you don't remember specifics, that’s okay. We can move on. And it's completely understandable about your family – distance makes things difficult. We don’t need to have a detailed family history if that’s not possible right now. Let’s focus on you. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions - things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I am… strong. I lift heavy things at work. I eat… normal food. Not too much sugar. My father… he had problems with his stomach, maybe? But I do not know. It was a long time ago. He is… gone now. Everything else… I am fine. Really. I do not need… pills. I do not like pills.
DOCTOR: "Okay, that’s good to know. And I understand your hesitation about medication. We're not here to just prescribe pills, Mr. Barban. The goal is to understand your health, and only use medication if it's truly necessary. You mentioned lifting heavy things at work. What kind of work do you do, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: I work at the… the food place. Processing. We take the… vegetables and… clean them. Box them. It is… hard work. Many hours. But it is… work. It pays. We also do the… the meat sometimes. Chicken, mostly. It is… cold work sometimes. A lot of standing.
DOCTOR: "Okay, food processing. That is hard work, especially on your feet for long hours. And handling food, especially meat, brings its own considerations. Have you had any injuries at work, like strains or sprains, from the lifting or repetitive motions?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Maybe a little… ache in my back sometimes. After a long day. But I rub it. It goes away. I am… tough. My grandfather, he was a farmer. Very tough. I am like him. No need for a doctor for a little back pain. It is… normal. Old age is coming, yes? Even though I am not old.
DOCTOR: "Well, your grandfather sounds like a remarkable man! And you certainly sound capable. But even capable people can benefit from checking things out, just to be sure. Back pain is common, but we want to rule out anything more serious, especially given the type of work you do. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: The… the exam? You want to… touch me? I do not… understand why. But… okay. If it is… necessary. I suppose. Just… be quick, Doctor. I have things to do. And… please, be gentle. My back is… important for my work. Do not break it.
DOCTOR: "Absolutely. I understand your concerns, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. This is just a routine check to make sure everything is functioning as it should. We’ll start with your blood pressure – just a cuff around your arm. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Finally, I’ll take a look at your back – I’ll just have you stand and move around a bit so I can see how you move. I'll explain everything as I go. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright. But… do not take too long. And… if it hurts, I will tell you. I am not… afraid. But I need my back. For work. Begin. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: "Okay, Mr. Barban. Just relax your arm for me. I'm just going to inflate this cuff – it will feel a bit tight for a moment, but it won't hurt. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just take deep, slow breaths for me." "Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear – I don't hear any wheezing or crackling. Alright, now if you could just stand up for me, and I'll take a look at your back. Can you bend forward slightly, and then stand up straight?
PATIENT: It… aches. A little. But it is… normal. Like you said. Old age. I also… feel a little… funny sometimes. Like… a pinching in my lower back. But it goes away. Usually. It happens when I lift… the heavy boxes. Do you… see anything wrong? I do not like doctors. They always find something wrong.
DOCTOR: "I do feel some muscle tightness and tenderness in your lower back, particularly on the left side. It doesn’t appear to be anything acute – no signs of a serious injury. The pinching sensation you describe sounds like it could be a minor nerve irritation, possibly related to the muscle tightness. It's good you're aware of your body and what triggers the pain. We’ll need to rule out a few things, just to be thorough. I want to order some blood work - a complete blood count and a metabolic panel - just to get a baseline understanding of your overall health. And I’d like to get an X-ray of your lower back to see if there’s anything structural going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? More… poking and prodding? I do not… like this. Is it… expensive? I do not have… much money. I work hard for my money. Just to take it away with… tests? Can I not… just rub my back and be done with it? It is… fine. Really. It always goes away. This is… too much. I just needed the paper for the insurance. Not… all of this.
DOCTOR: "I understand your concerns, Mr. Barban. I completely appreciate that you’re worried about the cost and don’t want unnecessary tests. I want to assure you, I wouldn’t be suggesting these tests if I didn’t think they were potentially helpful. The blood work and X-ray are relatively inexpensive, and covered by Medicare, so you shouldn’t have any out-of-pocket costs. They’ll give us a better understanding of what might be causing your back pain and help us rule out anything serious. If everything comes back normal, then we can focus on simple things like stretching and strengthening exercises. We don’t have to do them right away if you’re truly uncomfortable. But I do want to be cautious and thorough, especially given your physically demanding job. Let's start with the blood work. If that comes back normal, we can discuss whether or not to proceed with the X-ray. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. The blood work. Just the blood work. But… be quick. I have work tomorrow. And… do not tell me anything bad. I do not want to hear about… problems. Just… take the blood and be done. No poking. No prodding. Just… the blood. Is it… much blood? I do not like needles. At all.
DOCTOR: "Okay, Mr. Barban. Just the blood work. I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. And I'll explain everything as I go. It's just a small amount of blood, drawn from your arm. And I’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. I’ll use a small needle, and you might feel a brief pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. We’ll collect a few tubes, and then you’ll be all done. I’ll have you sit comfortably, and we’ll get started."
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: "Okay, all done. Just keep that bandage on for a few hours to prevent any bleeding or bruising. I’ll send these samples to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. I’ll have my nurse call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your pain worsens or you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, please don’t hesitate to call us immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
