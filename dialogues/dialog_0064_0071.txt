DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. Well, it’s about getting some shots, I reckon. My daughter, she’s trying to get her husband’s paperwork sorted out so he can come live here. She said I need to come see a doctor to make sure he has everything he needs, shot-wise, for the immigration. It's a bit confusing, all of it.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Immigration paperwork. Yes, I’ve done a few of those. It can be a bit confusing, you're right. So, your daughter needs documentation of your vaccination history for her husband?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. She said something about needing proof of certain vaccinations… and maybe some new ones? I honestly don’t remember exactly what she told me. It was a long phone call, and I tend to… well, I forget things sometimes. But she was very clear about needing to come to a doctor. Is this something you handle often?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Mr. Skarbek. Many people find keeping track of vaccinations difficult. And yes, we do handle these quite often. We’ll go through everything and see what records we can find, and what, if anything, might need updating. Let me pull up your chart here… Ah, yes. Karry Skarbek, date of birth… Okay. Now, the record isn’t extensive… it seems we have some childhood vaccinations documented from when you were younger, but not much beyond that. Do you happen to have any old vaccination records you could bring in, perhaps from a previous doctor or the military, if you served?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. I really don't. My childhood was… a long time ago, and we didn't keep very good records back then, not like now. And no, I never served in the military. I mostly just worked, you see. I was a teacher, a library teacher, at the college for many years. I mostly remember getting a flu shot every year, but that was always right at the school. I don't have any proof of those, either, I suppose. It’s just… a lot of years have gone by. What does this mean for my daughter’s husband? Is he going to have trouble getting his paperwork done?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek. Don't worry too much just yet. It doesn't automatically mean there will be trouble. We can work around this. The good news is we can do some blood tests – we call them titers – to see if you already have immunity to certain diseases. If you do, that’s just as good as having the vaccination record. If not, we can get you updated. Let's start with a basic review of systems. Just to get a good overview. Have you been feeling generally healthy lately?
PATIENT: Yes, I reckon I have. I get a little tired, you know, being my age, but nothing serious. No aches or pains, really. I can still get around pretty good. I go for a walk most mornings, down by the river. My appetite’s been alright, too. I eat regular. No fever or chills or anything like that. Just… old, I suppose. Is that what you need to know, Doctor? About feeling sick?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Skarbek. That’s a very helpful overview. And it’s good you’re still active. When you say “old”, are you experiencing any changes in your daily life?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… my memory, like I said, ain’t what it used to be. I forget things, mostly small things. Where I put my glasses, what I had for breakfast. Sometimes I have trouble remembering names, even people I’ve known for a long time. And… well, sometimes I get a little confused. Not all the time, but enough to worry me sometimes. My daughter says it's just getting old, but… I worry it's something more. Does that make sense, Doctor? I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Skarbek. It’s good you’re bringing this up. It’s very common to experience memory changes as we get older, but it’s always important to investigate, just to be sure. We can do a simple cognitive assessment here today, just some basic questions to get a better understanding. It doesn't take long. Before we do that though, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really, Doctor. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. My mother, she had high blood pressure, but I never have. I’ve had the usual things, you know, colds and the flu, a bad back once when I was lifting books at the library. But nothing serious, nothing a doctor ever had to treat for very long. I’ve always been pretty healthy, up until… well, lately, with the forgetting and all. I take a little medicine for my arthritis, just when it flares up. It helps with the pain. Is that what you need to know? Anything else I should be telling you?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Skarbek. Very good. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh, yes. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And… and I had a cataract removed from my right eye a few years back. That was a good thing, helped me see much better. Other than that, no. No other surgeries, not that I can remember. Is that important for this shot business? I’m worried I’m rambling, Doctor. My daughter always says I do that when I get nervous.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Mr. Skarbek. It's good to know about the appendix and the cataract surgery, thank you. And don't worry about being nervous. It's perfectly understandable. It's helpful for me to have a complete picture. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of, Doctor. Never had any trouble with any medicines or food. I eat pretty much anything. My daughter tries to get me to eat healthier, more vegetables and such, but I don’t mind most foods. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, not ever. I’ve always been pretty lucky, like I said. Does that help? I’m trying to think of everything. My mind feels a little foggy today.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Skarbek. And don’t worry about the “foggy” feeling. We’ll take things at your pace. Now, let’s talk about your family. Has anyone in your family had any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. My mother, she had that high blood pressure, like I said. And she had arthritis, too, pretty bad toward the end. My father, he died of a heart attack when he was pretty young, maybe in his sixties. And… and my sister, she had diabetes. She had to take shots for it, I remember that. Other than that, not really. Nothing major, not that I recall. We weren’t a very close family, so I don’t know a whole lot about their medical histories. Does that help, Doctor? I'm sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Skarbek. You've given me a lot of helpful information. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can move on to a quick physical exam, if you’re up to it. Do you currently take any medications regularly, besides the arthritis medicine when needed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, just that arthritis medicine when my joints bother me. I used to take something for my cholesterol, but the doctor took me off it a few years back. Said it wasn’t needed anymore. I don't take any vitamins or supplements, either. I don't really believe in all that stuff. Just the arthritis medicine, when I need it. That’s it. Is that all? I’m ready to get this over with, if you are. I’m starting to feel a little tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all. You’ve been very helpful, Mr. Skarbek. And perfectly alright, we can move on to the physical exam whenever you're ready. It won't take long. If you could just sit up on the table for me, that would be great. We'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. I reckon I can manage that. It’s just… I don’t like doctors very much, not really. Too many poking and prodding. But I understand it has to be done. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll try to be a good patient. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Skarbek. Just relax and breathe normally. Blood pressure is a little bit high today, but that could be from being at the doctor's office. It happens. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear, but there's some mild decreased air entry at the bases. Ears are clear. Throat looks clear. Thyroid is normal in size and consistency. No nodules felt. Okay, everything sounds and looks reasonably good, Mr. Skarbek. A slight murmur and mild decreased air entry, which we'll keep an eye on. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but we'll monitor that as well. Now, let's talk about the vaccinations…
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds… alright, I guess. You said something about monitoring things? Does that mean I’m sick? I don't want to be sick. I just want to get this done so my daughter’s husband can come live here. Is that too much to ask? I’m starting to feel a little anxious again. It's just… I worry a lot, you see. Especially about my family.
DOCTOR: No, no, it doesn't mean you're sick, Mr. Skarbek. “Monitoring” just means we’ll keep an eye on those things – your blood pressure and your heart and lungs – to make sure everything stays stable. It’s a precaution, nothing more. Now, regarding the vaccinations, as I mentioned earlier, your records aren’t very extensive. To be on the safe side, and to meet the immigration requirements, we should check your immunity to certain diseases. We can do this with a simple blood test – a titer. It’ll tell us if you already have antibodies, which means you’re protected. If not, we may need to give you a booster shot. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A blood test, huh? I don't like needles. Never have. But I suppose if it's the only way… alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. And it won’t hurt too much, will it? My daughter always says I’m a big baby when it comes to needles. But it’s the principle of the thing, you see. I just don’t like them. Is this going to take a lot of blood? I get faint sometimes, you know. Especially when I’m nervous. And I’m very nervous right now.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be nervous, Mr. Skarbek. Many people don’t like needles, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. We’ll take it slow and easy. It’s just a small amount of blood, a few vials – probably no more than what we took for your basic checkup today. And the phlebotomist is very experienced and gentle. We can have you lie down during the blood draw, just in case you feel faint, and we’ll be right there with you. Would you like to lie down now, just to be prepared?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I think I would like to lie down. Just in case. My daughter always says I worry too much, but… well, she doesn't have to get a needle stuck in her arm, does she? Just let me know when it’s going to happen. I don’t want to be surprised. And please be gentle. Very gentle. I’m trusting you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek. Just relax and breathe deeply. The nurse will be in shortly to start the blood draw. I’ll be right here with you the whole time. Now, while we’re waiting for the nurse, let’s talk about the specific vaccinations required for immigration. They typically include measles, mumps, rubella, varicella , influenza, and tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis. Depending on your age and medical history, you may also need hepatitis A and B. We’ll confirm all the requirements once we have the results of your blood tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. As long as you promise to be gentle. My arm is already starting to ache just thinking about it. Chickenpox, huh? I had chickenpox when I was a boy. I was very sick. But I don’t remember getting any shots for it. Just hurry up, please. I want to get this over with. And please don’t let the nurse poke me too much. I hate needles. I really, really hate needles. Is she a good nurse, Doctor? Is she gentle? You said she was good, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Skarbek, she’s an excellent nurse, very experienced and gentle. Her name is Nurse Ramirez, and she’ll take very good care of you. Just relax your arm, and Nurse Ramirez will do the rest. It will be quick and easy, I promise. I’ll be right here, keeping an eye on everything. Just breathe deeply, Mr. Skarbek. You’re doing great.
PATIENT: Just… just get it over with quickly, please. I don't want to look. I really, really don't. This is awful. I hate needles. I hate doctors. I hate everything. Is it done yet? Is it done yet?
DOCTOR: Almost done, Mr. Skarbek. Just a little pinch… almost there… Okay, all done, Mr. Skarbek. You did great. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: It… it stings a little. And my arm feels… heavy. I don’t like this. I really don't. Is… is it over now? Do I have to get another one? Please tell me I don’t have to get another one. I think I’m going to be sick.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal for it to sting a little, Mr. Skarbek. And your arm might feel heavy for a little while. That’s just your body reacting to the injection. It will pass. And no, that’s all the injections for today. We just need to wait for the results of the blood tests to see if you need any booster shots. But for now, that’s all done. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: I… I think I’m alright now. Just a little shaken up. And my arm still hurts. But I guess it’s not too bad. So… what happens now? Do I have to wait here? How long will it take to get the results? I just want to go home. I just want to sit down and relax. This has been… a very stressful day.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s perfectly understandable that you’re feeling stressed, Mr. Skarbek. You’ve been very brave. You don’t have to wait here. We’ll call you with the results of the blood tests, usually within a few business days. And we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine if any booster shots are needed. In the meantime, just try to relax and take it easy. If you experience any severe pain, swelling, or fever, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… just please call with the results as soon as you can. I just want to get this over with. Thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. You were very kind. And Nurse Ramirez, too. Even though… even though I don't like needles. I think I’ll just go home and rest now. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. You take care now, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
