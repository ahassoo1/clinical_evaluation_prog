DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Todoroovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have… a problem with my ear. It is leaking something. A discharge, yes? It started maybe… two days ago. Not much at first, but now… more.
DOCTOR: Okay, a discharge from your ear that's been increasing over the last couple of days. Alright. And is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left ear, Doctor. The right one is fine. No problem with that one at all. I noticed it after my shower yesterday. Perhaps water got inside? Though I try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And is there any pain with it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really pain. A little… stuffy, maybe? Like when you have a cold. But not pain. And no fever, I do not think. I checked this morning.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, just a stuffy sensation in the left ear and discharge. Has this happened before, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. This is the first time, as far as I remember. I have had colds, of course. Many times. But never… this leaking. I am usually very careful with my ears. I do not put anything in them.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any hearing loss, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: No ringing, Doctor. But… yes, I think my hearing is a little quieter in that ear. Not much, but I have to listen closer when people speak on that side. It is… subtle, yes? I noticed it this morning when my neighbor spoke to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Subtle hearing loss and discharge. Now, let’s take a quick look. Could you sit up and face me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. Please, take your time. I want to get this fixed. It is… worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm just going to take a look inside your ear now. It might be a little uncomfortable for a moment. Just let me know if you feel any sharp pain. Hmm. Yes, I see some fluid in the ear canal and the eardrum appears… slightly bulging. There’s a bit of redness as well. It looks like you likely have an outer ear infection – otitis externa. It's probably irritated and infected. The redness and fluid are consistent with that. It’s common, especially with a bit of moisture. We’ll want to confirm, but it seems pretty straightforward. Do you have any allergies to ear drops, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have allergies, not that I know of. I have never used ear drops before. This is all new to me. So, this is from the moisture, you think? From the shower? Is it… serious? I need to teach tomorrow. Will I still be able to?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. Yes, it's very likely related to the moisture from the shower – water getting trapped in the ear canal creates a nice environment for bacteria to grow. As for serious… it's not life-threatening, thankfully. But it can be quite painful if left untreated, and it can potentially affect your hearing. It's good you came in now. And I understand you need to teach tomorrow. We’ll get you started on some ear drops – antibiotic drops – to clear up the infection. They should start to provide some relief within a day or two. I'll write you a prescription. Now, I'd like to get a quick look in your right ear just to make sure everything's normal there. It’s just standard procedure. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. I understand. Antibiotic drops, yes. And checking the other ear… perfectly sensible. Please, do what you need to do. I want to be sure. It is good to know everything is alright. Thank you for explaining it so clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your right ear looks perfectly normal – clear ear canal, healthy eardrum. Good. So, I’m going to prescribe you Ciprofloxacin ear drops. Use them twice a day for seven days. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if your ear feels better after a few days, to make sure the infection is completely cleared. Also, avoid getting water in your ear as much as possible during this time – maybe use earplugs in the shower for a few days. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Seven days, twice a day. Ciprofloxacin, yes. And earplugs in the shower. I can manage that. No, Doctor, I do not think I have any questions right now. That seems… straightforward. Will the prescription be sent to my usual pharmacy? The one on Elm Street?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ve already sent it to Elm Street Pharmacy. They should have it ready for you within the hour. Now, just to be safe, if your symptoms don't improve after three days, or if you develop a fever, severe pain, or any dizziness, please call the clinic immediately. Okay?
PATIENT: Three days, no improvement, call. Fever, pain, dizziness, call. Yes, Doctor, I understand. I will keep that in mind. Thank you very much for your help. I feel much better knowing what is going on. Is there anything else I need to do, or anything I need to pay for?
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. The only thing left is the cost of the visit, which should be covered by your insurance. The pharmacy will handle the cost of the ear drops, and that will depend on your insurance coverage. I’ll have the nurse print out a summary of our visit for you, including the instructions for the ear drops. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. A summary of the visit sounds good. Thank you again for your time and your clear explanations. I appreciate it very much. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. The nurse will be right in with that summary. You have a good day too, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
