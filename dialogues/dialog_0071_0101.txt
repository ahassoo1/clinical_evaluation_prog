DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Or… Aldine, if you prefer?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Galena. Aldine is just fine, yes. Pleased to meet you. Though I’d be happier if it weren’t for this headache, eh?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, headaches are never pleasant. I understand. So, tell me, Aldine, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s right at the back of my head, this pain. Started a few days ago, just a little niggle. Thought it was maybe from bending over the nail files all day, you know? But it hasn’t gone away, and it’s getting… sharper. Not constant, mind you, comes and goes. But when it comes, oh boy. It’s a proper throb.
DOCTOR: A throbbing pain at the back of the head, started a few days ago, and getting sharper… not constant. Alright. And can you tell me, is anything else happening along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no dizziness. I haven’t been sick to my stomach or anything like that. Vision seems alright, I can see just fine. Maybe a little tired, but that’s just old age catching up with me, I suppose! I’ve been sleeping alright, though. Usual seven, eight hours.
DOCTOR: No fever, no dizziness, vision is good… some fatigue, but usual sleep patterns. Okay. Have you noticed any stiffness in your neck at all?
PATIENT: Stiffness… now that you mention it, yes. A little bit. Not awful, mind you, but when I turn my head from side to side, it feels a bit… tight. Like I’ve been looking down at something for too long. Is that… normal with these headaches, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, neck stiffness is good to know. It can be related, yes. Now, have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get little tension headaches sometimes, from being hunched over the manicure table all day, but they usually go away with a bit of rest and a cup of tea. This… this feels different. Deeper, sharper, you know? And it lingers. I’ve never had one that lasts this long before.
DOCTOR: Different from usual tension headaches, lasting longer… Alright. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your past medical history, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, go ahead. Ask away. I’ll try my best to remember. Though, at my age, things do tend to get a bit… fuzzy. I haven’t been to the doctor in… well, a long time, to be honest. Just the usual check-ups when I was younger. Nothing serious, ever.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We'll take it slow. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or any heart problems?
PATIENT: No, never. The doctor always said I was as strong as an ox, back in the day! Blood pressure, no. Diabetes, no. And my heart… well, it still beats, doesn’t it? I eat pretty healthy, mostly fish and vegetables, my wife makes sure of that. Though I do have a sweet tooth, I confess. A little rum cake now and then, can’t resist.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Never needed any. Broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree, but they just put it in a cast. That was it. Nothing serious. I always took good care of myself, you know? And I always had a strong constitution. Oh! Except… when my wife had our daughter, I was at the hospital with her, of course. But that wasn’t me being a patient, was it? Just a worried husband.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Ah, family. My mother, God rest her soul, she lived to be 98. She had arthritis, mostly. My father, he passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I think. My sister… she’s still living, back in Jamaica, doing well as far as I know. No history of headaches, not that I recall. Oh, my wife’s mother… she had migraines, terrible things, but she was on medication for them. That was decades ago, though. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, I'm going to ask about any medications you take, even over-the-counter ones, and any allergies you have. Do you currently take any pills, creams, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my joints now and then, when they get a bit creaky. Glucosamine, I think it's called. And sometimes, if I'm really aching, I'll take an ibuprofen. Nothing regular, though. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always checks the labels, she’s very careful. I think I’m alright, yes. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart, and do a quick neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Though, be gentle with this old frame, eh? I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148 over 92. That's not drastically high, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and some basic neurological function. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Balance is a little unsteady, but within normal limits. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. No problem, Doctor. Used to be a steady hand with the nail files, you know. Still am, when I can. Though these old eyes do get tired easier these days. Is everything alright? You look… serious.
DOCTOR: Everything is okay, Aldine. It’s just… the slightly elevated blood pressure combined with the headache and the neck stiffness, and diminished reflexes… It’s not necessarily alarming, but it warrants some further investigation. To rule out anything serious, I'd like to order a CT scan of your head. It will give us a clearer picture and help us determine the cause of your headache. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A CT scan… hmm. I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… painful? And is it safe? I've heard things, you know, about those machines. I don’t want to be exposed to anything that’ll do me harm. My wife would be terribly upset.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Aldine. It's perfectly natural to be worried about something new. A CT scan is not painful at all. You will simply lie on a table and the machine will take images of your head. It's like a very powerful X-ray. There is a small amount of radiation involved, but it’s a very low dose and the benefits of finding out what’s causing your headache far outweigh the risks. I wouldn’t recommend it if I thought it was unsafe. We’ll take all the necessary precautions to minimize your exposure. And, as you’re uninsured, we’ll explore options to keep the cost as low as possible. Would you like me to explain the process in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. Explain it to me like you’re talking to my grandson, eh? He's always asking me about these things, but I never quite understand the medical jargon. And tell me… what exactly are you looking for with this scan? Is it something serious? My wife… she worries so much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Think of it like taking a picture of the inside of your head. Your grandson knows how a camera works, right?
PATIENT: Yes, he’s always taking photos with his phone. A very modern boy, that one.
DOCTOR: Well, a CT scan is similar. It uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of your brain, bones, and blood vessels. It’s a lot more detailed than a regular X-ray. It doesn't hurt – you just lie very still on a table while the machine takes the pictures. It takes just a few minutes. As for what we’re looking for… well, a headache like yours can be caused by many things. Most of the time, it’s nothing serious – maybe tension, maybe a bit of dehydration. But, because you mentioned the neck stiffness and the slightly diminished reflexes, I want to rule out anything more serious, like a bleed in the brain, a tumor, or a blockage. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially at your age. We're looking for anything unusual that might be pressing on your brain or causing the pain. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes a little more sense. A bleed, a tumor… oh dear. But you said most of the time it’s nothing serious. And you wouldn’t recommend it if you thought it was dangerous, would you? My wife… she’ll want to know everything. And the cost… I don't want to be a burden. Can we talk about that now?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask. The vast majority of headaches like yours are not serious. We're being cautious, and doing this scan to rule things out. I would never recommend a test that I felt wasn’t necessary or that carried significant risk. As for the cost… it’s a difficult situation, being uninsured. Let me see… the scan itself will likely cost around $400-$600. However, I can talk to the hospital billing department and see if we can work out a payment plan, or potentially get financial assistance. We can also explore options for a more affordable scan at a different facility if needed. I’ll also see if we can get a discount for paying in cash. I want to make sure you get the care you need without causing undue financial hardship. I’ll write down the contact information for the hospital billing department and a few other resources. Now, let’s get this scan scheduled. Would tomorrow morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… hmm. That might be a bit rushed. My wife and I usually have a quiet breakfast together. But… …if it’s important, I suppose I could rearrange things. As long as I know exactly what to expect. And if it's not too early. And can my wife come with me? I'd feel much better having her there.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Your wife is more than welcome to come with you. Having someone there for support is always a good idea. And we can certainly try to find a time that works better. How about 10 am tomorrow?
PATIENT: 10 am… yes, that might be better. Gives me time for a proper breakfast with my wife. And it's not too early for her to get up. Okay, 10 am tomorrow. You said she can come with me, right? And you’ll explain everything again before the scan? I’m a bit worried about being stuck in that machine. Is it… claustrophobic?
DOCTOR: Yes, your wife can absolutely come with you. And I will explain everything again before the scan, step-by-step. I understand your concerns about being in the machine, and it's perfectly normal to feel a little anxious. The machine is relatively open, it's not a completely enclosed tube. It's more like a large donut shape. And we can give you medication to help you relax if you're feeling particularly anxious. We can even have someone stay with you during the scan if that makes you more comfortable. I’ll write all of this down for you. Here's the information about the scan, the hospital address, my contact number, and a few notes about what to expect. I’ve also included the information about the financial assistance program. Please call if you have any questions or concerns at all. We'll do everything we can to make this as comfortable and stress-free as possible. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve been very patient with my questions, Doctor. And I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. My wife will be relieved to hear about the financial assistance. And I’ll try not to worry too much. Thank you, Doctor Galena.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aldine. My pleasure entirely. Remember, we're just being cautious. And please, don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up before tomorrow. We'll see you then. Have a good rest of your day, and please give your wife my best.
