DOCTOR: Hi Gedalya, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they’ve been drooping. It's been happening for a little while now, maybe a few months, and it’s getting worse. I was hoping you could take a look.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids for a few months, progressively getting worse. That definitely warrants a look. Thanks for coming in to get it checked out. To start, can you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… it’s not like I can’t do things, not yet. But things feel heavier, you know? Lifting things is harder. Even just holding my arms up for a while… they start to shake. It feels like my muscles get tired very easily. It started in my arms, I think, but now I feel it in my legs too, a little. It’s… frustrating, honestly. I used to be quite strong, for my size, and now… well, you can see.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it started in your arms, now it's affecting your legs, and things just feel more effortful than they used to. You mentioned shaking – is that constant, or does it happen with activity?
PATIENT: It's definitely with activity, Doctor. Not constant, thankfully. If I'm just sitting, or resting, I don’t notice it. But if I try to lift something, or even hold my arms out like I was… showing someone how to do an exercise, then they start to shake. It's not a violent shake, more of a… tremble, really. And it gets worse the longer I keep them up.
DOCTOR: Okay, trembling with exertion, worsening with sustained activity. That’s helpful. Do you notice it happening more at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… I hadn’t really thought about that, actually. But thinking about it now… yes, I suppose it is a bit worse in the evenings. By the end of the day, everything feels more tired, and the trembling starts sooner. In the mornings, I feel a little better, but it doesn’t last.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be worse as the day goes on. Now, about the drooping eyelids - have you noticed any double vision, blurry vision, or any difficulty swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. My vision is… well, it's fine. Maybe a little tired, if I've been reading for a long time, but no double vision or blurriness. And I haven’t had any trouble swallowing or speaking, not that I've noticed, anyway. It's just the eyelids themselves, drooping down. It makes me look… very tired, I suppose. People have asked if I’m getting enough sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, no double vision, blurry vision, or difficulty with swallowing or speech. Just the eyelid drooping. Do you have any family history of any muscle problems or weakness?
PATIENT: That's a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we aren't very close, I’m afraid. My parents passed away some time ago, and I don’t really know much about their side of the family. I have a sister, but we haven’t spoken in years. I don't recall anyone specifically having muscle problems, no. But… I really wouldn’t know for sure. It’s possible, I suppose. It’s not something we ever talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history information. That’s alright, we can work with that. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing diagnosed. I’ve always been… relatively healthy, all things considered. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I haven’t been hospitalized or had any surgeries. I try to eat a balanced diet and get some exercise when I can, though lately, with the weakness, it's been harder. I haven’t really been to a doctor in… well, it's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, no surgeries, and generally healthy until recently. No current medications or allergies, correct?
PATIENT: That's right. No medications at all, and no allergies that I’m aware of. Nothing to worry about on that front, thankfully. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, as far as I know. I used to worry about bee stings, but I've never been stung.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No medications or allergies. Alright, Gedalya, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and look at your eyelids more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I'm ready whenever you are. I'm hoping you can figure out what's going on. It's just… unsettling, not knowing.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything looks good so far. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please relax your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Relaxed. Like this? Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I'm a little nervous, I must admit, but I'm trying to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gedalya, thank you for cooperating. Your reflexes are a little bit on the slower side, and your muscle strength is a little weaker than it should be, though not dramatically so. Your eyelids are drooping, as you mentioned, more noticeably on your right side. I don’t see any obvious problems with your pupils. Do you have any trouble with your vision at all now, looking straight ahead?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. My vision seems… normal. I mean, a little tired, perhaps, but no blurriness, no double vision, nothing like that. I can see you clearly enough. It's just… tiring, looking down for too long. I find myself squinting a little, sometimes. But straight ahead is fine. It's a bit strange, really. It’s not a constant problem, more of a… strain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so strain with prolonged downward gaze. I'm going to order some blood tests. I want to check your thyroid function, your vitamin D levels, and also a complete blood count to rule out any underlying anemia or infection. We also need to test for something called acetylcholine receptor antibodies. This is just to be thorough, as it can sometimes cause muscle weakness and drooping eyelids. Would you be able to come back in a few days to discuss the results?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Blood tests, then come back to discuss. Of course. Acetylcholine… receptor antibodies, you said? Is that… something serious? I apologize, I don’t pretend to know much about these things. I just… I’d like to understand a little bit about what we’re looking for. And yes, I can definitely come back in a few days. Just let me know when would be convenient.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to ask, Gedalya. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies are associated with a condition called Myasthenia Gravis. It's an autoimmune disorder where your immune system mistakenly attacks the connections between your nerves and muscles, causing weakness and fatigue. But we're not diagnosing anything yet. The blood tests will help us rule it in or out. There are many other potential causes for your symptoms, and we need to investigate those as well. I’ll have the lab draw the blood now. They’ll need a sample for a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, vitamin D level, and the acetylcholine receptor antibody test. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. I'll call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. If your symptoms worsen significantly, especially if you develop any difficulty breathing or swallowing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot to take in, Doctor. Myasthenia Gravis… that sounds quite serious. But you’re right, you said we're not diagnosing anything yet. Just ruling things in or out. I understand. No, I think I’m okay for now. I’ll try to avoid strenuous activity, and I will absolutely go to the emergency room if anything gets worse. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness, and… honestly, just for taking the time to listen to me. It’s been worrying me for a while now. I suppose I’ll just wait for the results, then. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gedalya. It’s my job to listen and figure out what’s going on. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I’ll talk to you soon.
