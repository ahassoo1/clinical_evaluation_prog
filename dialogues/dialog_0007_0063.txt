DOCTOR: Hi Larin, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Hernandez. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my back. It’s really hurting. Bad. It started… maybe a week ago? It’s gotten worse every day. It feels like… someone is pushing on my spine all the time. It makes it hard to even sit.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week of worsening back pain. That sounds rough. And you said it feels like pressure on your spine?
PATIENT: Yes, pressure. Like… a big weight. And sometimes it shoots pain down my leg, too. Not all the time, but when I try to stand up quick, or bend over. It makes me worry. You know… about the cancer. It’s the same kind of pain, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about cancer, especially with the pain radiating down your leg. It’s good you're bringing that up. We'll definitely explore all possibilities. To get a better picture, can you tell me exactly where on your back the pain is the worst?
PATIENT: Right here. Lower back. And it feels like it goes around to my side a little bit, too. Not just straight across, but kinda wraps around. And… it's hard to say exactly, but sometimes it feels… deep. Like it’s not just the muscles. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Deep pain is a really helpful detail. And radiating around the side is important too. Has anything specific caused the pain to start, as far as you can remember?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I was… working. At the factory. Just… normal work. Lifting boxes, mostly. But I do that every day. It didn't feel different that day. It just… started hurting later that evening. That's why I don't know why. Maybe I lifted something too heavy without realizing it? But I don’t remember anything special. It just… came on slowly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no specific injury, just gradual onset after a normal workday at the factory. Have you experienced back pain like this before?
PATIENT: Yes. A few times. But not this bad. It usually goes away with rest, and maybe some… what do you call it… the cream? The muscle rub? But this… this isn’t helping. And it’s not getting better. That's why I came in. I was worried something was different this time. About the cancer, you know. It feels… different. More… sharp. Than before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially given your history of back pain and the new, sharper sensation. We'll investigate this thoroughly. Now, let’s talk about the pain itself a little more. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now? Hmmm… It’s… maybe a seven? Sometimes it goes up to an eight when I move. But right now, just sitting… it's a seven. It’s… constant. A dull ache, mostly. But when I try to stand, or twist… that's when it gets really bad. An eight, maybe even a nine. It takes my breath away sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a baseline of seven with spikes to eight or nine with movement. That's definitely significant. Are you noticing any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I… I feel a little tired. But I always feel tired. Working at the factory… it’s hard work. I haven't noticed anything else, really. No… problems going to the bathroom. No numbness or tingling in my legs. Just the pain. And… I’ve been a little bit worried, so maybe a little bit shaky. But I don't know if that's from the pain, or from worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, no bladder or bowel issues, no numbness or tingling. Just pain and some worry. Have you tried any medications for the pain besides the muscle rub?
PATIENT: I took some… Tylenol? A few days ago. It didn't really help. Maybe a little bit, but not much. My neighbor gave me something… a white pill. I don’t know what it was. It helped me sleep, but I didn't want to take too much, because I didn't know what it was. I stopped taking it after one night. I don’t like taking pills if I don't know what they are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tylenol with minimal relief, and a one-time dose of an unknown white pill. It's good you were cautious about the unknown medication. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I’ve taken… antibiotics before, for infections. And… allergy medicine sometimes, when the pollen is bad. But I never had a bad reaction to anything. I don’t really like taking medicine much, so I try not to. But if I need it, I will. Just… I always worry about side effects.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam of your back, just to assess the range of motion and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That's okay. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what's going on. I'm worried about my back, and I want to feel better. Please. Just… be gentle? It hurts when you touch it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible. Now, could you please lie face down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. This… this is where it hurts the most. Right here. Be careful, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just going to feel around to see where the pain is most intense. Now, I’m going to have you lift your right leg, keeping it straight, and let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg. Just tell me if anything changes. And then we’ll do the same with your left leg.
PATIENT: Ooooh… yes. That one… that one hurts. Not in my back, but down my leg. Like… a shooting pain. It’s… not too bad, but I definitely feel it. It feels… familiar. Like… the same kind of pain I had before. Okay, done. What did you find? Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. The pain radiating down your leg when I lifted your right leg suggests there might be some irritation of the sciatic nerve. It's often associated with a bulging disc or narrowing of the spinal canal. Now let's try the left. And how about with this leg?
PATIENT: No… that one doesn't hurt as much. A little bit, maybe, in my hip, but not down my leg. Not like the other one. That one feels… okay. Just… a little bit stiff. So… what does that mean? Is it… the cancer? Is that what you’re thinking? I'm getting really scared now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more pain with the right leg raise and less with the left. That helps give us a better picture. And I understand your worry, Larin. It's natural to be scared when you're experiencing pain like this. Before we jump to conclusions, it’s important to remember that a positive straight leg raise doesn’t automatically mean it's cancer. There are many, many other possibilities, and most of them are not cancer. It could be a muscle strain, a bulging disc, or even inflammation of the sciatic nerve. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order an MRI of your lower back. That will allow us to visualize the discs, nerves, and surrounding structures and determine the exact cause of your pain. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… Yes. Okay. If that’s what you think is best. I want to know what’s going on. I just… I want it over with. This pain is… it’s making it hard to do anything. Will the MRI tell me… for sure? If it’s the cancer… will it show it? And… how long will it take to get the results? I'm getting really anxious now. Can I take something for this?
DOCTOR: Okay, an MRI will give us a much more detailed picture of what’s going on with your spine, and it's the best way to rule out serious conditions like cancer, as well as identify things like bulging discs or nerve compression. It will help us get a definitive answer. And yes, if there is something serious going on, an MRI will almost certainly show it. The results usually take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. I’ll have my assistant schedule the MRI for you right away. As for your anxiety, absolutely. I can prescribe a mild anti-anxiety medication to help you get through this waiting period. It won’t change the results of the MRI, but it can help you feel calmer and more comfortable. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. Anything to help me feel less scared. I can't sleep when I'm this worried. And… will the MRI… will it hurt? I don’t like small spaces. I get… claustrophobic. And… is it expensive? I don’t have a lot of money. I have the insurance, but… sometimes it doesn’t cover everything. I don’t want a big bill.
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely understand your concerns about the MRI. It’s very common to feel anxious about MRIs, especially if you're claustrophobic. The machine is large and can be noisy. However, we can take several steps to make it more comfortable for you. You can close your eyes, listen to music through headphones, and let the technician know you’re feeling anxious at any time. They can stop the scan if you need a break. We can also discuss the possibility of a mild sedative to help you relax. Regarding the cost, let me check your insurance coverage and give you an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. We also have a financial assistance program available for patients who qualify. I’ll have my assistant contact you with all the details. Let’s get this scheduled, and then we can focus on getting you some relief. We’ll take it one step at a time. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. One step at a time. That sounds… okay. I trust you, Doctor. Just… please don't let me be alone with the machine for too long. And… can you tell me again about the medicine for the anxiety? What does it do? And are there… side effects? I don’t want to feel even worse than I already do. I just want to sleep. That's all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I want you to feel comfortable and safe throughout this process. The anti-anxiety medication I'm considering is a low-dose benzodiazepine. It works by slowing down activity in the brain, which helps reduce feelings of anxiety and promotes relaxation. It's not a strong medication, and it’s typically well-tolerated. The most common side effects are drowsiness and dizziness, which is why it's important not to drive or operate machinery after taking it. Some people experience mild fatigue or lightheadedness. Rarely, some people may experience confusion or memory problems, but that's very uncommon at this low dose. We can discuss all the potential risks and benefits before you decide if it's right for you. And if you experience any unwanted side effects, you can always stop taking it. My assistant will be in shortly to schedule the MRI and discuss the medication options. Do you have any other questions or concerns before I leave?
