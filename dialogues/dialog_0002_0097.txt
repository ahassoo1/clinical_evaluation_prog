DOCTOR: Hi Marija, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, I must say, this waiting room… rather pedestrian, don’t you think? But never mind. I am here because I understand you can provide… a form. An advance directive, is it called? My husband felt it was… prudent to have something in place, should anything… unfortunate occur. He’s always been rather dramatic.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. We absolutely can help you with an advance directive. It’s very responsible of both of you to think ahead. And your husband sounds like a thoughtful man! It is a good idea to have that peace of mind. Just so I have a clear picture, have you started any paperwork already, or are we beginning completely from scratch?
PATIENT: No, absolutely nothing has been started. My husband simply… mentioned it. He reads a great deal, you see. All sorts of things. Legal journals, mostly. He said I should come and speak with a professional. Frankly, I find all this… rather morbid. But one does what one's husband suggests, doesn’t one? I haven't the faintest idea where to begin, or what is even required of me. It all seems terribly… complicated.
DOCTOR: It can definitely feel overwhelming at first, and it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. It's not something people think about every day. We can take it step-by-step, and I'll explain everything as we go. Essentially, an advance directive lets you document your wishes for your healthcare if you're unable to speak for yourself. There are a couple of different parts to it. We'll talk about a living will—that outlines what kinds of treatments you would or wouldn’t want—and a durable power of attorney for healthcare, which names someone to make decisions on your behalf if you can’t. Before we dive into those details, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My overall health. Well, I suppose it’s… adequate. I am tall, as you can see. Always have been. It makes finding clothes rather difficult, naturally. I do try to eat a sensible diet – mostly Mediterranean, my husband insists. He’s very particular about that. And I walk, when the weather permits. Though, honestly, these days the weather rarely does permit. I haven’t had any… serious illnesses, thankfully. A cold here and there, the occasional headache. Nothing that requires a doctor, usually. Though my husband, of course, disagrees. He thinks I should have a check-up every six months, simply as a precaution. He worries excessively, you see. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear – it sounds like you're taking good care of yourself! And yes, your husband’s concern is definitely relevant – it’s wonderful to have someone looking out for you. Just to get a more complete picture, have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Absolutely not. I had a rather thorough examination a few years ago – my husband insisted, naturally – and the doctor said I was perfectly healthy. “Robust,” I believe was the word he used. Though, he did suggest I lose a few kilograms. Which, frankly, I found rather insulting. A tall woman is simply… built differently, don’t you think? And I assure you, I have no high blood pressure, no diabetes, and certainly no heart problems. My father lived to be ninety, you see. A very vigorous man, right up until the end. It's a family trait, good health. Though, my husband always points out that good genes are no guarantee. He has a very pessimistic outlook, you see. Are we getting anywhere with this… form? I find discussing my personal life rather tedious, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting there, absolutely. And I apologize if I’m asking a lot of questions – I just want to make sure I have a good understanding of your overall health before we move on to the advance directive. It’s wonderful to hear about your father’s health, that’s very reassuring. Okay, let’s talk about past surgeries, if any. Have you ever had any operations or procedures done?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. Nothing. I have always been remarkably fortunate in that regard. I detest hospitals. The smell, the… the people. I had a rather unpleasant experience when I was a child – a broken arm, nothing serious, but the entire ordeal was… traumatic. And I have avoided them ever since. My husband, of course, thinks I am foolishly reckless. He insists on regular dental check-ups, which I tolerate with extreme reluctance. But beyond that, I have managed to avoid all medical intervention. I prefer to rely on… good luck and a sensible lifestyle. Are we finally getting to this form, Doctor? I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting to the form, I promise! You’ve been very clear about your health history, and I appreciate that. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I refuse to ingest anything that hasn't been grown in the earth or sourced from the sea. I find all these… concoctions rather suspect. My husband, naturally, disagrees. He takes a great many pills – for his blood pressure, his cholesterol, his… anxieties. He is a veritable pharmacy, honestly. But I have always maintained a healthy skepticism towards medication. I prefer to rely on… fresh air, sunshine, and a balanced diet. Honestly, Doctor, are you quite certain this form is necessary? It all seems rather… alarmist, don't you think? I am perfectly healthy, as I have repeatedly stated. I simply came because my husband insisted. Is there a shortcut, perhaps? A simplified version?
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Marija, and I appreciate you being so upfront about your preferences. It’s wonderful that you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. The reason an advance directive is helpful isn’t necessarily because you’re unwell right now. It’s about ensuring your wishes are known if something unexpected were to happen. It's a way to protect your autonomy, even if you are unable to speak for yourself. To be thorough, have you ever had any serious allergic reactions to anything?
PATIENT: Well, nothing serious. I am rather sensitive to certain perfumes, particularly those with… floral notes. They give me a headache, and I find them terribly vulgar, frankly. But an allergic reaction? No. I have never required an epinephrine injection or a trip to the emergency room because of an allergy. I am very careful about what I eat, and I avoid anything artificial. My husband, naturally, worries about anaphylaxis. He reads a great deal, you see. All sorts of dreadful things. But honestly, Doctor, I have never had any… debilitating reactions to anything. I am a remarkably robust woman, as I have repeatedly stated. Perhaps this form is simply… unnecessary. Are there any alternatives? A simple conversation with my husband and the hospital, perhaps? I am beginning to feel rather faint. This entire process is… exhausting.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your feelings, Marija. It sounds like you’ve given this a lot of thought, and you are very clear about your preferences. And you are right to question things and make sure this feels comfortable for you. A conversation with your husband and the hospital is a great starting point, and it's something we can absolutely document as part of your medical record. However, an advance directive provides a more formal and legally recognized record of your wishes, which can be extremely helpful for healthcare providers in a stressful situation. Before we discuss the options further, let's just briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not! The very idea! I find all such habits… appalling. I have never touched a cigarette in my life, and I consider alcohol to be a rather vulgar beverage. As for… recreational drugs? Don't even mention them! I lead a perfectly respectable life, thank you very much. My husband, of course, occasionally indulges in a glass of wine with dinner. But he assures me it’s for his health. Something about antioxidants, I believe. But I certainly do not partake. I find all such indulgences… detrimental to one’s well-being. Honestly, Doctor, I am beginning to suspect this entire questionnaire is designed to find fault with my perfectly healthy lifestyle. Are we getting anywhere with this… form, or are we simply going in circles? I have a luncheon engagement, you know. And I would prefer not to be late. This is all quite… draining.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question the process, and I apologize if it feels like I’m focusing on things that aren’t relevant to your lifestyle. It’s standard procedure to cover all bases, but I can certainly tailor the questions to your specific needs. Let’s set aside the questionnaire for a moment. You’ve made it very clear you are healthy, active, and have strong preferences about your well-being. Since your husband is the one who initiated this, perhaps the most helpful thing we can do is discuss the core components of an advance directive—the living will and the durable power of attorney—and how they would work in your situation. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that sounds rather reasonable. If we can simply discuss the components, as you say, without any further… probing. My husband is very particular about these things, you see. He likes everything to be… precise. A living will and a durable power of attorney, you say? I confess, I have only the vaguest understanding of these terms. Perhaps if you could explain them in… layman’s terms. Without any medical jargon, if you please. And preferably, without any further questions about my lifestyle. I am perfectly healthy, as I have repeatedly stated. And I would prefer not to be subjected to any further… scrutiny. This luncheon engagement is becoming increasingly important, you know. And I would hate to be late.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No further scrutiny, I promise. And I will explain everything in plain language. Let’s start with the living will. Think of it as a document that outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you were unable to speak for yourself – for example, if you were in a coma or had a severe illness. It’s where you would state what kinds of treatments you would or wouldn’t want, such as life support, feeding tubes, or resuscitation. The durable power of attorney for healthcare is a little different. It’s where you name someone—your husband, for example—to make healthcare decisions on your behalf if you were unable to do so yourself. They would be legally authorized to speak with doctors and make choices based on your wishes. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that is slightly more comprehensible. A living will – outlining my preferences, you say. And a durable power of attorney – authorizing my husband to… make decisions. It sounds rather… alarming, frankly. The thought of being unable to speak for myself is… unpleasant. And the idea of my husband making medical decisions… well, he is rather opinionated, you see. He reads a great deal, you know. All sorts of dreadful things. He has very strong views on everything. But I suppose it's… prudent to have something in place, just in case. Though, honestly, I find the entire process rather… morbid. Is it possible to simply… delegate the responsibility to my general practitioner? He knows me quite well, you see. And he is far less… dramatic than my husband. Is that an option? Or is this… delegation restricted to family members? This luncheon engagement is becoming increasingly pressing, you know. And I would hate to be late.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Marija. You can absolutely name your general practitioner as your healthcare proxy, alongside or instead of your husband. It’s entirely your choice. In fact, it’s often a good idea to have a backup proxy in case your primary choice is unavailable. However, there are some things to consider. Your husband is likely very familiar with your values and wishes, and he’s readily available to advocate for you. A doctor, while knowledgeable, might not know your personal preferences as intimately. Ultimately, the decision is yours. We can document your wishes for both your husband and your general practitioner to serve as proxies, if you’d like. That way, you have options. Before we proceed, I want to ensure you're comfortable with this process. Is there anything about this that makes you particularly uneasy?
PATIENT: Well, the thought of my husband making decisions… yes, that is rather unsettling. He tends to… overthink things, you see. And he has very strong views on everything. He reads a great deal, you know. All sorts of dreadful things. He’s a very… decisive man, but not always… practical. And the idea of documenting everything in writing… it feels rather… permanent. What if my views change? What if I decide I no longer want life support? Is it possible to amend the document? And what if my husband and my general practitioner disagree? What if they have conflicting opinions? This is all rather… complicated. Perhaps a simple conversation with both of them is sufficient. A verbal agreement, you see. Surely, that would be legally binding? This luncheon engagement is becoming increasingly urgent, you know. And I would hate to be late. Is there a shortcut? A simplified version? Or perhaps a waiver?
DOCTOR: You’re raising very valid points, Marija. It’s good that you’re thinking through all of this so carefully. Yes, you can absolutely amend the document at any time. It's not set in stone. You can change your wishes, add or remove a proxy, or even revoke the document entirely. And yes, if your husband and your general practitioner disagree, the healthcare team would work with them to try and find a resolution that aligns with your known wishes. It can be helpful to have a clear understanding of your priorities documented in the advance directive, which can guide their decision-making. Regarding a verbal agreement, while it can be helpful, it’s not legally binding. An advance directive provides a more formal and legally recognized record of your wishes, which can be crucial in a stressful situation. To address your concerns, we can create a very streamlined advance directive that focuses on your core priorities, without getting into excessive detail. We can also document that both your husband and your general practitioner are aware of your wishes and can serve as your proxies. Would that be a more comfortable approach?
PATIENT: Yes. A streamlined approach… that sounds rather more palatable. Focusing on core priorities… without excessive detail. And documenting the involvement of both my husband and my general practitioner. That… that sounds reasonable. Perhaps we can simply state that I prefer a “sensible” approach to medical treatment. And that both of them should consult with each other before making any… drastic decisions. And perhaps we can add a clause stating that I prefer to avoid hospitals whenever possible. Is that… feasible? And how long will this… streamlined document take? I have a luncheon engagement, you know. And I would hate to be late. Is there a template? A pre-written form that we can simply… amend? This is all rather… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A streamlined approach focusing on your core priorities is perfectly feasible. We can definitely document your preference for a “sensible” approach to treatment, the importance of consultation between your husband and your general practitioner, and your preference to avoid hospitals whenever possible. I do have a template that we can amend. It’s a relatively short form that focuses on key wishes and proxy designations. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes to complete. Let's start with your name and date of birth, and then we can move on to specifying your healthcare proxies. We can then add a clause about your preference for a “sensible” approach and avoiding hospitals. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that sounds perfectly acceptable. Fifteen to twenty minutes… that is… manageable. My name is Marija Chilla, and my date of birth is… July 12th, 1981. And yes, let us proceed with the designation of my healthcare proxies. My husband is… Jean-Pierre Dubois, and his contact information is… I will dictate it to you. He is a rather… organized man, you see. He keeps meticulous records. And yes, let us add the clause about the “sensible” approach and avoiding hospitals. And perhaps we can add a stipulation that I prefer natural light whenever possible. Hospitals are dreadfully… gloomy, you see. And if it’s not too much trouble, perhaps a clause stating that I prefer a private room. I detest sharing. This is all rather… complicated, but I appreciate your patience. And please, let us ensure that the form is legible. My husband is rather particular about fonts.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Marija Chilla, July 12th, 1981. And Jean-Pierre Dubois as your primary healthcare proxy. I’ll note his contact information. We’ll absolutely add the stipulations about a sensible approach, avoiding hospitals whenever possible, a preference for natural light, and a private room. I'm happy to accommodate your preferences, and I'll make sure the form is legible with a font your husband will approve. Here’s a draft. It includes your basic information, Jean-Pierre’s contact details as your primary proxy, and a section outlining your preferences for treatment. Could you please review it to ensure everything is accurate?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes. The font is… acceptable. Though perhaps a slightly bolder weight would be preferable. And Jean-Pierre’s contact information is correct. Though his email address is… outdated. He’s rather forgetful, you see. And the section on treatment preferences… yes, it accurately reflects my wishes. Though perhaps we should add a clause stating that I prefer organic food whenever possible. Hospitals serve such dreadful cuisine, you see. And the section on proxies… yes, that is correct. Though perhaps we should add a clause stating that I prefer my general practitioner to be consulted before any… drastic decisions are made. He knows me quite well, you see. And he is far less… dramatic than my husband. And the signature line… yes, that is correct. Though perhaps a slightly larger font would be preferable. This is all rather… meticulous, but I appreciate your patience. And please, ensure that the form is printed on high-quality paper. My husband is rather particular about stationery.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ve updated Jean-Pierre’s email address, added a clause about preferring organic food, and emphasized the importance of consulting your general practitioner. I’ve also increased the font size on the signature line and made a note to print the form on high-quality paper. Here's the updated version. Please take a look and let me know if everything is to your satisfaction. I want to ensure it accurately reflects your wishes and meets your husband’s standards. We're almost there.
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes. The font is… marginally better. Though perhaps a slightly warmer shade of grey would be preferable. And the email address is correct. And the clause about the organic food is satisfactory. And the emphasis on consulting my general practitioner is… adequate. And the signature line is… acceptable. Though perhaps a slightly thicker weight would be preferable. And the paper… yes, that is the correct weight. My husband will be pleased. However, there is a minor discrepancy. The section on "Code Status" is… incomplete. It simply states "To be determined." That is… unacceptable. I prefer to state unequivocally that I do not wish to be resuscitated under any circumstances. Unless, of course, it is absolutely necessary. And even then, only if my husband is present. And only if my general practitioner approves. And only if the hospital is… reasonably clean. And only if the lighting is… adequate. And only if the temperature is… comfortable. And only if the staff is… polite. And only if the cuisine is… palatable. And only if the room has… a view. Please, amend the form accordingly. This is… rather important. And please, ensure that the paper is… archival quality. My husband is… meticulous, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will amend the “Code Status” section to reflect your preferences regarding resuscitation, including the stipulations about your husband’s presence, your general practitioner’s approval, hospital cleanliness, adequate lighting, comfortable temperature, polite staff, and palatable cuisine. I will also ensure the paper is archival quality. Here is the completed advance directive. I believe it accurately reflects your wishes and meets your husband’s standards. Please review it one final time. I’m confident this document will provide clarity and peace of mind. Do you have any further questions or revisions?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes. This is… satisfactory. The font is… acceptable. And the email address is correct. And the clause about the organic food is adequate. And the emphasis on consulting my general practitioner is… sufficient. And the stipulations regarding resuscitation are… comprehensive. And the paper is… archival quality. Yes. I believe this is… perfect. My husband will be… delighted. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… remarkably patient. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a luncheon engagement to attend.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marija. It was my pleasure. I’m glad we were able to create a document that meets your needs and provides you with peace of mind. Enjoy your luncheon! And please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions in the future. Have a wonderful day.
