DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my heart, it feels like it's... flapping sometimes. Not always, but when it does, it's... strange. Like a bird inside. That's why I came. It's been happening for, maybe, two weeks now?
DOCTOR: Okay, “flapping,” you say. That’s a good way to describe it. And it's been happening for about two weeks. Can you tell me a bit more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When it happens… hmm. Not when I'm doing much. Sometimes when I’m just sitting, watching TV with my wife. Or… even when I'm sleeping, I think. She tells me I move a lot then. I don’t always feel it when I sleep, but she says I do. It doesn’t happen when I’m working, though. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I work with… with machines, big machines. Lots of noise. Maybe that covers it up?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to happen more at rest, like when you're relaxing or sleeping, and not so much during work. That’s helpful to know. Do you notice anything else happening when your heart feels like it’s flapping?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel… a little short of breath. Not like I can’t breathe, but like I need to take a bigger breath, you know? And… sometimes my chest feels a little tight. Not always, though. It’s not a bad pain, just… uncomfortable. And I feel… a little tired sometimes, but I work long hours, so maybe that’s just from that.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and fatigue. We’ll definitely look into all of that. Now, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is… new. I’ve been healthy, I think. No big problems before. I go to the dentist, and… and I get shots when they tell me to. But nothing with my heart before. Not ever. My father… he had problems with his legs, but not his heart. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know it’s new, and that you generally feel healthy. And it’s helpful to know about your father’s leg problems, even if it doesn’t seem directly related. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Besides your father’s leg issues, do you know of any other significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mother, she had… high blood pressure, I think. The doctor told her to watch her salt. And my sister, she has… allergies, lots of allergies. Dust, pollen, cats… everything. But nothing… serious, I don’t think. Just… sniffles and sneezes. I don't know about heart problems on my mother's side. Nobody ever talked about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother and allergies in your sister. And you yourself, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, touch anything… I've never had a reaction. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I’m outside, but that’s probably just bugs. I work outside sometimes, you know, fixing the machines. Lots of dust. But never anything… bad. Never needed an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. Just… a little pain reliever sometimes, for my back. From the work. But that's it. Over-the-counter stuff. Not a prescription. And not very often, really. Maybe once a month, if that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a few other basic things. It shouldn’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I want to find out what’s happening with my heart. Go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130 over 85. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and another… Okay. I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm. It's subtle, but it's there. Your lungs sound clear. Your pulse is also a bit fast, around 95 beats per minute. I’m also going to check your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels normal. Overall, everything seems… okay, but the irregular rhythm and slightly elevated pulse are what I want to investigate further. I’d like to order an EKG and a basic blood test to check your thyroid levels, electrolytes, and rule out any anemia. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… an EKG and blood test. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to know what's going on. Will it take long? And… will it hurt? I don't like needles very much.
DOCTOR: The EKG is completely painless. We just put some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs and it records your heart’s electrical activity. It takes about five minutes. As for the blood test, yes, there is a needle involved, but it’s a very quick prick. Most people don’t find it too painful. We’ll draw a small amount of blood from your arm. We can have the lab technician draw the blood right away. The results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, I'd like you to keep a log of when these "flapping" sensations happen. Note the time, what you were doing, and if you experienced any other symptoms like the shortness of breath or chest tightness. That will help us get a better picture of what's going on. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Stickers and a quick prick. I can do that. And I will write down when it happens. Time, what I'm doing… and the other stuff. Shortness of breath, chest tightness. I hope it's not anything… serious. But thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. Where do I go for the stickers and the prick?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. It's good to be prepared. Just down the hallway, to your left, is the lab. The technician, Maria, will take care of you. She’s very good. She’ll explain everything again before she starts. Once you’re done there, you can come back, and we’ll discuss the next steps once we have the results. In the meantime, if you experience any severe chest pain, dizziness, or difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It’s always better to be safe. Here’s a notepad and pen for your log. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… the stickers and the prick. And write down the time. Thank you again, Doctor Bombara. I'll go find Maria now. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Puder. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to let the front desk know if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll see you soon.
