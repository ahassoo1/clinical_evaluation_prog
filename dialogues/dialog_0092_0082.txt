DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Uh… travel? My wife… she booked something. A trip. I don't really… remember where. Something far. She always liked the… fancy places. I just need… whatever shots I need. For travel. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Odell. It’s perfectly alright to come in for travel vaccinations. That's a very responsible thing to do. To help me determine which vaccinations you might need, could you tell me a little more about where you and your wife are travelling to?
PATIENT: Travelling… Honestly? I really don't know. She… she did all the planning. I just… went with it. Somewhere hot, I think? Lots of… buildings. And maybe water? She liked beaches. Big beaches. It was… after she… well. It doesn't matter. I don't have a list or anything. She’s… gone now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. That’s alright. It’s perfectly okay if you don't have specific details. It sounds like a very recent loss, and I appreciate you coming in despite everything. Let's see if we can narrow things down based on what you do remember. Do you recall approximately when this trip is scheduled for?
PATIENT: Scheduled…? Soon, I think. She booked it… before. A few weeks, maybe? I don’t really keep track of dates anymore. Everything is… blurry. She wanted to go before the… the weather got bad. Before… nevermind. Soon. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: “Soon” is a starting point, Odell. We’ll work with that. To help me get a clearer idea of potential risks, and to ensure we provide you with the appropriate vaccinations, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past…? I… I don’t get sick much. Never really have. Just… the usual colds, I guess. Nothing serious. She… my wife, she always took care of all that stuff. Doctors, medicine… I never needed to worry. I don’t even know what kind of doctor I usually see. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Odell. It’s alright if you don’t have a lot of details. Have you ever had any serious allergies – to medications, foods, insect stings, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Uh… I don’t think so. She always asked when we went to restaurants. “Any allergies, Odell?” And I’d always say no. I think. Maybe… dust? Sometimes my eyes get a bit itchy. But that’s just… dust, right? Nothing serious. She gave me drops for it, once.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known serious allergies. It's good we're clarifying these things. And are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, herbal supplements… anything like that?
PATIENT: Medications…? No. Nothing. I told you, she took care of everything. She had a… a little box. For pills and things. But that was her stuff. I don’t… I don't need anything. Just… whatever you give me for the trip.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. That’s good to know. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. It’s standard procedure before administering any vaccinations. It’ll just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam…? Do you have to? I… I don't really like doctors. She always went with me. She knew what questions to ask. And what all the… things… do. I guess… if you have to. But be quick, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Odell. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical exams, especially under these circumstances. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll just do a few basic checks to ensure you are healthy enough to receive the vaccinations. If you'd like, you can sit up on the table. I'll start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. We'll keep that in mind. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, can I take a quick look in your ears and throat?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. My ears are okay, I think. Never had any trouble with them. And my throat… feels normal. I drink plenty of water. She always made sure of that. Just… get it over with. This is making me… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Your ears look clear, and your throat is a bit red, but no signs of infection. Alright, Odell. Everything looks generally okay for vaccinations. Based on what you’ve told me – travelling to a hot climate with buildings and beaches, soon, and the elevated blood pressure – and to be on the safe side, I recommend a Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccination. We should also consider a Tetanus booster, if you haven't had one in the last ten years. Do you have any questions about these vaccinations?
PATIENT: Hepatitis…? Typhoid…? What are those? And a… booster? She always knew what all this stuff was for. She’d explain it… slowly. I don’t… I don't understand. Is it… bad if I get these? And what about my blood pressure? Is that serious?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be confused, Odell. It's my job to explain everything clearly. Hepatitis A is a liver infection you can get from contaminated food or water. Typhoid is another infection spread through contaminated food and water. Both are common in certain parts of the world, particularly in warmer climates. The vaccinations protect you from getting these infections. As for your blood pressure, 140 over 90 is a little elevated. It doesn't necessarily mean it's serious right now, but it’s something we need to monitor. The vaccinations won’t affect your blood pressure. I would recommend you see your primary care physician when you return from your trip for a full check-up and to discuss managing your blood pressure. Do you have a primary care physician you usually see?
PATIENT: Primary…? No. She… she made all the appointments. She knew everyone. Doctors, dentists… everything. I just went. She took care of it all. I don’t have anyone. I don’t know anyone. Is that… a problem? Do I need one?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Odell. It’s not a problem at all, but it would be beneficial to establish care with a primary care physician. They can provide routine checkups, manage any health concerns, and help you stay healthy overall. I can provide you with a list of doctors in the area. Once you return from your trip, you can schedule an appointment with one of them. They can discuss your elevated blood pressure and recommend any necessary lifestyle changes or medications. Now, are you comfortable proceeding with the Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations?
PATIENT: Vaccinations… I guess. If you say it’s okay. But… will it hurt? She always said they weren’t very painful. But… I don’t know. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And explain what you’re doing. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. I’ll explain everything as I go. The vaccinations are administered as an injection into your upper arm muscle. You might feel a brief stinging sensation as the needle goes in, and there might be some mild soreness afterward, but it usually subsides within a day or two. I’m going to count to three, and then you’ll feel a quick pinch. One… two… three. There we go. Both done. Just keep that bandage on for a few hours. You might experience some mild side effects, such as fatigue or a low-grade fever, but they should resolve on their own. If you experience any severe side effects, such as difficulty breathing or a severe allergic reaction, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Done…? It… stung a little. Not as bad as I thought, I guess. So… I’m protected now? From… everything? And I need to see a… primary doctor when I get back? Is that all? Just… make sure I have everything I need. I don’t want to forget anything. She always made sure of that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Odell, you’re protected against Hepatitis A and Typhoid. The immunity builds over the next few weeks, so it's important to avoid any high-risk exposures during that time. Here is a summary of the vaccinations you received today, along with instructions on managing any potential side effects. I've also included the list of primary care physicians, as we discussed. I also recommend you take this list of things to watch for when traveling, especially regarding food and water safety. It’s a good idea to be cautious, even with the vaccinations. And yes, seeing a primary care physician when you return is important, especially to monitor your blood pressure. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you leave today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… try not to forget anything. She always said… nevermind. Thank you, Doctor. I guess. It was… helpful. Maybe. I hope. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Odell. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns later on. We're here to help. Have a safe trip, and take care of yourself. .
