DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you please tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Brando. Yes, well… it’s about a check-up, I think? Something to do with… performing? It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. They just said I needed to get cleared by a doctor. A physical, they called it. I do a bit of work at the theater, you see. Mostly ushering and taking tickets, but… yes. A check-up. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Brando. A physical examination to ensure you’re fit to continue your work at the theater – that’s perfectly reasonable. It sounds as though this is a requirement from your employer. To begin, let’s gather some more information. Could you tell me a little bit about what your duties at the theater entail, specifically regarding any physical exertion?
PATIENT: Oh, exertion… well, I walk a lot. Up and down stairs, mostly. The old theater doesn't have elevators everywhere, you see. And sometimes I have to help people to their seats – older folks, mostly. Not lifting, exactly, but… supporting. It's not strenuous, I don't think. Mostly just being on my feet for long stretches. And making sure everyone has their tickets, of course. It's… it's mostly standing and walking, Doctor. That’s it, really. I’ve been doing it for… a long time now.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, primarily ambulation – walking, standing, assisting patrons – and being on your feet for extended periods. That’s helpful to know. Let’s move on to your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s… a bit of a blank, to be honest. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. I think I had something with my blood pressure years ago, but it wasn’t… serious, I don't think. They gave me a little pill, maybe? But I stopped taking it after a while. It’s all very fuzzy, Doctor. I apologize. I really don’t have much to tell you in that regard. I generally feel… okay. A little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t?
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Brando. It’s not uncommon for people to have gaps in their medical history. We’ll do our best to get a clear picture today. You mentioned feeling a little tired sometimes. Is that a recent development, or has that been ongoing?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… a while, I suppose. Not new. Just… gets worse with the heat, maybe? And standing all day. It’s not debilitating, you understand. I can still do my job. But sometimes, at the end of the day… I just want to sit. And sometimes, I wake up feeling… not quite rested. It’s probably just age, Doctor. I’m not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: That's a fair assessment, Brando, but it's still important to investigate. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s… difficult. My parents… they passed away a long time ago. Both… old age, mostly. I don’t really… remember them talking about much illness. My mother… she had something with her hands, I think? Arthritis, maybe? But I didn’t really pay attention to these things when I was younger. And I don’t have any siblings, so… I’m really not much help on that front, Doctor. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Brando. It’s understandable that you don’t have a lot of details. We’ll proceed with what we have. Now, let’s briefly discuss some lifestyle factors. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. Always thought it was a terrible habit. Bad for the lungs, you see. And I don't drink much, either. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe, but that’s it. Not a drinker, no.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Brando. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Like I said before, I haven’t really been to a doctor in… well, ages. No, not currently. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but I stopped a long time ago. Nothing else. Just… the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that’s it. And it’s not regular.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Brando. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature – as well as listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your abdomen and extremities. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I have… things to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I'll do my best to be efficient. First, let's start with your height and weight. Could you step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Right. I’m… taller than most, you know. Always have been. It’s sometimes a bit of a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Brando. 199 centimeters and 118 kilograms. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Right here? It's probably a bit high, to be honest. I haven’t checked it in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 158 over 92. As you suspected, it is elevated. We’ll need to discuss that further. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Could you please take a deep breath in… and exhale. Your heart rate is 78 beats per minute and regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but slightly diminished. Now, I will briefly palpate your abdomen. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort. Just… old. It’s just an old stomach, Doctor. I haven't had any trouble with it, though. No pain or anything. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, with some mild tenderness upon palpation. Your peripheral pulses are present, though slightly weak. Now, I will check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Your reflexes are slightly diminished. Alright, Brando, that concludes the physical examination. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on the information gathered, your blood pressure is elevated, your lung sounds are slightly diminished, and your reflexes are somewhat reduced. We will need to order some further testing to determine the underlying cause of these findings.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good, does it? Further testing… what sort of testing? Blood work, I presume? I really don't like needles, Doctor. And honestly, I'm not sure I have the time for a lot of… procedures. I just needed a check-up for the theater, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Brando. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it's important to investigate. Yes, I would like to order some blood work. It will help us assess your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. We’ll also perform an electrocardiogram, or EKG, which is a painless test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. As for the time commitment, the blood work will take about 30 minutes, and the EKG is quick, maybe 5-10 minutes. We can schedule these tests at the lab across the hall. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Across the hall… that’s… convenient, I suppose. Thirty minutes and ten minutes… alright. But listen, Doctor, I really need to get back to work. Is there any way we can… expedite this? Or maybe just skip some of the tests? I've been feeling alright, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to expedite things, Brando, and I appreciate you being upfront about your concerns. However, skipping tests isn’t advisable. The blood work and EKG provide crucial information about your overall health. While you may be feeling alright now, these tests can detect underlying issues that might not be apparent. Ignoring them could potentially lead to more serious complications down the line. To prioritize, we can start with the blood work today. The results will take a few days to come back. Once we have those, we can decide if the EKG is necessary. Would that be a reasonable compromise?
PATIENT: A few days… alright. Just the blood work for now. That’s… acceptable, I suppose. It's just… I have a performance next week, and I need to be on my feet. I can’t afford to be sick. Where do I go to get this blood work done? And will it interfere with my work?
DOCTOR: Here is the referral order for the lab. It’s right across the hall, room 203. They’re open until 5 PM today. The blood work will likely cause some minor fatigue afterward, but it shouldn’t interfere with your work significantly. I recommend staying hydrated and taking it easy for the rest of the day. The lab technician will explain the procedure. Afterwards, I will contact you in a few days to discuss the results. Do you have any questions about the blood work or the appointment?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Room 203, stay hydrated… yes. It’s just… a lot to take in. I really appreciate you being patient with me, Doctor. I’m not very good with medical things. I’ll go to the lab now. Thank you, Doctor Delacour.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brando. I understand it can be overwhelming, and I’m happy to answer any questions you may have later. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms after the blood work. Take care, and I look forward to discussing your results with you soon.
