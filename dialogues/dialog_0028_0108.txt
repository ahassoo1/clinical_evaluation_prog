DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Gentz, yes?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Brad Gentz. Look, I ain’t one for doctors, if you don't mind. Just…gotta get this sorted, and then I can get on with things. It was… unpleasant, let’s just say that.
DOCTOR: Unpleasant. Very well. Could you elaborate, please?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What do you mean, elaborate? I threw up a bunch of blood, alright? Bright red, not like…chunks or anything, just…a lot of it. Happened a couple times yesterday, and again this morning. That’s elaborate enough for anyone, isn’t it? It ain’t like I’m a scientist here, I tell you what I know.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood, yesterday and this morning. And you say…bright red?
PATIENT: Yeah, bright red. Like…you know, blood. Not dark, not…coffee-colored or anything. Straight from the tap red. And it wasn’t just a little, Doc. Enough to make a fella nervous, I’ll tell ya that much. I’ve seen enough in my line of work, but this…this was different. It's probably nothing, right? Just something I ate?
DOCTOR: “Something you ate” is rarely the cause of bright red hematemesis, Mr. Gentz. We’ll need to determine the source. Do you have any pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Not really pain, exactly. More like…a cramping. Low down, in the gut. Kind of a dull ache, comes and goes. Not enough to stop me working, mind you. I got things to do. But yeah, a cramping. And a bit weak, if I'm honest. Lost my appetite, too. Everything just tastes…wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weakness, cramping, loss of appetite…and bright red hematemesis. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes…what kinda changes? Look, I ain’t one for…detailed descriptions, alright? It's been…darker than usual, I guess. And kinda…sticky. Is that important? Honestly, Doc, I don’t see why we gotta get into all this. Just tell me what's wrong and how to fix it. I got a schedule to keep. This is costing me money, you know.
DOCTOR: Darker stools are…concerning, Mr. Gentz, particularly with the blood you’ve described. We need to rule out a number of possibilities. Let’s start with some basic questions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. I try to avoid 'em if I can. I had a reaction to something once, years ago, made my face swell up, but I don't remember what it was. Probably penicillin, or somethin'. Look, I ain’t a fan of pills, alright? Makes me feel sluggish. I just need somethin' quick to settle my stomach. And a note for work, if you don’t mind. I can’t be off for long. This ain’t like a desk job, you know. It needs doin'.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. Alright. Now, past medical history – have you been diagnosed with any conditions?
PATIENT: Conditions? Not that I know of. I ain’t been to a doctor in…well, a long time. My wife…she used to handle all that. Before…you know. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin' older, I reckon. High blood pressure, maybe, the doc mentioned it once, but I never bothered with pills. Didn't feel sick enough to warrant it. Look, I'm a practical man, alright? I get on with things. I don’t sit around complainin'. Is this gettin' us anywhere? I’m feelin' weaker just talkin’ about all this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, your reluctance to provide details is…unhelpful. We need to establish a baseline. Family history - are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Now you're askin’ about family? My wife’s side was mostly healthy, far as I know. My own…well, my father had some stomach trouble when he was older, but he just toughed it out. Yemen ain't exactly known for fancy doctors and whatnot, alright? People just…dealt with things. No one sat around makin' lists of illnesses. Look, I’m tellin' ya, I’m a strong man. This is probably just somethin' I ate. Can we please just get a quick fix and be done with it? I’m losing time and money here, Doc. This is… frankly, ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical examination, then. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your abdomen and check your vital signs. Afterwards, we’ll discuss potential next steps, and I’ll write you a note for work. But please understand, Mr. Gentz, a thorough investigation is crucial.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just…be gentle, alright? I got things to do later. And try not to take too long. This table feels kinda…cold. Hurry it up, Doc.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is tender to palpation in the lower quadrants, and your pulse is slightly elevated. Blood pressure is within normal limits. I also notice some pallor. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a stool analysis. We need to rule out anemia and any signs of infection.
PATIENT: Anemia? Infection? Now you're talkin' scary stuff. Look, I told you, I just threw up some blood. That's all. You're makin' a mountain out of a molehill. Can I get a prescription for somethin' to settle my stomach now? Just somethin' to stop the…unpleasantness? I can't be runnin' around gettin' blood work done. I got a job to do. This is… frankly, irresponsible. You're scaring the customers, Doc. Don't you have a duty of care? Just…help me get back to work. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your concerns, but prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis would be…negligent. The tests are necessary. I’ll write you a referral to the lab, and a note for work excusing you for the time it takes to complete them. However, if you experience any further episodes of hematemesis, or feel dizzy or lightheaded, you must go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Now you're talkin’ crazy. Look, I’m a strong man, alright? I’ve dealt with worse. Fine. Fine, I’ll go get your tests. But I’m tellin’ ya, this is a waste of time and money. And I expect a full refund if it turns out to be nothin'. And a note for work, a good note, understand? One that doesn't make me sound like I’m fallin' apart. Just…get me the paperwork, Doc. Let's get this over with. And hurry it up, alright? I'm losin' daylight. .
