DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? My wife… she wants… babies. We want babies. But… we are older. I think we need help to make babies happen. It's a little… difficult to explain, everything is fuzzy in my head these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Carlotta, I understand. It’s perfectly alright if things are a little fuzzy. It's completely normal to feel that way. So, you and your wife are hoping to start a family, and you're wondering about options given your ages. We can certainly explore that together. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about how long you and your wife have been trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Trying… hmm. Not long. Maybe… six months? A little more? My wife, she keeps track of things better than me. I mostly… I make things with my hands. Metal and plastic. I don’t remember dates so good these days. But it hasn't happened yet. She is… worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or so. And your wife is keeping track of the cycles, that’s good. It’s understandable that she’s worried, and it’s good you're both talking about it. Mr. Carlotta, just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your wife's cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles… She says… regular. Yes, regular. Every… twenty-eight days? I think. She gets… the monthlies. Every month. No… trouble with that part. But… it doesn’t become a baby. She told me. I don’t understand why. It just… doesn’t. Does that make sense? I’m not good at talking about these things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Carlotta. It’s completely normal to feel unsure when discussing these things, and you’re doing great. “Regular cycles” is a good start. Now, sometimes, even with regular cycles, there can be other factors at play, especially as we get older. To help me understand a little better, have either you or your wife seen a doctor about starting a family before this?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. Not really. We… went to the regular doctor for check-ups. You know, the yearly ones. But not… a special doctor for babies. She might have mentioned it to her doctor… the lady doctor she always sees. But I wasn’t with her. I mostly deal with… things. Metal and plastic things. Not doctors and… babies. It’s all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so regular check-ups with your primary care doctors, but no specific consultation about starting a family yet. That's helpful to know. Mr. Carlotta, before we move forward, I’d like to ask a few general questions about your medical history, and your wife's if you can recall. Have either of you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had… something with my blood, years ago. High something. The doctor gave me pills. But that was a long time ago. I stopped taking the pills. And my wife… she’s always been healthy. Very strong lady. She eats good food. No… no big sicknesses, that I know of. Sometimes a little headache, but everyone gets those. Not much to report, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure for you, treated with medication in the past, and your wife generally being in good health. That's good information. Do you recall what the doctor said caused the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t remember. The doctor… he just said my blood was… too much. And I needed to take the pills. I don't remember why it was too much. Old age, maybe? Things just go wrong when you get old. I didn't ask too many questions. I just did what the doctor said.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Carlotta. It's common to not remember all the details from past medical visits. We can focus on what's happening now. To get a better understanding, have either of you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… My wife… she had her… babies taken out with surgery. You know, when the babies were born. That was a surgery, I suppose. Other than that… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long, long time ago. Nothing else that I remember. Small surgeries, maybe… a cut here and there, but nothing big.
DOCTOR: Okay, a Cesarean section for your wife and an appendectomy for you. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask about any medications you or your wife are currently taking. Any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… I take a little pill for my water. The doctor said my water wasn’t… flowing right. Something like that. It’s a small white pill. And my wife… she takes a pill for her bones. Something about… getting weaker. She gets old, too, you know. A little brown pill. That's it, I think. No vitamins. She eats fruits. That's her vitamins.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for your water and one for your wife’s bones. We’ll need to get the names of those medications, if possible, so we have a complete picture. Do you happen to know what they are called?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t remember the names. The bottles… they are in the kitchen. My wife keeps them. She is very good with… things. I mostly make things with my hands. I don't pay attention to the names. I can ask her when we go home. She will know. She always knows.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. We can certainly ask your wife later. Finally, I'd like to ask about any allergies you or your wife have. To medications, foods, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. I eat everything. My wife… she doesn’t like shellfish. Makes her… itchy. But it’s not a bad allergy. Just… she doesn't like it. No… no bad allergies. Nothing to worry about there. We are healthy people, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies except for your wife’s intolerance to shellfish. That’s good to know. Now, Mr. Carlotta, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam… yes, yes, that’s fine. I don’t mind. I'm an old man. I've had many exams. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please. My bones are getting old, too.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Carlotta. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Blood pressure is 148/92. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Pulses are 2+ bilaterally. No peripheral edema noted. Alright, Mr. Carlotta, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits, but the blood pressure is a bit elevated. We’ll want to keep an eye on that.
PATIENT: Elevated… Blood pressure? That’s the thing I had pills for, right? A long time ago? I guess my bones are getting old and… everything is just going wrong. Is that bad, Doctor? Will I need more pills? I don't like taking pills. They make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned about the blood pressure, Mr. Carlotta. It's not necessarily bad right now, but it is something we want to manage. It's common for blood pressure to rise with age, and sometimes it requires medication. Before we talk about medication, let's discuss lifestyle modifications. Things like diet, exercise, and stress management can often make a big difference. We can also repeat the blood pressure reading on your next visit to see if it's consistently elevated. To get a clearer picture of what's going on with you and your wife’s ability to conceive, I recommend some basic blood work for both of you. This will help us assess hormone levels and overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Hormones… What are hormones? Do they help with… the babies? My wife is always talking about hormones. They sound important. And lifestyle… you mean eating good food? I already do that, mostly. My wife makes sure of it. She is very good with… things. I mostly make things with my hands. But yes, blood work is fine. Whatever helps us get… a baby.
DOCTOR: Yes, hormones play a crucial role in reproduction, Mr. Carlotta. They help regulate the process and ensure everything is functioning properly. The blood work will give us a good baseline to work with. And yes, lifestyle modifications include eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and managing stress. I’ll write out the lab orders for both you and your wife. You can schedule an appointment at the lab at your convenience. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. You explained everything very well, Doctor. Just… thank you. For helping us. We’ve waited a long time for this. My wife… she really wants a baby. I just want to make her happy. Tell me… is it hard? To get a baby when you're old?
DOCTOR: It can be more challenging, Mr. Carlotta, that’s true. But it’s certainly not impossible. With proper evaluation and guidance, many couples in their 70s successfully conceive and have healthy babies. We’ll explore all the options available and do everything we can to help you achieve your goal. I'll also order a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist. They specialize in fertility issues and can provide expert care. We'll start with the blood work and the specialist consultation. We'll take it one step at a time, and I'll be here to support you both throughout the process. Here are the lab orders and the referral information. Do you have any trouble finding a reproductive endocrinologist?
PATIENT: No… no trouble. My wife… she's very good with… finding things. She will take care of it. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. It makes me feel… hopeful. That's good. It’s been a long time. I think I’m ready. And my wife… she is very ready. We will do the blood work. We will see the specialist. Whatever it takes. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I’m glad I could help. I’m confident that you and your wife will do great. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way. I wish you both all the best. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you both again soon. .
