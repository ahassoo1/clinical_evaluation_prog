DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s… good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, it's this shaking. This blasted shaking. It’s in my hands, mostly. Makes it hard to… well, makes things hard. I don't remember exactly when it started, to be honest. Old age, probably. What do you want to know? Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to rush. "Shaking," you say. Mostly in the hands?
PATIENT: Mostly. And sometimes it feels… like a little flutter in my chest, too. Not often, though. Look, I used to have steady hands. Directed movies, you know? Big pictures. Now… now I can barely hold a fork straight. It's embarrassing. Is that what you need to know? When it started? Honestly, I don't sit around cataloging my tremors. Waste of time.
DOCTOR: Movies… right. Okay. And this shaking… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I guess. It’s worse when I’m trying to do something. Like… writing, or… buttoning my shirt. Just sitting around doing nothing, it’s not as bad. Though sometimes, even then, it’ll just… start. It's annoying, more than anything. Really annoying. Are you going to give me something for it, or just ask questions all day?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it's worse with activity…and it's been…gradual, then?
PATIENT: Gradual? Look, things go. I’m eighty years old! Of course it’s gradual. Everything’s gradual when you get to be my age. My hair went grey gradually, my memory goes gradually… everything. I haven't exactly been keeping a detailed log of the worsening of my hand shake, doctor. What kind of question is that? I just want something to stop it. Honestly. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, no, of course not. I understand. Let’s see… have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Else? Like what? I'm a bit hard of hearing, if you're talking loudly. And my knees ache. Everyone's knees ache at my age, surely. No, I haven't noticed anything else. It’s just this… this ridiculous shaking. And frankly, this whole conversation is ridiculous. Is there a test you can give me? A pill? Something?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I want to check your reflexes, your muscle strength, and your coordination. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry it up, please. I have better things to do than be poked and prodded. And be gentle, alright? My skin is… delicate. Honestly, you young doctors, always taking so much time. Let's get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here for me. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Then we'll move on to the neurological exam. 140 over 90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let's look at your hands. I see a resting tremor in both hands, more pronounced on the right. Now, can you hold your arms out in front of you like this?
PATIENT: Ugh, it feels weird already. These old bones aren’t as cooperative as they used to be. And yes, you see it, good. It's obvious. You don’t need to make me hold my arms out to prove it. It's worse when I'm nervous, you know. So poking around is probably making it worse. Just get to the point. What is it? Some kind of…Parkinson's? My sister had something like that. Horrible.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. It could be a tremor, and Parkinson's is certainly one possibility, but it's too early to say definitively. There are other conditions that can cause tremors as well. We’ll need to rule those out. I'm going to check your reflexes and coordination. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Eyes, yes, fine. Follow your finger. Honestly, I feel like a lab rat. Don’t poke me in the eye. Diminished reflexes? What does that even mean? Does that mean I’m getting stupider? This is ridiculous, I tell you. Absolutely ridiculous. Just tell me if there’s a pill or not. That’s all I care about.
DOCTOR: Your eye movements are normal. Alright, now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Now, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? What a question! I’m eighty years old, doctor! What don’t I have? Arthritis, naturally. High blood pressure, you just figured that out. And my knees… I already told you about my knees! Honestly. Let me think… Oh, and I used to have a bit of trouble with my cholesterol, but they put me on something for that years ago. Don’t remember what it was called. It's all a blur. Just… a lot of old-age stuff. Nothing exciting. Is that helpful? I'm sure I’m forgetting something. What exactly are you looking for? A list of every ache and pain I've ever had?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, arthritis, high blood pressure, history of high cholesterol… and you're currently taking medication for that?
PATIENT: No, not anymore. They stopped it, years ago. Said it was doing more harm than good, something about side effects. Look, I don't keep track of every little pill the doctors have given me over the years. I have a lot more important things to remember, like… well, I can’t remember what those things are right now. This is pointless. Really pointless. Are you going to actually do something about this shaking, or just keep asking questions? I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I understand your frustration. So, to summarize, you're experiencing a tremor that's worse with activity, and you have a history of high blood pressure, arthritis, and previously treated high cholesterol. Given your age and medical history, several things could be causing this. I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also want to get a referral for a neurological evaluation. A neurologist can perform more specialized tests to determine the exact cause of the tremor. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and another doctor. Wonderful. Just what I need. More poking and prodding. Fine. Whatever. Get it done. Just… hurry it up, please. And send the results to my house. I don't fancy coming back here again anytime soon. Honestly, it’s all a waste of time, probably. Just old age. But fine, do your tests. Just get it over with. Now, can I go? I'm tired. Really tired. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Here's the lab order for your blood tests. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you right away. And here's the referral for Dr. Chen, the neurologist. His office will call you to schedule an appointment. I’ll have the results sent to your home address as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if the shaking gets significantly worse, or you experience any other symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Baide. Have a good day, and get some rest. .
