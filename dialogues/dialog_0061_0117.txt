DOCTOR: “Bula vinaka, Devin! Good morning. I’m Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good mornin’. Just… a cough. Been coughin’ up stuff. Not good stuff. Red… yeah, red in it. Been happenin’ a bit now. I don’t… I don’t really remember exactly when it started, just… lately. I smoke, if that matters.
DOCTOR: “Okay, a cough with some red in the mucus, and it’s been happening recently. And you smoke. Yes, that definitely matters, thank you for telling me. Can you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: Uh… how to say it… it’s a deep cough. Comes from… down low. Not like a cold cough. It… it kinda rattles. And it’s worse in the mornin’. Always worse when I first wake up. I try to… ignore it, mostly. Doesn't always work.
DOCTOR: “Okay, a deep, rattling cough that’s worse in the mornings. You try to ignore it, but it’s difficult. And is it constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. It’s… not all the time. Sometimes I forget I even had it. Then, wham. It hits. Usually a few times a day. More when I… when I’ve been workin’ hard. Out distributin’ power. It kinda… makes my chest hurt sometimes, too. Not bad, just… feels tight.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so it’s intermittent, comes and goes, worse with activity, and you’ve noticed some chest tightness along with it. When you say “distributin’ power,” what kind of work are you doing exactly?
PATIENT: Uh… I work for the power company. Makin’ sure folks get their electricity. I go out and check the lines, fix stuff when it breaks. Walk a lot. Climb poles sometimes. It’s… physical work. Been doin’ it a long time. Don't really think about it bein’ hard, ya know? Just what I do.
DOCTOR: “Right, so you’re doing fairly strenuous physical work, climbing and walking. And has anything else changed lately?
PATIENT: Changed? Uh… not that I remember. Work's been… the same. Been hotter than usual, I guess. That might be somethin’. Lots of dust out there. And… I think I’ve been more tired lately. But… I always kinda feel tired. Hard to say, really. I forget things easy these days.
DOCTOR: “Okay, hotter weather, more dust, and you’ve noticed increased fatigue. It's good you're mentioning that even if it's hard to pinpoint. Now, have you had any fever, chills, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. Chills… maybe a little when it’s cold, but everyone gets cold. Night sweats… I don’t… I sleep pretty heavy. Don’t usually wake up. Weight loss… I dunno. I haven't been weighin' myself. Been eatin' okay, I guess. Hard to keep track of things.
DOCTOR: “Alright. No fever, chills, or night sweats, and no significant weight loss that you’ve noticed. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions like asthma, COPD, heart problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Uh… nothin’ I know of. Never been told I have anythin’. Went to the doctor when I was a kid, got shots, that’s about it. My mom… she had somethin’ with her breathin’, I think. But I don't remember what. Old news now. I mostly just… keep goin’. Don't get sick much. Except for this cough.
DOCTOR: “Okay, no known medical conditions, and your mother had some breathing issues. We can talk more about that later if you remember any details. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. Broke my arm once when I was little climbin’ a tree, but that was just a cast. That’s it. I’m a pretty simple guy, Doc. Don't need much fixin’. Mostly.
DOCTOR: “Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations besides a childhood broken arm. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Not really. Maybe some aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. Don't like takin' pills if I can help it. Makes me feel… weird. And I don’t go for that herbal stuff. Mostly just drink water. That’s what my grandma always said. Good for ya.
DOCTOR: “Okay, just occasional aspirin for headaches, otherwise nothing. And no herbal supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Sometimes dust makes me sneeze, but that’s just dust. Not an allergy. Are we almost done, Doc? I got a schedule.
DOCTOR: “Alright, no known allergies. We're getting there, Devin. Just a few more questions. Last, have you ever smoked cigarettes, cigars, or used any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: Yeah. I smoke. Been smokin’… a long time. Since I was… young. Not as much as I used to, but… still smoke. Don't like talkin' about it.
DOCTOR: “Okay. Thank you for being honest with me, Devin. And it’s alright, we don’t have to dwell on it. And approximately how much do you smoke per day?
PATIENT: Uh… maybe a pack a day. Sometimes less. Depends. If I’m busy, I forget to smoke. If I'm stressed… more. It’s… a habit. A bad habit. I know it ain't good for ya.
DOCTOR: “Okay, roughly a pack a day, depending on stress and workload. Alright, Devin, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Whatever ya gotta do. Just… try to be quick, Doc. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely. I’ll be as quick as I can. Please take a deep breath in through your mouth, and then exhale slowly.” “Okay… I’m hearing some wheezing and crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit fast. I'm also noting your chest feels tight when I press on it.” “Given your history of smoking, the cough with red mucus, the wheezing, and the crackles, there are a few possibilities we need to consider.”
PATIENT: What… what possibilities? Is it bad? I don’t want no bad news. Just fix it, Doc. I got work to do. I can't be sick.
DOCTOR: “I understand your concern, Devin. It’s not necessarily “bad” yet, but it does warrant further investigation. The most likely possibilities, given your symptoms and smoking history, are bronchitis or pneumonia. Less likely, but we need to rule it out, is something more serious like COPD or even lung cancer, though your age makes that less probable. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. It's the best way to see what's going on in your lungs. I’ll also order a sputum culture to see if we can identify any infection. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: X-ray… and a… whatchamacallit… a culture? Is that… is that gonna hurt? And… and how long is this gonna take? I got a schedule, Doc. I can’t just… sit around. And… Cancer? You said… cancer? I don’t want no cancer.
DOCTOR: “Okay, Devin, deep breaths. The X-ray won’t hurt at all. You’ll just stand still for a few seconds while the machine takes a picture. And the sputum culture is just collecting a sample of the mucus you cough up – it might be a little uncomfortable, but it’s quick. I said it’s less likely to be cancer, and we're doing these tests to rule it out, okay?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Do the tests. Just… get it over with. Get me the answers. And… and tell me what it is, Doc. Don't… don't beat around the bush. Just tell me. I gotta know. Then… then I can go back to work.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Devin. I promise I will be upfront and honest with you. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible, and I’ll explain the results to you in plain language. I’ll have my nurse schedule you for a chest X-ray and sputum culture right away. It should be today, if possible. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you an inhaler to help with your breathing and a cough suppressant to ease your discomfort. It won’t cure anything, but it will hopefully make you more comfortable while we wait for the results. And I also want you to take it easy for a few days. No heavy lifting or strenuous activity, okay?
PATIENT: Alright… inhaler and… and easy. I can try. But… work is… important. Just… get those tests done quick, Doc. And… and tell me what’s goin’ on. I gotta know. .
DOCTOR: “I understand, Devin. We’ll do everything we can to get you answers quickly. My nurse will be in shortly with information about the tests and your prescriptions. If you have any questions or concerns before then, don’t hesitate to call the office. Get some rest, and we’ll talk soon.”
