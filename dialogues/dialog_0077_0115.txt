DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you as well, Doctor. Pirl, was it? Yes… well, it’s… my skin. It’s gone a bit yellow, you see. A friend… someone mentioned something about the liver, and I thought it best to have it looked at. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been… a while, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Durig, I understand. Yellowing of the skin – what we call jaundice – can certainly be unsettling. And it's good you're getting it checked out. You mentioned not recalling exactly when it started… that’s alright. Roughly, would you say it’s been a few weeks, a few months?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a few months, I think. Possibly longer. Time… it just seems to slip away these days. I’ve had… some trouble with my stomach, on and off. Not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And tired. Very tired, most of the time. I don’t remember the doctor mentioning anything specific about my liver before, though. Perhaps it was a different doctor… it’s all so hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a few months of yellowing skin, some stomach discomfort, and fatigue. We'll certainly investigate. Let's try to piece things together. Have you noticed any changes in your stool color – perhaps paler than usual?
PATIENT: Oh… stool color. Now you’re asking something. I… I honestly don’t pay much attention to that, Doctor. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. I eat… fairly regularly, I suppose. Not much of an appetite these days, but I try. I mostly eat… soups, and toast. Simple things. Is it important? Will it help you figure out what’s wrong? I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, Ms. Durig, but don’t worry if you haven’t noticed anything specific. It’s perfectly alright. We'll proceed regardless. Now, have you experienced any itching, all over your body?
PATIENT: Itching… now that you mention it… yes. A little. Not constant, but… a sort of prickling sensation. Mostly on my arms and back, I think. I put it down to the dry weather, honestly. It's been quite warm, hasn't it? I use lotion, but it doesn't seem to help much. Is that… important, Doctor? Are we getting anywhere? I feel rather… anxious.
DOCTOR: Yes, the itching is important, Ms. Durig. It often accompanies jaundice. And don’t worry, we are getting somewhere. It just takes time to gather all the pieces of the puzzle. Now, regarding your medical history… do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. Let me think… I don't believe so. I haven't taken much in the way of medication lately. A pain reliever now and then for my arthritis, but nothing regularly. I used to… many years ago, I had a reaction to penicillin, I think. But that was… a very long time ago. I’m not even certain it was penicillin. My memory… it’s terribly unreliable, I’m afraid. Are you writing all of this down?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Durig, I am. Every detail is important, even if it seems small. We can always clarify later if needed. So, a possible reaction to penicillin in the past. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses that you recall?
PATIENT: Oh… surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was very young. And… a hysterectomy, many years ago. That's all I can recall, I think. As for illnesses… I've had the usual colds and flus, of course. Nothing serious. I used to be quite healthy, actually. But… things change, don't they? I haven't been feeling myself for quite some time now. I just want to know what’s happening… is it something awful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: We'll get to the bottom of it, Ms. Durig. It’s too early to say anything definitively. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother… she had trouble with her stomach, I think. Something about ulcers, perhaps? And my father… he had heart problems. A weak heart, they said. As for anything else… I'm not certain. We weren't a very close family, you see. Didn’t talk much about… health matters. It’s all a bit vague, I’m afraid. Is this… helpful? I feel rather useless, not being able to remember things. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: You're not being useless at all, Ms. Durig. It’s perfectly common for memories to fade, especially over time. Every little bit of information helps. Now, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… oh dear. Well, I live alone, you see. I used to be very active, I enjoyed gardening and… socializing. But these days, I mostly stay indoors. I don’t get out much. I used to drink… a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. But I’ve cut back on that, lately. I don’t smoke, and I’ve never used… any sort of drugs. Is that… what you wanted to know? I don’t have many visitors. It gets lonely, you know. But I manage. I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Durig. That’s helpful. Now, one last question for now. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… just the arthritis cream, you know, the one you rub on your joints. And… occasionally, I take a pain reliever, ibuprofen, when my arthritis is particularly bad. Nothing else, I don't think. Sometimes I take vitamins, but I'm not very regular about it. I try to eat a healthy diet, but… it’s difficult these days. I just want to feel better, Doctor. I feel so tired all the time. Is this going to take much longer? I have… an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. That’s very helpful. It sounds like we have a good starting point. Now, I’d like to conduct a quick physical examination. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical examination. Yes, alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. My appointment… it's with my niece, you see. She's very busy. But yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. I'm a bit… frail these days. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if anything is uncomfortable. I do hope it’s nothing serious, Doctor. I truly do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are a bit muffled, but rhythm is regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Abdomen is soft, but there's slight tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Finally, let's examine your skin. As I suspected, there is noticeable jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and eyes. I also note some mild edema in the lower extremities.
PATIENT: Oh… the abdomen… yes, that’s a bit tender. Just there, on the right side. It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And the swelling… in my legs? I hadn’t noticed that, to be honest. My eyesight isn’t very good these days. So… what does it mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? Please, tell me the truth. I can handle it. I just want to know what’s happening… and what can be done. I’m getting quite anxious now. I feel… rather faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig, please just take a few deep breaths. You're not alone, and we’ll figure this out together. Based on the physical examination and what you’ve told me, I suspect we may be dealing with a liver issue. The jaundice, tenderness in the upper right quadrant, and edema in your legs are all consistent with this. Now, I need to order some blood tests to confirm my suspicions and determine the extent of the problem. These tests will assess your liver function, look for signs of infection, and rule out other possible causes. I will also order an ultrasound of your abdomen to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but it’s important we investigate this further. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Oh dear… liver issue? Is it… is it serious, Doctor? I mean, can it be… fixed? I have… hepatitis, you said? My niece… she mentioned something about that, years ago. But I don't remember the details. Ultrasound… blood tests… it all sounds so frightening. Will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to feel normal again. I'm a bit overwhelmed. Perhaps… perhaps I should call my niece. I think I need some support. But… what if it’s bad news? What if… what if it’s something I can’t recover from? I'm getting quite upset now. Please… tell me honestly, Doctor. What are the chances?
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, please try to remain calm. I understand your anxiety, and it’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed. I haven't said you have hepatitis, but that's one possibility we need to investigate. The blood tests and ultrasound will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. As for the chances… it’s impossible to say anything definitively at this point. Liver issues can range from mild to severe, and treatment options vary depending on the cause and extent of the damage. We won't know more until we have the results of the tests. I will order them immediately, and we should have them back within a few days. In the meantime, I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to provide the best possible care. You are not alone in this. And yes, please, call your niece if you need support. Having someone by your side is always helpful. I'm here for you as well. Let's focus on getting the answers we need first. And remember, we haven’t even made a diagnosis yet. Is there anything else I can do to reassure you right now?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That’s… that’s very kind of you. Just… getting the tests done as quickly as possible would be helpful. And… perhaps a list of what I should expect? What if they need to… draw a lot of blood? I’ve always been a bit… faint around needles. And… what if it’s something very serious? I just… I need to be prepared. I suppose… I should call my niece. She's very practical, you see. She’ll know what to do. But… please, Doctor, promise me you’ll let me know as soon as you have the results. I don't want to be kept waiting. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. I will personally ensure the tests are expedited and I will call you immediately with the results, no matter the time of day. The phlebotomist will be aware of your anxiety and will take extra care during the blood draw. They will let you lie down if needed. I will also provide you with a written list of instructions and resources. And yes, please, do call your niece. Having support is very important. I will also have my nursing staff prepare a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results once they are available. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
