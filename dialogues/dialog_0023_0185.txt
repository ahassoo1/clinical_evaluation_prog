DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Ambris. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my breath. It smells…bad. Really bad. My ex-husband definitely noticed, and honestly, everyone probably does. It’s embarrassing. Can we just…fix it? I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Well, "fixing it" requires understanding why it smells bad, Ms. Ambris. It’s rarely just…happening. Have you noticed this odor consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't pay that much attention. I smell it sometimes, especially in the morning, I guess. And after…well, never mind what I eat. It’s just…there. Is it a hygiene thing? Because I shower. Regularly.
DOCTOR: It could be related to hygiene, yes, but there are many other possibilities. We need to rule those out. Do you brush your teeth twice a day?
PATIENT: Look, are you accusing me of not brushing my teeth? I do! Sometimes. Okay, maybe not always twice a day. But who has time? It's not like I'm living under a bridge. I work highway maintenance, it's not exactly a glamorous job, you know? I'm out in the sun all day, dealing with…stuff. It's a lot.
DOCTOR: Highway maintenance…right. Alright. And do you use floss?
PATIENT: Floss? Seriously? Who even has time for floss? Look, I’m just here to get rid of the smell, not take a dental hygiene course. Is there a pill for this or what? It’s not like it’s a life-threatening problem. I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, I understand your frustration, but simply masking the symptom isn't responsible medical care. The odor could indicate a variety of things – gingivitis, an infection, even something systemic. Before we even consider a "pill," we need to perform an oral examination. And I will need a full medical history. Let's start with allergies. Are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Okay, allergies… I think I’m allergic to dust. And sometimes my skin gets itchy when I wear certain fabrics. Does that count? And I had a bad reaction to penicillin once, like, a long time ago. Other than that…no. I really don’t have time for this. Is this going to be a long appointment? I have a shift starting at 5.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy is important, thank you. Dust and fabric reactions are noted, but less relevant to this issue at hand. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don't like taking pills. I just…deal with things. Honestly, I haven't really needed anything, until now. This breath thing is just…annoying. It's embarrassing, that's all. Can we please just move this along? I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ambris. Let’s proceed with the examination then. Please open your mouth wide for me. I need to check your gums, teeth, and tongue. This will take only a moment.
PATIENT: Fine. But if this gets weird, I'm leaving. Just…get it over with. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your gums are quite inflamed, and I see some plaque build-up. Your tongue also appears coated, which can contribute to odor. No obvious cavities that I can see without an X-ray. I also notice some…calculus, a hardened form of plaque. It seems you haven't had a professional cleaning recently. Do you have dental insurance?
PATIENT: Dental insurance? Are you serious right now? No. I told you, I'm divorced! My ex took everything. Look, I just want this fixed, not a lecture on dental hygiene and a bill I can't afford. What's the cheapest option? Just tell me what I need to do. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ambris. Given your lack of insurance, we will focus on the most immediate steps. The odor is likely caused by bacterial overgrowth due to poor oral hygiene. I recommend a rigorous brushing and flossing routine – twice daily brushing for two minutes each time, and daily flossing. An over-the-counter antibacterial mouthwash could also help reduce bacteria. However, the inflammation of your gums suggests gingivitis. This requires professional cleaning to remove the calculus and prevent it from worsening into a more serious gum disease. I can write you a referral to a low-cost dental clinic in the area. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Ugh, a referral… great. Fine, yeah, give me the referral. Just…email it to me. I don't have time to write anything down. And honestly, if this doesn't work, I'm just gonna start chewing gum all day. Is that a bad idea? Don't tell me it's bad, I really don't want to hear it. How much longer is this going to take?
DOCTOR: Chewing sugar-free gum can stimulate saliva production, which helps neutralize acids and cleanse the mouth, but it's a temporary fix, Ms. Ambris. It won’t address the underlying inflammation. Here’s the referral information. The clinic offers a sliding scale fee based on income. I strongly advise scheduling an appointment as soon as possible. I'll also email you a handout on proper brushing and flossing techniques. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. That’s it. I’m done. Thanks… I guess. Just…email it. And don't bother calling me.
