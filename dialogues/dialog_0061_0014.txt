DOCTOR: Bula and welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, bula to you too, Doctor. Limtiaco is fine, everyone calls me Ronnie. Um… well, my wife, she said I really need to get some papers… for, you know, time off? She handles most of this stuff. Something about… leave? Or… maybe not being able to work? I get a bit mixed up sometimes, honestly. It's for my job, with the church.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ronnie, no worries at all. It sounds like you might need some medical documentation for leave from your job at the church. We can definitely get that sorted out. Just to clarify, is there something specific happening right now that’s causing you to need this leave?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Honestly… not really? My wife, bless her heart, she worries a lot. She says I’ve been… slower lately. More forgetful, she says. And tired. I… I do feel a bit more tired than usual, I guess. But I’ve always been a bit… absent-minded, you know? It's just… getting older, probably. She thinks it’s better to be safe, get the paperwork just in case. I can’t really recall exactly why she wanted me to come in today, now that I think about it. Old age, eh?
DOCTOR: It's wonderful that your wife is so attentive and looking out for you, Ronnie. It's always good to be proactive about health, and it is common to experience some changes as we get older. It sounds like she's noticing some changes in your energy levels and memory, and wants to rule out anything concerning. Let's talk a little more about this "slower" feeling and the tiredness. When did you start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. It wasn't sudden, you see. Just… gradual. Maybe… six months ago? Or was it a year? I honestly can’t pinpoint it exactly. It feels like it's been… building, slowly. I still go to work, I still do everything I need to, mostly. It’s just… takes me a little longer. And I forget where I put things more often. My wife gets frustrated, but she’s very patient. She says I repeat myself. Do I repeat myself, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to have some difficulty with recall as we get older, Ronnie. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. And it's very common for spouses to notice these things first! You mentioned taking longer to do things. Can you give me an example of something that’s become more challenging?
PATIENT: Well… at work, I plan a lot of the religious education programs. Used to be I could just… know what needed to be done. Now, I have to write everything down. Lots of lists. And even then, I double-check them constantly. It's like… my mind just doesn't hold onto things like it used to. And the names… sometimes the names of the children in the programs… they slip my mind. It's embarrassing, really. I used to remember everyone’s name instantly. Now? It’s a struggle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty with planning, organization, and recalling names – that’s helpful to know. Has this been impacting your ability to enjoy things?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. I used to love reading, you know? Just lose myself in a book for hours. Now? I start a page, and I have to go back and reread it constantly. I can’t seem to follow the story. And I used to play chess with my grandson every Sunday. Now… I get so confused, I just end up upsetting him. He's very patient, but I can see the frustration in his eyes. It’s… it’s not the same anymore. I miss doing those things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ronnie. That sounds incredibly frustrating, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling down about it. It's hard when things you enjoy become more difficult. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my prostate checked a few years back, that was all fine. And my blood pressure… sometimes it gets a little high, but my doctor – Dr. Kalani, lovely woman – she put me on a little pill for it. Nothing major. I used to be very active, swam a lot, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I take something for those too, just to ease the pain. Oh, and I’ve got a touch of arthritis, that’s why my hands sometimes ache. But other than that… not much, I think. My wife keeps me on a strict diet, too. Lots of fish. She's very health-conscious, bless her.
DOCTOR: Okay, so history of prostate check – normal, hypertension managed with medication, knee pain, and arthritis. That's good to know. And your wife sounds like a wonderful advocate for your health. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any problems with the pills Dr. Kalani gave me, or anything else for that matter. I've never really had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. My wife always double-checks everything before I take it, so I trust her judgment. She's very careful. But no, I don’t think I have any allergies. Lucky me, eh?
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had… well, she got very confused towards the end. The doctors said it was old age, I think. Not sure. And my father… he had a bad heart, I believe. He passed away when I was young. And my sister… she had some problems with her blood pressure, like me. But other than that… not that I recall. My wife keeps all the family medical records, I'm afraid. She's very organized. I wish I had her memory! She'd be able to tell you everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of maternal confusion later in life, paternal heart disease, and sister with hypertension. That's helpful to know. It sounds like your wife really keeps track of everything. Alright, Ronnie, I'm going to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. This will help me get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. My knees aren’t what they used to be, so getting up and down might be a little… challenging. But I’ll manage. Just do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, if you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. We’ll take it slow, and if anything is uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Finally, I’m going to do a quick cognitive assessment - just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking. Okay, Ronnie, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the year… Let me think. Is it… 2023? No… 2024? My wife always keeps track of these things. I get so mixed up. It must be… 2025? Is it 2025? I really can’t be sure. It feels like yesterday it was 2020, honestly. Time flies, eh? Am I right?
DOCTOR: It is 2025, Ronnie. That’s alright, it’s very common to have some difficulty with recall. Now, can you tell me the names of three things?
PATIENT: Three things… Oh dear. Um… a table… and a chair… and… a… a lamp? Is that three? My mind is just… blank. It’s like they’re right there, but I can’t quite reach them. This is embarrassing, really. I used to be so sharp.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ronnie. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty with recall. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words back to me. I’ll say them, and then you tell me when I ask. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I'm ready. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, and penny. Remember those. Apple, table, penny. Alright, now I’m going to ask you a few more questions about your daily life. But first, let’s see if you can recall the three words I just gave you. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Hmm… apple… and… oh dear. I remember something about a fruit… and… and something you find in a room… But the third one… it’s right on the tip of my tongue… It’s… table! Yes, table. And apple… but what was the other one? I’m so sorry, Doctor. My mind is just… a blank. I’m failing miserably, aren't I?
DOCTOR: You're not failing at all, Ronnie. It's perfectly normal to have some difficulty with recall, especially as we get older. And you remembered two of the words, which is good. Based on this quick exam and your history, it sounds like you may be experiencing some mild cognitive impairment. Now, this doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's something we should investigate further. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this. I also recommend a more comprehensive cognitive assessment, which we can do here at the clinic. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood work and… a more detailed test? I suppose so. If you think it’s best, Doctor. I just… I don’t want anything serious. I want to be able to keep up with my wife, and enjoy my hobbies. Is it something to worry about? I’m probably just getting old, eh? But yes, do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. And whatever it is, I want to make sure my wife is informed, of course. She handles all these things anyway.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re proactive about this, Ronnie. We’re just going to rule out any other potential causes. Many things can cause temporary memory issues, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. We’ll get some blood work done to check for those. And the comprehensive assessment will give us a better picture of your cognitive function. I’ll write the orders for the blood work now, and schedule you for the assessment with our cognitive specialist, Ms. Lani. I’ll also make sure Ms. Lani is aware of your wife’s concerns. In the meantime, it’s good to continue doing things that keep your mind active – reading, puzzles, social activities. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. Just… thank you. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. And please, do let my wife know. She's going to want to be involved in all of this, of course. She’ll probably call you tomorrow. She’s very thorough, you know. She always is. And… thank you again. I feel a little better now, knowing we’re getting it checked out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ronnie. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. And don’t worry, I’ll be sure to keep your wife informed every step of the way. Let me get the nurse to come in and take your blood. And then I'll have Ms. Lani give your wife a call to schedule the assessment. Take care of yourself, Ronnie, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before then.
