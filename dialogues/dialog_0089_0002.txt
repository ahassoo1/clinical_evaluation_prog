DOCTOR: Hi Zoie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brought me in? Let me think… it's… going to the bathroom. It’s hard now, you see? Not easy like before. It takes a long time, and sometimes… sometimes it just doesn’t come out all the way. My husband, he says I should come see someone. He worries, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, difficulty with urination – it takes longer, and you're feeling like you aren’t completely emptying your bladder. And your husband is concerned, which is good—it's always helpful to have someone looking out for you. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… that’s a tricky one. It hasn’t been forever, but not just yesterday either. Maybe… a few months? It started slowly, I think. I just thought I was getting older, you know? Things change when you get old. But it's getting worse, I suppose. It worries me a little, but I don't remember exactly when it started being this bad. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. A few months is helpful to know. It is common for things to change as we age, but it's good you came in to get it checked out. Now, besides the difficulty emptying, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. Sometimes… sometimes I feel like I have to go right away, very suddenly. It’s a bit embarrassing, but I rush to the bathroom and… well, you know. Not always an accident, but I have to go now. And sometimes… a little bit of a burning feeling when I go. Not all the time, though. Just sometimes. Is that what you mean by symptoms? I don’t know all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I mean by symptoms. Thank you for telling me. So, urgency – needing to go suddenly – and a burning sensation with urination sometimes. Do you have any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Lower… abdomen? Is that my belly? No, not really pain. A little bit of a… discomfort, maybe. Like a dull ache sometimes, but not sharp. And my back… oh, my back always aches a little. I’m an old woman! It’s just old age, I think. I don't think it's because of the bathroom trouble, though. It's just always a little sore. I used to work… what was I working? Oh, something with people… helping people. A long time ago. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Zoie. It's helpful to know your back ache is a long-standing issue. So, just to clarify, no new pain in your lower abdomen, just the general discomfort you mentioned. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in my… pee? Oh dear. Let me think… I haven't been looking at it, you know? I just go. But… now that you mention it, sometimes it looks a little… cloudy? Not always, but sometimes. And… I think it smells a little stronger than it used to. Is that important? I really don't pay much attention, I'm sorry. I just know it's not clear like water all the time.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize at all! It’s very helpful to know. Cloudy urine and a stronger smell are definitely things we want to look into. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, just to get a full picture. Have you had any previous medical problems or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That’s a hard one. I’ve lived a long life, you know? I think… I think I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. But everything was so long ago, I barely remember. And… I used to get sick a lot when I was younger. Just colds and things. I worked with people who were… not well. So I caught things sometimes. And I have my blood pressure, the doctor always tells me to take my pills. That’s about all I can remember. I’m sorry I’m not more help. My mind… it’s like a sieve, you know? Things just slip away.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Zoie. It's very helpful knowing about the gallbladder removal and your blood pressure. Don't worry about remembering everything—we can go through your records as well. Do you take any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take something for my arthritis, it makes my hands less achy. A little white pill, I think. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take a little something my husband gives me. He says it’s to help me rest. But I don’t take it every night, just when I’m really restless. I don't remember what they're called, I just take what the doctors tell me. My husband helps me keep track of things. He's a good man.
DOCTOR: Okay, so something for arthritis and something for sleep occasionally. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else—like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat most things. I used to grow flowers in my garden, you know? All sorts of them. And I never had any trouble with those. I might sneeze sometimes, but that’s just the dust. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but I haven’t really paid much attention. I eat what my husband cooks, and he wouldn’t give me anything that would hurt me. He’s very careful. I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a simple urine test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a test? Well… I suppose so. If you think it will help. I don't like needles, you know? But if it's just listening and checking… that sounds alright. My husband always says I worry too much. But I don’t mind if you need to listen. Just be gentle, dear. My skin is thin now, you know? And the urine test… is it painful? I don’t want anything painful.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Zoie, I promise. Just listening with my stethoscope, checking your reflexes, and a simple urine sample. The urine sample is just you going to the bathroom—no pain involved at all. It's just to check for infection. If you’d like, you can lie down on the table, and we’ll start there. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A table sounds… alright. Just a little wobbly, maybe? I’m not as steady as I used to be. Just be careful, dear. And don’t mind if I take my time. Old bones, you know. They creak a little.
DOCTOR: Take all the time you need, Zoie. No rush at all. I’m just listening to your abdomen now, checking for any unusual sounds. I’m also feeling your abdomen gently to check for any tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. It sounds quiet in here, which is good. Everything seems… soft. No particular areas of pain. Now, let's check your reflexes quickly. Can you bend your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. My knees… they’re not what they used to be, you know? A little creaky, but they still work. I think. Just be careful, dear. Don’t pull them too hard. And… is everything alright? You’re very quiet. Are you finding anything wrong? It worries me when you’re quiet. My husband says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Everything is alright, Zoie. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, just that things are slowing down a little. Now, if you're comfortable, we'll just need a urine sample. There's a cup in the bathroom. Just catch a little bit when you can. No pressure, take your time. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Oh, a cup? Alright. The bathroom… is it far? My legs aren’t as strong as they used to be, you know. Just be careful, dear. And let me know if I need help. I don’t want to fall. My husband would worry so much.
DOCTOR: It’s just down the hall, Zoie, and I’ll be right here. Take your time, and let me know if you need any assistance at all. I’m right outside if you need me. Don't rush.
PATIENT: Here you are, dear. It wasn't easy, you know? My legs… they weren't cooperating. But I managed. Just be careful with it. Is that enough? I didn’t want to strain myself. It’s a little cloudy, I think. Like my pee usually is.
DOCTOR: Thank you so much, Zoie. You did a wonderful job. And yes, that’s perfectly enough. Alright, Zoie. The urine sample does show some signs of infection. It’s not severe, but it explains the urgency and burning sensation you’ve been experiencing. It also explains the cloudiness and stronger smell. We'll need to start you on a course of antibiotics to clear up the infection. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics, that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… hmm. I don't think so. I've taken pills before, you know? My husband always makes sure I take my pills. But I don't remember what kind. I don't think I've ever had a bad reaction to anything, but my memory… it's not what it used to be. He keeps a list, I think. Of all my medicines. He’s very careful. But I don’t want to take anything that will make me feel worse. I get dizzy easily, you know? And I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. We’ll start with a mild antibiotic—Nitrofurantoin—which is less likely to cause dizziness. We'll start with 100mg twice a day for seven days. I’ll send the prescription to your pharmacy. It’s important to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better before the seven days are up. That will make sure the infection is completely cleared. Also, drink plenty of fluids while you're on the antibiotics – about 8 glasses of water a day. That will help flush out the infection and prevent side effects. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Seven days… alright. I can remember seven days, I think. My husband will help me keep track. He always does. Twice a day… morning and night? And eight glasses of water… that’s a lot of water. But I can try. I don’t want to get worse. And what if… what if it doesn’t work? What if I still feel bad after seven days? My husband would worry so much. He's very protective, you know. He's always looking after me. Should I call you? Do you have a number? I don't want to bother you, but I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. If you don’t feel any improvement after three days, or if your symptoms get worse at any time, please call the office immediately. Here’s a number: 555-123-4567. You can ask for me directly, and we’ll figure out what to do next. It’s better to be safe than sorry. We'll also want to monitor your kidney function. Sometimes infections can affect your kidneys. We'll do a blood test in one month just to make sure everything is alright. I’ll give you a lab order when you leave. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Kidney… oh dear. That sounds serious. A blood test… alright. If you think it's necessary. My husband always says I worry too much. But I want to be careful. Hmm… let me see… I think that’s all. You’ve explained everything very clearly, dear. And you’ve been very patient with me. My memory… it’s not what it used to be, you know? I’m afraid I’ll forget something important. But I’ll try my best to remember everything you’ve told me. Seven days of pills… eight glasses of water… a blood test in one month… Thank you, dear. You've been very kind. I feel a little better now, knowing what’s going on. And knowing what to do. I'm ready to go home now, if that's alright. My husband must be worried. He's a good man.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Zoie. And don’t worry about forgetting—that’s perfectly normal. We’ll send a summary of everything we discussed to your pharmacy and to your husband’s email as well. Here’s the lab order for your blood test. Just take this to the lab at your convenience. Take it easy, drink plenty of fluids, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I hope you feel better soon. And please give your husband my best—it sounds like he takes wonderful care of you.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. I will. He will be so relieved to know I’m alright. And I will try to remember everything you’ve told me. Seven days… eight glasses… a blood test… Thank you again, dear. You’ve been very kind. And… goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Zoie. Take care, and have a good day. Goodbye.
