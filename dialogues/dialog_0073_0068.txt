DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's...the swelling, you see? After the cancer treatment. It's mostly in my legs and feet. It’s a bit uncomfortable, to be honest. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: Yes, swelling… after cancer treatment. I see. And how long has this swelling been occurring, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, hmm… maybe a month ago? It wasn't too bad at first, just a little puffiness. But it's getting worse each week, I think. It’s hard to tell exactly, you know? Old age, everything feels slower.
DOCTOR: A month ago…gradually worsening. Right. And is it worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Definitely worse at the end of the day. After I’ve been… standing, or even just sitting for too long. It feels much better when I can put my feet up. Though, I don’t always have time to put my feet up, you know? Work keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Of course. Work. And where is this swelling located specifically?
PATIENT: Mostly in my ankles and feet, like I said. Sometimes it goes up a bit into my calves, but not too high. It’s… mostly on both legs, thankfully. Not just one. I worry if it was just one, that would be… bad, right? I don't know much about this.
DOCTOR: Both legs, ankles, feet, occasionally calves. Good. Symmetrical swelling is… less concerning, generally. Now, Ms. Queener, can you tell me about the cancer treatment you received?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a while ago now. It was… chemotherapy. And radiation, I think? They gave me lots of pills, and I had to go to the hospital a lot for… the machine. It was quite tiring. I don’t remember all the names of things, sorry. It was… a stressful time. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It’s… something. And do you recall when this treatment ended?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It finished… maybe two years ago? Yes, around August, I think. It was before the really hot summer. Everything feels like a blur now, honestly. I just want to get back to normal. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Two years ago. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the swelling?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Let me think. Not really… just tired, sometimes. But I am getting older, you know? It’s hard to tell what’s normal and what’s not. I don’t think so… no pain, no fever, no shortness of breath. Just the swelling, mostly. It's just… annoying. And getting worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Oh, just the usual, I think. Something for my blood pressure… Lisinopril, I think it’s called? And a little thing for my cholesterol. Nothing much else. Oh! And I take a vitamin D pill every day. My doctor said I wasn't getting enough sun. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Possibly. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of! Never had a problem with any pills before. I’ve taken lots of things over the years, you know? Everything was always fine. I don't think so... no allergies, no. Is that good? I hope so!
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, Ms. Queener. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. Just let me… Here we go. It’s a bit high, isn’t it? My legs aren’t what they used to be. Hurry it up please! I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's take a look. Hmm… there is pitting edema bilaterally, up to approximately the mid-calf. Skin is warm to the touch, no redness or lesions noted. Pulses are… present, though somewhat diminished. Capillary refill is… a little slow. Your reflexes are normal, sensation intact. I don't detect any enlarged lymph nodes.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… complicated. What does that mean? Pitting… edema? Is that bad? I don't understand all these words! Is my blood circulation bad? I'm just worried, you see.
DOCTOR: It means there's fluid accumulating in your legs and feet, Ms. Queener. The pitting edema is just what we call it when it leaves a little indent when I press on your skin. It’s… not immediately dangerous, but it’s certainly something we need to investigate. Given your history of cancer treatment, it's most likely related to that. We'll need to rule out a few other possibilities though. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We also need to check your kidney function and your albumin levels.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But can’t we just… get me something for the swelling now? I’ve got work to do, you see. All this waiting is… frustrating. Is there a pill for it? A cream? Anything? I really don't want to sit around all day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Queener, I understand your frustration, but we need to determine the cause of the swelling before I can prescribe anything. Prescribing a diuretic without knowing the underlying issue could actually be harmful. We'll get the blood work done today, and I’ll have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible and wearing compression stockings. Do you have those?
PATIENT: Compression stockings? No, I don’t think so. My sister used to wear them… something about her veins. But I don’t have any. Look, can you just write me a prescription for something, anything to take the edge off? I'm in agony here, you know? I’m not a doctor, I don’t know what’s best, you’re the expert! Just… help me.
