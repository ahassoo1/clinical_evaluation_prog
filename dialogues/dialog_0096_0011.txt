DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop, good morning. Have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor… Burlingham, is it? Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get right to it. I need a… a permission slip. For somethin’ a fella wants me to get done. It’s… cosmetic. That’s all you need to know. I just need you to say I’m okay to do it, so I can be on my way.
DOCTOR: A “permission slip,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. That’s what he called it. A young man, very… modern. Said I needed a doctor to sign off on it before he does the… the work. I don’t rightly recall what it is exactly, just that it’s to make me look… better. Is that enough for you? I’m a simple man, Doctor. Don’t need a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I can’t simply “sign off” on a procedure I know nothing about. That’s not how medicine works, and frankly, it’s not safe. I need to understand what this procedure is, why you want it done, and if you're a suitable candidate. Now, can you tell me anything more specific?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don’t know nothin’ specific! This young man came to me with a whole sales pitch, talkin’ about makin’ me look younger, tighter… somethin’ with the face. I just thought it sounded alright, and he said I needed you to say I was healthy enough. I work with towers, you know? Climb ‘em all the time. I’m in good shape for my age! That gotta count for somethin’, right? I ain't about to sit here and list every detail if I don't even remember them. Seems like a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: “Climbing towers,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. Radio towers, cellular towers, the big ones. Been doin’ it for… well, a long time now. It’s honest work. Keeps a man active. But this… this face thing, it's a different matter. He said it was quick, nothin’ invasive. Just… adjustments. I just need your signature. I got things to do, Doctor. Important things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're busy, but I'm responsible for your well-being. "Adjustments" could mean anything, and a procedure, even a seemingly minor one, carries risks. I need to know what this young man intends to do to your face. Do you have a card, a pamphlet, anything with the name of his business or the procedure itself?
PATIENT: Hold on, hold on… let me see… Ah, here. “New Reflections Aesthetics.” That’s it. Young man seemed reputable. Real slick website, if that means anything. I don’t pay much mind to computers. Just want this over with. It’s… a “Facial Volumizing Treatment.” That what you want to know? Now can we get this done? I'm startin’ to feel like I’m bein’ interrogated.
DOCTOR: “Facial Volumizing Treatment…” Involves injections, usually fillers. Mr. Honcoop, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… not that I know of. Never had much trouble with… with plants or nothin’. I eat whatever’s put in front of me. A little dust sometimes when I’m workin’ on the towers, but that’s about it. Why is that important? I just want to look a little less… weathered, you know? It ain’t a big deal.
DOCTOR: It's important because fillers can cause allergic reactions, sometimes serious ones. And, given your profession… climbing towers… you’re at risk for falls. A reaction while you’re at height could be… problematic. Now, I need to get a better sense of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Look, I told you, I climb towers! That's gotta be proof of somethin’! I’m strong, I’m steady… I ain't sick. The only thing that bothers me is my knees sometimes, after a long climb. Old man trouble, you know? But that’s it! I don't go see doctors unless somethin' is broken, and nothin’ is broken now. Are you gonna keep askin’ questions all day, or are you gonna sign the paper? I'm losin' valuable time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're frustrated, but I'm trying to ensure your safety. “Old man trouble” with your knees is relevant. Do you have arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis… maybe? The fella at the hardware store said somethin’ about it once, when I bought some liniment. Said it was good for achin’ joints. It aches, alright? Especially after a long day on a tower. But I rub some of that stuff on it and it’s fine. Look, I ain't a delicate flower, Doctor. I work hard, I play hard. I don’t need a whole medical examination just to get a little somethin’ touched up on my face. This is gettin’ ridiculous. Frankly, I think I’m wastin’ my time here. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I'm not comfortable signing off on a procedure without a proper assessment, especially given your profession and the potential risks involved. I recommend you consult with a qualified dermatologist who can thoroughly evaluate your health and determine if this treatment is appropriate for you. I’m not going to put your safety at risk. Perhaps you should see a specialist before proceeding. I have some referral information I can provide.
