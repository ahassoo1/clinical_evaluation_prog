DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… my nails. They just… look funny. Not good funny. They changed, see? I don't remember when exactly, but they're not like they used to be. I just noticed it, I guess. It's botherin' me.
DOCTOR: “Changed” how, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Ugh. Well… they're kinda… yellow. And thick. Not all of 'em, just some. And one of 'em... it's kinda liftin' up, see? Like it's comin' loose. I don't do nothin' special with 'em, really. Just… normal stuff. Washin' dishes and stuff. I don't paint 'em or nothin'. It's just weird. I don't remember hurtin' myself or anythin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long would you say you’ve noticed these changes – the yellowing, the thickening, and the lifting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… that's hard. A while. Maybe… a couple months? Could be longer. I don't really keep track, you know? Things just kinda… happen. I just noticed it when I was doin' the dishes last week, I think. Or maybe the week before. It's all blurry. It's not like it was sudden, see? It just... got worse. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the changes to your nails, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like... feelin' sick? No. I feel alright. A little tired, maybe, but who isn't? I just… don’t like lookin’ at my hands now. They're just... not nice to look at. That's the symptom, I guess. Not feelin' good about my hands. Does that count?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly valid to be concerned about a change in your appearance, Ms. Thut. We'll certainly investigate. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, medical history… I go to the doctor when somethin' hurts. That’s it. Let me think… the doctor told me somethin' once, years ago, about my… cholesterol? It was too high, maybe. I don't remember. I don't take nothin' for it, though. And… I think my mom had somethin' with her heart, but that's her, not me. I get Medicare, if that matters. I don't really remember much else. I'm not good with names and dates and stuff. It all blurs together.
DOCTOR: Alright. The EHR does show a cholesterol reading from approximately five years ago that was slightly elevated. No other significant medical history documented. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I eat everything. I take nothin', so I can't be allergic to anythin', right? I mean, I've never had a reaction or nothin'. No hives, no breathin' problems… nothin'. I'm pretty tough, I think. I've lived a long time. I don't go messin' with stuff that'll hurt me, if that makes sense. So, no allergies. I’m sure of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Let's take a look at your hands. If you'll just place your hands flat on the table, palms up. I’m going to examine them closely.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Here. Just look close, I guess. I don't know what you're lookin' for, but I hope it's not somethin' bad. My grandson says I have nice hands, but he's just bein' nice. He's a good boy.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm seeing some thickening and yellowing of several nails, as you mentioned. The texture is also somewhat brittle. And this nail here… yes, there is significant onycholysis – that's the lifting you described. It appears to be more pronounced on this one. I also notice some slight pitting on several of the nails. Capillary refill is normal, and there's no significant tenderness to palpation. I don’t see any signs of infection at this time. Does this nail feel different than the others?
PATIENT: Onyco-what-now? Look, I just know it doesn't look right. Different. It feels… loose. Like it's gonna fall off if I pull it. Not painful, just… weird. The others feel normal, I guess. A little rough, but normal. I wash dishes all the time, maybe that’s it? Makes 'em hard. You think it’s the dishes? Or somethin' worse? Don’t tell me I gotta cut 'em all off. I need my hands.
DOCTOR: Onycholysis can have several causes, Ms. Thut. Trauma – like repeated exposure to water and detergents – is one possibility. However, it can also be associated with fungal infections, psoriasis, thyroid issues, and, less commonly, other underlying medical conditions. Given your history, it's difficult to determine the exact cause at this time. To rule out a fungal infection, which is the most likely culprit, I'd like to order a nail culture. We'll send a small scraping from the affected nail to the lab for analysis. It will take about two weeks to get the results back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… nail culture? You're gonna grow somethin' on my nail? Sounds kinda scary. Two weeks? That's a long time to have a weird nail. Okay, fine. If you think it'll help, do it. Just… don't grow nothin' too nasty. And don't make it hurt. I don't like pain. What if it is a fungus? Do I gotta take pills? I don’t like pills either. Is it contagious? Will my grandson catch it? He helps me with the dishes sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s not growing anything, Ms. Thut. It’s simply a test to identify if a fungus is present. It's a very common test. And no, it won’t hurt. It just involves gently scraping a small portion of the nail. If it is a fungus, treatment typically involves topical antifungal medication applied directly to the nail. Oral medication is sometimes necessary for more severe cases, but we’ll discuss all options thoroughly if that becomes necessary. Fungal nail infections are generally not highly contagious, but it's always a good idea to practice good hygiene – keep your nails clean and dry, avoid sharing nail clippers, and wear sandals in public showers. Your grandson is unlikely to contract it with casual contact. We can discuss preventative measures as well. I’ll order the nail culture now. The lab technician will come in shortly to collect the sample. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Topical… that sounds better than pills. And sandals… I wear sandals. Mostly. So, a little scrape and then wait two weeks? And don’t tell me I gotta cut it off. Promise? Just… get it over with. The sooner I know, the better. And don't grow somethin' scary, okay? I have enough to worry about. And tell that lab tech to be gentle! My hands are important. Really important.
DOCTOR: I promise, Ms. Thut, we will not be cutting it off. I understand your concern, and I assure you we’ll do everything we can to determine the cause and find a suitable treatment. I'll inform the lab technician to be as gentle as possible. They should be in shortly to collect the sample. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Just… get it done. And don't grow anything. Seriously. I just wanna know what's wrong with my hands. That's all. .
