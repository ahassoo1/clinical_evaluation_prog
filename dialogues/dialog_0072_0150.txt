DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I don’t have all day, so let's just get right to it. I want to… have a baby. And I want it to be easy. I'm 51, not 80. I don’t want any… complications. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, while I appreciate your directness, achieving a successful pregnancy at your age does present… certain challenges. “Easy” is not a term I would use, frankly. However, it may be possible. First, we need to understand your medical history and current health status to determine if you are a suitable candidate for pregnancy, and what potential risks are involved. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Yes, of course I have. Once. A long time ago. It was…fine. Normal. Everything was perfectly normal. Divorced him soon after, though. Honestly, don't see why that's relevant. I'm in good health now. I ride my bicycle every day. A very long ride, I might add. Is that enough information, or do you need my life story?
DOCTOR: While your current activity level is good, a prior pregnancy decades ago doesn't necessarily indicate your current ability to carry a pregnancy to term. A great deal can change over time. To proceed, I need more specifics. Do you recall any complications during that pregnancy?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely none. I told you, it was normal. No complications, no issues, no anything. Look, I don't remember every single tiny detail from thirty years ago! Are you doubting me, Doctor? I'm a perfectly healthy woman. I eat well, I exercise...I don't smoke, I rarely drink. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I am not "doubting" you. I am attempting to gather a comprehensive medical history, as is standard practice, and absolutely crucial when considering a pregnancy at your age. Let's move on. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Look, I told you, I’m healthy. I get a yearly check-up. My doctor always says I'm in excellent condition for my age. Better than most people, frankly. High blood pressure? Diabetes? Are you serious? I don’t look like I have those problems, do I? This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your assessment of your health, a yearly check-up is not a specialized fertility evaluation. To proceed responsibly, I would need to review your medical records from your primary care physician. Do you happen to know your most recent blood pressure and cholesterol readings?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I don't just carry those numbers around with me. Why would I? I told you, my doctor says I’m fine. I don't need to be poked and prodded like some… fragile old woman. If you can't just take my word for it, maybe I should find a doctor who isn't so… skeptical. This is completely unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, with all due respect, proceeding with a pregnancy without a thorough evaluation would be… irresponsible, and potentially dangerous. Given your age, we need to assess your overall health, including cardiac function, hormone levels, and uterine health. I understand your frustration, but this isn't about skepticism; it's about ensuring your safety and maximizing your chances of a healthy pregnancy, should you be a suitable candidate. I'm going to need you to provide me with records from your primary care physician. If you are unwilling to do so, I’m afraid I cannot proceed with this consultation. It would be unethical of me to do so.
PATIENT: Unethical? You’re being unethical! Wasting my time with all these… ridiculous questions. I’ve wasted enough time here. I clearly need a doctor who isn’t going to treat me like I’m falling apart. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. I wish you the best in finding a healthcare provider who can meet your needs. Please understand that I am prioritizing your health and safety, and a comprehensive evaluation is essential. .
