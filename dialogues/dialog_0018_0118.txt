DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… I believe it’s for a… certification, of some sort? Honestly, the paperwork these days is just dreadful. I’m quite sure my ex-wife handled most of the scheduling, and I rarely pay attention to such things. It has something to do with… keeping my license current, I suppose. A yearly check-up, perhaps? It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Yes, it sounds like this is a routine preventative health exam, often required for professional licenses. No need to worry about the paperwork; we can sort through it. It’s quite common for these things to be a bit confusing. To begin, let’s go over your medical history. Have you seen a primary care physician regularly in the past?
PATIENT: A primary care physician… Hmm. Not regularly, no. I’ve always been a rather… robust individual. I rarely find the need to bother doctors unless absolutely necessary. A touch of the flu now and then, perhaps. But a regular physician? No. I usually just self-treat, to be frank. I find most of them… overly cautious. And expensive, naturally.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many people are quite capable of managing minor ailments themselves. However, regular check-ups can help identify potential issues before they become serious, even in robust individuals. Since you haven’t seen a physician regularly, let’s start with a comprehensive history. Could you tell me about any significant past medical problems you have experienced, even if you self-treated them?
PATIENT: Significant problems… Well, now that you mention it, I had a rather nasty bout of… something in my shoulder, oh, twenty years ago? Perhaps more. I just slept it off, mostly. Used a bit of heat, you know. Liniment. Can’t recall the specific diagnosis. The local chiropractor said it was… misalignment, I believe. He cracked it a few times, and it cleared up. And… there was a touch of the shingles, a few years back. But that wasn't significant. Just a bit of a rash. I applied some ointment. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for dwelling on ailments. It’s all rather… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand. Shoulder pain addressed by a chiropractor twenty years ago, and shingles treated with ointment a few years back. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t believe so. Absolutely not. I’ve always prided myself on avoiding such… invasive procedures. Too risky, in my opinion. Hospitals… well, I was briefly admitted once, many years ago, when my son was born. But it was a perfectly normal delivery, thankfully. No complications. I was mostly just there for moral support, naturally. My ex-wife… she did the majority of the work. I’m not one for… medical details.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, and a brief hospital stay for your son’s birth. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother… she had a touch of arthritis, I believe. Mostly in her hands. She used a lot of creams, and complained frequently. My father… he was a very stoic man. Never spoke much about his health. I think he had high blood pressure, eventually. But he never went to the doctor, so it’s difficult to say for certain. My sister… she had a bit of trouble with her stomach, years ago. But I haven’t seen her in decades. Honestly, Doctor, we weren’t a particularly close family. Medical history is… rather hazy. I wouldn’t rely on my recollections, if I were you.
DOCTOR: I understand. Arthritis in your mother, potential high blood pressure in your father, and some stomach issues in your sister. It’s helpful to have what information we do have. Now, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I’m retired, of course. Used to be an engineer, quite a stressful job, actually. Now, I spend most of my time… tending to my garden. It’s quite relaxing. And I do a bit of reading. History, mostly. I don’t really… socialize much. Prefer my own company, to be frank. I eat… reasonably well. Nothing extravagant. And I generally get enough sleep. It’s a quiet life, Doctor. A very quiet life. And I prefer it that way.
DOCTOR: That sounds very peaceful, Mr. Oriley. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Absolutely not. Never have. Never will. A dreadful habit, if you ask me. And completely unnecessary. I’ve always considered myself a man of… moderation. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, mind you. A good Cabernet Sauvignon. But smoking… simply out of the question. A barbaric practice.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you drink alcohol regularly, more than occasionally?
PATIENT: Regularly… well, let’s say a few glasses a week. Perhaps three or four. Occasionally five, if it’s a particularly… stressful week. Gardening can be surprisingly demanding, you know. But it’s never excessive, Doctor. I assure you. I maintain complete control. It’s merely a… social lubricant. And a pleasant accompaniment to a good meal. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being open with me, Mr. Oriley. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I once had a bit of a rash after using a particular brand of fertilizer, but I suspect it was just… irritation. And I avoid shellfish, purely out of personal preference. No, I don’t believe I have any true allergies. I’m quite resilient, Doctor. A remarkably robust constitution, as I mentioned earlier. No, allergies are not something I worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. That gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your general physical condition. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Well, I suppose. I’m not particularly fond of being poked and prodded, to be frank. But if it’s necessary for this… certification, then I suppose I can endure it. Just please be… gentle, Doctor. And as efficient as possible. I have a rather delicate constitution, as I’ve mentioned. And I do have a rather important gardening project to attend to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. We’ll take it at your pace. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Your blood pressure is 148 over 88. That’s a bit elevated. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but there’s some diminished breath sounds at the bases. Now, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat… Ears appear clear, nasal passages are slightly congested. Throat looks a bit dry. Finally, I’ll just palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper right quadrant. Alright, Mr. Oriley, that concludes the brief physical exam. We'll discuss the findings in a moment.
PATIENT: Tender in the upper right quadrant… That doesn't sound particularly good, does it? I do occasionally get a bit of indigestion, mind you. Perhaps that's what you're feeling. Gardening can be surprisingly strenuous. Is it something serious, Doctor? I trust it's nothing that requires… invasive procedures? I’m rather averse to hospitals, as you know.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you brought that up, Mr. Oriley. Tenderness in the upper right quadrant can indicate a few things. It could be something as simple as indigestion, as you mentioned, or muscle strain from gardening. However, it could also indicate a problem with your gallbladder or liver. Given your elevated blood pressure and the tenderness, I’d like to order a few blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. These tests will check your liver function, gallbladder function, and cholesterol levels. We’ll also do a complete blood count to check your overall health. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Of course. It figures. Just what I needed. More poking and prodding. And waiting for results. Honestly, Doctor, the modern medical system is such a… trial. Very well. If it’s absolutely necessary for this certification, then I suppose I have no choice. But please, assure me these tests won’t take too long. And are they… painful? I’m not one for needles, you see. And I do have a rather important rose bush that requires my attention. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Fasting, perhaps? The thought is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Oriley. I assure you, the blood tests are relatively quick and the discomfort is minimal. It’s just a brief pinch, and then it’s over. Yes, for the most accurate results, we will need you to fast for 12 hours before the tests. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We’ll schedule the tests for tomorrow morning, so you can fast overnight. The tests will take about 30 minutes, and we should have the results back within a week. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water and avoiding any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions about the tests or the fasting requirements?
PATIENT: Fasting for 12 hours… A week for the results… This is… quite inconvenient, to say the least. My rose bushes will be terribly neglected. And I do rely on a hearty breakfast to fuel my gardening efforts. Very well. I suppose I can endure it. But please, assure me this is the only further inconvenience required. I’m not one for prolonged medical procedures, you see. And I do have a rather busy schedule. Now, about this certification… Will these tests guarantee I receive it? Or are there further hurdles I must overcome? I trust you haven’t forgotten the reason I’m here, Doctor. It’s rather important, you see. My livelihood depends on it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Oriley. And no, I haven't forgotten why you're here. The tests are primarily to ensure there are no underlying medical issues that could affect your ability to continue your profession. These tests, along with a review of your medical history, should be sufficient for the certification process, provided the results are within normal limits. I will review the results carefully and discuss them with you thoroughly. If everything checks out, I will complete the necessary paperwork to certify your health. However, I must be transparent: if the tests reveal a significant medical problem, further investigation or treatment may be required before certification can be granted. But let's remain optimistic, and hope for the best. Do you have any other concerns I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Significant medical problem… That’s… not what I wanted to hear, Doctor. Not at all. I’m quite healthy, you see. At least, I was. Until this… ordeal. Very well. I suppose I have no choice but to proceed with the tests. But please, assure me you’ll expedite the results as much as possible. My rose bushes are counting on me. And my livelihood, of course. Now, about scheduling these tests… What time tomorrow morning should I arrive? And will I need to bring anything with me? Identification, perhaps? I trust this won’t be a lengthy process. I have a rather busy schedule, you see. And I do have a reputation to maintain. A gardener must be punctual, you know. It’s a matter of professional pride.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. I will do my best to expedite the results. We'll schedule the tests for 8:00 am tomorrow morning. Please arrive 15 minutes early to complete some paperwork. Yes, please bring a valid photo ID and your insurance card. The process should take about an hour, including the blood draw and a brief wait time. You can eat and drink as normal until midnight tonight, and then fast until after the tests tomorrow. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: Midnight tonight… Very well. 8:00 am tomorrow morning. Photo ID. Insurance card. Fast until after the tests. I believe that covers everything. Unless… will I be able to drive myself home afterwards? I trust the blood draw won’t leave me feeling… incapacitated? I do have a rather long drive, you see. And I do pride myself on being a safe driver. A gardener must be alert at all times, you know. It’s a matter of responsibility. Now, if you’ll excuse me, Doctor, I believe I should return home and prepare for this… ordeal. Thank you for your time. And please, do your best to expedite those results. My rose bushes are counting on you. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. You should be perfectly safe to drive yourself home after the tests. The blood draw typically causes minimal discomfort, and you’ll be able to resume your normal activities immediately afterwards. I will do my best to expedite the results. If you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Thank you for coming in today, and I wish you a good evening.
