DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I received a communication from your office regarding some… paperwork. My husband insisted I come. He’s become quite insistent on these things lately, you see. It has to do with… what happens if one is unable to… manage one’s affairs. An Advance Directive, I believe it was called? Honestly, the whole thing feels rather morbid, but he’s quite worked up about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here that we sent out some information regarding Advance Directives – also sometimes called a living will or healthcare proxy. It's very responsible of your husband to be thinking ahead, even if it doesn’t feel comfortable. It’s not about anticipating anything negative, but about making sure your wishes are known should you ever be unable to communicate them yourself. So, to clarify, you’re here today to discuss completing this paperwork, and perhaps understand it a bit better?
PATIENT: Precisely. He’s been going on about ‘wishes’ and ‘quality of life’ and… frankly, it’s all a bit dramatic. I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions, thank you very much. But he’s a bit… excitable. I suppose I’m here to satisfy him, mostly. Though I do wish he hadn’t scheduled it during my grading period. Is this a lengthy process? I have essays to return, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you’re being a good sport, and I appreciate you taking the time to come in despite your grading commitments. It doesn't need to be lengthy at all. We can go through the basics, discuss your general preferences, and if you’re comfortable, start filling out the form. If not, we can take things slowly. Before we dive into the paperwork itself, perhaps we can just talk a little bit about what's important to you when it comes to your health and well-being. Have you given any thought to what kind of medical care you would or wouldn’t want in a serious illness?
PATIENT: Serious illness… Honestly, Doctor, I try not to. It’s… unpleasant to dwell on. I suppose… I’ve always believed in allowing nature to take its course. I don’t want to be… prolonged unnecessarily. No heroic measures, if you understand. I’ve seen what those can entail. And I certainly don’t want to be a burden. But beyond that… I haven’t given it much thought. My husband, of course, has very strong opinions on everything. And they rarely align with my own. He's very fond of… aggressive intervention. Which, frankly, I find barbaric.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very common to avoid thinking about these difficult scenarios. And it sounds like you have a clear sense of what you want, even if it differs from your husband’s views. “Allowing nature to take its course” and avoiding “heroic measures” – that's a good starting point. It sounds like you prioritize comfort and dignity. To be more specific, and just to document everything accurately, when you say “heroic measures,” are you thinking about things like mechanical ventilation , CPR, or feeding tubes?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you quizzing me? I am a professor of literature, not a physician. I know of these things, naturally. But I haven’t precisely researched the nuances of each procedure. Mechanical ventilation… yes, that sounds unpleasant. And CPR… I’ve seen it in films. Rather… disruptive, wouldn’t you say? And feeding tubes… well, that sounds… undignified. I suppose, yes, all of those. I simply don't want to be kept alive artificially if there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. Is that clear enough? I find this rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Marija. I apologize if I came across as quizzing you. It's simply my responsibility to ensure I understand your wishes as completely as possible, and to document them accurately. There are many different levels of intervention, and terminology can be confusing. I'm just trying to be thorough. So, to summarize: you would not want mechanical ventilation, CPR, or artificial feeding if there's no reasonable hope of recovery. That’s very helpful. Now, let's think about who you would want to make medical decisions for you if you were unable to do so yourself. Your husband, I presume?
PATIENT: Naturally. Though I suspect he’ll simply impose his own will, regardless of my… stated preferences. He’s quite… determined. He already has a list of specialists he’s consulted, and procedures he’s researched. It’s rather overwhelming, frankly. But yes, he is my husband. And legally, I suppose, he would be the one. Though I do wish he’d listen to me for once. He tends to… dominate the conversation. And he’s quite fond of second opinions. Endless second opinions. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you anticipate some challenges in ensuring your wishes are respected. That’s valuable information to know. We can certainly document your preferences very clearly in the Advance Directive, and I can also make a note in your chart about your concerns regarding your husband’s tendency to seek multiple opinions and potentially override your wishes. We can also discuss the possibility of including a statement in the document that specifically emphasizes your autonomy and the importance of respecting your values. Would that be something you’d be comfortable with?
PATIENT: That… that is a rather sensible suggestion, Doctor. A statement emphasizing my autonomy… yes, that might be helpful. He tends to dismiss my concerns as… “emotional” or “irrational.” A formal statement might… lend some weight to my opinions. Though I doubt it will sway him entirely. He’s remarkably… steadfast in his beliefs. But it’s worth a try, I suppose. Anything to avoid a protracted argument. Yes, please include that. A statement emphasizing my autonomy. And perhaps something about the importance of… respecting my quality of life? He tends to focus solely on extending it, regardless of… circumstances.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can absolutely include a statement emphasizing your autonomy and the importance of respecting your quality of life. I'm documenting that now. It's important to remember that this document is ultimately about your values and preferences, and we want to make sure it reflects that as clearly as possible. Now, let’s talk about the specific form itself. It’s a fairly straightforward document, but it does require some careful consideration. It asks you to identify what types of medical treatments you would or would not want in various scenarios. Would you like me to walk you through it section by section, or would you prefer to read it over on your own first?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’d rather get this over with. The sooner it’s done, the better. I have essays to grade, you see. Walk me through it, please. Quickly. I trust you know what all the… medical jargon means. Just… try to be concise. And please, don’t dwell on the gruesome details. I have a rather sensitive disposition.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll be as concise as possible and avoid any unnecessary details. The form is divided into several sections. The first concerns life-sustaining treatment – things like mechanical ventilation, CPR, and dialysis. As we discussed, you've indicated you would not want these if there’s no reasonable hope of recovery. We’ll document that clearly. The next section concerns artificial nutrition and hydration – feeding tubes and IV fluids. You also expressed reservations about these. Are you comfortable with specifying that you would not want these under similar circumstances?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Absolutely not. No tubes. No fluids. I do not want to be… sustained artificially. It’s undignified, Doctor. And frankly, rather unpleasant to contemplate. Just… get it over with. I’m starting to feel quite faint. All this talk of medical procedures… it’s rather unsettling. Is there a summary of this document I can review afterwards? Just to be certain everything is… accurate? My husband will undoubtedly scrutinize every word.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. We'll move as quickly as possible. I'm documenting your wishes regarding artificial nutrition and hydration now. And yes, absolutely, there is a summary of the document you can review afterwards. We can also provide you with a copy of the completed form for your records. The next section concerns pain management. It asks you to specify your preferences regarding pain relief. Do you have any specific wishes in that regard?
PATIENT: Pain management… Well, naturally, I’d like to be comfortable. Is that even a question? I do not wish to suffer needlessly. But I also don’t want to be… sedated into oblivion. A reasonable level of comfort, yes. But I want to be… aware. I want to be able to… converse with my loved ones, should the occasion arise. No excessive medication, please. Just… sufficient to alleviate the discomfort. Is that clear enough? Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… morbid. Perhaps I should have stayed home and graded essays.
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Marija. We’ll document that you want to be kept comfortable, but remain aware and able to converse with loved ones. We'll specify a preference for avoiding excessive medication. The final section concerns your healthcare proxy – the person you’ve designated to make medical decisions for you if you’re unable to do so yourself. We’ve already established that’s your husband. It simply asks for his contact information, which we already have on file. So, that’s essentially it. I’m finishing up the documentation now. It will take just a few moments to print a summary for you to review, and a copy of the complete form. Do you have any immediate questions before I do that?
PATIENT: No, no immediate questions. Just… hurry, please. I have a mountain of essays awaiting my attention. And I fully expect my husband to… revise everything. He’s remarkably opinionated, you see. But at least this is… done. I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. Though I confess, I found the entire experience… rather unpleasant. But necessary, I suppose. Just… let me have the summary. And the form. The sooner I can escape, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's the summary of your Advance Directive, and a complete copy of the form. Please review them at your leisure. As you can see, everything is documented according to your wishes. I understand you found the experience unpleasant, and I apologize for any distress it caused. However, I'm glad we were able to complete this important step in ensuring your healthcare preferences are respected. If you have any questions or concerns after reviewing the documents, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. And remember, this is your document, and you have the right to revise it at any time. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Thank you, Doctor. Though I doubt my husband will be satisfied. He always has… more opinions. But at least this is… done. Goodbye. .
