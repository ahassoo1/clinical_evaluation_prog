DOCTOR: Alright, Jase. Have a seat. Twenty years old, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Twenty. It feels…weird to be saying that sometimes, like it doesn't quite fit.
DOCTOR: Age is just a number. Though, typically at twenty, people are generally…healthier. So, let’s get down to business. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, um…it’s my stomach. It’s been…well, a lot of going to the bathroom. Like, a lot. And it’s been going on for a bit now. I…I think I read something about it being connected to something I have, but I can't really remember what it was. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: "A lot" isn't particularly helpful, Jase. We need specifics. How many times are we talking?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics…right. Okay, um…most days, at least six, maybe more? It’s hard to keep track, honestly. Sometimes it feels like…every hour? And it’s not just…normal, you know? It’s…watery. And I get cramps, too. It's been like this for a few weeks, I think? Maybe longer? It all kind of blends together.
DOCTOR: A few weeks of frequent, watery stools… and cramps. Right. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. I don’t think so? I haven’t taken my temperature or anything, but I don't feel hot. I mean, sometimes I feel a little tired, but that could just be…everything, you know? I don’t usually get fevers.
DOCTOR: "Feeling tired" is exceptionally vague. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… That's…a little embarrassing to talk about. I…think so, yeah. A little. Not like, a lot, but…sometimes. It’s usually just a tiny bit, but it’s enough to…notice. I just try not to think about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood in the stool… and frequent watery bowel movements. Have you experienced any weight loss recently, Jase?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t really been trying to lose weight, if that’s what you mean. I guess my clothes feel a little looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself lately. My husband usually does the cooking, so I don't pay much attention to portion sizes. It could just be… I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Um…just my birth control pills. And…sometimes I take something for headaches, if they're really bad. Just over-the-counter stuff though, like ibuprofen. Nothing regular, really. Oh, and I take a daily multivitamin, I think? My mom always told me to. I don't always remember, though. Sorry, I'm not very good at keeping track of things.
DOCTOR: Birth control, occasional ibuprofen, and a sporadically taken multivitamin. Now, let's talk family history. Any history of inflammatory bowel disease – Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis – in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. Family history… I…think my grandma on my dad's side had something with her stomach? But I don't really know what it was. My parents never really talked about it. It was…a long time ago. And I don’t really know anything about my mom’s side of the family, to be honest. They live back in Pakistan, and we don’t talk much. Sorry, I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: Right. Minimal family history. Now, tell me about your social habits. Do you travel often?
PATIENT: Travel? Not really. I haven’t left the country in years. We went to visit my in-laws in Florida last year, but that was it. Mostly I just…go to work and come home. And hang out with my husband. He's really good at keeping me busy. We don’t really do much…adventurous stuff, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jase. Given your symptoms – frequent watery stools, blood in your stool, weight loss – and the lack of a clear cause, I’m going to need to perform a physical exam. It will primarily involve listening to your abdomen and palpating it to check for tenderness. It's routine, but necessary. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh. Um…no, I guess not. As long as it’s…nothing too embarrassing. Is it going to hurt? I’m just…a little nervous, that’s all. I don't usually like doctors' appointments.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be painful, Jase. Though, you may feel some slight pressure. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Okay… Ooh…a little. Just…a sort of cramping feeling, on the left side. It's not bad bad, but…it’s definitely there. Is that normal? It feels a little tender.
DOCTOR: Tenderness on the left side is… noteworthy. And I'm detecting some slight guarding in that area. This could indicate inflammation. Your bowel sounds are… hyperactive. Given these initial findings, I'm concerned about the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease. However, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We'll need to run some tests. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample analysis to check for infection and inflammation. We’ll also need to order a colonoscopy to visualize your colon. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Oh… wow. Um… what exactly is a colonoscopy? And… is it going to be… unpleasant? I’ve heard stories… Is it really necessary? I mean, could we try something else first?
DOCTOR: A colonoscopy is a procedure where a long, flexible tube with a camera attached is inserted into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It’s the gold standard for diagnosing inflammatory bowel disease. It’s necessary to rule out more serious conditions and to determine the extent of any inflammation. Yes, there is preparation involved – you’ll need to cleanse your colon beforehand. And it’s not entirely comfortable, I won't lie. You will be sedated, however. As for trying something else first…we could try a trial of medication, but without knowing the underlying cause, it’s simply treating the symptoms, not the problem. It's inefficient and potentially dangerous. I strongly recommend proceeding with the colonoscopy. I’ll refer you to Dr. Amin, a gastroenterologist at St. Jude’s Hospital. He’s excellent. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh… wow. That sounds… a lot. Um… I don't think so? I haven't had any bad reactions to anything before, as far as I know. But… my husband does say I sometimes get a little itchy after taking ibuprofen? But it's not a full-blown rash or anything, just… a little uncomfortable. Is that something I should worry about? And… what if they find something bad?
DOCTOR: Mild itching after ibuprofen is… unlikely to be a major concern, but it’s worth noting. We’ll make a note of it. As for finding something “bad”… that's precisely the purpose of the colonoscopy. It allows us to identify the source of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan. Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic condition, but it’s manageable with proper care. I'll provide you with a referral to Dr. Amin, along with instructions for the bowel preparation. You'll need to schedule the procedure as soon as possible. Do you have any questions about the referral process?
PATIENT: I… I think I need a minute. It’s just… a lot to take in. A chronic condition… bowel preparation… colonoscopy… I don't even know where to begin. Could… could my husband come with me to the appointment with Dr. Amin? I think I’ll need someone with me.
DOCTOR: Of course. Your husband is welcome to accompany you. It is often beneficial to have support. I will have the nurse provide you with the referral information and the appointment details. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
