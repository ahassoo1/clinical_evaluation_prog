DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 80 years old. Welcome to the clinic. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, eighty… something like that. Time… it goes, you know? Well, it’s my chest. Hurts when I… when I take a big breath. Not all the time, just when I try to fill my lungs. It's been happening for a little while now, I guess. I don't really keep track of things so well these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Hurts when you take a big breath.” Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it? It’s… like a tightness. A squeezing. Not sharp, not really. Just… uncomfortable. Like something’s blocking the air. It doesn’t last long, just when I breathe deep. Does that make any sense? I’m not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It’s… helpful. And it’s alright if it’s difficult to explain. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Now, has this discomfort been getting worse, better, or staying about the same?
PATIENT: Worse… I think so. It used to be just when I was doing something, like… carrying wood. Now it happens even when I’m just sitting. Not all the time, mind you. But more often, I think. It’s hard to say for sure. Everything feels a little… foggy these days. I apologize. I'm not the easiest patient.
DOCTOR: It's acceptable. We will proceed systematically. Now, Mr. Ruocco, do you have any other symptoms accompanying this chest discomfort?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Let me see… I get a little… winded, sometimes. Easier than it used to be to get tired. And… I cough a little. Not a bad cough, just… a tickle. Mostly in the mornings. I don’t think that’s related, though. Old man stuff, probably. I haven’t been sick or anything. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cough, shortness of breath… and this chest discomfort. Have you ever smoked, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Smoked? Oh, yes. Years ago. When I was young and foolish. A long time ago, though. Stopped… oh, goodness, fifty years ago maybe? More? It was a long time ago. Not since I was married, I think. I don't remember exactly. It wasn’t a lot, though. A pack a day, maybe. For a few years.
DOCTOR: And have you ever been exposed to a lot of dust or fumes at work, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Dust? Oh, yes. Construction, you know. A lot of dust. And… fumes. Cement, paint… all sorts of things. For many years. That was my job. Construction Manager. Always breathing in something. Didn’t think much about it then. You get used to it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… Heart… the doctor told me my heart was a little… big, once. A long time ago. Nothing serious, he said. Just… bigger than normal. I don’t remember what he called it. And… I had some trouble with my blood sugar a few years back, but it went away. It wasn’t anything… serious, either. I don't really go to the doctor much. Never really needed to. Until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Do you take any medications currently, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Medications? No, not really. Just… some pills for my knees, sometimes. When they really bother me. But I don’t take them all the time. They don’t really do much, anyway. Mostly I just try to take it easy. And some ointment for my skin. That’s it, I think. Nothing important. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, and perhaps check your oxygen levels. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. It’s just… I don’t like being poked and prodded too much. But if it will help, go ahead. I just want this… tightness to go away. It's unsettling.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Breath sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, with some scattered wheezes. Heart rate is regular, but slightly tachycardic. No obvious murmurs. Your oxygen saturation is 92%. That's on the lower end of normal. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that bad? The oxygen thing? I get a little… anxious at the doctor sometimes. It makes it hard to breathe, I think. Maybe that’s why it’s low? I don’t know. It’s just… unsettling, all this poking and prodding. Do you think it's serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 98. The oxygen is a little low, and your pulse is slightly elevated, which could be due to anxiety, but we need to investigate further. Now, Mr. Ruocco, I would like to order a chest X-ray and a blood test to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood test… Oh dear. That sounds… serious. What are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something bad? I don’t like hospitals. Or tests. It makes me nervous just thinking about it. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose. Just… please be quick. And don’t poke too much.
DOCTOR: The X-ray will help us see if there’s anything going on in your lungs, like pneumonia or fluid buildup. The blood test will check for infection and assess your overall health. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Ruocco, and it will help us determine the best course of action. It’s not necessarily serious, but it’s important to rule out anything concerning. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Then, you can go to the radiology department for the X-ray. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Radiology… I suppose not. Just… how long will it take? I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things. And will it hurt? The blood test, I mean. I bruise easily, you know. Old man stuff. Please be gentle. And… will you explain the results to me when you have them? I don’t understand all the medical talk.
DOCTOR: The blood draw should only take a few minutes, and the X-ray won't take long either, perhaps another ten to fifteen minutes. I will personally explain the results to you in plain language when they are available. I understand medical jargon can be confusing. We will go through everything slowly and ensure you understand what's going on. The nurse will come in shortly. In the meantime, try to relax. And I assure you, we will proceed as gently as possible. Do you have anyone who can accompany you to the radiology department?
PATIENT: No… no one. My wife… she passed a long time ago. And my children… they live far away. I usually do things on my own. It’s alright. I’m used to it. Just… try not to poke too much, alright? And thank you, Doctor. For being patient with an old man. I think that’s all for now. I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Ruocco. The nurse will be with you shortly. I will review the results as soon as they are available and will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, or a high fever – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. He's very independent, and likely anxious. A thorough explanation of the results will be crucial.
