DOCTOR: Good morning, Jacquille. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Jacquille Belan. Look, I just... I wanted to get tested for, you know, the thing. HIV. My wife and I… well, it’s just a precaution, really. I like to be on top of these things, make sure everything’s alright. Not that I expect anything to be wrong, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jacquille, that’s very responsible of you to get tested, even as a precaution. It's always good to be proactive about your health. Just to clarify, you and your wife are sexually active, and you'd like an HIV test as a routine check?
PATIENT: Routine? Well, yes, I suppose. It’s not like I’m the one who… needs it, if you understand. My wife... she's just been around a lot of people, let’s put it that way. Before me, naturally. It’s just sensible to make sure, isn’t it? For everyone’s peace of mind. I wouldn’t want to be that guy, finding out later. You know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jacquille. It's perfectly reasonable to want to be sure, and it's good you're thinking about this proactively for both your and your wife's health. So, to get a better understanding, has either of you had any recent illnesses, like a fever, rash, or flu-like symptoms?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Not recently. My wife… she gets colds sometimes, but nothing serious. She's a bit dramatic, honestly. Always complaining. But no fevers, no rashes. I’ve been perfectly fine, thank you very much. Always been healthy, I am. Good genes, you know? And I eat well. Mostly. It’s my wife who… well, never mind. Nothing for you to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No recent illnesses is helpful to know. And you feel generally healthy overall?
PATIENT: Perfectly. Absolutely top-notch. I exercise, I don't smoke, I only drink occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. My wife… she doesn’t look after herself as well as she should, to be honest. But I am fine. Very robust. I assure you, Doctor. This is probably a waste of your time, but my wife insisted. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jacquille. It's still good to rule things out, even if you feel perfectly healthy. Now, have you ever had any previous STD screenings or tests?
PATIENT: STD screenings? Look, I'm a married man. I've been with my wife for ten years. I haven’t needed to worry about those things. Honestly, the implication… it’s a little insulting. But, fine. Years ago, before my wife, yes. A basic checkup, just to be safe. Everything was clear, naturally. I don’t go around… doing things, if that's what you're asking. This is all a bit unnecessary, frankly.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question came across as insensitive, Jacquille. It's standard procedure to ask about previous screenings as part of a comprehensive assessment. You said you had a basic checkup years ago and everything was clear - do you recall when that was, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Hmm... let me think. It was... before we were married. So, at least twelve years ago. Maybe fifteen? I'm not exactly good with dates. It was just a standard thing, the doctor recommended it. A little blood test, nothing major. Everything came back negative, as I said. I remember being a bit annoyed, honestly. A waste of a Saturday morning. But my wife is… meticulous. She keeps track of everything. She’d know the exact date if you asked her. She has a file for everything, I swear.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And just to confirm, you've been exclusively with your wife for the past twelve years?
PATIENT: Exclusively? Yes. Absolutely. Look, I’m a loyal husband. I don’t go… gallivanting around. My wife might have had… a more interesting past, but I haven’t. I assure you. This whole conversation is making me uncomfortable, to be honest. I came in for a test, not a… interrogation. I just want to get it over with and prove everything's alright. For her, mostly. She's the anxious one.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Jacquille, and I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. I assure you, I'm just gathering information to ensure we do a thorough assessment. To move forward, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to any medications or substances?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Perfectly healthy, remember? And allergies… hmm. I get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s it. Nothing serious. No reactions to any drugs or anything. My wife is allergic to shellfish, but that’s her problem, not mine. Honestly, Doctor, is this test going to take all day? I have things to do. I just want a quick result. Preferably negative. It will save a lot of… bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or significant allergies. That’s good to know. Alright, let's proceed with the HIV test then. We'll need a blood sample. It will only take a few minutes. While we’re waiting for the results, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. The quicker this is over, the better. Blood test, heart and lungs… just get it done. I have a perfectly healthy heart and lungs, I assure you. Probably better than most people’s. And it’s all going to be negative, anyway. This is a complete waste of my time, but my wife… well, you know. Let’s just get on with it. I don't want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jacquille. Please have a seat on the examination table. Alright, I'm just going to take a quick listen to your heart and lungs now. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Very good. Everything sounds clear so far. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'll just need to draw a small blood sample. It will be a quick pinch.
PATIENT: Pinch? A pinch? Honestly, Doctor. I’m not afraid of a little needle, you know. I’ve had worse. Just… get it over with. And try to be quick about it. I don’t enjoy sitting here having my insides examined. It's all a bit unnecessary, really. And it's going to be negative, I’m telling you. Completely and utterly negative. My wife just worries too much. She's a bit of a hypochondriac, if I’m honest. Now, hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jacquille, just relax your arm for me. You might feel a brief sting. Alright, almost done… There you go. All finished. Hold that pressure for a few minutes to stop any bleeding. Now, we'll send this sample to the lab, and the results should be available within a few business days. We will contact you as soon as they are in. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Few business days? Seriously? That’s… unacceptable. Can’t you do it quicker? I have things to do. But… fine. Few business days. I suppose I’ll have to wait. No, I don't have any questions. Just… tell my wife it's negative. Even if it isn't. It will save a lot of trouble. Honestly, the whole thing is a ridiculous overreaction. A waste of everyone’s time. But she insisted. Now, can I go? I have better things to do than sit around waiting for lab results. A perfectly healthy man doesn’t need a test, you know. But… fine. I’m going. Just… call me with the “negative” result, alright? Goodbye, Doctor.
