DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been having some pain… down there. In, you know… that area. It's been going on for a little while now, but it’s gotten worse recently. I’m not quite sure what’s causing it, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if it's difficult to explain. We'll take our time and figure things out. “Down there,” as you say – could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me see. It's… a dull ache, mostly. But sometimes it feels… sharp. Like a sudden twinge. It’s not constant, thankfully. It comes and goes. And… it seems to be worse after I’ve been… working. With the wood, you know? I do a lot of bending and lifting… although, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Was I saying something specific? I get lost sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly fine, Ms. Stepbro. It's alright to get sidetracked – we can always circle back. A dull ache with sharp twinges that worsens with work – bending and lifting, specifically. That's helpful information. To clarify, when you say “work,” are you referring to a specific occupation or hobby involving woodworking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Woodworking. I… I make things. Furniture, mostly. Small tables, chairs… sometimes I try bigger projects, but… well, it's hard work. I have a little workshop behind my house. It keeps me busy, at least. And… I sell things at the market sometimes. Though I don't remember when exactly anymore. It all feels a bit… jumbled. I’m sorry if I’m not being very clear.
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly clear, Ms. Stepbro. It sounds like you're quite active. And don't apologize – it's very common for things to feel a bit jumbled sometimes. Let's focus on the pain for now. You mentioned it worsens with bending and lifting. Does anything else specifically trigger the pain, or does anything relieve it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don’t think anything specifically triggers it, other than the work. But… lying down seems to help. When I rest, it’s not as bad. And… a warm bath sometimes. That takes the edge off. But it doesn’t last long. It comes back. Oh, and… I haven’t noticed any… swelling, if that’s what you’re asking. At least, not that I've noticed. I really don’t pay much attention to things like that, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to know – lying down and a warm bath offer some relief. No swelling noted. Now, let’s move on to some other questions to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel or bladder habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Bowel… or bladder? I… I’m not quite sure. Let me think. Everything seems normal, I suppose. I haven’t noticed anything… different. It's hard to explain. I don't spend a lot of time thinking about those things, if you understand. I go when I need to, and that's about it. No pain during those times, if that matters. I really don’t know what you’re looking for, Doctor. I apologize.
DOCTOR: You're not apologizing for anything, Ms. Stepbro. It's perfectly alright. I understand that these questions can be a bit personal and perhaps uncomfortable. “Seems normal” is very helpful information. Now, have you noticed any unusual vaginal discharge or bleeding?
PATIENT: Oh… that kind of question? I… well, I am single. It's been… a long time since… any of that. So, no. No unusual discharge or bleeding. Not at all. I… I haven’t had… a reason to notice, if you understand. Is this… normal for this sort of thing? I mean, to ask about… those things? I am a bit confused.
DOCTOR: It is normal, Ms. Stepbro. I ask these questions to get a complete picture of your health, and it’s important to consider all possibilities. Thank you for answering honestly. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… that's a tough one. My memory… it's just not what it used to be. I think… I had the flu a few times, as a child. And… I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. But… serious illnesses? Not that I recall. I went to the doctor regularly when I was younger, but… I don’t remember what they told me. And honestly, I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I have Medicare, but I mostly just use it for… check-ups. I don’t think I’ve ever been hospitalized. Does that help? I’m really trying to remember, but it's like… a fog.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Stepbro. It's very common for details to be forgotten over time, especially if it's been a long time. Flu as a child, a broken arm – that's helpful. No hospitalizations. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I don't think so. No, I'm quite certain I haven't had any surgeries. I… I would remember something like that, wouldn't I? It feels like I would. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. A few aches and pains, as you get older, of course, but nothing… serious enough for surgery. No, I’m pretty sure I haven’t had any surgeries. Although… perhaps I should ask my sister? She remembers everything. But she lives far away. I am not sure she would be able to help.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Stepbro. No surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… is there any history of similar pain or any medical conditions like cancer, heart disease, or arthritis in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me think. My mother… she had arthritis, I believe. In her hands, mostly. It bothered her a lot, especially in the cold weather. And… my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had… something with his heart, I think. He died when I was very young, so I don’t remember the details. As for cancer… I don't recall anyone having cancer, specifically. But… my aunt… she was always very sick. I don't know what she had, but she passed away quite young. It was a long time ago. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It's all a bit blurry, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stepbro. Arthritis in your mother, heart condition in your grandfather, and an aunt who was ill – that's helpful information. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no. I do not smoke. Never have. It's terrible for you, you know. And… I rarely drink alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, very occasionally. And… absolutely not, I do not use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I’m a simple woman, Doctor. I keep to myself, mostly. I enjoy my woodworking, and… I try to stay healthy. That’s all. I do not partake in any of those things.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear, Ms. Stepbro. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. No, I haven’t ever had a reaction to any medications. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times, for infections, and… I’ve taken pain relievers when I’ve had a headache, but nothing… serious. And… I can eat all sorts of foods, thankfully. No food allergies that I’m aware of. I don't have any allergies to animals or anything like that either. No, I'm pretty sure I don't have any allergies. Thankfully. Is that everything, Doctor? I hope I haven't been too much trouble.
DOCTOR: No, you haven't been any trouble at all, Ms. Stepbro. In fact, you've been very helpful. Thank you for answering all of my questions so thoroughly. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be causing your pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. A physical examination sounds… fine. Although, I do get a bit nervous, if I'm honest. But I trust you. Please, go ahead. I hope you can find out what's causing this pain. It's been bothering me more and more lately. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stepbro. We'll take things slowly and gently. I’ll explain everything as I go along. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Now, I’m going to need to do a pelvic exam to assess the source of your pain. I will explain each step as I go along, and please let me know if you experience any discomfort. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a pelvic exam? I… I haven’t had one of those in a very long time. It sounds… a bit uncomfortable, if I’m honest. But… if you think it’s necessary, then yes, I suppose. Please… be gentle, Doctor. And… explain everything, as you said. I am a bit nervous, you see. I trust you, but… it's still a bit daunting. Take your time. And… perhaps tell me what you’re looking for? That might help me relax a bit.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stepbro. I completely understand your apprehension. We will take things very slowly and gently, and I will explain each step as we go along. I am looking for any signs of inflammation, tenderness, or abnormalities in your reproductive organs that could be causing your pain. External genitalia appears normal. Speculum examination reveals no visible lesions or discharge. Cervix is closed and without obvious abnormalities. Uterus is normal in size and position, without palpable masses. Adnexa are normal to palpation bilaterally, without tenderness. The exam was well-tolerated, Ms. Stepbro. I didn't find any obvious signs of infection, masses, or abnormalities. However, there is some mild tenderness upon palpation of the lower abdominal muscles, particularly on the left side. This could be related to your woodworking activities and the strain on those muscles.
PATIENT: Oh… well, that doesn’t sound too bad, does it? Just my muscles? From the woodworking? That’s… a relief, actually. I was worried it was something… serious. But still, it is painful. And it's getting worse. What do you recommend, Doctor? Should I rest? Use a hot compress? I just want it to stop hurting. I am very grateful for your time and attention, by the way. You explained everything so well, and you were very gentle. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stepbro. I’m glad I could ease your mind. While the examination didn't reveal anything alarming, the tenderness suggests some muscular strain, likely from the repetitive motions and lifting involved in woodworking. I recommend a few things. Firstly, rest is important. Avoid strenuous activity and heavy lifting for a week or so. Secondly, apply a warm compress to the affected area for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can also help manage the pain. However, given your description of the pain and the fact that it’s worsening, I would like to order a urinalysis to rule out any potential urinary tract infection. I also recommend a complete blood count to check for signs of inflammation. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, then please, go ahead. A urinalysis and a blood count sound… fine. I trust your judgement. I just want to know what’s causing this pain, and I want it to stop. I’m willing to do whatever it takes. Where do I go for those tests? And… how long will it take to get the results? I do have an appointment with my sister next month. I would like to know what’s going on before then, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stepbro. I'll write you a requisition for both tests. You can have them done at the lab just across the street – they take walk-ins, so you shouldn't have to wait long. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or if you develop a fever, nausea, or any other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve answered all of my questions, and you’ve explained everything so well. I really appreciate your kindness and patience. It’s… reassuring to know that it’s probably just my muscles, and not something serious. I will go to the lab tomorrow and get those tests done. And I will call if anything changes. Thank you again for your time and attention. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stepbro. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day.
