DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Ivette! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's… this hiccuping. It started a couple of days ago, and it won't stop. It’s been going on for, let me see… almost three days now, I think. It’s really getting annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, almost three days of hiccups – that is annoying! Can you tell me a bit more about them?
PATIENT: Sure. They just… come and go. There doesn’t seem to be any pattern to them. I haven’t been doing anything special when they start, not that I've noticed. I was gardening on Sunday, and they started then, but I was just weeding, nothing strenuous. They happen when I'm sitting, when I'm walking, even when I'm trying to sleep! It’s just… random. And they're pretty strong, actually. Not little tiny ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, random, strong hiccups, starting after gardening… and they’re interfering with sleep, that's good to know. Have you tried anything to get rid of them so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. My daughter, Nadia, told me to hold my breath, you know? And drink water upside down. And she suggested a spoonful of sugar. Nothing works! I even tried breathing into a paper bag – she watches a lot of those online health videos. It just made me feel a bit dizzy. Honestly, I’m starting to lose hope. It’s just… relentless.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've tried holding your breath, drinking water upside down, a spoonful of sugar, and breathing into a paper bag – all good attempts! And none of those worked, and the paper bag made you dizzy. Alright. Now, besides the hiccups, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. No fever, no chest pain, no stomach trouble. I'm a little tired, but that’s probably just from not sleeping properly with all this hiccuping! I haven't noticed anything else unusual. Oh, wait… maybe a little heartburn, now that you mention it. But I get that sometimes anyway, usually if I eat something spicy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no chest pain, no stomach trouble, tiredness from lack of sleep, and a little heartburn that you sometimes experience anyway. Let's talk about that heartburn a bit more. How often do you usually get heartburn, and is it worse now with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn't say I usually get it. Maybe once a month, if I have a really spicy curry or something. And yes, it is definitely worse now. It's not constant, but it comes and goes along with the hiccups. It's a sort of burning feeling, right here… … and it doesn’t really go away with antacids, not fully. It’s just… persistent, like everything else at the moment.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the heartburn isn’t typical for you, it's happening with the hiccups, and antacids aren’t fully helping. Have you taken anything for the hiccups themselves besides what your daughter suggested?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I haven't really bothered with anything else, to be honest. I figured if those home remedies didn't work, what would? I haven't even taken anything over-the-counter. I usually try to wait things out, see if they just disappear on their own. But almost three days… it’s a long time to hiccup! It’s starting to wear me down, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, almost three days of unrelenting hiccups with accompanying heartburn that isn't responding to antacids. Before we move on, let's quickly go over some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything in the past. I don’t take any regular medication, either. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, and that’s about it. I’ve never had an allergic reaction, not even to penicillin or anything like that. I’m usually pretty healthy, to be honest. This hiccuping is just… so strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and you don’t take any regular medications. Now, have you had any previous medical conditions or surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but that was all straightforward. And I had a bad bout of bronchitis when I was younger, but that’s it. Nothing else, really. No heart problems, no diabetes, no asthma. I did have a hysterectomy when I was 40, but that was a long time ago, and it didn’t cause any long-term issues. Other than that… I'm pretty sure that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, bronchitis when you were younger, and a hysterectomy at 40 with no long-term issues. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had arthritis. My sister has some trouble with her knees, but that’s probably just age. No one in the family has ever had anything like this – not long-term hiccups, or anything with the stomach. It’s just… me, it seems. It’s a bit worrying, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and arthritis. Now, just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone now, since my divorce. I try to keep busy – gardening is my main hobby, as you know. I also volunteer at the local library a couple of times a week. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I probably should exercise more, but I haven't been very motivated lately, especially with these hiccups! I eat a fairly healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. Not a lot of processed foods.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, garden, volunteer at the library, don’t smoke, occasional glass of wine with dinner, and a generally healthy diet. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also feel your abdomen. It'll just help me rule out anything obvious. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I'm happy to do whatever you think is necessary. Go ahead, Doctor. I hope you can figure out what's going on with me! These hiccups are driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear, and there’s no tenderness when I press on your abdomen, although I do note a little bit of fullness. No significant masses or anything concerning. I'm also going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it's unlikely there’s anything serious going on, but because these hiccups are persistent and you’re experiencing heartburn, I’d like to order a few blood tests just to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it will help figure out what's causing this, then I’m happy to have some blood tests. It’s just… frustrating not knowing. So, what kind of tests are we talking about? And will they take long? I have a volunteer shift on Wednesday.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We’ll do a complete blood count to check for any infection or anemia, and we'll also check your electrolytes, as imbalances can sometimes cause hiccups. I’ll also order a test to check your liver function, just to be on the safe side given the heartburn. The tests shouldn't take long – just a quick blood draw. It’ll probably take about 15-20 minutes in the lab. And the results should be back within a couple of days, hopefully before your volunteer shift on Wednesday. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results then. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. I appreciate you being so thorough. And yes, before Wednesday would be ideal. I really don’t want these hiccups to interfere with my volunteering. Okay, let’s get the blood tests done. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall to your left. The nurse, Maria, will take care of you. She’s very efficient and will explain everything. Once the tests are done, she'll send the results to me. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and try to avoid spicy foods. If the hiccups become unbearable or you develop any new symptoms – like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or vomiting – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Kimm. I feel a bit better just knowing we’re looking into it. I’ll go find Maria now. I really hope I can get rid of these hiccups soon!
DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Ivette! You're very welcome. I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly too. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. Take care, and I'll see you soon. .
