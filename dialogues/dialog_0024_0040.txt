DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side, mostly. Comes and goes, you see. And I keep getting these… water infections, the doctor calls them. It's been happening quite a bit lately, and it's not very comfortable at all. They told me it has something to do with my kidneys, but I don't rightly understand all the details.
DOCTOR: “Kidney issues,” right. Vague, as usual. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s right. Vague is a good word, Doctor. I apologize. It’s just...well, they said something about lots of little sacs on my kidneys. Polycystic, I think? And that causes the pain and the infections. I’ve had it for a while, but it seems to be getting worse recently, which is why I thought I should come in.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease. Yes, I see that noted in your file, Mr. Espinueva. And you say the pain is recent?
PATIENT: Recent as in… the last few months, Doctor. It used to be just a dull ache now and then, easily ignored. But lately, it’s sharper, and it comes more often. And it seems to be on both sides, if that makes sense. Sometimes it’s just one side, sometimes the other, and sometimes… well, both at once. It doesn’t come every day, but when it does, it’s quite noticeable.
DOCTOR: Both sides, you say. And a change in character… that is concerning. Now, tell me, do you have any fever associated with these infections, or any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Hmm… fever, not usually, Doctor. I might feel a bit warm sometimes, but nothing I’d call a proper fever. No, no vomiting either. But I do feel… tired. More tired than usual, and a bit weak. And my appetite isn’t what it used to be, though I put that down to getting older, mostly.
DOCTOR: Weakness and loss of appetite… typical for someone your age, frankly. Now, let’s move on. Do you experience any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, that’s a good question, Doctor. Sometimes, yes. A bit of a burning sensation, you see? Not every time, but often when I have one of these… water infections. And I find myself needing to go quite frequently, even when I haven't had much to drink.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination and dysuria… consistent with a urinary tract infection, naturally. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… yes, I have. A couple of times, I’ve noticed a bit of… redness. Not a lot, mind you, just a tinge. I thought it might be something I ate, to be honest, but now that you ask, it’s probably related to these infections.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a listen and feel around. I detect some tenderness on palpation, as expected. We'll need to run some labs, confirm the infection and assess your kidney function. I'll order a urinalysis, a complete blood count, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. Also, a renal ultrasound to assess the size and state of your kidneys. The lab technician will explain the procedure. Please collect a sample first thing tomorrow morning.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Thank you. A renal ultrasound, you say? Is that… uncomfortable? I don’t mind the other tests, but I’m not very fond of machines and things, if you understand. But if it’s necessary… then I suppose I can manage. First thing in the morning, then. I’ll remember that.
DOCTOR: It’s non-invasive, Mr. Espinueva. Just a bit of gel and a probe. No discomfort whatsoever. Now, while we're awaiting the results, I want you to increase your fluid intake significantly – at least eight glasses of water a day. And avoid caffeine and alcohol. I will also prescribe a short course of antibiotics to address the current infection. Take this as directed, and finish the entire course, even if you begin to feel better. We will review the results at your follow-up appointment next week. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Eight glasses of water… that’s a lot. But I can try, Doctor. And no caffeine… that will be difficult. But I understand. Antibiotics, yes. I'll be sure to take them as directed, finish the whole course, you can be certain. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment, Doctor. Just… thank you for listening. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Follow the instructions carefully, Mr. Espinueva. And try to rest. I have other patients waiting. Good day. .
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will. Thank you again. Good day to you too.
