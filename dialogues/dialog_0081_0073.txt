DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It's my stomach. Been… well, it’s been awful. Just constantly running to the bathroom. And nothing seems to stop it. I’ve tried everything the pharmacy suggested.
DOCTOR: "Everything the pharmacy suggested," you say. Right. Well, let's try to be a bit more precise than that, shall we?
PATIENT: Precise? Honestly, I don't even remember exactly what I bought. Pink stuff, white stuff… things for upset stomachs. You know. Over-the-counter. I just need something that works. I've already wasted a week on this. And I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, "pink stuff and white stuff" isn't terribly helpful for a diagnosis, Ms. Woodring. When did this start?
PATIENT: Ugh, a week ago, like I said. Maybe a little more. It started… after I ate some salmon. But I eat salmon all the time. It shouldn't matter. It just… started. And it hasn’t let up. It's just… inconvenient. Really inconvenient.
DOCTOR: “Shouldn’t matter,” you say. Foodborne illness is, unfortunately, rather common, even with foods you consume regularly. And it does matter. Now, describe the… episodes to me. Frequency?
PATIENT: Frequency? What am I, a clock? Look, it’s constantly. I wake up needing to go, I go after every meal, I go in the middle of the night… It’s just… a lot. More than normal, obviously. I’m not going to sit here and count how many times a day, alright? It’s embarrassing even talking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s unpleasant to discuss, Ms. Woodring, but a vague description of “constantly” doesn’t allow me to assess the severity of your condition. Is it watery?
PATIENT: Yes! Of course it’s watery! What, did you think I was going to tell you it was… solid? Honestly, it’s just… a mess. And it’s not just a little bit, it’s… a lot. I’m starting to get dehydrated, I can feel it. It's just… look, can we just skip to the part where you give me something that will fix this? I don’t have time for a twenty-question game.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, for goodness sake. No! No blood. I would know if there was blood. I’m not completely oblivious, you know. It’s just… diarrhea. A lot of it. Watery. And it won't stop. I’ve told you this. Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: I am listening, Ms. Woodring. I simply need to rule out certain possibilities. Have you experienced any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No fever. Maybe a little queasy sometimes, but I don’t vomit. I just… feel weak. And really, really tired. It’s probably from… well, you know. Losing everything. It’s just… exhausting. Honestly, I'm surprised I even made it in here today. I feel awful. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we going to keep going in circles?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Travel? No! Where would I have traveled to? I haven't left the state in years. I have things to take care of here. I don't go gallivanting off on vacations. It's just… this stomach thing. It started after the salmon. And it hasn't stopped. Are you going to ask me about my childhood next?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or any other gastrointestinal condition?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a painter, not a medical textbook! I’ve had the usual things, a cold here and there. Nothing serious. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything like… what did you say? Irritable… whatever. I’ve always been healthy. Until this. Honestly, I think it's just a bad piece of fish. And I need something to fix it now. Is that too much to ask? I don’t understand why this is taking so long.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. I take a little something for my arthritis sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing serious. And I haven’t taken anything for this stomach thing yet, because nothing seems to work anyway. I just want to feel normal again. I’m starting to think I should have just stayed home. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie back. I’m going to listen to your abdomen and palpate it. Please inform me if you experience any pain. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, a little! Right… there. On the left side. It’s… sensitive. Not like a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Are you sure you need to push that hard? This is making me nervous. I don't like being poked and prodded. Can we just get a prescription already? I’m starting to feel dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the left lower quadrant. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to rule out anything else. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Your vitals are stable, but given your symptoms, and the tenderness, I’m going to order a stool sample to rule out any infection.
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? You want me to… take a sample? Look, I already told you, it’s just a bad piece of fish! I don’t have time for this. I have work to do. And I’m not going to sit around waiting for test results. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just give me something for the diarrhea, and I’ll be on my way. Is that too much to ask? This is a complete waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration, but I am attempting to provide you with appropriate medical care. Dismissing your symptoms as “a bad piece of fish” without proper investigation is irresponsible. While I could prescribe something to temporarily alleviate the diarrhea, it will not address the underlying cause, and could potentially mask a more serious condition. I’m going to give you a requisition for the stool sample. Please take it to the lab as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend you stay hydrated with an electrolyte solution. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever, you need to seek immediate medical attention. I'm also going to write a prescription for loperamide. It's over the counter, but this will hopefully help regulate things while we wait for results. .
