DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, I want to know… about my family. Long time ago, you see. I hear now, you can… find out where people come from, with… the spit? Or the blood? I want to know more about that. About my ancestors.
DOCTOR: Ancestry testing. Right. Well, that's… not really what family medicine is for, Mr. Scobie, but we can discuss it briefly. Are you feeling unwell?
PATIENT: No, no, I feel okay. Old, but okay! Not sick. Just… curious. I always wonder about my people, you know? Where they really come from. My mama, she tell stories, but… stories can change, yes? This test… it tell the truth?
DOCTOR: Look, these tests… they're often marketed as providing definitive answers, but they're far from perfect. They analyze your genetic markers, but interpreting those markers is…complex. And frankly, it's not particularly relevant to your health. We're here to address medical concerns, not genealogy. However… if you're insistent, I suppose I can point you towards some resources. But before we go down that rabbit hole, let's just quickly review your current medications and any allergies, just for my records. Do you take any pills or have any reactions to anything?
PATIENT: Oh. Complex… that sounds hard. Okay, okay. No pills. Never take pills. I like to stay natural, you see. And no… allergies. Nothing make me sick like that. Just old bones sometimes. But that's just getting old, not… allergy. So, about the family? Can you help me find out?
DOCTOR: Right. No medications, no allergies. Good. As for helping you with ancestry… I can refer you to a genetic testing company. But I want to be clear – I won't be personally interpreting the results. It's not my area of expertise. Before we proceed with that, and frankly because I have to ask, have you experienced any recent changes in your health?
PATIENT: No changes. Same old, same old. A little slow, maybe. Hard to walk so far now. But that's just… time. The testing… you mean I send them my spit? Or blood? And how much money it cost? I don't have so much money, you see. I make little boats, wood boats, but not so many people buy them now.
DOCTOR: Yes, typically it involves a saliva sample. Some companies offer blood tests, but those are generally more expensive. As for the cost… it varies wildly, from a couple hundred dollars to several hundred. Honestly, it sounds like a considerable expense for something that isn’t medically necessary. Now, Mr. Scobie, let's talk about something practical. You mentioned difficulty walking. Has this been a gradual change, or did something specific trigger it?
PATIENT: Gradual. Slow, slow, slow. For maybe… five years now? Started with just tired legs after working on the boats. Now… harder to get up from chair. And sometimes… little pain in the hips. Not bad pain, just… old pain. Like the weather, you know? When it rains, it hurts more. I just thought it was getting old. But maybe… you should look at my legs? Before we talk about the family?
DOCTOR: Alright. We can take a look. It’s good you brought this up. “Old pain” can sometimes indicate something more than just age. Please, have a seat on the examination table and let's start with a quick assessment of your hips and knees. I’ll need you to flex and extend them for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Flex and extend… you mean bend them? Like this? Is this okay? It… feels a little stiff.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. Flex and extend. Good. I see some limited range of motion, and I note some discomfort with extension. Now, let’s do the other leg. And I’m also going to palpate your hip joints to assess for any tenderness. This will just take a moment. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful.
PATIENT: Okay. Ooh. That one… a little more pain. Yes… right there. A little sore. Like a… ache. Not sharp, just… ache. Like the weather, remember? When it rains. It always hurts more then. Is it bad, Doctor? Is it just old?
DOCTOR: There’s some tenderness present, yes. And your range of motion is definitely limited in both hips. While some discomfort is expected with age, the level of pain and limitation suggests it could be more than just typical wear and tear. It’s possible you have some osteoarthritis developing in your hip joints. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some X-rays of both hips. That will allow us to visualize the joint space and assess the extent of any cartilage loss. Does that sound alright to you, Mr. Scobie?
PATIENT: X-rays? Is that… safe? I hear things about… the rays. My mama, she always say… be careful with the rays. Is it much rays? And… will it cost much money? I don't want to spend all my money on… looking at my bones. I want to know about my family, remember?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, the amount of radiation from an X-ray is very minimal. It’s a standard diagnostic tool, and the benefits of identifying the cause of your hip pain far outweigh the risks. It’s not going to “harm” you. As for the cost… it shouldn’t be exorbitant, especially with Medicare. We can check the exact amount beforehand. Look, let’s focus on your health first. We need to determine what’s causing your pain before we can discuss any ancestry testing. If it’s simply osteoarthritis, we can manage it with physical therapy and potentially some pain medication. But if it’s something more serious… we need to know. So, will you allow me to order the X-rays?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. If it not much rays. And if Medicare pay for it. You think it is just the old? Just the bones? But… if it is something bad… what then? I… I don’t want to be sick. I just want to know about my family. But… I don't want to be sick.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, let’s not jump to conclusions. We don’t know anything yet. That’s why we need the X-rays. “Something bad” is unlikely, but we need to rule it out. If it is something more serious, we'll discuss treatment options. And frankly, knowing what's going on will alleviate your anxiety more than any ancestry test. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the X-rays for you. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that aggravates your hip pain. We can also discuss some simple pain relief strategies. Now, regarding the family history… can you tell me anything about your parents’ or grandparents’ health?
PATIENT: Okay. No strenuous activity. I try. Mostly I just make the boats. My mama… she was strong. Worked hard in the garden. She had… trouble breathing sometimes, when she got old. And my papa… he was a fisherman. He fell off the boat once, broke his leg. He was okay, but… always hurt after that. They both gone now, a long time ago. I don’t know much about their mamas and papas. Just stories, you see? Old stories. That's why I want the test. To know the truth.
DOCTOR: Trouble breathing and a broken leg… alright. That’s… something. While not definitive, it gives us a little to work with. Family history can sometimes indicate a predisposition to certain conditions, but it’s not always reliable. Look, Mr. Scobie, I’m going to order those X-rays, and we’ll review the results when they come back. In the meantime, let’s focus on managing your current pain. I’ll write you a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory, which can help reduce discomfort. I’ll also have the receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks, so we can discuss the results and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For trying. I still want to know about my family, you see. But… I understand. We need to fix the legs first. Maybe… after the legs are better… then we can talk about the test?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. We’ll re-evaluate after the X-rays. If your pain improves, and the tests are clear, we can discuss your options. But frankly, I still believe focusing on your current health is the priority. The receptionist will schedule your follow-up. And please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Get well soon. .
