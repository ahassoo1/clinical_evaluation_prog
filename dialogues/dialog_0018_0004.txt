DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It is a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Stilaire. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it's just a check-up, really. Routine immunization visit, like the nurse said on the phone. I try to keep up with those when I can.
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Fornes. Proactive preventative care is excellent. And it's wonderful that you prioritize staying current with your immunizations. To ensure I have a complete picture, even for a routine visit, I would like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds good. Ask away. I don't mind at all.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I see here that this is your first visit with me, so I'll start with some general questions. Let's begin with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing like that. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. I had a bad flu a couple winters ago, but that cleared up on its own. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains from working on construction sites all these years. Nothing a little rest and ibuprofen couldn’t fix.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Fornes. And it’s wise to address those aches and pains – better to be safe. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. When I was a little girl, maybe seven or eight, I had my tonsils out. That was a long time ago, though. And when I broke my wrist falling out of a tree when I was a teenager, but that was just overnight at the hospital, you know? Just to set it. Nothing major since then.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information. Now, could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Well, my mom lived to be 88, and she was pretty healthy all her life, honestly. She had a bit of arthritis in her hands towards the end, but that's about it. My dad passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I think. And my brother... he's got high blood pressure, I know that much. And maybe some cholesterol issues, but we don't talk about health stuff much, if you know what I mean. It’s just not really our thing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Fornes. It’s common for families to not always discuss these things openly. Knowing what you do know is very helpful. And now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Okay… well, I’m married, been with my husband, John, for thirty years now. We both work in construction - he's a carpenter. I do inspections, making sure things are up to code. We don’t have any kids, just a couple of cats. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much – maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I like to go fishing when I have the time, and I volunteer at the local tribal center when I can. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fornes, that covers it beautifully. It sounds like you have a very full and active life. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen for when my joints act up, like I said. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I'll take a melatonin gummy. That’s it, really. Nothing regular, just as needed. Oh, and sometimes a vitamin D supplement in the winter, since we don’t get much sunshine here.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen, melatonin as needed, and vitamin D seasonally. That’s good to know. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven’t had any problems with bee stings or anything like that. I think I’d remember if I was allergic to something! Does that sound alright? I'm not sure if there's anything else I should be thinking of.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Fornes, that sounds excellent. It doesn't appear that you've forgotten anything. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, let's move on to a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration – and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go right ahead. I don't mind at all. Just let me know if anything feels strange or uncomfortable, okay? I've always been a bit of a worrier about doctor visits, but you seem very nice and I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your trust, Ms. Fornes. I will certainly let you know if anything feels unusual, and we can always stop if you're uncomfortable. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your arm for me. …122 over 78. Blood pressure is within the normal range. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration is 16 breaths per minute, and your oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Could you please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly?
PATIENT: Okay. It always feels weird listening to my lungs, makes me feel like I'm not breathing right. But I'm trying to relax.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or abnormal sounds noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi appreciated. I'm going to palpate your abdomen now. Just let me know if you feel any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. It might be a little sensitive, I had a bit of indigestion last night, but it shouldn't be anything major. I ate a pretty spicy curry.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no masses or guarding noted. There is mild discomfort in the epigastric region, likely related to the indigestion you mentioned. I’m going to check your reflexes now. Could you please sit on the edge of the examination table, feet dangling?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally, which is normal. I'm also going to briefly check your cranial nerves. Please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head.
PATIENT: There… there… okay, I see it. It's a little blurry without my glasses, but I can follow it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your cranial nerves appear intact. Okay, Ms. Fornes, that completes the physical examination. Everything appears within normal limits. Given your age, health history, and the routine nature of your visit, I recommend staying up-to-date with your recommended immunizations. Based on your immunization record, you are due for a Tdap booster and an updated COVID-19 vaccine. Would you like to receive those today?
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds good. A Tdap booster and the new COVID vaccine… yes, let’s go ahead and get those done, please. I figured that's why I was here! It’s better to be safe than sorry, you know? Do they hurt much? I don't love needles.
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent decision, Ms. Fornes. And I understand your apprehension about needles. They can be a bit uncomfortable, but it’s very quick, and the discomfort is usually minimal. We can also use a numbing spray if you’d like. I’ll prepare the vaccines now. While I do that, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything really well. No, no questions right now. Just… let's get it over with, okay? I trust you. The faster it's done, the better! And maybe afterwards, we can talk about that fishing spot you mentioned on the wall? I think I saw a picture of a really big salmon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fornes. We can definitely discuss the fishing spot afterward. And I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, let's get started. Please roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Okay… here we go. I'm trying not to flinch. Just do it quickly! And yes, please tell me when you’re about to poke me. A warning is always appreciated.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fornes. I'm going to give you the Tdap booster now. It will feel like a small pinch, and it will be over in a moment. 3… 2… 1… There! All done. See?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that wasn’t too bad. A little pinch, but nothing awful. Is that all? I'm ready for the COVID one, if that's next. Let’s just get it over with! You're doing a good job, by the way. Just wanted to say that.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fornes. I appreciate that. You’re being very brave. And yes, the COVID vaccine is next. It's a similar pinch to the Tdap. Alright, here we go. 3… 2… 1… Done! All finished. See?
PATIENT: Okay, done! That wasn't as bad as I remembered needles being. You were right about being quick. My arm feels a little sore, but it's not terrible. Thank you!
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Fornes! You handled that beautifully. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little soreness at the injection site for a day or two. You can apply a cold compress if it helps. I also recommend staying hydrated and avoiding strenuous activity with that arm for the rest of the day. I've given you an updated immunization record and some information on potential side effects. If you experience any unusual symptoms, such as a high fever or severe allergic reaction, please contact the clinic immediately. Now, as promised, let's talk about that fishing spot. It's a bit of a hidden gem, up on the Skagit River… I’ve got a picture of a 30-pound salmon I caught there last year.
PATIENT: Oh, wow, 30 pounds! That's incredible. My husband, John, would love that spot. He's a much better fisherman than I am, I mostly just enjoy being outdoors. Tell me everything, what kind of lures do you use? What’s the best time of year to go? Is it a difficult hike to get there? You know, all the important stuff.
