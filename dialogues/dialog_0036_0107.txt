DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s August 2nd. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you. I… uh… my heart, it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s… beating too fast, but not regular. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not all the time, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Funny” – can you describe that a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s like… a flapping. Not a strong beat, more like… quick little flaps inside my chest. And sometimes it makes me feel… a little short of breath, but not always. It doesn’t hurt, just… weird. Like something is not right with the rhythm.
DOCTOR: Alright, “quick little flaps” and an irregular rhythm – that's helpful. And you mentioned shortness of breath sometimes accompanies it. When did you first start noticing this happening?
PATIENT: Let me think… maybe… three months ago? Around… May? It started slow, just once in a while when I was… walking up a hill, maybe. Now it happens… easier. Even when I'm just sitting. Not every day, but… more often. It’s hard to say exactly. I don’t keep a calendar for my heart, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, no need to keep a calendar! Three months ago, starting with exertion, and now happening more easily… Okay. Have you noticed anything that specifically triggers it, besides exertion?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I drink a lot of coffee, maybe that? But I drink coffee every day, so I thought… I don’t know. Sometimes when I’m worried, maybe? Like if something is wrong with the work. But I can’t say for sure. I try not to stress, but… work is work, you know? It's chemicals, gotta be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee and potential stress at work. We’ll definitely keep those in mind. Now, outside of the palpitations and occasional shortness of breath, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No… not really. I get tired sometimes, but I work long hours. So, I think that's normal. No… no chest pain, no dizziness, nothing like that. Just the funny beating. And the… flapping.
DOCTOR: Alright. No chest pain or dizziness is good. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I've never been to a doctor much, to be honest. I feel okay most of the time. Just… this heart thing started. My wife, she tells me I should come, but I don’t like doctors. I’ve never needed them before.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No prior medical diagnoses. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, but that’s it. Just a cast. Nothing serious. I work with the equipment, gotta be careful, but I haven’t had any accidents. Hopefully never will.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family – does anyone in your family have a history of heart problems, like heart disease, arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father, he had… something with his blood pressure, I think. High blood pressure, maybe? He didn’t go to the doctor much either. My mother… she was healthy, I think. No heart problems that I know of. Nobody died young from the heart, if that’s what you mean. But my family… we don’t talk about health much. It's not polite, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure in your father. That's helpful to know. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work, like I said, with the chemicals. Long hours, sometimes six days a week. I try to eat okay, but my wife does most of the cooking. Rice and fish, mostly. I drink coffee, a lot. And… I don’t do much exercise, to be honest. Work is exercise enough, I think. I smoke… maybe ten cigarettes a day. I know it's bad, but… it helps with the stress.
DOCTOR: Okay. Long work hours, rice and fish diet, coffee, ten cigarettes a day, and limited exercise. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't drink. Never liked it. My wife, she sometimes has a little wine with dinner, but I don't. It makes me feel… sick, if I try. So, no alcohol for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No alcohol. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. Nothing. And no allergies. I can eat anything. I’m very lucky that way. My wife always tells me I eat like a goat. But I’ve never had a problem with any food or medicine. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No medications, no allergies. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and feel your neck. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need. Just… be gentle? I don't like being poked and prodded too much. But I trust you. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Your pulse is 92, and it's slightly irregular – I can feel the fluttering you described. Your lungs sound clear. I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes in your neck. I’m going to order an EKG – that's an electrocardiogram – to get a better look at your heart's electrical activity. Also, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and a thyroid test. We also need to check your cholesterol levels. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay… 140/90… that doesn’t sound good, does it? And the fluttering… you feel it too? Yes, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are best. EKG and blood work… yes. I trust your judgment. Whatever will help figure out what’s wrong with my heart, I’m willing to do. So, how do we do these tests? Do I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: You’re right, 140/90 is a little higher than we’d like. And yes, I can definitely feel the irregularity. It’s good we're getting this checked out. For the EKG, we can do that right here in the clinic. It’s a painless test where we put some stickers on your chest and arms to record your heart’s electrical activity. It takes about five minutes. The blood work, we'll just need to draw a few vials of blood, and that will also be done here. It will take a little longer. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood after the EKG. Based on the initial findings, and to be cautious, I want to rule out any underlying heart conditions or thyroid issues that could be contributing to these symptoms. While we await the results, I recommend reducing your coffee intake and trying to manage your stress levels. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay… stickers and blood… not my favorite, but okay. So, right here today? That's good. I don’t want to have to come back too many times. Reduce coffee… that will be hard. And stress… easier said than done. What could be wrong, Doctor? Is it serious? Could it be… my heart? And what is this… thyroid? Is that bad? I get worried easily, you know? I don't want anything too scary. Is it something I need to be afraid of?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Mr. Puder. Let’s take things one step at a time. There are many possible reasons for palpitations and an irregular heartbeat. It could be something relatively minor, like stress, caffeine, or dehydration. However, it’s important to rule out any more serious underlying causes. The thyroid is a gland in your neck that produces hormones that regulate your body’s metabolism. Sometimes, an overactive or underactive thyroid can cause heart palpitations. We need to check your thyroid levels to see if that’s contributing to your symptoms. The tests we’re doing today will give us more information. While we don’t know the cause yet, I want to emphasize that we're taking this seriously and will figure out what's going on. I’ll explain the results thoroughly once we have them. It’s possible it could be related to your heart, which is why we’re doing the EKG. But it's too early to say anything definitive. I want to assure you that we’re taking this step-by-step. We’ll start with these tests, and then we’ll discuss the best course of action based on the results. Do you want me to explain anything in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… step-by-step… that sounds better. Not jump to conclusions. Thyroid… so not just my heart? That's good. I guess. And what if it is something with my heart, Doctor? Will I need… medicine? Surgery? I've heard bad things about heart surgery. My neighbor, he had… a bad time. I don't want a bad time. And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t like waiting. The worrying is the worst part.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be concerned about those possibilities, Mr. Puder. Let’s address them one at a time. If it is something with your heart, the treatment options depend entirely on the specific diagnosis. Many heart conditions are very manageable with medication. Surgery is usually reserved for more serious cases, and it’s a decision we would only make after careful consideration and discussion of all the risks and benefits. I assure you, we would explore all other options before considering surgery. And, if it were to come to that, we would refer you to a highly experienced cardiac surgeon. Regarding the results, the EKG results should be available within minutes. The blood work results typically take 24-48 hours to come back, as they need to be sent to a lab for analysis. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to focus on reducing your stress levels and limiting your coffee intake, if possible. And please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: Okay… 24-48 hours… I can wait, I guess. Reducing stress… that's the hard part. I'll try. And no chest pain, dizziness… good. What about smoking, Doctor? Should I… stop smoking? My wife is always telling me to stop. Maybe this is a good excuse. It's hard, though. It calms my nerves. I think that's all my questions for now. Let's get the stickers, I guess. And then… wait and worry. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, regarding smoking, I strongly recommend quitting. Smoking significantly increases your risk of heart disease and other health problems. It also makes it harder for your heart to function properly. I understand it's difficult, but there are resources available to help you quit, such as nicotine patches, gum, or counseling. I can provide you with some information about those options after we have the test results. We’ll get the EKG done right away. My nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to get you set up. Just lie still for a few minutes while the stickers record your heart activity. Remember, try to relax as much as possible. We'll take things one step at a time, Mr. Puder. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I'm here to help. .
