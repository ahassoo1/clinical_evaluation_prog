DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my muscles, see. They’ve just been…weak. Like, really weak. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it's starting to bother me more and more. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness for a few weeks, progressively worsening. Can you tell me a bit more about that weakness?
PATIENT: Sure. It's…hard to explain. It’s not like a sudden thing, you know? It’s more like…everything takes more effort. Lifting things, even just getting up from a chair. And it’s not every muscle, all the time. My arms feel it mostly, but my legs have been a bit shaky too, sometimes. It’s just…tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s a gradual onset, more effort with daily activities, primarily in your arms, with some involvement in your legs. And you describe it as tiring. Is the weakness worse at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. I think…yeah, actually. It feels worse in the afternoons, definitely. Like, mornings aren't great, but I can usually manage. By the time evening rolls around, I'm really dragging. It's almost like I used up all my energy just getting through the day. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. Weakness worsening throughout the day, particularly in the afternoons. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… other symptoms… I’ve been a bit more tired overall, even before the muscle weakness gets bad. Just…sleepy, I guess. And… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little dizzy sometimes, when I stand up too fast. It doesn't last long, just a quick whoosh. Nothing major, but it’s been happening more often lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased fatigue and dizziness upon standing. Have you noticed any changes in your weight – either loss or gain – recently?
PATIENT: Actually, yes. I think I've lost a little weight. Not a lot, maybe five or six pounds? I haven't been tracking it or anything, but my clothes feel a bit looser. And my appetite hasn't been great lately, now that I think about it. It’s just…hard to eat when I’m so tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weight loss, decreased appetite, fatigue, weakness worsening throughout the day, and dizziness upon standing. Now, let’s go over some basic medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I haven't seen a doctor in… well, it's been a while. Maybe five years? Just regular check-ups, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, haven't seen a doctor regularly in the last five years. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery, never been in the hospital. Knock on wood, I've been pretty lucky. Just the occasional cold, that's it. I work as an insurance appraiser, so I'm mostly just driving around looking at cars. Not a very physically demanding job, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior surgeries or hospitalizations. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… my dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandma, on my mom's side, she had arthritis, pretty bad. Nothing else that I can really think of. We weren’t really a family that talked about health stuff much, to be honest. I don’t know if anyone had anything…serious. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your grandmother. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, take most medications without a problem. No rashes, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I’m pretty boring when it comes to allergies. Just trying to be as helpful as possible here.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it, so I try to just tough things out. That’s why I’m here now, I guess, before things get too bad. I figured it's better to figure out what's going on before it gets really serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. No current medications. Alright, Mr. McKinnon, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn’t take too long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I'm just hoping we can figure out what's going on. The sooner the better, honestly. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay. Like that? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can, but my grip isn’t what it used to be. It's definitely weaker on this side, actually. Feels a little… shaky too.
DOCTOR: Okay. I notice some weakness in your left hand grip, and you’re right, it does appear to be slightly shaky. Now, can you try to push against my hand?
PATIENT: Okay. I’m trying… it’s harder than it looks. Especially on my left arm. It just… feels like I don't have much power. I can feel it trembling a bit, too. It’s a little sore, actually. Not a sharp pain, just… tired.
DOCTOR: Okay. And let’s check your legs. Can you push your heel down against my hand like this?
PATIENT: Okay. I’m pushing… it’s harder on this leg too. It feels weaker, and… honestly, a little bit numb. Not completely numb, just… tingly. It’s hard to explain. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay. Weakness in left upper and lower extremities, diminished reflexes, and tingling sensation in the left leg. Mr. McKinnon, based on this initial exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on, but your symptoms and exam findings are concerning for possible nerve compression or neuropathy. The weakness, tingling, and diminished reflexes suggest something may be affecting a nerve. I would like to order some blood work and an MRI of your cervical spine to get a better look at your nerves and spinal cord. The blood work will rule out any underlying medical conditions and the MRI will help us identify any compression or damage to the nerves in your neck. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Honestly, anything to figure out what’s going on. Blood work and an MRI, right? I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s causing this, and hopefully, get it fixed. Will the MRI show…like, if it’s serious? Is it something bad? I'm a bit worried now, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. McKinnon, and it’s good you’re asking questions. An MRI will give us a detailed view of your spinal cord and the nerves in your neck, allowing us to identify potential causes for your symptoms. It could show something serious, but it could also show something relatively minor. It’s important to remember that an MRI is just a diagnostic tool, it doesn’t tell us everything. It's possible it will show a compressed nerve, inflammation, or even something else entirely. We'll discuss the results thoroughly when they are available, and I’ll explain all your options for treatment. I'm going to write an order for the blood work and the MRI. You can schedule the MRI at the imaging center across town – I'll give you the number. The blood work can be done here at the clinic tomorrow morning. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity and if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as severe pain, loss of bowel or bladder control, or significant weakness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. I’ll avoid strenuous activity, and if anything gets worse, I'll go to the ER. I'll schedule the MRI for tomorrow. So, blood work here tomorrow, MRI across town, and then follow-up when the results are in. I think I have that right? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I'm still worried, but…at least we're doing something now. .
