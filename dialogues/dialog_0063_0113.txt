DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me—in as concise a manner as possible—what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Jules, you say? Hmm. Well, it's... the bathroom. I seem to be going to it a lot. More than I used to, anyway. It's… bothersome, let's put it that way. Not a serious thing, I don’t think. Just… frequent. Yes, frequent. My wife keeps saying something about it, but women always worry too much, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Frequent urination. Yes, I see. And how long has this been… frequent, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now, how long… that’s a tricky one. A while, I suppose. Weeks, maybe? It all feels… blurry, to be honest. I haven't been keeping a calendar of my bathroom visits, you know. I just know it's not like it used to be. Used to be able to go a good long stretch… these days, not so much. Is this important? Knowing the exact date? Seems like a waste of time, frankly.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Segretto. A general timeframe is acceptable, but precision aids in… assessment. Let's say, roughly, over the past month?
PATIENT: A month… yes, alright, a month sounds about right. Maybe a little longer, but a month will do. Though, truthfully, it feels like longer than that. Time just… slips away when you’re getting on in years, you know? Not like when I was farming, every day had a purpose then. This… this is just… going to the bathroom a lot. Is that all there is to it? Just a month of going to the bathroom?
DOCTOR: We need to ascertain why, Mr. Segretto, not merely that you are urinating frequently. Are you experiencing any pain or burning sensation during urination?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. A little… discomfort sometimes, maybe. But not pain. It’s… a pressure, more like. Like you need to go, even when there isn’t much there. And then you go, and it’s… well, it’s normal. Just… more often. I don’t understand why you need to know all these details. It's just my bladder, isn’t it? Old age, probably. Everything wears out eventually.
DOCTOR: “Old age” is not a diagnosis, Mr. Segretto. We must rule out other possibilities. Do you notice any change in the color or odor of your urine?
PATIENT: Color and odor… now you’re asking me to be a chemist, aren’t you? I don't examine my urine, Doctor. I go to the bathroom, that’s what I do. It looks like… urine, mostly. Yellowish, I suppose. And it smells… like urine. What kind of answer are you looking for? I haven’t noticed anything different, if that helps. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. My wife could probably tell you more about the color, she notices everything. But I’m the one sitting here, answering questions about… bodily fluids.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? No. Abdominal pain… well, my stomach creaks a bit when I bend over, but that's just old age again. Everything aches. I had a bad back for years from all the farming. You're asking about a lot of things that aren't bothering me. I just go to the bathroom a lot, Doctor. Is there a pill for that? Just something to… calm things down? I don’t need a full investigation. It’s probably just a weak bladder. Really, my wife worries too much.
DOCTOR: We will perform a quick examination, Mr. Segretto. Just to rule out any immediate concerns. I need to assess your prostate, if you don't mind. It's a standard procedure for men your age.
PATIENT: Prostate? Now hold on just a minute. What does my prostate have to do with going to the bathroom? I haven’t even thought about my prostate. Is this… is this necessary? I don't like the sound of that at all. I came in here because I go to the bathroom a lot, not for a… a prostate exam. Honestly, I think I'm starting to regret coming here. My wife insisted. She always insists. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, an enlarged prostate is a common cause of frequent urination in men of your age. It's a simple examination, and it’s important to determine if that is contributing to your symptoms. I assure you, it is not as unpleasant as you imagine. However, if you are truly opposed… we can proceed without it, but I strongly advise against it. But, I will need a urine sample first, at the very least. Can you provide that for me?
