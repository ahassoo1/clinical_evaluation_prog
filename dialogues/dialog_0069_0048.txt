DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lason is fine. And you can skip the “nice to meet you,” we haven’t met met. My wife made the appointment because… well, I’ve been having these little… spells. Confusion, she calls it. I don’t know about confusion, exactly. More like… moments.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Moments” is a good way to put it. And you’re right to point that out – we haven’t formally met before. Thank you for clarifying. So these “moments”... can you tell me more about them?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I forget who I am, you understand? It’s… things. Like yesterday, I went to the hardware store for tile adhesive, perfectly clear in my head, and came back with… garden hose nozzles. Three of them! Not what I needed at all. And I stood there, looking at them, perfectly aware they weren’t adhesive. Just… happened. My wife says it’s worrying. I think she worries too much, frankly. She always has.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So it's not a loss of identity or major memory, but more like… a slip in focus or getting the wrong item despite knowing what you intended to get. And these episodes are new, correct?
PATIENT: New-ish. They’ve been happening… oh, maybe six months now? Started small. Misplacing tools, forgetting which customer I was talking to for a minute. Annoying, but nothing a good night's sleep wouldn't fix. It's just… gotten more frequent lately. And bigger mistakes, like the nozzles. It's not like I'm a child, Doctor. I've been setting tile for forty years. I know what adhesive looks like.
DOCTOR: Forty years is a long time – that’s a lot of experience! It's understandable to be concerned when something like this starts to happen when you're so accustomed to doing things a certain way. So, these episodes are happening more frequently over the past six months. Are they happening at a specific time of day, or are they random?
PATIENT: Random. That's the frustrating part. Sometimes it's first thing in the morning, sometimes in the middle of a job, sometimes when I’m relaxing in the evening. There’s no pattern to it, which makes it… unsettling. I mean, if it was tiredness, I could adjust. If it was stress, I could slow down. But this is just… there. Like a little gremlin messing with my head. And my wife keeps wanting to call my son, who's a lawyer, and I told her absolutely not. Lawyers just complicate things.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and a "gremlin" is a good way to describe it. It’s good you’re able to articulate that. And I respect your preference about not involving your son at this time. Okay, let's try to get a broader picture. Besides these "moments," have you noticed any other changes in how you've been feeling?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well, I've been… a bit more tired, maybe. But that could be the heat. It's been brutal lately. And my wife says I've been… irritable. But she says a lot of things. Honestly, she's been a bit more difficult lately, too. She's always complaining about something. But, no, nothing major. I eat okay, sleep okay when she doesn't wake me up, and I’m still able to do my work. Setting tile is physical, you know. You’d notice if I was really off.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that you’re still able to do your work. It’s helpful to know that your physical abilities haven’t been affected. And it sounds like the irritability might be related to the heat, or perhaps some stress related to your wife. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… well, I had my prostate checked a few years back, everything was fine. High blood pressure, the doctor put me on something for it, I take it every morning. Can’t remember the name of it, though. And my knees bother me sometimes, old injury. But that’s it, really. I’m not one for doctors, never have been. Always seemed like a waste of time, frankly. I’ve always been a practical man. Fix things myself when I can.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been generally healthy. I see here you’re on Lisinopril for hypertension. Good. And you mentioned a past knee injury. Has that required any treatment beyond occasional discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort is putting it mildly. When it rains, you hear about it. And when it’s cold. But no, I haven’t seen a doctor for it in years. Just rub some ointment on it. My wife keeps telling me I should get a shot, but I don't like the idea of needles. I had enough of those when I was a boy. We didn’t have good doctors back then, either. Mostly just told you to drink more water. Useless. So, no, just ointment and a lot of complaining. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere. It's helpful to have this information, and I appreciate your honesty. Knowing about the knee discomfort and your aversion to needles is good. Now, just to cover all bases, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And… I think I had a mole removed from my back, maybe twenty years ago. Small thing. Nothing major. That’s it. Never been one for hospitals, Doctor. Too much… sickness. I prefer to be healthy and get on with things. This whole thing is… unsettling. I’m a tile setter, not a patient. It’s just not right.
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings completely. It sounds like you’ve had a relatively straightforward medical history. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother had… something with her memory when she got old, I think. But she didn’t see a doctor much either, so we never really knew what it was. My father was strong as an ox, lived to be eighty. Heart trouble, eventually. My sister… she's always been a worrier. She sees a doctor for every little sniffle. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to their medical problems. Too much drama. I just focus on my own work. Are we almost done here, Doctor? I really need to get back to the job site.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. We’re getting there. Just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a bit of a rash sometimes when I brush against poison ivy, but that's about it. Nothing serious. I eat everything. I've never had a problem with any medications, as far as I know. My wife tries to give me vitamins all the time, but I usually forget to take them. She says I’m stubborn. Probably is true. So, no allergies. Can we finish this now? I'm starting to get anxious just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, we’ve covered a lot of ground. No allergies, good. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications, over-the-counter supplements, or herbal remedies besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Just what my wife gives me. Sometimes she'll sneak something into my tea, some sort of herbal thing for my knees. She says it’s ginger. I don’t really pay attention. It tastes awful, that’s all I know. But no, nothing I take regularly on my own. Honestly, I just want to get back to work. This whole thing is… unsettling. Are we done now, Doctor? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Lason, we are almost done. Thank you for your patience and honesty. Based on what you've told me – the episodes of confusion with getting the wrong items, the fatigue, the irritability, and the family history of memory issues – I’d like to explore the possibility of early cognitive decline. It’s important to rule out other potential causes first, but this is a possibility we need to consider. I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any infections. I’d also like to schedule a brief cognitive assessment – just a few simple tests to get a baseline of your memory and thinking skills. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… fine. I suppose. But I don’t want any needles bigger than necessary. And a “cognitive assessment”? Sounds like a test. I don’t like tests. I’m a tile setter, not a student. But… if you think it’s necessary. My wife will be happy you’re taking this seriously. She’s been nagging me about this for months. Just… don’t keep me here all day. I have a job to finish. And if it turns out to be nothing, I expect an apology. A proper apology. This is unsettling, Doctor, very unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Lason, and I’ll make sure the blood draw is as comfortable as possible. And I assure you, the cognitive assessment is short and simple – it shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood now, and then we can schedule the assessment for next week. I'll also have my nurse give you a list of instructions for the blood work. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as difficulty speaking, changes in your vision, or weakness on one side of your body – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. And I appreciate your trust in me. We'll work through this together. I will also document everything thoroughly and keep you informed every step of the way. Let’s get the blood work started. The lab technician will be right with you.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with quickly. And tell your technician to be gentle. I have a job to finish, remember? And I still expect an apology if it’s nothing. This whole thing is… unsettling. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I’ll have the technician prepare immediately. And I assure you, I will keep that apology in mind. If you’ll follow me.
PATIENT: .
