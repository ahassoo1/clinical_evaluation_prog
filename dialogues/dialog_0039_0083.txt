DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Kammer. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Kammer is the name. Yes, well, it’s… a bit of a thing. My daughter, she thinks I need… a card. A “get well” card, she says. From you. I feel perfectly fine, you understand. Perfectly. But she insists. A doctor’s note, or… a card. It's a bit silly, really.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s very kind of your daughter to be so concerned. And it's perfectly alright to come in even if you’re feeling well, just to put her mind at ease. Sometimes a little reassurance is all we need. So, even though you feel perfectly fine, is there anything at all – even something small – that prompted her concern?
PATIENT: Prompted? Hmm. She says I’ve been… quiet. A bit more quiet than usual, she thinks. And maybe… not as much puttering in the garden. I do like my garden. But the heat, you know? It’s been awful hot. Makes a man tired. And truthfully, Doctor, I just don’t feel like explaining all this to her. She worries too much. It’s a waste of perfectly good energy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like she’s noticing a change in your usual activity level, and the heat is certainly a factor. It’s good you have such a thoughtful daughter. Just to get a better picture, has this quietness been a recent change, or has it been building up over a while?
PATIENT: Building up… yes, I suppose that’s the word. Not suddenly, no. More… gradual. A few weeks, maybe? Since the heat really started. And… well, my ex-wife, she keeps calling. About… things. Old things. That doesn’t help the quietness, I can tell you that. A man needs his peace.
DOCTOR: That sounds… challenging, to say the least. Dealing with both the heat and calls from your ex-wife is a lot to handle. It’s completely understandable that would affect your energy levels and make you want to withdraw a bit. Just to be thorough, are you having any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleeping? Not really. I sleep alright. A few dreams, maybe. Old dreams. But nothing… troublesome. I wake up, I get my coffee, I putter. When the heat isn’t too bad. It's just… I don't have the vigor for things. Like I used to. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Kammer. A loss of vigor is a good way to describe it. And it’s helpful to know you’re sleeping okay. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. My appetite’s not what it used to be. I used to enjoy a good roast pork, but now… it doesn’t appeal. And I’ve been a bit more… forgetful, maybe. Small things. Where I put my glasses, the name of that actor… you know. But nothing serious. Just… old age creeping in, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It's good you're aware of these changes, Mr. Kammer. A decreased appetite and some forgetfulness can be common, and it's often related to things like stress and changes in routine. It's good to rule things out, though. Are you experiencing any weight loss along with the decreased appetite?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that you mention it, yes. My trousers feel a bit looser than they used to. Not a lot, mind you. But noticeable. My daughter probably noticed that, too. She notices everything. It's a curse, really. A blessing and a curse.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Weight loss is something we'll want to look into further. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. Not at all. Chills, maybe a little when the air conditioning is too strong, but that’s just the cold. And night sweats… no. I sleep quite dry, actually. Like a desert. I’m a healthy man, Doctor. Honestly. Just a bit… quiet. And maybe a little looser in the trousers.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so open with me, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you're generally feeling well, but we want to investigate the weight loss and decreased appetite a little further, just to be sure everything is okay. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Well… I suppose. If you insist. I haven't been to a doctor in years. Always thought it was a waste of time, frankly. But my daughter… she’d be furious if I didn’t. Go ahead, Doctor. But be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kammer. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll just do a basic check – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No tenderness. Not really. Feels… normal, I suppose. Like a sack of potatoes. A slightly loose sack of potatoes. But normal. I used to have a bit of trouble with indigestion, years ago, but that's been alright for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No tenderness is good. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that can be normal with age. Alright, Mr. Kammer. Everything seems generally okay, but given the weight loss and decreased appetite, I think it would be wise to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… more poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, it's a bit much. But… alright. If it will satisfy my daughter, and put her mind at ease, then yes. Go ahead with the blood work. But please, no surprises. And can you tell me what you’re looking for, exactly? Just so I know. A man likes to understand what's going on with his own body, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kammer. I understand. I want you to be fully informed. We'll be checking a complete blood count to look for any signs of anemia or infection. We'll also check your thyroid function, as that can affect appetite and energy levels. And we’ll check your kidney and liver function, and vitamin levels, just to get a complete picture. It's a standard set of tests, and it shouldn't take too long. The lab is right down the hall, and they'll take good care of you. We should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just the blood work, and then… hopefully, a card from you. My daughter will be thrilled. And then she’ll leave me alone for a while. That’s all I ask. A little peace and quiet. And maybe a good roast pork dinner, when I have my appetite back.
DOCTOR: Sounds like a perfect plan, Mr. Kammer. I’ll make sure to get that card signed and ready for you. And hopefully, we’ll get those results back quickly and you’ll be back to enjoying a good roast pork dinner in no time. Here’s the lab order. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything quite clearly, Doctor. Thank you… for the card, and for listening to an old man’s troubles. It’s… appreciated. And tell your nurse to be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I’ll be sure to pass that message along to the nurse. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
