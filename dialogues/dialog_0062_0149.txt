DOCTOR: Hi Wynell, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Lovely to meet you too, I suppose. Well, honestly? It’s all this fuss. All this fuss about… things. My daughter, bless her heart, she just insists I come. Says I need “looking after.” I’m perfectly capable, thank you very much. Feet are fine, mostly. A little ache now and then, but who doesn’t have aches at my age? It’s just… they want to do things. And I don’t need things done.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're feeling a little pressured to be here, and you feel quite well overall. That's perfectly valid. It’s good of your daughter to be concerned, though. Sometimes a little check-up can just give everyone peace of mind, even if everything is perfectly fine. So, just to get a better picture, when did you start noticing these “aches now and then”?
PATIENT: Oh, aches… goodness. When did I start noticing…? Honestly, dear, it’s been years. Decades, probably. I can’t rightly say. It comes and goes, you know? Like the tides. One day they’re there, the next they’re not. I don't keep track of every little twinge. And frankly, I have better things to worry about than my feet. Are you sure we need to go over all this? It sounds like a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: You’re right to question it, Wynell. We absolutely don't need to spend time on things that aren’t bothering you. But sometimes, even aches that come and go can tell us something useful. It helps me get to know you and your health history. Perhaps we can focus on what's been happening recently?
PATIENT: Recently… hmm. Well, I went to that garden party last month, Mrs. Abernathy’s, you know, the one with the dreadful canapés? I was on my feet a lot, greeting people, making polite conversation… that might have aggravated something. Though I doubt it. I’ve worn these shoes for years. Perfectly good leather. Not like these youngsters and their flimsy things. It’s probably just… old age. Is that a satisfactory answer? I'm not going to be poked and prodded, I'll tell you that much.
DOCTOR: Perfectly satisfactory! And I assure you, no poking and prodding unless you want it. It sounds like the garden party might have been a bit much for your feet, even in good leather shoes. Just to be thorough, and again, only if you’re comfortable sharing, do you notice the aches more at certain times of day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Times of day… let me think. I suppose they're a little worse in the evening, after I’ve been on them all day. Not terrible, mind you. Just… a little heavier. And sometimes, if I’ve been standing a long time, they feel… swollen, perhaps? But that could just be the heat. It’s been awfully humid lately. Honestly, I don't make a fuss about it. I've lived a long life, and I’ve certainly had worse things to contend with than a little foot discomfort. Are we getting anywhere with this? This is rather tedious.
DOCTOR: You're very stoic, Wynell, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. It does sound like the swelling and evening aches could be related to being on your feet a lot. To get a clearer picture, are you noticing any redness, warmth, or pain in your feet besides the aches and swelling?
PATIENT: Redness? Goodness, no. I bathe regularly, thank you very much. And warmth… well, they feel warm like feet do. It’s not like they’re on fire, dear. And pain… it’s not pain, exactly. It’s more… a dull ache. An annoyance, really. Honestly, you’re asking me to examine my feet like I’m some kind of… podiatrist! Which, ironically, I was for many years. And I can assure you, I know when something is actually wrong. This is just… age. It's perfectly normal. Are you trying to tell me I’m falling apart? Because I assure you, I’m not. .
DOCTOR: Oh, Wynell, please don't think I'm suggesting you're falling apart! I apologize if my questions feel like I'm overscrutinizing. It's just my job to rule things out and make sure everything is as it should be. And knowing you were a podiatrist is incredibly helpful – you have a much better understanding of feet than most! Since you were a podiatrist, perhaps you can describe the location of the ache more precisely?
