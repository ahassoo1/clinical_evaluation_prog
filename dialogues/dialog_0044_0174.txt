DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo! It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Nani. Honestly? Life has been…difficult. I don’t quite know where to begin. It’s just…a heaviness, you understand? I haven't been feeling myself lately. I suppose that’s a good place to start. I just want to get through this as quickly as possible, if we can.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. “Heaviness” is a good way to put it. We’ll take it at your pace, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. Can you tell me a little more about this heaviness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…everything, really. It started a few months ago, I think. After my grandson left for university. He's a good boy, very bright. Always kept me busy. Now… the house is quiet. Too quiet. And it’s not just that. I find I don’t enjoy my gardening anymore, and I used to live for that. Even getting out of bed is…a struggle sometimes. I don’t sleep well either. It's all just…much.
DOCTOR: It sounds like a lot has been going on, and it's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed when big changes happen. Losing that routine and connection with your grandson is significant. And it's important that it’s affecting things you usually love, like gardening. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about the sleep issues?
PATIENT: Oh, the sleep… it’s a mess, Doctor. I used to sleep like a log. Now? I toss and turn for hours. Wake up several times during the night. Sometimes I just lie there, staring at the ceiling. And when I do finally fall asleep, I don’t feel rested when I wake up. It’s… exhausting, honestly. And then I’m just tired all day. It's a vicious cycle.
DOCTOR: That is a difficult cycle. And being constantly tired can make everything feel much harder. Do you find yourself having any trouble staying asleep, or is it mostly difficulty falling asleep initially?
PATIENT: Both, actually. Sometimes I drift off alright enough, then I wake up in the middle of the night and…that’s it. Wide awake. Thoughts racing. Other times, I just lie there for hours before I even get to sleep. It feels like my mind won’t quiet down. It’s very frustrating. Honestly, I just want a good night’s sleep. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Nani, that’s not too much to ask at all. It sounds like you're dealing with a good amount of insomnia. And racing thoughts are very common with that. Just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… yes. It’s definitely not what it used to be. I used to enjoy cooking, big meals for my family. Now… I don't really feel hungry much. I force myself to eat something, but it doesn’t feel enjoyable. I've lost some weight, I think, but I haven't really bothered to check. It just doesn’t seem important at the moment. Everything feels…muted.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Loss of appetite and weight loss are good things to note. And "muted" is a good way to describe it. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been managed with medication for years now. And I had a knee replacement about ten years ago. Aside from that… not much, really. I’ve been quite healthy, actually, all my life. Until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, well that’s good to know. High blood pressure managed with medication and a knee replacement ten years ago. And it sounds like you've generally been in good health. What medications are you currently taking, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. One tablet a day. And sometimes I take Ibuprofen for my knee, when it flares up, but not regularly. That's it, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril daily and Ibuprofen as needed. That's good to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat, though. My mother always said, “Better safe than sorry.” I suppose that’s why.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, children – have experienced any mental health conditions like depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My mother… she was always a worrier, very anxious. Never formally diagnosed, but she stressed about everything. And my sister, bless her soul, she had some…difficult times after her husband passed away. She didn’t want to talk about it much, but I suspect she was depressed. Other than that…not that I know of, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. History of anxiety in your mother and possible depression in your sister. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a general overview. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Let’s just get this over with, shall we? I have a gardening club meeting this afternoon, and I don’t want to be too late.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly different from what you likely experience normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Knees show some expected wear and tear from the replacement, with mild swelling and decreased range of motion, but no acute signs of inflammation. Overall, everything appears stable.
PATIENT: Good. Glad to hear it’s all “stable,” as you say. I just want to feel like myself again. This…heaviness is exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nani. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with depression. The loss of interest in activities you enjoy, changes in sleep and appetite, feelings of heaviness and fatigue – these are all common signs. It's important to remember that this isn't a sign of weakness, and it is treatable. Would you be open to discussing some options for addressing this?
PATIENT: Treatable, you say? Well, that's a relief, at least. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve never been one for… talking about feelings. It wasn't something we did in my family. But if it will help me feel better…yes, I suppose. What sort of options are we talking about? I hope it doesn’t involve too much…fuss.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's okay to be hesitant, and we can take things at your pace. There are a few different options. The most common are talk therapy – that’s meeting with a therapist to discuss your feelings and develop coping strategies – and medication, specifically antidepressants, which can help rebalance the chemicals in your brain. Sometimes a combination of both is most effective. We can start with talk therapy, if you prefer. I can refer you to a wonderful therapist in the area. As for medication, we don't have to decide on that right now. We can see how therapy goes, and if you're not feeling improvement, we can discuss medication options then. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Therapy… that sounds… less frightening than pills, I suppose. Is it expensive? I have insurance, but… I don't want to rack up a huge bill. And who is this therapist? Are they… young? I’m not sure I'd be comfortable talking to someone very young.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Nani. Let’s address them one by one. Regarding cost, I’ll have my staff verify your insurance coverage and estimate your out-of-pocket expenses. We want to make sure this is affordable for you. As for the therapist, I recommend Dr. Evelyn Reed. She’s a very experienced therapist specializing in geriatric mental health. She's been practicing for over 20 years and is known for her compassionate approach. She’s around my age, actually, so I think you’d feel quite comfortable with her. I can give you her profile and contact information. Would you like me to proceed with a referral to Dr. Reed?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A referral to Dr. Reed sounds… reasonable. Someone closer to your age is definitely preferable. And please do have your staff check the insurance. I don't want any surprises. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel normal again. It’s been such a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nani. We’ll get that referral to Dr. Reed arranged right away, and my staff will contact you with the insurance details. In the meantime, I want you to know that I’m here for you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And please, try to be kind to yourself. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for listening. And thank you for not… dismissing me. I’ve been putting this off for a long time. Hopefully, Dr. Reed can help. I suppose I should get going, before I’m late for my meeting.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nani. It takes courage to ask for help, and I'm glad you did. I have a good feeling about Dr. Reed. Please, take care of yourself, and enjoy your gardening club meeting. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have questions. Here’s the referral information, and my staff will be in touch shortly. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
