DOCTOR: Hi Nani, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Hernandez. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, thank you. It’s… it's a bit difficult to explain, honestly. I suppose… I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately. A long time, now. And my daughter insisted I come. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of your daughter to look out for you. “Not feeling yourself” can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me a bit more specifically what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Honestly? Just… a heaviness. Everything feels… grey. I don’t enjoy things like I used to. Used to love my garden, loved swimming – I am a lifeguard, you know. Ski patrol in the winter. But now… it’s just effort. And I sleep a lot. Too much, probably. It's hard to get up in the mornings. I just… don’t see the point in much, these days. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Nani. That sounds really difficult. It sounds like you’ve experienced a significant change in how you’re feeling. When did you first start noticing this heaviness and lack of enjoyment?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It wasn't sudden, you see. It sort of… crept up on me. Perhaps… six months ago? After my divorce was finalized. That was… unsettling. It’s been hard adjusting to being on my own again after all these years. Though, truthfully, it wasn’t a happy marriage at the end. But still. Six months… yes, I think that’s about right. Perhaps a little longer. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or so, around the time of your divorce. That gives us a good starting point. And besides the heaviness and lack of enjoyment, are there any other symptoms you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Well… my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I used to love to cook, Nigerian food especially, very flavorful. Now, I just… pick at things. And I’m rather… forgetful, I suppose. Small things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, appointments… things like that. Though, at my age, one expects a little forgetfulness, doesn't one? I haven’t been sleeping well either, even though I sleep a lot. It’s just… restless sleep, you see? I wake up feeling tired. And… sometimes, I just feel… anxious. A sort of… fluttering in my chest. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, so loss of appetite, some forgetfulness, restless sleep despite sleeping a lot, and occasional anxiety. That’s helpful to know. Now, thinking about your past medical history, do you have any significant health conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not particularly. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. And… arthritis in my knees, of course. Comes with the territory, being a lifeguard for so long, all that activity. But nothing major. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. I see my general practitioner regularly for check-ups, and he always says I’m remarkably healthy for my age. Perhaps that’s why this is all so… baffling. I don’t feel healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension and arthritis. That’s good to know. And you see your general practitioner regularly. Do you remember when your last check-up was?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that is a good question. It was… sometime last year, I believe. Early last year, perhaps? Before… before things got worse. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn't what it used to be. My daughter handles most of those things now. She reminds me of appointments, keeps track of everything. I suppose I should be more organized. It’s just… difficult. It all feels rather overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me just take a quick look at your records here… Ah, yes. Your last visit with Dr. Olamide was February 15th, 2024. It does say here that your blood pressure was well-controlled. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Never had any surgeries. Always been quite lucky, in that regard. Just a few minor injuries over the years, scrapes and bruises from lifeguard duty, things like that. Nothing serious enough to require an operation. Though my daughter always worried I would break something, swimming and skiing like that. She was always a cautious one.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, thinking about your family, are there any health conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's… a difficult question. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart in her later years. Congestive heart failure, I believe. And my father… he suffered from diabetes. Type 2, I think. My sister, bless her soul, she had high blood pressure as well, like me. And… there was an uncle, on my husband’s side, who… well, he struggled with depression. Quite severely. He was never quite the same after his wife passed away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart issues, diabetes, and depression in the family. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a couple more questions, if you don’t mind. Could you tell me a little bit about your current living situation and social support?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I live alone, in a small bungalow in the suburbs. It’s… quite comfortable. I manage perfectly well, though I do have help with the gardening now. My daughter, Ada, she lives nearby, thankfully. She comes over most days to check on me, helps with the shopping, things like that. She’s a wonderful girl. Very attentive. I have a few friends from my church, we get together occasionally for tea. But… it's not the same as it used to be. People move away, get sick… it's just… lonely sometimes. Especially since the divorce.
DOCTOR: Okay. So you live alone, with good support from your daughter and some friends. Now, finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take Lisinopril for my blood pressure, as I mentioned before. Twenty milligrams a day. And… I used to take a vitamin D supplement, but I stopped taking it a few months ago. Didn't seem to be doing much good. And occasionally, when my arthritis flares up, I take Ibuprofen. Just as needed, though. Nothing else. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly Nigerian food, though my appetite hasn’t been very good lately, as I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. That gives me a really good understanding of what’s been going on. Based on what you’ve told me – the long-lasting heaviness, loss of enjoyment, sleep disturbances, appetite changes, occasional anxiety, and your family history – I'm concerned about the possibility of depression. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes first. I'd like to do a physical exam, just to get a baseline and check for any other contributing factors. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. It's just… nice to finally talk about it, to be honest. And I do trust your judgement. I haven’t felt myself for a long time now, and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to feel better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Blood pressure is 130/80, heart rate is 72 and regular. That's good. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Lungs are clear. Everything looks normal here. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. And finally, I'll just do a brief neurological exam… Everything appears to be within normal limits physically. However, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. If that’s what you think is best, then please do. I just want to know what’s wrong, and what I can do to feel better. My daughter Ada will be glad to help me schedule the appointment. She handles all of these things, you see. I suppose it's best to be sure, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It's always best to be thorough. And Ada sounds like a wonderful support. I'll write up the lab order now, and I'll also give you a referral to a psychologist. Based on what you've told me, talking to a professional could be very helpful, even if it’s just to explore your feelings and coping mechanisms. It doesn't necessarily mean you have depression, but it’s a good step to consider. I’ll also provide you with a list of local resources. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible, eat a healthy diet when you can, and continue doing activities you enjoy, even if you don’t feel like it. It's important to stay active. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A psychologist… yes, I suppose that makes sense. I haven’t really considered talking to someone before. Ada has suggested it a few times, but I’ve always been a bit… hesitant. I suppose my only question is… how long will it take to get the results of the blood work? And… will there be a charge for the psychologist visit? I have private insurance, but I’m always mindful of the cost.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable question. The blood work results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. The lab will bill your insurance directly, and you'll likely just have a copay, depending on your plan. I can have the billing department look into the exact cost for you, if you’d like. As for the psychologist visit, the cost will depend on whether you use someone in-network or out-of-network. I'll give you a list of in-network psychologists, and you can check with your insurance company about their coverage. I can also have my office staff help you verify your benefits. We don't want any surprises. I also want to assure you that seeking therapy is a sign of strength, not weakness. It can be incredibly helpful, even if you just need someone to talk to. Do you have any other questions, Nani?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that answers everything. You’ve been very thorough and kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I suppose I’ll wait for the blood work results, and then we’ll go from there. And I will talk to Ada about finding a psychologist. She'll be glad to help. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nani. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I’m here for you. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the results. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
