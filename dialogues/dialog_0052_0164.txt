DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. But I’ve been feeling really unwell after eating fava beans. I get very tired and… yellow. My skin turns yellow, and my eyes too. It started a few weeks ago, and it only happens after I eat them.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Haggar. It's good you've identified a specific trigger food – that’s very helpful. “Very tired and yellow,” as you put it, indicates we need to explore this further. To clarify, when you say a few weeks ago, can you recall approximately how many weeks?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe around four or five weeks, I'd say. It was after a barbecue with some friends, and someone made a fava bean dip. I didn't think much of it at first, but then it happened again when I tried them at a restaurant. It's definitely the fava beans. I just… I don’t know why they’re making me sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, approximately four to five weeks. And it's consistently after consuming fava beans. That narrows things down. The yellowing of your skin and eyes – medically, we call that jaundice – is a significant symptom. Before we proceed, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and jaundice?
PATIENT: Oh, jaundice, is that what it’s called? Yes, that sounds right. Let me see… well, sometimes I feel a bit weak, like I might faint. And my tummy… it gets a little uncomfortable, like a dull ache. Not terrible, but noticeable. Oh, and I've been going to the bathroom… more often than usual, if you know what I mean. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Ms. Haggar, thank you for letting me know. Weakness, abdominal discomfort, and increased frequency of bowel movements – all potentially relevant. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the color of your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s a bit awkward. Um… it's lighter than usual. Not white, but definitely not the normal brown color. More… clay-colored, I suppose. It’s been like that since this all started with the fava beans. I didn’t really pay much attention until you asked, honestly. It’s just… not normal.
DOCTOR: I understand, and it's good you're sharing all of this with me. “Clay-colored” stool is a particularly important detail. It suggests we need to investigate the possibility of a blockage in the bile ducts. Before we move to a physical examination, let me ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing that I know of. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I've had the usual colds and flu, of course, but never anything serious. I don’t take any regular medication either. My family… my mother had some problems with her gallbladder when she was older, but I don’t think that’s relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Haggar. And yes, your mother’s gallbladder issues are relevant. Gallbladder problems can sometimes be hereditary. Just to be thorough, have you ever had your gallbladder removed, or had any surgery involving your abdomen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I’ve never had any surgery at all. I'm quite careful with what I eat, usually. This whole thing with the fava beans is really strange. I mean, I ate them when I was a child and never had a problem. It just started recently, like you said, four or five weeks ago. It's making me quite anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Haggar. It's concerning when something changes suddenly, especially regarding your health. Given your history, the timing of the symptoms, and the clay-colored stools, we need to investigate the possibility of a problem with your gallbladder or bile ducts. I’d like to perform a physical exam now. I’ll listen to your abdomen, feel for any tenderness, and check for signs of jaundice. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Please, go ahead. I want to figure out what’s going on, so anything you need to do, just let me know. I'm a little worried, but I trust your expertise. Where should I lie down?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you, Ms. Haggar. Please lie down on your back, with your arms at your sides. Okay. I’m going to gently press on different areas of your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. Everything seems relatively normal so far, but I do detect a slight tenderness in the upper right quadrant, where your gallbladder is located. Your sclera – the white part of your eyes – does indeed show a yellowish tint, confirming the jaundice you described. No significant distension or masses are palpable. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Yes, that part… the upper right side… it’s a little uncomfortable when you press. Not sharp pain, just… a dull ache, like I mentioned before. And yes, my eyes have been feeling strange, like they're gritty. I hadn’t really connected the two things. That makes sense, though. I'm glad you're listening to my lungs too, just to be thorough. I appreciate it. Is that tenderness… is that bad?
DOCTOR: That tenderness could indicate inflammation of the gallbladder, Ms. Haggar, but we need further testing to confirm the cause. Listening to your lungs is standard procedure to rule out any other contributing factors. Based on your history and the physical examination, the most likely possibility is cholecystitis – inflammation of the gallbladder – potentially triggered by something you ate, in this case, the fava beans. However, it’s also important to rule out other causes of jaundice, such as a blockage in the bile ducts or a liver problem. I want to order some blood tests to check your liver function and bilirubin levels. I also recommend an ultrasound of your abdomen to visualize your gallbladder and bile ducts. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests and an ultrasound… absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on and how to fix it. I’m a little worried about a blockage, if I’m honest. Is that common? And what happens if it is the gallbladder? Do I need surgery? I’m sorry to ask so many questions, but I’m a bit frightened.
DOCTOR: You’re not at all asking too many questions, Ms. Haggar. It’s perfectly natural to be concerned, and I want to ensure you understand everything. A blockage in the bile ducts is less common than inflammation of the gallbladder itself, but it's important to rule it out. The ultrasound will give us a clearer picture. If it is cholecystitis, the usual treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder – a procedure called a cholecystectomy. Fortunately, it's a very common and generally safe procedure, often performed laparoscopically – meaning through small incisions, resulting in a quicker recovery. We’ll discuss all your options in detail if that becomes necessary. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests and ultrasound now. The lab is just down the hall, and the radiology department is on the third floor. The results usually take a few hours, and my nurse, Sarah, will contact you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding fatty foods and, of course, fava beans. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies to medications that I know of, Doctor. Okay, no fatty foods or fava beans… I can do that. Avoiding fava beans won’t be a problem, I assure you! I’m a little worried about the surgery, but if that’s what’s best, I trust your judgement. Should I be looking out for any specific symptoms while I’m waiting for the results? Like, if things get worse, should I come back right away? Or is a bit of discomfort normal? I just want to be prepared. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor Shely. It makes me feel a little better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. It’s important to me that you feel informed and comfortable. Yes, please monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any of the following, please come to the emergency room immediately: Severe abdominal pain, especially if it's constant and radiating to your back or shoulder High fever Yellowing of your skin spreading rapidly Dark urine or pale stools Nausea and vomiting that prevents you from keeping fluids down A bit of discomfort is not uncommon, but if the pain worsens or becomes unbearable, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. I'll also have Sarah give you a list of those symptoms to take with you. I’ve written the orders and Sarah will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide further instructions. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and for explaining everything so thoroughly. I really appreciate it. I’ll keep a close eye on my symptoms and will contact you if anything changes. Just waiting for Sarah now, I suppose. Thank you again.
