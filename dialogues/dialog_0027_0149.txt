DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Wynell. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Dr… Fazzina, was it? Yes, well. It’s about this…fuss they’re trying to make over my feet. Honestly, I don’t see what the bother is. People make such a deal out of nothing these days. I just want to be left alone about it, really.
DOCTOR: Right, your feet. I see here that there was a note about some concerns… perhaps swelling or pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Swelling? Oh, there might be a little… but I’ve lived a long life, you know. Things get a little puffy here and there. It's just… old age, dear. They act like it’s a crisis. And all these tests… honestly. What is the point of poking and prodding? I haven't got time for all that.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. It's good you've lived a long and full life. We do want to rule out anything serious, just to be safe. Even a little swelling can sometimes indicate a larger issue, especially with changes over time. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the swelling, and if it's gotten worse recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I notice? That’s… a good question. Honestly, it all blurs together after a while, you know? Probably… a few months ago? Maybe longer. I really don’t remember. I mostly notice it when I’m trying to put on my shoes, and those silly things are getting tighter every day. It hasn't been aggressively worse, if that makes any sense. Just… present. It’s always been present, a little bit. My daughter keeps fussing over it, that’s how this whole thing started. She worries too much, that girl.
DOCTOR: It sounds like it's been gradual, and that's helpful to know. And daughters do tend to worry. Let’s try to get a better understanding. Besides the tightness in your shoes, have you noticed any other changes with your feet?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… they feel a bit wider, I suppose. Not dramatically, mind you. But getting into some of my nicer shoes is a bit of a struggle now. And sometimes, if I’ve been on my feet for a while, they ache. A dull ache, nothing terrible. I just… put my feet up and it goes away. I used to be able to dance all night, you know. Not so much these days. Everything slows down eventually.
DOCTOR: Dancing all night… that sounds lovely. It’s good to hear you were so active. And it's helpful to know about the aching – that does give us some clues. Now, have you noticed any changes in the skin on your feet?
PATIENT: Skin? Oh… let me think. It's… drier, maybe? Older skin gets drier, doesn’t it? I put lotion on, of course. I always have. I try to keep myself presentable. Not like some people, letting themselves go. But no, no sores or anything. Just… dry. And sometimes a little flaky. Nothing to write home about. Honestly, I think they're just trying to find something wrong with me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Wynell. It doesn’t sound like anything alarming, but we do want to be thorough. Just one more quick question about your general health. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes or heart problems – that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. My daughter keeps telling me about things… something with my sugar, I think? She's always monitoring it. And my heart… the doctor said something about a flutter now and then, but nothing that needed… fixing. I take a little pill for it, I suppose. Nothing major. I mostly just try to ignore everything and get on with my life, you know? All this poking and prodding makes me feel worse than whatever's actually wrong with me!
DOCTOR: Alright, let me just review this quickly. It sounds like you've been diagnosed with diabetes and have a history of some heart arrhythmia, and you're currently taking medication for it. Knowing that is very helpful. Would you mind telling me the name of the medication you take for your heart?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. The name of the medication? Honestly, I have no idea. It's a little white pill. I think my daughter handles all of that. She puts them in those little boxes with the days of the week on them. I just take what she gives me. I wouldn’t even know where to begin looking! It’s all very confusing, you know. I just want to be left alone with my feet. Is it too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it's not too much to ask at all, Wynell. And I completely understand. It's very common for patients to not remember medication names. We can certainly get that information from your daughter or from the pharmacy. Now, since you mentioned diabetes, do you regularly check your blood sugar levels?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My daughter makes me prick my finger every morning. It’s… unpleasant, to say the least. And she fusses over the numbers. Says they need to be within a certain range. I mostly just try not to think about it. It’s all very stressful, you know. I was much happier when I didn't have to worry about all this. Now, can we please talk about something else? My feet are perfectly fine, honestly. They've carried me a long way, and they deserve a bit of peace and quiet.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Wynell. Your feet have carried you a long way, and you deserve to feel comfortable. Given your history of diabetes and the changes you’ve described with your feet, I would like to do a quick physical exam just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It won’t be anything painful, just a visual inspection and some simple tests to check sensation and circulation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. More poking and prodding? I really don’t see the point. It’s just going to tell you what I already know – that I’m an old woman with tired feet. But… alright. If you must. Just promise me it won’t take long. And please, be gentle. I don't need any more fuss, thank you very much. And don't start talking about surgery or anything like that. I’ve heard stories… I won’t stand for it.
DOCTOR: I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible, Wynell. And I absolutely won’t discuss surgery unless it’s absolutely necessary, and we’d have a very thorough conversation about all your options first. Let’s start with just looking at your feet. Could you please take off your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? Honestly, you'd think I was presenting you with a complicated medical mystery. It's just feet, dear. Old woman feet. Not exactly groundbreaking. Just get it over with, alright? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your pulses feel a little weak, but present. And sensation seems slightly diminished in your toes… not significantly, but enough that we should pay attention. There’s also some redness around your ankles, which could be a sign of inflammation. The swelling is most noticeable on the tops and sides of your feet. Do you feel any pain when I touch here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, a little bit. Not terrible, but… sensitive. I told you, I’ve got tired feet. And everything feels a little sore when you poke around. Honestly, you're just making things worse. I just want to go home and put my feet up. Is that too much to ask? Can we be done now? This is all very upsetting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell, we can stop here. I understand your discomfort. Given your history of diabetes, the slightly diminished sensation, weak pulses, and some redness and pain, I'm a little concerned about the circulation in your feet. It's possible you have some peripheral artery disease, which is common in people with diabetes, or some early signs of neuropathy. I want to be cautious and order a few simple tests - a blood test to check your blood sugar levels and a vascular study to assess the circulation in your legs and feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly, you're determined to run me ragged. I haven't got the energy for all of this. And what about this “peripheral artery disease” and “neuropathy”? Sounds dreadful. I just want my feet to be left alone, not poked and prodded and given complicated medical names. I don't want any fancy procedures or anything like that. Can't you just…tell me they're fine? Or give me a cream or something? I really don't want to go through all this fuss. It's too much. Just too much. .
