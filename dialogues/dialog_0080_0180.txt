DOCTOR: Hi Hedy, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. It's… this tiredness. It's just awful. And… and I’ve been eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but… I just… need it. Does that make sense? It’s embarrassing, honestly. I don't know why I’m doing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. It does sound a little unusual, but don’t worry, you’re in a safe space. We’ll figure this out together. First, let’s talk about this tiredness. When did it start?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't really remember when exactly. A while ago. Maybe… last year? Everything’s kinda blurry these days. It just… got worse. Slowly. And now… now it's hard to even get out of bed. I used to be able to… well, I used to do things. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been gradually worsening over the past year. And it’s significantly impacting your daily life now, making it hard to get out of bed and do things you used to enjoy. Do you feel tired all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: All the time. Always. Even when I sleep, I don't feel rested. It’s… frustrating. And the dirt… I keep telling you, that started around the same time, I think. It's not like I want to eat it, it's just… a feeling. A need.
DOCTOR: Alright, constant fatigue even after sleep, and this craving for dirt… that started roughly a year ago alongside the tiredness. Okay. Has anything else changed in the past year?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… My husband… he passed away a couple years back now. Before all this started, I guess. It was… hard. Still is. Other than that… no, not really. I just mostly stay home. Don't see many people.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your husband, Hedy. That must have been incredibly difficult. Losing someone close can definitely have a huge impact on your health. Staying home and not seeing many people… okay. Now, let's talk about the dirt craving a little more specifically. Where do you get the dirt from?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t get me started. It's embarrassing! From the garden, mostly. I try to get it from where the dog doesn't… you know. And sometimes I find little bits in the potted plants. Don't judge me! It's not like I’m eating a lot of it. Just… enough to feel… better. Briefly.
DOCTOR: I’m not judging you at all, Hedy. It’s important to be honest about things like this so we can figure out what’s going on. The garden dirt… so it's soil from your own yard and potted plants. And you said it makes you feel briefly better. How long does that feeling last?
PATIENT: Not long. A few minutes, maybe. Then it’s gone, and I just feel… empty again. It's stupid, I know. It doesn’t solve anything. But it's… a compulsion, I guess. I just… do it. And then I feel guilty, and tired, and… I just want to lie down.
DOCTOR: Okay, a brief sense of relief followed by guilt and increased fatigue. This is helpful. Now, have you noticed any other unusual cravings – not just dirt – or any changes in your appetite overall?
PATIENT: Ugh, cravings? Not really. I just… don’t eat much. Food doesn't taste good anymore. Everything’s kinda bland. I used to love cooking, but… what’s the point? I mostly just pick at things. A little bit of soup, maybe. It’s easier.
DOCTOR: Alright, loss of appetite and food tasting bland alongside the fatigue and dirt craving. Okay. Have you had any recent weight loss, Hedy?
PATIENT: Probably. I haven't really been trying to lose weight, if that makes sense. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven't actually… weighed myself. Honestly, I don't even bother. What's the point in that either? It's just another thing to feel bad about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so clothes are looser, but you haven’t weighed yourself. Now, let's quickly go through some other things. Do you have any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Ugh, pain? Sometimes. My joints ache, mostly. Knees, hips, that sort of thing. I just figured it's old age. I’m not getting any younger, you know. It comes and goes, nothing constant. Just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent joint pain. Okay. Now, one last quick question before I do a quick physical exam. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or anything unusual about your stool?
PATIENT: Look, do we have to talk about this? Really? Ugh, fine. It’s… normal, I guess. Nothing different. Look, I’m telling you, I just need more energy. Is that too much to ask? This whole thing is ridiculous. I want to go home.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy. It is a lot to go through, and I apologize for asking personal questions. We're just trying to gather as much information as possible to help you feel better. Okay. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Hurry up, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is a little low – 108/62. Pulse is 78, regular. Lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Now, I’m going to check your thyroid. Your thyroid feels… slightly enlarged. It’s not dramatically so, but it's worth noting. Skin is normal, no lesions. Now, let’s take a look at your nails. Your nails look a little pale, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to ask you to open your mouth. Mouth looks normal, no signs of anemia. Okay. That's all for now. It was a quick exam. I'd like to order some bloodwork. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? Of course. Just… get it over with. What are you looking for? Is this serious? Honestly, you're scaring me now. I just wanted some energy!
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Hedy. I don't want to scare you, but it’s important to rule things out. We’re going to check your complete blood count – that will tell us if you're anemic, which could explain the fatigue and pale nails. We'll also check your thyroid function – given the slight enlargement I felt, we want to see if that's contributing to your symptoms. And we’ll check your iron levels, vitamin D, and B12, just to be thorough. We’ll also do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. It's a pretty standard set of tests. The dirt eating – that’s called pica – can sometimes be a sign of an iron deficiency, or other nutrient deficiencies, so we’re going to investigate that thoroughly too. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to find out. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Fine. Just... write down whatever I need to do. I don’t want to have to come back here again. Honestly, I’m probably just stressed. My husband would… nevermind. Just tell me where to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, here’s the requisition. You can go to the lab just down the hall - room 203. They'll take some blood samples. It should take about 15-20 minutes. After the lab, the results will be sent to me, and I'll give you a call as soon as I have them – usually within a couple of business days. While we wait for the results, I'm also going to write you a prescription for a daily multivitamin, just to cover any potential deficiencies. It won’t cure everything, but it's a good place to start. And Hedy, if you start feeling worse – if you get dizzy, or really weak, or have any chest pain – go to the emergency room immediately, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just... give me the papers. And... thank you. I guess. Honestly, I don't know what I'd do without someone telling me what to do. . I’m going to go.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Hedy. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. And please, if anything changes, don't wait for a call from me. Take care of yourself. I’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: .
