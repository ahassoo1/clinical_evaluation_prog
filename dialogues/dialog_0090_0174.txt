DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s… a long story, I suppose. I just feel very… down. Not enjoying things like I used to. It's been going on for a little while now, and frankly, I’m tired of feeling this way. I suppose that’s what you’re here for, isn't it? To figure out why an old woman feels a bit blue?
DOCTOR: "A bit blue," is one way to put it. It’s good you’re here to discuss it, though. It’s never just “an old woman feeling a bit blue.” We need to understand what’s going on. How long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… it’s hard to pinpoint exactly. Perhaps… six months now? Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, you see. Just… less enthusiasm for things. I used to love my garden, absolutely loved it. Now, I look at it and… it just feels like work. And I haven’t even been doing much of that. I just… sit. It's silly, really. An active woman like me, reduced to sitting. Do you… need a precise date? Because I’m not very good with dates these days.
DOCTOR: Six months is helpful, even approximate. It's not silly at all, Ms. Derasmo. Changes in enjoyment are significant. Have you noticed any other changes along with this loss of enthusiasm?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… Well, my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don't feel hungry, you understand. I eat, because I know I should, but it doesn’t bring me any pleasure. And… I sleep a lot. More than usual. Not necessarily well, mind you. Just… a lot. I wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. And… perhaps a little more irritable. My grandson came to visit last month, a lovely boy, and I… well, I didn’t have the patience I usually do. I feel bad thinking about it. Is that… is that what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Derasmo, that’s very helpful. Loss of appetite, increased sleep, irritability… These are all important pieces of the puzzle. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I believe I have. I haven’t weighed myself precisely in a while, my scale isn’t very reliable, but my clothes feel looser. Not a dramatic amount, mind you. I wouldn't say I'm wasting away! But… certainly noticeable. My daughter commented on it when she visited. She said I looked… thinner. I brushed it off, said I was just eating smaller portions. But… she might be right. Is that… concerning? I haven’t been feeling ill, if that makes any difference. No fever, no aches, just… this general lack of… spirit.
DOCTOR: Weight loss is always something we need to investigate, Ms. Derasmo, even if you aren't feeling ill otherwise. Let me just review your medical history here… Okay, I see you had your gallbladder removed several years ago, and routine check-ups, nothing major. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. The gallbladder was… unpleasant at the time, but it was a long time ago. And routine check-ups, yes, I try to keep on top of those. I had a bit of trouble with my knee a few years back, skiing accident, but it’s mostly healed now. Physical therapy helped tremendously. Oh! And I had a touch of pneumonia a long time ago, but that was decades ago. Truly, Doctor, I'm a relatively healthy woman for my age. Or… was, I suppose. Before this… feeling. I’m not sure if any of that’s relevant. I just… don't want you to waste your time on old injuries. It must be something else.
DOCTOR: Everything is relevant, Ms. Derasmo. But I understand your concern. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just my blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. I’ve been taking that for years. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knee, if it acts up, but not very often. Oh, and a multivitamin. Just a standard one, for older people. Nothing fancy. I try to keep things simple. I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it. Do you need the dosages? I can look them up if necessary, but I don’t have them memorized.
DOCTOR: Ms. Derasmo, have you been feeling hopeless or having thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a rather blunt question, Doctor. Not that I'm ungrateful, mind you. But… No. No, I haven’t been thinking of… not wanting to be here. It’s just… tiring. Everything feels so heavy and pointless. I miss feeling joy. I miss my garden. I miss having energy. It's not that I don't want to live, it’s just… the color has gone out of things, you understand? It’s a bit different, I think. I just wish… I wish I could feel like myself again. But thoughts of… ending things? No. Definitely not. I have my grandson, you see. I wouldn't do that to him.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Derasmo. Thank you for being so honest with me. It’s good that you have your grandson. It sounds like you have a strong support system. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just to rule out any underlying physical causes for how you’re feeling. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary, of course. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just hope it’s not something serious. I’m not a fan of doctors’ visits, generally, but I understand you need to be thorough. Just… please be gentle with my knee. It still bothers me sometimes, especially in cold weather. Do you need me to undress? Or just… a blood pressure check? Perhaps just tell me what you need me to do, and I’ll comply. I'm used to following instructions.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. Let's start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, and just a quick check of your reflexes. After that, I'll do a brief neurological exam. And yes, we'll be gentle with your knee. You can stay fully clothed for most of it, just roll up your sleeves for the blood pressure. And if anything feels uncomfortable, please tell me immediately. Okay, blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Let's listen to your heart now… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs sound clear… Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… Good.
PATIENT: Alright. Everything sounds… normal? I'm not very good at interpreting those things, of course. I just know when something feels off. And right now, nothing feels particularly off, physically. Just… this weight inside. It's hard to explain. It's not a pain, it's not a weakness, it's just… a hollowness. Will the neurological exam tell you anything? I read in the newspaper about… well, never mind. It's probably just old age catching up with me. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll cooperate. Just try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: It's good you're able to articulate how you’re feeling, Ms. Derasmo. And no, I won't poke too much. The neurological exam will help us assess your reflexes, balance, and coordination – just to rule out anything that might be contributing to how you’re feeling. It's fairly routine. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. It’s… a bit tiring, actually. My eyes aren’t what they used to be. I need stronger glasses, I suspect. But I can follow it. Up and down, left and right… Is that alright? Am I doing it correctly? I always worry about doing things wrong at the doctor's office. It's silly, I know. But I want to be helpful. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. Or if I'm being a nuisance. I don't mean to be.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Ms. Derasmo. No, you're not being a nuisance at all. Your eye movements are normal. Now, could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that too much? I don't want to break your hand, Doctor. I have a surprisingly strong grip for an old woman. Years of gardening, I suppose. I used to be able to lift heavy pots, but now… not so much. It's all getting harder. My hands are a bit shaky, too. It's probably just nerves. But yes, I squeezed as tightly as I could. I felt a little… strain in my wrist. Is that normal? Should I stop? I don't want to cause you any trouble.
DOCTOR: A little strain is not unusual, especially if you're not used to squeezing. Your grip strength is slightly diminished, but not significantly so for your age. And yes, a little shakiness is common as well. Now, let's check your reflexes. I'm going to gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. It might be a little surprising, but it shouldn’t be painful. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright. The little hammer… It doesn’t sound very pleasant. But… if you think it’s necessary, go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. My knees are sensitive, you see. I’ve had a few… mishaps over the years. Skiing, mostly. And gardening. I seem to injure myself even when I'm not trying. But yes, go ahead. Do it quickly, perhaps? I don't like dwelling on things. It just makes them worse. Just… tap quickly and tell me what you find. I'm ready. Though not particularly enthusiastic, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Everything appears to be neurologically intact. Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Based on the physical exam, there's nothing obvious physically causing your symptoms. However, given the length of time you've been feeling this way, and the constellation of symptoms – loss of enjoyment, fatigue, appetite changes, sleep disturbances, weight loss – I suspect you may be experiencing depression. It’s not a sign of weakness, and it's very treatable. Would you be open to discussing some options?
PATIENT: Depression… It figures. My daughter mentioned something similar last time she visited, but I dismissed it. I thought I was just… tired. Old. But… yes, perhaps you’re right. It makes a sort of… sense. I’ve never been one for… talking about my feelings. I prefer to keep things bottled up, really. But… if you think it’s the best course of action, I’m willing to listen to my options. I just… I don't want to be on a lot of medication. I’m already taking pills for my blood pressure, and I’d rather not add to the list if possible. Are there… other options? Perhaps talking? Or… I don’t know. What are my choices, Doctor? Please be honest with me. I'm a practical woman, and I want to know what I'm getting into.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your reluctance to start medication, Ms. Derasmo. And it's good you're a practical woman. We have several options. Medication is one, but it's not always necessary, especially with mild to moderate depression. We could start with therapy – talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is often very effective in helping people identify and change negative thought patterns. There are also other types of therapy available. Another option is lifestyle changes. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and good sleep hygiene can make a significant difference. We can discuss strategies for incorporating those into your routine. And, of course, there’s always the possibility of a combination of approaches. Before we make any decisions, I’d like to ask you a few more questions, just to get a better understanding of your current situation and see what might be the best fit for you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Questions are fine. As long as they're not too personal. I’m a private person, you see. But I'm willing to cooperate, if it means finding a solution. And yes, I agree that a combination of approaches might be best. I don’t want to rely solely on pills. Exercise… well, I used to enjoy gardening, but that’s become… difficult. And my knee bothers me. But I suppose I could try to walk more. And yes, I’ve always tried to eat a healthy diet. Though my appetite hasn’t been very good lately. Go ahead, Doctor. Ask your questions. I'm ready. Well, as ready as I can be, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Let's start with your social situation. Do you have a lot of close friends or family you see regularly?
PATIENT: That's… a bit of a complicated question. My husband passed away several years ago. We didn’t have any children. I have a daughter, thankfully, a lovely girl. But she lives several states away, and we don’t see each other very often. Perhaps a few times a year. She calls, of course, but it’s not the same. And… I have a few acquaintances, people I see at church or at the grocery store. But I wouldn’t call them close friends, exactly. I used to have a wider social circle, but… people move away, or… things change. I spend a lot of time alone, to be honest. Is that… concerning? I'm not a particularly sociable person, to begin with. I prefer my own company. But I suppose it’s not healthy to be completely isolated.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily concerning, Ms. Derasmo, but social isolation can definitely contribute to feelings of depression. It's good that you have a daughter you can talk to, even if she lives far away. Now, let's talk about your daily routine. What does a typical day look like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A typical day… well, it’s not very exciting, I’m afraid. I usually wake up around seven or eight o’clock. I have a cup of tea, and perhaps a piece of toast. Then I read the newspaper, or watch a bit of television. I might do a few chores around the house, but I don’t exert myself too much. My energy levels are low, you see. I often sit in the garden for a while, but I don’t do much gardening anymore. I just… look at the flowers. I have lunch around noon, and then I might take a nap. In the afternoon, I might visit with a neighbor, or go to the grocery store. I have dinner around six o’clock, and then I watch some more television before going to bed. It’s… a very quiet life. A bit monotonous, perhaps. But it’s what I’m used to. It’s not exactly a stimulating existence, but it’s comfortable. Is that… adequate? I suppose it’s a bit sad, when you put it into words. But it’s my routine.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a comfortable routine, Ms. Derasmo, but it also sounds like you might be missing some things that used to bring you joy. And it’s perfectly normal to feel sad when you acknowledge that. Now, have you experienced any significant losses or stressful life events recently, besides your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: Well… my husband passed away five years ago, as I mentioned. That was… a difficult time, of course. We were married for forty years. It took me a long time to adjust to being alone. And… my daughter has been having some difficulties at work. She’s a teacher, and the school district is facing some budget cuts. She’s worried about losing her job. It’s… stressful for her, and that worries me. And… my grandson, he’s been having some problems in school. He’s a bright boy, but he’s struggling with his studies. I try to help him as much as I can, but I’m not sure I’m doing enough. And… my health hasn’t been very good lately, as I mentioned. My energy levels are low, and my knee bothers me. It’s… a lot, when you put it all together. I try to stay positive, but it’s difficult sometimes. Is that… significant? I don’t want to burden you with my troubles, Doctor. But I suppose that’s what you’re here for.
DOCTOR: It’s not a burden at all, Ms. Derasmo. In fact, it’s very helpful for me to understand what’s going on in your life. What you’ve described – the loss of your husband, your daughter’s worries, your grandson’s struggles, your own health concerns – those are all significant stressors. And they can definitely contribute to feelings of depression. Based on everything you’ve told me today, I believe you are experiencing depression. It’s not a sign of weakness, and it’s very treatable. I recommend we start with therapy, perhaps Cognitive Behavioral Therapy , to help you identify and manage the negative thought patterns that are contributing to your feelings. We can also discuss lifestyle changes – regular exercise, a healthy diet, good sleep hygiene – to improve your overall well-being. I’m also going to prescribe a low dose of an antidepressant, just to help lift your mood. We can monitor your response, and adjust the dosage if needed. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Therapy… and medication. I suppose that’s what I expected. I’m… hesitant about the medication, but I suppose I’m willing to try it, if you think it’s necessary. I’ve never been one for taking pills, but… I’m willing to give it a chance. And therapy… that sounds… helpful, perhaps. I’ve never done anything like that before. I’m a private person, as I mentioned. But I suppose it’s worth a try, if it means feeling better. I suppose my biggest concern is… will it work? I’m tired of feeling this way. I just want to feel like myself again. I want to enjoy my garden, and spend time with my grandson. I want to feel… hopeful. Is that too much to ask? Alright. I’ll try it. Therapy and medication. But… please be patient with me, Doctor. It’s going to take time, isn’t it? I’m not a quick fix. And… I’m a bit scared, if I’m honest. But I’m willing to try.
DOCTOR: It will take time, Ms. Derasmo, and that’s perfectly alright. There’s no quick fix, and I will be patient with you every step of the way. And it’s perfectly normal to be scared. It takes courage to ask for help, and you’ve already taken the first step. I’m going to write you a referral to a therapist who specializes in CBT. Her name is Dr. Anya Sharma. I’ll also give you a prescription for Sertraline, a low-dose antidepressant. It may take a few weeks to start feeling the effects, and there may be some side effects at first, but we can monitor those closely. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks, just to check in on your progress and see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Dr. Sharma… I’ll look forward to meeting her. And Sertraline… I’ll pick up the prescription tomorrow. Two weeks… that gives me time to adjust. I suppose I should… prepare myself for some side effects. Is there anything I should be aware of? Anything I should tell Dr. Sharma? Thank you, Doctor. For… listening. And for not dismissing me. It’s… reassuring to know that you’re taking me seriously. I suppose… I feel a little bit better already, just knowing that there’s a plan. A little bit of hope, perhaps. Alright. Two weeks. I’ll be in touch. And thank you again, Doctor. For everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. That’s what I’m here for. As for side effects with Sertraline, the most common ones are nausea, diarrhea, and sleep disturbances. They’re usually mild and temporary, and they often subside after a few weeks. It's also important to be aware that it may take a few weeks to start feeling the effects of the medication. As for Dr. Sharma, just be honest with her about your feelings and concerns. She’s very experienced and compassionate, and she’ll be able to help you develop coping strategies and work through your challenges. I’m glad you’re feeling a little bit better already. That’s a great first step. And remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Here are the referral and prescription. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Ms. Derasmo. And I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Kur. I truly appreciate your kindness. I will call if I have any questions. Goodbye. And… thank you again. .
