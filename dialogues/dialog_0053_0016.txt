DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my wife’s medication. She’s been on a blood thinner for a while now, and lately she’s been bruising like a peach. It’s concerning, frankly. She wasn't like this before.
DOCTOR: Bruising, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, bruising. Everywhere. Little bumps, mostly, but they turn purple and… well, they just don’t seem to go away quickly. And she complains of aches, though honestly, at her age, what doesn’t ache? It just seems… worse lately. It's the bruising I'm worried about. Is the dosage wrong, perhaps? She’s very diligent about taking it, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Right. And what blood thinner is she currently taking?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I wouldn't have the faintest idea. She handles all that. I just… bring her here when something's not right. It's… Warfarin, perhaps? Is that it? She mentioned something sounding like that, a while back. She keeps the bottles, of course, but I don’t bother with all that. I’m a physician myself, you know. Pathology, not general practice. Different skillset entirely.
DOCTOR: Warfarin, yes. Okay. And how long has she been on it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It must be… five years now, maybe six? It was shortly after her hip replacement. A dreadful ordeal, that was. But the medication has kept things stable, or had kept things stable. Until now. It’s just… I expect a certain level of competence, you understand. She’s a very particular woman, and I assumed everything was being managed correctly. This bruising… it feels… sloppy.
DOCTOR: Right. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Well, she’s been a bit more… forgetful, perhaps. Nothing drastic. Misplacing her glasses, things like that. And she started a new… knitting class, I believe. It's all rather…domestic. She’s retired, you see. Needs to keep busy. But no, nothing major. No new medications, no falls, no… adventures. Just the bruising and the general… decline, which, frankly, is expected at her age. I just want to be sure this medication isn’t the cause.
DOCTOR: Well, we'll need to do a little investigating. I'd like to get a full blood count and a PT/INR to see where her levels are at currently. Do you recall when the last blood test was done?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, no. I do not recall. She handles all these appointments and tests. I simply drive her here. She has a file, of course, but I wouldn’t know where to begin. I'm a pathologist, remember? I look at tissue, not blood work. Perhaps you could check with her primary care physician? She sees Dr. Eldridge. A perfectly competent woman, I’m sure. Though she does tend to over-explain things. Honestly, sometimes I just wish someone would tell me what’s wrong and what needs to be done. This whole process is rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll need something to work with. Let me see if we can access her records here. And while I’m doing that, perhaps you could tell me a little more about these aches she’s experiencing?
PATIENT: Aches… well, it's the usual sort of thing. Joint pain, mostly. Her knees bother her, and her lower back. She complains of stiffness in the mornings. It's hardly remarkable, Doctor. She's… an older woman. I suspect it's just arthritis. She refuses to take anything for it, you see. Says it doesn't help. And frankly, I've given up trying to convince her otherwise. She’s a very strong-willed woman, my wife. Terribly stubborn, actually. It’s a wonder she let me bring her here at all. Really, the bruising is the main concern. It’s… unsettling. It’s not like her.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm seeing some results here. Her last INR was checked three months ago and was within the therapeutic range. However, there's a notation that she had a minor fall approximately six weeks ago, but didn't seek medical attention. Did you know about this fall?
PATIENT: A fall? No, absolutely not! She would have told me. She always tells me if she's had a fall. Unless… unless it was very minor. Perhaps a stumble? She’s a bit unsteady on her feet sometimes, especially when she’s distracted. But a fall? No, I was not aware of that. That’s… concerning. She should have said something. Honestly, she’s becoming quite forgetful, and that’s rather worrying. A fall and not mentioning it… that’s not like her at all. This is… troubling, Doctor. Very troubling.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the fact that she had a fall, even a minor one, could explain the bruising. It’s also possible her INR has fluctuated since the last test. We'll need to repeat the blood work, and I'd recommend a thorough neurological exam just to be safe. And I strongly suggest she see her primary care physician about her increasing forgetfulness. It's important to rule out any underlying cognitive issues. Do you think you could schedule that for her?
PATIENT: Cognitive issues… Oh, dear. Honestly, this is all rather… upsetting. Yes, yes, I suppose I can schedule an appointment with Dr. Eldridge. Though she will no doubt want to run a battery of tests, and my wife hates tests. But, yes, I’ll do it. I'll schedule it. And the blood work, of course. Yes. Just… tell me what needs to be done, Doctor. I'll handle it. I just… I’m a pathologist, not a… a scheduler. This is all rather… a lot. It’s just concerning to see her decline, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. I'm going to order a complete blood count, PT/INR, and a basic metabolic panel. The lab is just down the hall. And I'll write a referral to Dr. Eldridge for a cognitive assessment. You'll need to make an appointment with her office. I'll also have the nurse take her vital signs and get a brief neurological assessment done before you leave. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… efficient. Vital signs, neurological assessment, blood work, appointment with Dr. Eldridge. Yes. Just… tell me where to go for the blood work, and I'll take it from there. Honestly, the sooner this is all sorted out, the better. It's… unsettling to see her like this. She's always been so… independent. And to think she didn’t mention a fall… Just the blood work, Doctor. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Down the hall, second door on the left. The lab technician will be expecting you. And I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to get those vital signs started. Is there anything else I can help you with at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I believe that’s all. Just the blood work, and the appointment. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to… sort through all of this. It’s… reassuring to have a plan, at least. Though, honestly, I suspect it's all just old age. I’ll go and get the blood work done, then. .
