DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been… forgetting things. Little things, mostly, but it’s happening more and more, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned when you notice changes in your memory, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s good that you’re addressing it. Could you tell me a little more about these “little things” you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm… where to start? Like, I’ll go to the grocery store for something specific, and then completely blank on what it was when I get there. Or I’ll start a sentence and… the word just won’t come to me. It’s not all the time, but enough that I noticed. Yesterday, I couldn't remember if I took my vitamins. I think I did, but I couldn't be sure. Things like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing those examples, Ms. Heidenthal. That gives me a better understanding. And it's quite alright to not be certain about details like the vitamins – it happens. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately when you first started noticing these memory lapses?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question… It’s hard to say exactly. Probably… six months ago, maybe? It was very gradual. At first, I just thought I was stressed, you know? Work has been busy. But it’s definitely gotten more frequent in the last couple of months. I'd say the last two months have been the most noticeable.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, with a more noticeable increase in the last two months. That’s helpful information. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, are these memory issues affecting your ability to perform your daily activities – things like managing finances, preparing meals, or keeping up with appointments?
PATIENT: Not really… yet. I'm still able to do everything I need to. I just… have to be more careful. I write everything down now – appointments, grocery lists, everything. And I double-check things constantly. It’s annoying, but it hasn't stopped me from doing things. I just feel… frazzled, if that makes sense. It's like my brain is working harder than it used to. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Heidenthal. It sounds like you’ve developed some good coping strategies to manage these difficulties, which is excellent. Feeling frazzled is a very understandable response. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Hmm… let me think. I had pneumonia when I was about 25, but that was a long time ago. Nothing major since then, really. Just the usual colds and flu. I broke my wrist a few years back, but that wasn’t a serious illness. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was a pretty routine surgery. Is that helpful? I’m trying to remember everything…
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Heidenthal. Pneumonia at 25, a broken wrist, and gallbladder removal ten years ago. I’m making a note of all of this. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Let’s see… I take a multivitamin, like I mentioned before, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches. Nothing regularly, just when I need it. And… oh! I used to take something for my blood pressure, a few years ago, but the doctor took me off of it. I don’t remember the name, unfortunately. It was a small white pill. Does that help? I really wish I could remember the name of that pill…
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, and a blood pressure medication discontinued some time ago – a small white pill, you recall. We can certainly look into that medication later, if needed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations for anything neurological – meaning related to your brain or nerves?
PATIENT: Neurological… hmm. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had any problems with headaches or dizziness or anything like that. I've had the usual things – a tonsillectomy when I was a kid, and a wisdom tooth pulled, but nothing to do with my brain or nerves. I think. I really don’t remember anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. My mother… she was a bit forgetful towards the end, but everyone said it was just old age. She never really got a proper diagnosis. My grandfather on my father's side… he had Alzheimer's, I think. Yes, definitely Alzheimer's. He was quite sick for a long time before he passed away. And… oh! My aunt, my mother’s sister, she has Parkinson's disease. But that’s not a memory thing, is it?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. That’s important information. Mother with some forgetfulness, grandfather with Alzheimer’s, and aunt with Parkinson’s disease. It's good that you’re able to recall that. Finally, regarding your social history, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… okay. Well, I work as a dentist, which keeps me pretty busy. I live alone, I don't have any kids. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard sometimes with my schedule. I don’t drink or smoke. I used to go to the gym regularly, but I haven't been in a while. I enjoy reading and watching movies. Just a pretty quiet life, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. That gives me a good overview of your lifestyle. Now, to help me get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to perform a brief cognitive assessment. This involves a few simple questions and tasks to evaluate your memory, attention, and other mental functions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I understand. I'm happy to do whatever you think will help. It's a little scary, to be honest, but I want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. This assessment is simply a way for me to gather more information, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. We'll take it one step at a time. First, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Please listen carefully: apple, table, penny. Repeat those three words back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Now, I'm going to ask you a series of unrelated questions. Please answer to the best of your ability. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Today is… August 2nd… 2025. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Very good. Now, what city are we currently in?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think… I… I know I came from a ways away… is it… Greenville?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct. We are in Greenville. Now, I'm going to ask you to spell the word "world" backwards. Take your time.
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's tricky! Let me see… um… d-l-r-o-w… No, wait… l-o-r-w-d? Oh, I’m terrible at this! I think I messed that up completely.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Spelling backwards is challenging for many people. It’s not a test of intelligence, simply a task to evaluate certain cognitive functions. Now, I'm going to ask you to recall those three words I asked you to repeat earlier: apple, table, penny. Can you tell me what those words were?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I… I can’t remember. I’m so sorry. I know I heard them, but they’re just… gone. Apple… was one of them, I think? But I can't remember the others. This is awful!
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Don't apologize. It's not uncommon to have difficulty with recall, especially during times of stress. Based on the information you’ve provided, your medical history, and the brief cognitive assessment we just completed, there are several possibilities we need to consider. The assessment did reveal some difficulties with immediate recall and short-term memory. Given your family history of Alzheimer's, it is important that we investigate this further. However, it’s crucial to remember that this does not automatically mean you have Alzheimer's disease. Many other factors can contribute to memory problems, such as stress, anxiety, medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, or even underlying medical conditions. I recommend we proceed with some additional testing to help determine the cause of your memory issues. Specifically, I would like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a vitamin B12 level, and a brain MRI to rule out any other potential causes and provide a more definitive diagnosis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. It’s a little frightening, but I want to know what’s going on, so yes, please. Do whatever you think is best. A brain MRI sounds scary, but if it will help… then yes, let’s do it. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I understand your apprehension, and I want to assure you that we will proceed with caution and at your own pace. The brain MRI is a valuable tool for evaluating the structure of the brain and identifying any potential abnormalities. It's a non-invasive procedure, and we'll provide you with detailed instructions beforehand to ensure your comfort. I'll write the orders for the blood tests and the MRI now. The blood tests can be done at the lab next door, and we can schedule the MRI for next week. In the meantime, I’d like to recommend a few lifestyle modifications that may help improve your cognitive function. These include getting regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in mentally stimulating activities, and ensuring you get adequate sleep. I also want you to know that there are resources available to support you throughout this process. I can provide you with information about local support groups and organizations that specialize in memory care. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m a little overwhelmed, to be honest. But thank you. Thank you for listening, and for not dismissing my concerns. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Maybe… maybe I’ll have more questions later. Could you just… write down the name of those support groups? And remind me again about the MRI? Just so I don't forget.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Let me write down the names of a few local support groups for individuals experiencing memory concerns and their families: The Alzheimer's Association has a local chapter, and they offer a variety of resources and support services. There’s also a local Memory Care Support Group that meets weekly at the community center. I'll write down their contact information for you. And regarding the MRI, it stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It’s a painless imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It's important to remove any metal objects before the scan, as metal can interfere with the imaging process. The scan typically takes about 30-60 minutes. We will provide you with detailed instructions beforehand, and a technician will be with you throughout the entire procedure. Do you want me to write down the number of the radiology department as well, in case you have any questions?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be helpful. Thank you. I think… I think that’s everything for now. I really appreciate your kindness, Doctor. And… I’ll try to stay positive.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm glad I could help. Remember, staying positive is a crucial step. I'll have the lab orders and MRI request ready for you before you leave. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results of the tests. Take care, Ms. Heidenthal, and try not to worry too much. We'll work through this together. .
