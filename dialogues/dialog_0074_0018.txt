DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I'm Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in. Yes. Well, I seem to be… going to the bathroom quite a lot. More than usual, I think. It's rather inconvenient, actually. I wouldn’t say it’s painful, just… frequent. I’m not entirely sure when it started, to be honest. Time… it slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. And you’re right, time does seem to fly by. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. What sort of details would be helpful, Doctor? I confess my memory isn't what it once was. Is it the amount each time? The… colour, perhaps? I do drink a fair amount of water, I believe – good habit, they always said. Though perhaps too much? I really am not certain. It happens throughout the day, and… I believe a couple of times during the night as well, which is… new.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. Knowing you drink a good amount of water is a good starting point. And it's useful to know about the nighttime frequency – that is definitely something we’ll want to explore. Let's try to get a little more specific. When you say “quite a lot”, roughly how many times would you estimate you're urinating in a 24-hour period?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Estimating… that is difficult. Let me think. I suppose… normally, it would be, perhaps, four or five times? Now, it feels like… seven or eight, possibly more. It truly is hard to be precise, Doctor. I don't keep a tally, you see. It’s just… noticeable. Enough to be bothersome, certainly. And waking up… two, sometimes three times in the night is rather disruptive to my sleep. I am usually quite good at sleeping, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a significant increase from your usual four or five times a day. And the nighttime awakenings are particularly concerning. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the frequent urination?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me ponder that. Hmm. No… not that I am readily aware of. No pain, as I said. No… burning sensation. I haven't noticed any change in the… smell, or colour, of it, not that I actively look, you understand. I feel thirsty, perhaps a bit more than usual, but I attribute that to the warmer weather, if that makes sense. I haven’t felt unwell generally – no fever, no chills, no fatigue. Nothing immediately springs to mind, Doctor. Is there anything specific I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – the absence of pain, burning, or changes in color or smell is helpful. And attributing the thirst to the weather is reasonable. To get a better understanding, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Hmm… that is a question. I believe not, but… honestly, I’ve seen a good many doctors over the years. It's possible something was mentioned, but it doesn't readily come to mind. I think I would remember something like that. I had a rather thorough check-up with Doctor… Now what was his name? … about five years ago, and he didn’t mention anything of the sort. But, as I said, my memory isn't the best. Would my records be available? Perhaps they’d shed some light on the matter.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s common for things to be forgotten, and it’s good you had a check-up relatively recently. Let me check your electronic health record here. Okay, I see here from Dr. Novak’s notes in 2020 that you had a routine physical, and your blood glucose level was normal at that time. No mention of any diabetes risk factors. Now, have you ever had any problems with your kidneys or bladder?
PATIENT: Kidneys or bladder… No, not that I recall. I’ve never experienced any pain in my back, or difficulty urinating. Everything has always… functioned normally, if you will. I've always been rather regular, in all respects. I don’t recall ever having a urinary tract infection, or anything of that nature. I do believe I had my prostate checked, years ago, but the results were… satisfactory, as far as I can remember. It was a rather… uncomfortable procedure, if I recall correctly. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t given my kidneys or bladder much thought in recent years.
DOCTOR: That’s reassuring. And you’re right, it’s good that you haven’t had any known issues with your kidneys or bladder. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me see. I take… a small dose of Lisinopril, for my blood pressure, I believe. Doctor Novak prescribed it, as I recall. Just a small tablet, once a day. And occasionally, I take Paracetamol for aches and pains, but that’s infrequent. Perhaps once or twice a month. I used to take a Vitamin D supplement during the winter months, but I haven't taken any this year. No, that’s it, as far as I am aware. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. It's a rather… unpleasant business, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional Paracetamol. That's helpful to know. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. We’ll also do a simple neurological exam, just to rule out any obvious causes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly, Doctor. A physical exam sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need for thoroughness. I used to be quite active, you know, always hiking and… well, that was some time ago now. But I don’t mind at all. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I do have a rather sensitive back, you see, from an old injury. But otherwise, I am quite robust, I assure you. Shall we proceed?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please remove your jacket, and I'll have you lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A bit chilly in here, isn't it? But better to be cool than warm, I always say. Ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so, and can be expected given the clinic setting. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. Do you feel any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort at all, Doctor. Just a gentle pressure, that’s all. I haven’t experienced any pain in my abdomen, as I said. This is all very… efficient, isn’t it? You seem to know exactly what you are doing. A far cry from some of the doctors I’ve seen in the past. They’d poke and prod for ages, without seeming to have a clue!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. I appreciate that. We aim to be thorough but also efficient and respectful of your time. Your reflexes are normal, and your muscle strength appears good in all extremities. Okay, everything seems relatively normal on the physical exam. Based on your symptoms and the exam, the frequent urination could be due to a number of factors. One possibility is simply an overactive bladder, especially considering you drink a lot of water. Another possibility is benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is common in men your age, even if you had a satisfactory prostate check in the past. It can develop over time. And, while less likely given your history, we need to rule out other causes like diabetes or a urinary tract infection. To do that, I’d like to order a few tests. These include a urine analysis to check for infection, a blood glucose test to rule out diabetes, and a PSA test, which is a blood test to screen for prostate cancer. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, those tests sound perfectly reasonable, Doctor. If that’s what you recommend, then I’m happy to proceed. I confess I’d be relieved to put my mind at ease, one way or another. I've never been overly fond of worrying, you see. It doesn't solve anything, does it? And if it's just an overactive bladder, well, I suppose I should drink a bit less water! But, as I said, it's good habit... Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Will I need to fast, or…?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Mr. Verbos. And you’re right, knowing what’s going on is the most important thing. For the urine analysis, you'll just need to provide a sample when you arrive at the lab. It’s best to provide a mid-stream sample – the lab technician will give you instructions. For the blood glucose and PSA tests, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks – water is fine. We'll schedule the lab appointment for tomorrow morning, giving you plenty of time to fast. While we’re waiting for the test results, I recommend keeping a bladder diary for a couple of days. Just note down when you drink, when you urinate, and the amount each time. It will give us a clearer picture of your fluid intake and urination pattern. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, a bladder diary sounds manageable, Doctor. I might need to purchase a small notebook, but that’s no trouble. I always preferred writing things down, you know, helps to keep the thoughts organized. And if it helps you determine what's going on, I'm happy to oblige. Eight hours fasting… I suppose I can skip breakfast. It’s not the end of the world! Perhaps I’ll have a rather substantial dinner instead! Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave? Instructions for the lab, perhaps? Directions?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Verbos. You’re a very cooperative patient. I’ll print out a detailed instruction sheet for the lab, including directions and what to expect. The lab is located in the medical building across the parking lot – it’s a very short walk. You’ll need to bring your insurance card and a photo ID. The sheet also includes the fasting instructions again, just to be sure. In the meantime, please continue to drink a normal amount of water, and avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. If you experience any fever, chills, or pain in your back or abdomen, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You've been most thorough, and I appreciate your patience and explanations. It’s reassuring to know someone is taking my concerns seriously. Thank you again for your time. I suppose I’ll see you when the test results are back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. I’m glad I could help. And yes, we’ll contact you as soon as the results are back, usually within a few days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and please take care. .
