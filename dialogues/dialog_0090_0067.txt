DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… pain. When I breathe deep. It’s been… a while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long. Old man problems, probably. I just want to get it checked, if that makes sense. Don’t want it to be anything serious.
DOCTOR: “Old man problems,” alright. Well, we'll see what we can figure out. Pain when you breathe deep… can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… sharp. Not always, though. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache. Mostly in my chest, I guess. Right here. It feels worse when I try to do something… like lift things, or walk up the stairs. Just gets tighter, you know? It’s hard to explain. It’s… just there.
DOCTOR: “Just there,” is not very helpful, Mr. Ruocco. I need specifics. Is it a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry, Doctor. I… I don't remember things so well these days. It comes and goes, yes. More when I do things, like I said. Sitting still… it's not so bad. But if I push myself… then it really hurts. I try not to push myself too much, but… you know. Gotta do things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific triggered this pain?
PATIENT: Triggered? Like… what do you mean? I haven’t fallen or anything. Just… gets worse when I’m active. I used to work construction, you know. Heavy lifting. Maybe it’s something from that? It’s been a long time, though. I’m retired now. A long, long time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: So, it’s been going on for… how long now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. Years, I think. Maybe five? Ten? It’s come and gone over the years. It wasn’t always this bad, though. Lately, it’s been… more frequent. I just figured it was my age. Old man aches, you know? I don't want to bother you with something so… minor.
DOCTOR: “Minor” is for you to determine, Mr. Ruocco, not me. Let’s just get a better understanding of what’s going on. Have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Well… I get tired easily. But I’m eighty years old! I guess that’s normal, right? No… no cough, no fever. Just… tired. And this pain. I haven't really noticed anything else. I eat okay, I think. My daughter makes sure of that. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath…? Sometimes. When I walk up the stairs, like I said. It feels like… I can’t get enough air. But I’m out of shape, you know? I don’t walk much anymore. It’s probably just that. It doesn't happen all the time, though. Mostly when I exert myself. It's probably nothing. Really.
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I need you to be specific. When you walk up the stairs, is it just that you're tired, or do you feel like you're struggling to breathe?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… It’s… both, I think. I get tired, yes. But it also feels like… my chest is tight. Like someone is squeezing it. That’s when I have to stop and catch my breath. It’s not… terrible. But it’s definitely not easy. I just take my time, you know? Slow and steady. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Let’s listen to your lungs. And then we’ll do a quick exam of your chest wall. Please take a deep breath in… and out.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is something wrong? It feels a little… uncomfortable. It’s hard to breathe deep, you know.
DOCTOR: I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds on your lower lobes, Mr. Ruocco. And you mentioned discomfort. Tell me, does the pain radiate anywhere—to your arm, your neck, your back?
PATIENT: Radiate…? Sometimes. A little in my shoulder, I think. Left shoulder, mostly. And… sometimes down my left arm. But it’s not bad. It’s just… a dull ache. Like a muscle pull. I just thought it was from sleeping in a bad position. Is that… serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, given your age, history of pain with exertion, and now the radiation you’re describing, I’m concerned about possible angina. We need to rule out cardiac involvement. I'm going to order an EKG and some blood work, including cardiac enzymes. And I want you to get a chest X-ray as well.
PATIENT: Angina…? Cardiac…? Oh, goodness. Is that… bad? Is something wrong with my heart? I… I don’t know anything about that. I just have a little pain, Doctor. I thought it was just old age. What does this mean?
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, angina is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re having a heart attack, but it can be a warning sign. That's why we need to investigate. The EKG will look at your heart’s electrical activity, the blood work will check for any heart damage, and the X-ray will look at your lungs and heart size. I’m going to have the nurse draw your blood and do the EKG now. Then we’ll get you scheduled for the chest X-ray. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially with symptoms like yours.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get it checked, you know? I don’t want to be a bother. Just… please tell me what’s going on. I don’t understand all this… heart stuff. Will it hurt? The tests, I mean. And… will I be okay?
DOCTOR: The tests are quite simple, Mr. Ruocco. The blood draw will be a quick pinch, and the EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest. It won't take long at all. As for being okay… we’ll know more once we have the results. Let's just get these tests done, and then we'll discuss them. I’m sure it’s nothing too serious, but it’s important to rule things out. The nurse will be in shortly.
