DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you. I’m here about getting one of those… medical marijuana cards, I believe they’re called. My daughter, bless her heart, she thinks it might help with… well, with everything. Though frankly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’re interested in exploring medical marijuana as a potential treatment option, and you’d like to discuss whether a medical marijuana card is appropriate for you. That's perfectly reasonable. To best understand if this is a good fit, could you tell me more about what "everything" refers to?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, where do we begin? It’s the aches, mostly. Just… general aches. Old age, you see. Though I do keep active. Bridge three times a week, you know. And a little gardening, when the weather permits. But it’s there. And then there’s the… sleeplessness. Not every night, mind you. But enough to be bothersome. It’s just… everything feels a little… off. My daughter insists this marijuana will fix it all, but I’ve always been a firm believer in proper rest and a good cup of chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you're experiencing generalized aches and some difficulty sleeping, and you're curious about whether medical marijuana might offer some relief. It's good that you stay active with bridge and gardening—that's wonderful. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about these aches?
PATIENT: What more is there to say about aches, Doctor? They ache! They’re… pervasive. In my back, mostly. And my knees, of course. All the joints, really. It’s just… a dull, constant throb. It's not like a sharp pain, thankfully. More of an… inconvenience. I try to ignore it, but it does interfere with my bridge, sometimes. Hard to concentrate when you're uncomfortable, you see. It’s just… a part of getting older, I suppose. Though I don’t particularly like it.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it sounds like these aches are fairly widespread, mostly in your back and knees, and they're causing some difficulty with concentration, specifically when playing bridge. To help me understand if medical marijuana might be a suitable option, could you rate your pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: A scale, you say? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the slightest idea. I don’t do scales. Pain is pain. It’s… unpleasant. But to assign it a number? It seems rather… undignified. Perhaps a four? On a good day. A six when the weather is damp. It fluctuates, you see. It’s not a constant, fixed entity. Are you sure you need a number?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ellan. It’s not essential, but it helps me gauge the severity and how much it impacts your daily life. A four to six, fluctuating with the weather, gives me a good sense. Now, you mentioned difficulty sleeping. Could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not that I can’t fall asleep, Doctor. It’s staying asleep. I wake up. Several times a night. Sometimes it’s just a little… restlessness. Other times it’s… thoughts. Racing thoughts, you see. About this and that. About my daughter, mostly. And the state of the world. It’s a dreadful state, you know. But I lie there, and I just… can’t seem to quiet my mind. And then I’m awake for… oh, I don’t know… an hour, sometimes more. It's quite frustrating, really. I’ve tried warm milk, you know. And chamomile tea. But it doesn’t always… work.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you're having trouble staying asleep, with awakenings due to restlessness and racing thoughts, often about your daughter and current events. And warm milk and chamomile tea haven't consistently helped. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask a few more general health questions, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think. Dr. Alvarez, bless his soul, he said my blood pressure was a little… elevated a few years back. He put me on a… a little pill. I can’t remember the name. Something with an ‘L’, I think. I’ve been taking it ever since. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be twenty years ago now. It was a dreadful experience. Beyond that… I’m remarkably healthy for my age, you know. I take very good care of myself. I do worry about my weight, though. It fluctuates, you see. Just like everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of elevated blood pressure, managed with a medication – something starting with an ‘L’ – and you had your gallbladder removed approximately twenty years ago. You feel generally healthy otherwise. Do you recall the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I never was good with names. It was a small, white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. Perhaps my daughter knows. She manages all my… appointments and such. Honestly, Doctor, I leave the details to her. It's much easier that way. I simply take the pill. It’s… something with an ‘L’, definitely. And it starts with a… I believe it's 'Lisinopril'. Is that right? She told me once, when I asked her. Though I promptly forgot it, of course. It’s all rather… confusing.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lisinopril is a common medication for high blood pressure. Thank you for that information. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, there’s the Lisinopril, of course. And sometimes I take an ibuprofen for my aches, if they’re particularly bad. But not regularly. Oh, and I take a Vitamin D supplement in the winter. My daughter insists. Something about the sun, you see. And… I suppose that’s all. I really don’t believe in taking too many pills. It's… unsettling. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible. Though, clearly, they’re not always sufficient.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, Lisinopril daily, ibuprofen as needed for aches, and a Vitamin D supplement in the winter. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’m remarkably robust, you see. I’ve never had a single allergy in my life. Perhaps a little sensitivity to the cold, but that’s hardly an allergy. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I never had trouble with pollen, or dust, or any of those… modern sensitivities. I simply haven’t a trace of allergies. It’s rather… fortunate, really. I can eat anything, and I’m rarely ill. Although, I do avoid shellfish. Not an allergy, mind you. Just… a dislike. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, and a dislike of shellfish. Now, before we discuss medical marijuana further, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I find the habit… appalling. My husband, bless his soul, he tried it once, many years ago. A dreadful experience. I simply wouldn’t dream of it. It’s… unhealthy. And rather… vulgar. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea, thank you very much. I have never, and will never, touch a cigarette. It's simply… unthinkable. I am a woman of… refinement, you see. Smoking is… out of the question.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Well… occasionally. A small glass of sherry with dinner, perhaps. On special occasions. Or a little glass of wine with my daughter. But very rarely. I don't believe in excess. It’s… uncouth. And rather… unhealthy. I find it interferes with my sleep, you see. And I prefer to keep a clear head. I'm not one for… frivolous pursuits. A small glass, on occasion, is all. Nothing more. It's… a civilized indulgence, perhaps. But certainly not a habit.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional small glass of sherry or wine. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members with a history of medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do we begin? My mother, bless her soul, she had… arthritis. Terrible arthritis in her hands. She couldn't knit anymore, it was dreadful. And my father… he had heart trouble, towards the end. A weak heart, you see. He wasn't one for… taking care of himself. And my aunt… she had… something with her mind. A nervous condition, they called it. She spent some time in… a home. It was a sad affair. Beyond that… I believe my family is remarkably healthy, all things considered. A few aches and pains, here and there. But nothing… serious. It’s a rather… long family, you see. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of arthritis, heart trouble, and a nervous condition. Now, just to clarify, when you say “something with her mind”, do you have any further details about that condition?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It was a long time ago. My mother never spoke much about it. Something about… being agitated. And… forgetful. She’d wander off sometimes. And she’d… talk to herself. It was very distressing for everyone. They said it was a… a mental illness. But I don’t pretend to understand those things. It was simply… a sadness. A very sad affair. She needed… care. And eventually, she was placed in a home where she could receive it. It was a difficult time for the family. I believe it was… dementia, perhaps? Or… something of that nature. But I’m not a doctor, you see. I simply know it was… a decline. A very sad decline.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ellan. That’s helpful. Now, to understand your current situation better, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Goodness. Is that necessary? I haven’t had one of those in years. I simply came for… a card. To explore… options. But very well. If you insist. Though I assure you, I am in remarkably good health for my age. But please, be gentle. And do try not to… poke too much. It’s… unsettling. Very well, proceed. But gently, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as gentle as possible. It's just a routine check to ensure we have a complete picture of your health. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 78. That's slightly elevated. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs. I’ll also check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a bit diminished. Finally, I’ll take a look at your throat and ears. Your throat looks clear, and your ears are also normal. Overall, you appear to be in reasonably good health, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and mild crackling in your lungs are things we should monitor.
PATIENT: Crackling in my lungs? Goodness. That sounds… alarming. I haven’t coughed a day in my life. Perhaps it’s just the air conditioning. This building is rather old, you know. And my blood pressure… slightly elevated? Well, I’ve always been a bit… excitable. It’s the state of the world, you see. It’s simply dreadful. Are you certain it’s nothing serious, Doctor? I do hope this won't interfere with my bridge game. It’s my only… social outlet, you know. And the card… will I be getting the card, Doctor? That's what I came for, after all.
DOCTOR: The crackling in your lungs is mild, and it could be due to a number of factors, including the air conditioning as you mentioned. It doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem, but we should monitor it. I'll recommend a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture. As for your blood pressure, it's slightly elevated, but we can manage it with lifestyle changes and medication if necessary. Now, regarding the medical marijuana card. Based on your symptoms of aches and difficulty sleeping, and your interest in exploring this option, you may be a candidate. However, I need to ensure it's appropriate for your overall health. Given the mild crackling in your lungs, I want to rule out any underlying respiratory issues before proceeding. I’m going to order that chest X-ray. Once we have those results, we can discuss the potential benefits and risks of medical marijuana in your case and determine if it's the right course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? Goodness gracious. It’s all rather… disruptive. I simply wanted a card. To perhaps… ease my aches. And sleep a little better. This is becoming quite… complicated. Very well. If you insist. But please, be as quick as possible. I have a bridge game on Wednesday, you see. And I’d prefer not to miss it. And what… what does this card entail? Will it require… frequent visits? I do hope not. This is becoming quite… a burden, Doctor. A burden, I tell you. And will it interfere with my blood pressure medication? I do hope not. Very well. Order the X-ray. But please, be quick. And keep me informed. I simply want to… get on with my life.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ellan. I'll order the chest X-ray, and we'll schedule it for as soon as possible. It shouldn’t take long. We’ll review the results together, and then we can discuss the card and the potential benefits of medical marijuana in more detail. Regarding the card, it requires an initial consultation, like the one we're having today, and then periodic follow-up appointments to monitor your progress and ensure it’s working effectively for you. The frequency of these appointments will depend on your individual needs. I don’t anticipate any interactions between medical marijuana and your blood pressure medication, but it’s always best to be cautious. We’ll review your medication list carefully and monitor your blood pressure closely. I’ll also provide you with information about potential side effects and precautions. I’ll have the X-ray order ready for you now. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once you have the results, please bring them to your next appointment so we can discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Very well. But please, be quick about it. I do hope this won’t take too long. And I do hope it won’t interfere with my bridge game. It’s my only… social outlet, you know. And please, ensure the radiology department understands the urgency. I simply want to… get on with my life. And I do hope it won't make my aches worse. That would be dreadful. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. But please, be quick. And keep me informed. I do hope this won’t be too… disruptive. I suppose I'll see you again then. When will I be seeing you again? I have a bridge game on Wednesday. Very well. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ellan. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to make this process as smooth and efficient as possible. I’ll have my assistant contact you within 24 hours to schedule a follow-up appointment once the X-ray results are available. We'll work around your bridge schedule. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Goodbye, Ellan. And please, try to relax and focus on enjoying your week.
