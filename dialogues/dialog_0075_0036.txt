DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a physical. For the insurance. Medicare wants me to have one, before they… allow things. A pre-insurance physical, yes? I do not really understand all of it, but that is what the lady on the telephone said.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. A pre-insurance physical, or a wellness exam, is quite common. It’s just a check-up to make sure everything is in good working order. It’s good you’re getting it done. Just to be thorough, and to help me get a complete picture, I’ll ask you a few questions about your health history. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, questions are… fine. I suppose. As long as it does not take too long. I have… things to do later. Are these questions about… my family? Because I do not know much about my family’s health. They are… far away.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can work with what you know. We'll start with your health, and if you're comfortable, we can touch on family history briefly. Don’t worry if you don’t know a lot, we can skip it if you prefer. First, let's talk about you. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well… yes. I work. I eat. I sleep. It is… normal. No big problems. Sometimes my back… aches, from the work, but it is nothing. Old men have worse backs, I think. It is just… being on my feet all day. Nothing to worry about, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how long have you been experiencing this back ache?
PATIENT: A long time. Many years, I think. Since I started the work. It comes and goes. Some days it is worse than others. I take… some pills sometimes. The ones you can buy at the store. They help a little. Not much, but… enough. I do not want to complain, Doctor. Everyone has something.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re managing it, but we should still make a note of it. What kind of pills are you taking, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen. The blue ones. From the… pharmacy. The big store. I do not know the numbers or anything. Just the blue ones. They say “pain” on the box. It is… common, I think. Everyone takes them. I only take them when it really hurts. Do not worry, I do not take too many. I am not… foolish.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen. And roughly how often would you say you take them?
PATIENT: Hmm… difficult. Maybe… two or three times a week? Sometimes not at all. When I have been lifting heavy things, or the weather is bad. It is… hard to say exactly. It depends. I do not keep track. It is just… as needed. I am not a doctor, I do not measure things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can estimate. Now, aside from the back ache and the ibuprofen, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I am… tired sometimes, from the work, but that is normal. I do not get sick. I do not have… fevers or coughs or anything like that. I eat good food. I sleep. I work. It is all… normal. Are you sure you need to ask so many questions, Doctor? This is just a check-up, yes?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Barban. I am simply trying to get a complete picture of your health so I can ensure everything is as it should be. It is just a check-up, and it’s good that you’re generally healthy. Now, let's quickly go through some other things. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing major. When I was a small boy, I had… the measles, I think. And maybe chickenpox. But that was long ago. I have not been to the hospital since then. No surgeries. I am a strong man. I do not break easily. Is this all? Because I really do not like hospitals. They are… unpleasant places.
DOCTOR: Okay, measles and chickenpox as a child. Good to know. Now, about any medications you're currently taking, besides the ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen, Doctor. I do not take anything else. I do not like pills. They make me feel… strange. I do not need anything else. I eat good food, I sleep, I work. That is enough. Are we finished now? Because I have things to do. I am wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Alright, just ibuprofen as needed. Good. Now, one final area – allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I eat everything. I have never had a problem. Dust bothers me sometimes, when I am cleaning, but that is not an allergy. It is just… dust. I am a strong man. I do not get sick easily. Are you sure you do not need to ask about anything else, Doctor? This is taking a very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Barban. No allergies, just the occasional backache treated with ibuprofen. That's very good to know. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to quickly do a basic physical exam – check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat. It won't take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: No. No touching. I do not like being touched. I came here for the insurance paper, not for a… examination. I do not feel sick. I am fine. Just give me the paper, Doctor. I have wasted enough time here already. I need to go. I am a strong man, I know my own body.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your discomfort, but a basic physical exam is standard procedure for a wellness check, even for insurance purposes. It helps ensure everything is functioning correctly. Without it, I'm unable to accurately complete the necessary forms. However, I respect your wishes. I can complete a limited form stating I’ve spoken with you and taken your medical history, but it will likely require additional documentation from your primary care physician. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That is acceptable. Just… the paper. I do not need anything else. No touching. Just write what you need to write. I do not care. I just want to go home now. This is… ridiculous. Give me the paper, Doctor. And I will be leaving.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. Here is the form. I've documented our conversation and your medical history as we discussed. Please review it to ensure it’s accurate. I strongly recommend establishing care with a primary care physician for regular check-ups and health maintenance. Thank you for your time, Mr. Barban. Have a good day.
