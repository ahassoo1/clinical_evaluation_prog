DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Neeraj Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a bother, really, coming in. But I have been having trouble. I can’t lie flat anymore without getting… short of breath. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Perhaps a month. It’s quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out, even if it is inconvenient. Shortness of breath is definitely something we want to look into. A month, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer. It wasn't sudden, you understand. It just… gradually got worse. I used to be able to sleep quite comfortably, but now… now I need several pillows. Three, at least. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Maribeth. Needing three pillows to sleep comfortably suggests we should definitely investigate what's going on. It sounds like you're experiencing something called orthopnea – that's difficulty breathing when lying flat. Can you tell me a little more about the shortness of breath itself?
PATIENT: Orthopnea? I don’t believe I’ve heard of that. Is that… serious? And when you say “tell you more,” what exactly are you wanting to know? It feels like… well, like I can't get enough air. A tightness in my chest, mostly. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And it’s worse when I’ve been… active. Even just walking to the store.
DOCTOR: It's good you asked about orthopnea – it just helps us pinpoint what might be going on. And it can be a sign of something that needs attention, which is why we're looking into it. Okay, so a tightness in your chest, not painful, worse with activity… even walking to the store. That’s helpful. Does it come on suddenly, or does it build up gradually when you're walking?
PATIENT: It builds up, Doctor. It doesn't happen all at once. I can walk a bit, feel alright, then… then I notice I'm breathing harder. And then harder still. It's not like I collapse, mind you. But I have to slow down. And then rest. I used to be able to walk for miles, you know. It’s quite frustrating. Is this… is this my heart? My sister had a bad heart, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your sister's history. It's definitely good to consider that, and we will. It could be related to your heart, but shortness of breath can have many causes. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me about any other symptoms you've noticed?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. My ankles have been a bit swollen lately, I suppose. Not terribly, but… puffier than usual. And I’ve been feeling rather tired, even after a good night’s sleep… well, as good as a night’s sleep can be with all the pillows. I also seem to be… needing to go to the bathroom more often at night. But that could just be old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so swollen ankles, increased fatigue, and more frequent nighttime urination. All helpful things to know. The nighttime urination could be related to other things, but it's good you mentioned it. Now, have you had any chest pain at all, even mild?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no chest pain. Never have. It's always just… this tightness. And the breathlessness. It’s not a sharp pain, or a squeezing… just uncomfortable. Like something is… pressing on my lungs, perhaps? Although, I don’t know anything about lungs, really. I just feel… constricted. Is that a word? Constricted. And I'm very regular with my check-ups, you understand. I don’t usually have any problems. This is… unusual.
DOCTOR: Constricted is a very good word, Maribeth, and it describes the sensation well. It's good you're regular with your check-ups, that gives us a good baseline. Alright. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your ankles, and take your blood pressure. Just routine things to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfectly alright, Doctor. Anything you need to do, just let me know. I do wish we could hurry, though. I have a luncheon with the ladies from the church this afternoon. We’re making quilts for the veterans, you see. It’s a very important cause. But do what you need to do. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Maribeth. I understand about the luncheon - we’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Alright. I’m hearing some… crackles in the lower part of your lungs, especially on the right side. Your heart sounds a little… distant, and a bit rapid. And I can see some slight swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated as well – 150 over 90. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing, it’s possible you’re experiencing some fluid buildup in your lungs, which could be a sign of heart failure. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm that.
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Like my sister. What kind of testing? Will it take long? And… and what does it mean? I mean, I’m seventy-one years old, Doctor. I don't want to be… a burden. But I do want to know what’s going on. Is it… is it treatable? Please don’t use complicated words. Just tell me plainly.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Maribeth. Heart failure can be serious, but it's also often manageable, especially when caught early. And it doesn't necessarily mean the same thing as your sister’s experience – everyone is different. What it means is that your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should be, which can cause fluid to build up in your lungs and other parts of your body – that’s what’s causing the shortness of breath and the swollen ankles. We'll need to do a couple of things to get a clearer picture. First, I want to order a chest X-ray to see how much fluid is in your lungs. Then, I’d like to do a blood test to check for certain markers that can indicate heart failure. And finally, an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart. The X-ray and blood test shouldn’t take long – a few minutes each. The EKG takes a little longer, maybe ten or fifteen minutes. And yes, it is treatable. There are medications that can help your heart pump more efficiently and reduce the fluid buildup. We’ll discuss all of your options once we have the results of the tests. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes a little more sense, Doctor. Chest X-ray, blood test, EKG. I suppose I can manage that. Ten or fifteen minutes for the EKG… alright. And medications… that sounds… hopeful. Will these tests… will they hurt? And… and when can I get them done? I really do need to be at the luncheon by one o’clock. It’s very important. Mrs. Henderson is bringing her famous pecan pie. And the veterans… well, they deserve the quilts. It’s just… I feel like I’m wasting everyone’s time.
DOCTOR: No, none of these tests will hurt, Maribeth. The X-ray is just a quick image, and the EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest – it doesn’t send any electricity through your body, just reads the signals. It’s completely painless. We can get the X-ray and blood test done right away here in the clinic. The lab technician is just down the hall. And we can schedule the EKG for immediately after – it shouldn’t take long at all. We’ll aim to have everything done well before one o'clock, so you can make it to your luncheon. And please don’t worry about wasting anyone’s time. Your health is the most important thing, and we’re happy to help you get to the bottom of this. The veterans and Mrs. Henderson’s pie will have to wait a little while. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright. That… that sounds acceptable, Doctor. Immediately after… as long as it doesn’t take too long. And no pain… good. Very well. Let’s get this over with then. The X-ray first, you said? And… and please, try not to keep me waiting. I do have a reputation to uphold with the pecan pie. Though, truthfully, I’m not much of a baker myself. But I can certainly sew a straight seam. Lead the way, Doctor. And thank you… for not dismissing an old woman’s worries.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Maribeth. We’ll get you taken care of quickly. And it’s never a waste of time to address your concerns - that’s what I’m here for. Here we are. This is Sarah, our lab technician. She’ll get you started with the X-ray and blood test. I’ll be right here after she’s finished, and we’ll schedule your EKG. Sarah, could you please take good care of Maribeth?
