DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kilton. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. I… I have been having some trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I breathe. It is making me a little worried.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A whistling sound, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, like… like a tea kettle, almost. But inside my chest. It comes and goes, but it is happening more now. Especially when I walk.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, that is a good question. Let me think… maybe two, three weeks now? It started small, I did not think much of it at first. Just a little puffiness. But now… it is harder to ignore.
DOCTOR: “Puffiness”?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like… like I am working a little harder to get air. Not so much pain, but… I feel it. In my chest. And the whistling. It is mostly when I do something, like walking the dog. Or stairs. When I sit, it is better.
DOCTOR: Do you have any other symptoms associated with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really. I have been a little tired, maybe? But I am old, Doctor, so I am always a little tired! No cough, no fever. Just… the whistling and feeling breathless sometimes. It is not very bad, but it is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, not that I have noticed. My feet sometimes feel a little warm, but I thought that was just from being on them too much. I like to garden, you see. But no real swelling, Doctor. Just warm.
DOCTOR: Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I have taken some things over the years for aches and pains, but never had a bad reaction. I try to avoid medicine when I can, if that makes sense. I prefer to just rest.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my bones, Doctor. My daughter helps me with it. I think it is called… calcium with Vitamin D? And sometimes, when my joints are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. But not every day, only when I need it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I remember. I have had the usual things – colds, the flu, things like that. But nothing serious with my lungs. I was a very active girl, always running around, so I have always felt… strong. Until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! I had my gallbladder out many years ago. Maybe thirty years ago? And… I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, but that was a long time ago. Everything else, just normal bumps and bruises. Nothing major, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Now, thinking about your family… are there any lung problems, like asthma or emphysema, that run in your family?
PATIENT: That is a good question. My mother… she always coughed a lot when she got older. But I don’t think it was anything serious. Just an old lady cough, you know? My father… he was strong and healthy his whole life. I don't recall anyone having… trouble breathing like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Kilton, based on what you’ve told me, it could be a number of things. It sounds like you're experiencing some degree of dyspnea, or shortness of breath, with associated wheezing. We need to listen to your lungs to get a better idea of what’s going on. If you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dyspnea? Is that… bad, Doctor? I do not mind you listening. Please do. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what is happening and how to feel better. Please, go ahead. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here on the table, and I’ll listen to your breathing with my stethoscope. Please take some deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try to relax as much as possible. Take a deep breath… and exhale… again… good. I’m hearing some mild wheezing in both lungs, predominantly on exhale. Your respiratory rate is a little elevated, at 22 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. No edema in the lower extremities. Your oxygen saturation is 93% on room air, which is a little low, but not critically so.
PATIENT: Oh. 93%? Is that… a bad number, Doctor? I do feel a little breathless just talking. What does this mean? Is it my heart? My mother had some trouble with her heart later in life. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, Ms. Kilton, but it's not necessarily cause for immediate alarm. It could be a number of things, and frankly, at your age, some mild breathlessness is not entirely unexpected. We need to rule out some possibilities. I would like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and heart. And a basic blood test – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – just to make sure everything else is within normal limits. It's unlikely to be a direct inheritance of your mother’s condition without further evidence. But, it's always best to be thorough. The X-ray and bloodwork will give us a clearer picture. We'll schedule those for this afternoon. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. X-ray? Is that… safe, Doctor? I have heard things… and I do not like being poked and prodded. But if you think it is necessary… then I suppose I should do it. Poked and prodded… and blood tests… it all sounds a little frightening. Will it hurt? And how long will I have to wait for the results? I just want to know what is going on and get back to my garden. It is the only thing that keeps me going these days.
DOCTOR: The X-ray is very safe, Ms. Kilton. The radiation exposure is minimal – far less than you receive from a cross-country flight. It won't hurt at all – you’ll just stand still for a few moments while the technician takes the images. As for the blood test, there will be a brief pinch, but it’s over quickly. The results usually take a couple of days to come back. Once we have them, we can discuss the findings and decide on the best course of action. It’s likely this is just a mild exacerbation of something, perhaps a minor chest infection, but we need to rule out anything more serious. We'll get you back to your garden, Ms. Kilton. Let’s just take things one step at a time. I’ll have the nurse schedule those tests for you now. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all. Just… please be quick, if you can. And try not to poke too much. Thank you for listening to me. I appreciate your help. I just… want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse come in to explain the procedure and schedule the tests. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Worsening breathlessness… chest pain… fever… I will remember. Thank you. I think… I think that is all for now. I will wait for the nurse, then. I really appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Good. I have other patients waiting, Ms. Kilton. The nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: .
