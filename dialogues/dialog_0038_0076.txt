DOCTOR: Good morning, Clarke. I’m Dr. Auelua, but please, call me Neeraj. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Neeraj. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, and they really hurt. Been bothering me for a little while now. Red and…well, bumpy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke. Bumps on your shins that are red and painful. And you said this has been going on for “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yeah, “a little while.” Hmm… maybe a couple of months, I think? It started with just one or two, and now there's… quite a few. Not all over, just on the front of my shins, mostly. They ache, especially after I’ve been on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple of months, starting with one or two and now several on the front of your shins, aching after being on your feet. Do they itch at all, Clarke?
PATIENT: Itch? Not really. They don’t bother me with itching. It's mostly just the pain, you know? Like a…a really deep ache. Sometimes feels a little warm around them too, but I don’t know if that’s just me being old.
DOCTOR: No, it’s good you’re telling me everything, Clarke. Warmth can be a sign of something, so it's good to note. And aches are definitely something we need to figure out. Now, have you noticed anything that makes them better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Worse… definitely worse after work. I do a lot of lifting and moving things, you know, at the warehouse. Better… when I’m resting, of course. And… maybe when it’s cooler? I don’t know if that makes sense. Summer’s been pretty hot, and they feel a bit better when it’s not so blazing outside.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Clarke. Worse with activity and lifting, better with rest and cooler temperatures. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. I haven’t felt sick, no fever or anything. No swelling in my feet, or anything like that. Just the bumps and the pain. Oh! Actually, my ankles have been a little stiff sometimes in the morning, but I figured that was just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no swelling, just the bumps, pain and morning ankle stiffness. We’ll definitely look at those ankles. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been pretty lucky, to be honest. High blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor got it under control with some pills. Other than that… nothing major. I’m on Medicare, if that matters. And I take a little something for my arthritis, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, controlled with medication, and something for arthritis. Medicare is good to know. What about any surgeries or hospital stays?
PATIENT: Let me see… Had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long, long time ago. And… I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my arm falling off a ladder maybe ten years ago. Other than that, nothing much. Just the usual bumps and bruises from working.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal as a child and a broken arm about ten years ago. Now, family history. Do any of your family members have similar skin problems, or any other medical conditions that run in the family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother had… arthritis, I think. And my father had diabetes. Skin problems… not that I remember. My brother had heart trouble, but… nothing like these bumps. We weren’t really ones for talking about health stuff much, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand, Clarke. Okay. And lastly, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Quit a long time ago, thank goodness. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer with dinner once in a while, but that's about it. Never touched anything else, no. I try to stay healthy, you know? Especially getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very minimal alcohol use. Alright, Clarke, that gives me a good picture. Now, I’d like to take a look at your legs, if that's alright with you. We’ll do a quick exam, and then we can talk about what might be going on and what we can do about it. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Go ahead, take your time. They’re not pretty, I’ll warn you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, I see a number of raised, reddish bumps on the front of both shins. They feel firm to the touch and are tender when I press on them. There is some mild warmth to the area as well. No swelling or open sores at this time. Your ankles have a bit of stiffness, but no significant swelling or tenderness to the touch. It looks like you may have some shin splints, but given the bumps, it could also be a form of dermatitis or even a mild vasculitis. We will need some blood work to rule out anything more serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Shin splints… I’ve heard of those. From running, right? I don't run. Dermatitis and…vasculitis? Those sound…serious. Blood work… yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I just want to get rid of the pain. Will the blood work tell you what’s causing it? And… will it hurt? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: You're right, shin splints are common in runners, but they can happen with any repetitive activity. And you’re right to ask about the other possibilities. Dermatitis is a general term for skin inflammation, and vasculitis is inflammation of the blood vessels - it can be serious, but often manageable. That’s why we’re doing the blood work – to get a clearer picture. The blood work will help us rule things out and see if there’s any underlying inflammation or other cause for the bumps. As for the needle… it’s just a quick pinch, Clarke. I'm very good at it, and we'll try to make it as comfortable as possible. We’ll just need a small sample. I'm going to order a complete blood count, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a C-reactive protein test. These will give us some good baseline information. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. I’ll also get an order for a skin biopsy, just to be sure. We will schedule the biopsy for another day, once we get back the blood results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Wow, that’s a lot of tests. Complete blood count…erythrocyte something… and a biopsy? Okay. If you think it’s necessary, doctor, then yes, that sounds alright. I trust your judgment. Just… please tell me what everything means when you get the results. I don’t understand all that medical talk. And… how long will it take to get the results back? And will someone call me, or do I need to make another appointment?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Clarke. It is a lot, and I apologize if it feels overwhelming. We want to be thorough, just to make sure we get to the bottom of this. I promise to explain everything in plain language, no medical jargon. The complete blood count checks your overall blood health. The ESR and CRP are tests that look for inflammation in the body. And the biopsy involves taking a small sample of the skin to look at under a microscope. The blood work usually takes 24-48 hours to come back. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Once we have those results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. We will schedule the biopsy for another day, once we have the results, too. In the meantime, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible, and applying cool compresses to the area to reduce inflammation. You can also take an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen or naproxen, if needed. Do you have any allergies to either of those?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to either of those. Rest… that’s hard. I gotta work. But I’ll try. Cool compresses and ibuprofen… okay. Thank you, doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. So… just wait for the nurse to call? And try to stay off my feet? .
DOCTOR: Exactly, Clarke. Just wait for the nurse to call with the results, and try to rest as much as possible. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, swelling, or redness, please don’t hesitate to call the office right away. Here's some information you can take with you, and don’t hesitate to ask any questions when the nurse calls. It was nice meeting you, Clarke. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and have a good day. .
