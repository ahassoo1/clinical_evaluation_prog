DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, it's about my bruising. I've been getting bruises really easily lately, and they seem…bigger than usual. I'm on a blood thinner, so I figured I should get it checked out, just in case. I don't want any problems.
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in, Ms. Hainley. It’s good you’re being proactive about this, especially given you’re on a blood thinner. We definitely want to investigate this. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, like, I bumped my arm on the corner of the table yesterday – not even that hard – and this big purple bruise showed up almost immediately. Normally, it wouldn’t be this bad. And I have a couple on my legs too, and I don't remember how I got those. It’s kinda worrying, to be honest. It’s not like I'm walking into walls or anything!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley. A sudden increase in bruising, especially with easy onset and without a clear injury, is something we should definitely look into. Could you describe the size of the bruise on your arm?
PATIENT: Umm… okay, let me think. It's… maybe the size of my palm? A big palm, I guess. It’s pretty wide, and it's kinda… raised a little bit. Not a lot, but you can definitely feel it. It's not just flat purple, if that makes sense. And it's kinda tender to the touch. Oh, and it’s dark purple, almost black in the middle.
DOCTOR: Okay, a palm-sized bruise, raised, tender, dark purple, almost black… that gives me some helpful information. And you mentioned some bruising on your legs as well. Are those similar in appearance?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty similar. Not quite as big as the one on my arm, but still bigger than normal. They’re also purple and tender, but not raised as much. They're mostly on my shins, I think. I wear sandals a lot, so maybe I bumped them without realizing? But I don't remember anything specific. It just feels weird. And they showed up, like, a couple of days ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. So multiple bruises appearing relatively quickly, larger than usual, and without a clear cause… I want to get a good overall picture. Ms. Hainley, do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Umm… let me think. Not really. I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I thought that was just because of the heat. I haven't noticed any bleeding gums or nosebleeds or anything like that. No dizziness or anything either. Just the bruising and the tiredness. Oh, and maybe a little bit of achiness, but again, that could just be… getting older. I'm 47, you know.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. It’s good you’re thinking through everything. We’ll take it all into account. To help me get a more complete understanding, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I don’t really have much, honestly. I had strep throat a couple times as a kid, and I broke my wrist when I was in high school, but that's about it. No serious illnesses or anything. I’m not allergic to any medications, as far as I know. And I don’t really take anything except the blood thinner, which the doctor prescribed after I had… well, a blood clot in my leg a couple of years ago. It was scary. That's why I’m so worried about this now.
DOCTOR: A blood clot is certainly a serious concern, and I understand why you’re particularly anxious about this now. It’s good you’re being so vigilant. And you said you’re only on the blood thinner currently?
PATIENT: Yes, just the blood thinner. Warfarin, I think it’s called? I take one pill every day. I try to be really good about taking it at the same time, but sometimes I forget, if I’m really busy. But I usually remember eventually. The doctor did blood tests regularly to check the levels, but I haven’t had one in a while. They said I was stable, so they didn’t need to do them as often.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hainley. That’s helpful. And regarding your family history, do you have any family members with a history of bleeding disorders, easy bruising, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not that I know of, honestly. My dad had high blood pressure, and my mom had arthritis, but nothing like that. My grandparents… I didn't really know them very well. They passed away when I was pretty young. So, I don’t think so. I mean, no one ever talked about bleeding problems or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of bleeding disorders. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I work as an information security analyst, so I’m mostly at a desk all day. It’s kinda stressful, to be honest. I try to go for a walk a few times a week, but it’s hard to find the time. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink very much. Maybe a glass of wine on the weekend. I eat pretty healthy, mostly. I cook a lot, so I know what’s in my food. And I don’t do any drugs.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hainley. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I would like to perform a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse, and then I’d like to examine the bruises on your arm and legs, and also look for any other signs of bleeding. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Go ahead. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 135 over 85. Your pulse is normal at 72. As for the bruise on your arm, it is quite extensive – about ten centimeters across. It's tender to the touch, as you mentioned, and I do notice some swelling and varying shades of purple. Now, let's take a look at the bruises on your legs. Could you please point them out to me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Here. One here, and one here. They don’t hurt as much as the one on my arm, but they're still pretty noticeable. I usually don't bruise this easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, these bruises are about five centimeters in diameter. They are tender to the touch, and I see the discoloration you mentioned. Now, I’m going to check for any other signs of bleeding, like petechiae or gum bleeding. Please open your mouth for me. No signs of bleeding or petechiae in your mouth. Everything looks normal there. Finally, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound normal. All right. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, you are experiencing unexplained bruising, which is concerning given your history of a blood clot and current Warfarin use. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. To investigate further, I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count , a prothrombin time and international normalized ratio to check your Warfarin level, and a peripheral smear. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that sounds good. Blood tests are fine. I just want to know what’s going on. I don't want another blood clot or something. The blood pressure thing… yeah, I guess that’s not good either. So, what happens next? How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Hainley, and we'll get to the bottom of this. The blood tests should take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I would like to provide you with a referral to a hematologist – a specialist in blood disorders – for a more thorough evaluation. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, a specialist sounds good. Better to be safe, right? What does the hematologist do exactly? And will my insurance cover it?
DOCTOR: That’s exactly right, better to be safe. A hematologist specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of blood disorders. They can perform more specialized tests to determine the cause of your unexplained bruising and recommend the appropriate treatment. As for insurance coverage, unfortunately, you mentioned you are currently uninsured. I can have our billing department contact you to discuss potential options, such as payment plans or financial assistance programs. They may also be able to help you explore affordable care options in the area. Would you like me to go ahead and arrange the referral to a hematologist, and have the billing department contact you about the financial options?
PATIENT: Yeah, please. That would be great. I appreciate it. I guess I just need to figure out the money thing. So, is there anything I should do in the meantime? Like, should I avoid certain activities or foods? Anything like that?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. In the meantime, to be cautious, I would advise you to avoid any activities that could lead to injury or trauma. That means avoiding contact sports or anything that could cause a significant bump or bruise. As for foods, there are no specific dietary restrictions you need to follow at this time. However, it is always a good idea to maintain a healthy diet, rich in fruits and vegetables. I would also recommend avoiding taking any over-the-counter medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, as these can increase your risk of bleeding. I'm going to write up a referral for a hematologist and some written instructions outlining these recommendations. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for when you have the results of the blood tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. No aspirin… got it. A follow-up appointment… perfect. I appreciate you explaining everything. I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Alanes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hainley. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Our nurses are always available to assist you. I’ll have the receptionist provide you with the referral information, the written instructions, and a time for your follow-up. Take care, and I hope you have a good day. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again. You too.
