DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Good morning. I... something about learning, the lady on the phone said. About... staying healthy, I think? It's not really important, I just need to... get it over with, you know? My husband made me come.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like this might not be something you specifically chose to pursue, but that's perfectly alright. We can definitely work through this. When you say “something about learning,” can you tell me a little more about what you were hoping to discuss?
PATIENT: Discuss? I don't... I don't remember what I was supposed to discuss. She just said… things. About, you know, not getting sick. I work with metal all day, it's pretty dangerous. Lots of sharp edges. Is that what this is about? Getting cut? Because I already have bandages at home. Lots of them.
DOCTOR: It sounds like the appointment was scheduled as a general wellness check, perhaps with a focus on preventative care given your work environment. Working with metal all day does present some specific risks, and it’s good you’re thinking about safety. Bandages are definitely helpful for minor cuts, but we want to think about more than just treating injuries after they happen. We want to try and prevent them, and make sure we’re also taking care of your overall health. To start, can you tell me a bit about what a typical day at work looks like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, a typical day? It's… loud. Very loud. And dirty. I cut metal. Big sheets of metal. And bend it. And sometimes… weld it. It’s hot, even with the fans. And dusty. Lots of dust. I wear a mask, sometimes. My boss tells me to. I don't always remember to put it on. It's… uncomfortable. And makes it hard to talk to people. Why do you need to know all this? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: No, nothing is wrong yet. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your daily life so I can understand any potential health risks you might be facing. The noise, the dust, the heat, the welding… all of these things can affect your health. And you're right to point out the mask - that's very important. Let's talk about that mask for a moment. How often would you say you wear it during a typical work shift?
PATIENT: Honestly? Maybe… half the time? Sometimes I forget. Or it's just… annoying. And it makes my glasses fog up. I need my glasses to see! I can’t cut metal if I can't see what I'm doing. My husband says I should just get contacts, but I don't trust putting things in my eyes. It sounds… awful. He doesn't understand. He sits at a desk all day. It’s not the same.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. It sounds like you've weighed the pros and cons, and it's understandable why you'd prefer glasses even with the fogging. Let's circle back to the dust for a moment. You mentioned there's a lot of dust in the workshop. Do you experience any symptoms related to that dust?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I… sometimes my throat feels scratchy. And I cough a bit. Especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just… from the loud noise. It dries out my throat, you know? And… sometimes I feel tired. Very tired. But everyone gets tired, right? I just thought it was from working hard all day. My husband says I should sleep more. He’s always telling me what I should do.
DOCTOR: You’re right, everyone gets tired. And a scratchy throat and cough can have many causes. But given your work environment, it’s good we’re talking about this. The dust could certainly be contributing to those symptoms. To get a clearer picture, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmm… not that I know of. I went to the doctor once when I broke my arm as a kid, but that was a long time ago. And I get my yearly checkup, but they just poke and prod and tell me I’m fine. Nothing special. I don’t really like going to the doctor. They always ask a lot of questions. Like this. My husband goes to the doctor all the time. He worries about everything. He said something about high blood pressure once. Is that… contagious? Should I worry about that?
DOCTOR: No, high blood pressure is not contagious. It's a condition someone develops on their own. It sounds like your husband is very proactive about his health, which is good, but it's important to remember everyone is different. You mentioned you have yearly checkups, which is great. Do you recall if they ever checked your lungs or asked you about breathing problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t really remember. They always stick a thing in my arm, and weigh me, and… poke my stomach. And then the lady tells me my numbers. She says “everything looks good.” That's it. I don’t think they ever listened to my lungs. Or asked me about… breathing. Maybe? I really don't pay attention. I just want to get it over with. It’s always a waste of time. My husband says I need to be more responsible about my health. He keeps saying things. It’s… annoying. I'm getting a headache. Is this going to be much longer?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if this feels like a lot of questions. It sounds like those yearly checkups haven’t been very thorough. Just to be sure, and given your work environment, I’d like to do a quick exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, another exam? Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But if it takes too long, I’m going home. My husband will be mad, but… I just want to relax. I haven’t had a chance to relax all week. And my head is really starting to hurt now. Hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll be quick. If you could please take a deep breath in and out for me… Okay, take another deep breath… and hold it… and exhale slowly. Alright, and one more deep breath… good. Okay. Your oxygen saturation is currently 95%, which is within the normal range. However, I am hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, especially on the right side. It’s subtle, but it’s there. This could be related to the dust and irritants at work. Also, I note your weight is 136lbs and height 151cm, which puts your BMI at 59.7, categorizing as Severe Obesity. Do you have any history of asthma or other breathing problems?
PATIENT: Wheezing? What’s wheezing? Is that bad? And…severe what? I don’t like all these big words. I don’t have asthma. Never had it. I just… get tired. A lot. And sometimes I cough. My husband says I need to exercise more. He says I’m carrying too much weight. He always says things like that. It’s…rude. I eat normal. I just… like food. Is this all because of the dust? Can’t I just wear a better mask? Is that all I need to do? Please tell me it's just the mask. I don't want to have to change everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's break things down. Wheezing is a whistling sound you make when you breathe, and it can indicate that your airways are narrowed. It’s often associated with conditions like asthma, but it can also be caused by irritants like dust, especially with prolonged exposure. And you are right to ask about the dust. It is very likely a significant contributor to your symptoms. As for the BMI, it is a measure of body fat based on your height and weight, and yours is in the Severe Obesity category. I am not mentioning it to be rude, but because it can contribute to many health issues and make breathing more difficult. While a better mask would be a very good first step, it might not be the only thing needed. Given the wheezing, I would like to recommend a chest x-ray to rule out any underlying lung conditions. Also, due to the combined factors of the wheezing, the cough, and your work environment, I recommend consulting with a pulmonologist. They are specialists in lung health and can help determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, a chest x-ray? And another doctor? This is… a lot. I just wanted to learn about staying healthy, not… get poked and prodded and sent to a bunch of specialists. Is it really that bad? I feel fine… mostly. And I don't want to go to another doctor. My husband will be happy, though. He always says I need to see more doctors. But I really don't want to. Can't I just try the mask first? And maybe… sleep more? I don't want to do anything else. This is too much. Please. Just the mask. I'm getting a headache again. .
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand you're feeling overwhelmed, and I respect your wishes. We can start with the mask. A well-fitted N95 mask would be the best option. It’s important to make sure it creates a tight seal around your nose and mouth to filter out the dust particles. However, I strongly recommend scheduling an appointment with a pulmonologist as soon as possible. Even if you feel mostly fine, it's best to get a professional assessment to rule out any underlying issues. We need to be proactive about your lung health, given your work environment. I'll give you a referral to a local pulmonologist. I’ll also write down some resources for finding properly fitted N95 masks. And I’ll document our conversation and your concerns. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
