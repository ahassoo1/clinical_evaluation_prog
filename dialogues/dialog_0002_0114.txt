DOCTOR: Hi Maribeth, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… Maribeth Vanderwiele. I have been having trouble breathing when I try to lie flat. It’s quite bothersome, and I’d like to get it sorted out if possible. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Maribeth. No need to worry about wasting my time, that's what I'm here for! Trouble breathing when lying flat… that’s definitely something we should look into. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… it’s hard to explain precisely. When I’m sitting up, or even standing, I breathe just fine. Normal, you might say. But as soon as I try to lie down… especially flat on my back… it feels like something is pressing on my chest. Makes it difficult to take a full breath. I usually have to prop myself up with pillows. Several pillows. It started, oh, maybe a month or so ago, and it seems to be getting a little worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's positional – meaning it happens when you lie down and is relieved by sitting or standing, and worsens when lying flat. And it's been gradually getting worse over the past month. That's helpful to know. Do you notice any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No coughing, no wheezing. My heart doesn’t race, as far as I can tell. Sometimes… sometimes my ankles swell a bit at the end of the day, but I’ve always had a tendency for that. And… I do feel a little more tired than usual, but being 71, one expects a bit of that, doesn’t one? I haven’t noticed anything else specific connected to the breathing problem.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Maribeth. No cough, no wheezing, no palpitations. Swelling in your ankles… and increased fatigue. Okay. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. And I was told I had high blood pressure for a time, but it was well-controlled with medication. I stopped taking the medication, oh, perhaps five years ago, after my divorce. Doctor said it was okay, that lifestyle changes were enough. And… I had a bad fall about ten years ago and broke my wrist. That’s about it, I believe. I've been generally healthy for my age, until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, a history of high blood pressure that was managed and then controlled with lifestyle changes, and a broken wrist ten years ago. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about it. I prefer a cup of chamomile tea if I’m feeling unwell. I find that helps more than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Just the occasional multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat most things, and I haven’t had any trouble with insect bites or pollen, or anything of that nature. My husband… my late husband… he was allergic to bee stings, but I don’t share that affliction.
DOCTOR: Good to know, no known allergies. Now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 88, and she was quite healthy until the very end. She did have some arthritis in her later years. My father… he passed away when I was young, from a heart condition, I believe. And my brother… he had diabetes. That's about all I can recall concerning serious illnesses on either side of the family. It wasn’t a particularly sickly bunch, all in all.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother healthy until late in life with arthritis, father with a heart condition, and a brother with diabetes. Finally, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I’ve always detested smoking. My late husband smoked for a time, but I insisted he do it outdoors. I’ve always been very careful about my health. I don’t drink alcohol either, except perhaps a small glass of wine on very special occasions. And I try to eat a healthy diet – mostly vegetables and lean protein. Though I do enjoy a good piece of chocolate now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and a generally healthy diet. That’s all very helpful information, Maribeth. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your legs and ankles. It shouldn't take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please proceed. I’m eager to find out what’s causing this breathing trouble. Let’s get it sorted out, shall we? I have a book club meeting next week, and I’d like to be able to attend without feeling winded.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s do that. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145 over 90. That’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Okay, I'm listening to your heart and lungs now... and I notice some mild crackles in the lower parts of your lungs. And I do see a little swelling in your ankles, which you mentioned earlier. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some fluid buildup in your lungs, which could be related to your heart function. The elevated blood pressure and the swelling in your ankles are also consistent with that. It’s not necessarily something serious, but we need to investigate further. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray. The blood tests will help us assess your kidney function and rule out other potential causes. The chest X-ray will allow us to see how your lungs and heart look. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. And sensible. Blood tests and an X-ray. Yes, I suppose that’s necessary. I trust your judgment. I just… I don’t want it to be anything too alarming. I'm not a fan of hospitals, if I’m being honest. But if it's needed, it’s needed. Could you explain what the next steps are, precisely? Where will I go for these tests, and when can I expect to hear back from you?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Maribeth. And I assure you, we're doing this to get to the bottom of things and make sure you can enjoy your book club meeting, and everything else, without feeling winded. The blood tests can be done right here in the clinic. We'll just need a small sample. And the chest X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street – it's a very quick and painless procedure. I’ll give you a referral slip. Once the results are back, the lab usually takes about 24 to 48 hours. I'll review them as soon as they're available and give you a call to discuss the findings and the next steps. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your breathing, or if you develop chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all very clear. Blood tests here, X-ray across the street. Results in 24 to 48 hours, and a follow-up appointment. And seek immediate help if things worsen. I believe I have that correct. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently. I appreciate it. It helps to know what to expect. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll just sit here for a moment and gather my thoughts before heading over to the lab. It’s a bit overwhelming, all at once.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Maribeth. Take your time. It is a lot to take in all at once. I'll have the nurse come and draw your blood when you're ready. And please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns at all. We're here to help. Just so you know, to document everything, I’m noting your symptoms as shortness of breath when lying flat, mild crackles auscultated in the lower lung fields bilaterally, +1 pitting edema bilaterally, and elevated blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg. We're ordering blood work to assess kidney function and rule out other causes, and a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs and heart. Take your time, and we’ll get this figured out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is… very kind of you to explain it so thoroughly. I feel a little better knowing you have everything documented. It’s reassuring. I will just sit here for a moment, as you suggested. I think I am ready for the blood tests now. Perhaps I should have brought a book. Still, I will manage. Please let me know when the nurse is available.
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. I'll let the nurse know you're ready right away. She'll be in shortly to take your blood. Just relax, and we'll get through this. She will be with you shortly. Is there anything at all I can get you in the meantime?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am quite alright. Just a little… anxious, perhaps. But I will manage. Thank you for your kindness and patience. I believe I will just sit quietly for a moment until the nurse arrives. I do not want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You aren't a bother at all, Maribeth. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in situations like this. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease a little. I'll be just down the hall if you need anything at all. Don't hesitate to ask. .
PATIENT: .
