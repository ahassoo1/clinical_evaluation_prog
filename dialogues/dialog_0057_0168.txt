DOCTOR: Good morning, Esthela. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, frankly, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t feel it was… necessary. I’m dating someone, and I thought it prudent to get a check-up. One simply doesn't know what people are carrying these days, you understand. It's a matter of…responsibility, really.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Esthela. That's very responsible of you. It's always a good idea to be proactive about your health, especially when starting a new relationship. To get started, can you tell me a little bit more about what specifically prompted you to come in today?
PATIENT: Well, he’s…older. Not ancient, mind you, but certainly not a young man anymore. And one hears stories, doesn’t one? About…things one should be aware of. I suppose I’m mostly concerned about…the usual things. You know. What one catches. And what one gives. I just want to be certain everything is as it should be. It’s not that I don’t trust him, but…better safe than sorry, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. Better safe than sorry is always a good approach. It’s smart to be thorough. So, to clarify, you're concerned about sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, and generally want a health screening?
PATIENT: Precisely. Though, don’t use such…clinical language. It’s rather uncouth. Yes, those things. And anything else a man his age might… harbor. I want a complete picture. I have a very active social life, you understand, and I pride myself on maintaining certain standards. It would be…most distressing to discover anything untoward.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Esthela. We’ll definitely do a comprehensive screening. I want to make sure you have peace of mind. Let’s start with a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. Nothing major, really. I had my tonsils out as a child – a dreadful experience, I assure you. And I broke my arm once, falling off a bicycle. But other than that…just the usual female complaints. A bit of this, a bit of that. Nothing that required…serious attention. I've always been quite careful, you see. I maintain a healthy diet, I exercise regularly, and I rarely drink. I’m not one to indulge in…frivolity.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Esthela. So, no chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I take excellent care of myself. My husband – and now, this gentleman – would attest to that. I have my blood pressure checked annually by my primary care physician and it's always…perfectly acceptable. And I would never allow myself to become…overweight. It’s simply dreadful. No, I’m quite certain I’m in excellent health, which is why I’m somewhat surprised to be here. But, as I said, one can never be too careful.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Esthela. It’s always best to be proactive, and it sounds like you are very diligent about your health. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin. And occasionally, ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s…infrequent. Really, that’s it. I detest taking pills. I much prefer natural remedies, when possible. Though, frankly, I find most of them…ineffective. And I certainly wouldn't trust anything a television commercial tells me to take. It's all about profits, you understand. No, just the multivitamin. And, perhaps, a little chamomile tea before bed. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea definitely doesn't count as medication! Just checking to be thorough. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none whatsoever. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. My husband has a slight allergy to shellfish, but I do not. Honestly, I’m quite meticulous about what I consume. I read all the labels, I avoid processed foods, and I only purchase organic whenever possible. It's all about quality, you see. I refuse to put anything harmful into my body. It simply wouldn't do.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Esthela. It sounds like you have a very healthy lifestyle. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your social history, if you don't mind. This information helps me get a complete picture of your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I would never. I mean, I’ve been…active, certainly. But always with…discretion. And I’ve always insisted on…protection. I’m not a…careless woman. The thought! No, never. I’m quite certain of that. It would be…a scandal. And frankly, rather appalling. I pride myself on my reputation.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Esthela. And you mentioned being active, and using protection - that's very responsible. To continue, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Well, yes. As I said, I am…dating someone. And, shall we say, the relationship is progressing nicely. It’s not as if I’m leading a… dissolute lifestyle, Doctor. It’s a perfectly respectable connection. We’re…compatible, let’s say. And it would be…unnatural, wouldn't it, to abstain completely? It’s a matter of…connection, you understand. Though, of course, we are both…careful. I would never jeopardize my health.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. It's perfectly natural. Now, and I'm going to ask this in a straightforward manner, are you currently using any form of birth control?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Absolutely not. I am…married. And my husband and I…have already addressed that particular matter. It’s…no longer relevant, shall we say? It’s rather indelicate to discuss, isn’t it? I simply wouldn't feel comfortable elaborating. And frankly, I find the question rather…unnecessary. It’s a perfectly closed chapter. I assure you. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, Esthela, that is perfectly sufficient. Thank you for your honesty. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had…high blood pressure, I believe. And my father…he had a touch of arthritis, as he got older. Nothing particularly serious, mind you. Mostly, my family is quite…robust. We tend to live long lives, thankfully. And we all take rather good care of ourselves. We believe in moderation, you understand. No smoking, no excessive drinking, and a healthy diet. It’s a family tradition, really. Though, my aunt Mildred…she had a touch of something…but I couldn’t tell you exactly what it was. It was a long time ago. She wasn’t a particularly…stable woman, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know, Esthela. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any other concerns you have?
PATIENT: Well…yes, actually. There is one thing. It’s rather…embarrassing, to be honest. But I thought it best to be thorough. I’ve been experiencing a…slight change in my…discharge. It’s not painful, exactly. But it's…different. And it's been making me…anxious. I wouldn’t want it to…interfere with my current relationship, you understand. It's a perfectly respectable connection, and I wouldn't want anything to…complicate matters. It's probably nothing, mind you. But I thought it best to mention it. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Esthela. It’s very good you brought that up. It's much better to address these things, even if they feel embarrassing. We can definitely take a look at that. It’s very common to experience changes, and often they aren't anything serious. It sounds like a good idea to do a pelvic exam and possibly a few tests to determine the cause. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be…most sensible. I suppose. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Though, I must admit, I'm not particularly fond of…those examinations. They’re rather…invasive, aren’t they? But if it’s necessary… then so be it. I just hope it won’t take too long. I have a luncheon scheduled this afternoon with several…important ladies. And I wouldn't want to be…delayed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Esthela. We'll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I will explain everything as we go along. We'll start with a visual exam, then a gentle internal exam. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Before we begin, would you like me to explain the procedure in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I always prefer to know what to expect. It’s the…uncertainty that bothers me most. I simply dislike surprises. Especially…down there. Explain everything thoroughly, Doctor. And please, be gentle. I’m not as…resilient as I used to be. And if it's going to be uncomfortable…please just warn me beforehand. I do dislike unpleasant sensations.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. I will absolutely explain everything beforehand and be as gentle as possible. First, I'll have you lie on your back with your feet in stirrups, similar to how you would for a Pap smear. I'll visually examine the external genitalia for any redness, swelling, or unusual lesions. Then, I'll use a speculum – a slightly curved instrument – to gently open the vaginal canal so I can see the cervix. This might feel a little bit of pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. If it does feel uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. I can stop at any time. I will then collect a sample of discharge for lab testing to check for any infections, such as bacterial vaginosis, yeast infection, or sexually transmitted infections. We'll also do a quick check of your pelvic organs to make sure everything feels normal. Throughout the exam, I'll explain what I'm doing and what I'm looking for. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: That…sounds rather thorough. And a little bit…intimidating, if I’m being honest. The “speculum” sounds particularly…unpleasant. Will it be…cold? And will it hurt? I do have a rather low tolerance for discomfort, you understand. And will I need to undress completely? I simply dislike being exposed. Please assure me it will be quick, Doctor. And that you’ve performed this procedure many, many times. I prefer a…competent professional.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Esthela. It's perfectly natural to feel a little anxious about this. The speculum is made of plastic and is warmed to room temperature before use. It shouldn’t be cold. And while it might feel a little bit of pressure or stretching, it shouldn’t hurt. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately, and we can pause or stop at any time. You will need to undress from the waist down. We will provide a gown and a drape to ensure your privacy. I've performed this procedure countless times, and I am very experienced. My priority is your comfort and well-being. I’ll explain everything as we go, and you're welcome to ask questions at any time. We’ll take it at your pace. Before we begin, would you like me to show you the speculum so you can see what it looks like?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Seeing it might…alleviate some of my anxiety. I simply dislike the unknown. And perhaps you could explain what you’ll be looking for? I don’t want to be…surprised by any unpleasant discoveries. I pride myself on my…hygiene, you understand. It would be most distressing to discover otherwise. Show me the instrument, Doctor. And speak slowly. I need to…process this information.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. Here is the speculum. As you can see, it’s made of smooth plastic. It comes in different sizes, and I will choose the smallest one that allows me to get a good view. The sides gently separate to hold the vaginal walls open. We’ll use a lubricant to make it more comfortable. During the exam, I will be looking for any signs of irritation, inflammation, or unusual discharge. I'll also check the cervix for any abnormalities. We'll send a sample of the discharge to the lab to identify any potential infections. The entire process usually takes just a few minutes. We’ll move slowly and gently, and you’re in control. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. Are you comfortable with me proceeding?
PATIENT: It…looks rather intimidating. And rather…cold. Though I suppose I have no choice. If it’s necessary for my…peace of mind, then so be it. But please, be as gentle as possible, Doctor. And do warn me before you…insert it. I simply dislike surprises. And if you discover anything…unpleasant, please be discreet. I wouldn't want to cause a…scene. Proceed, Doctor. But slowly. Very slowly. And with plenty of lubricant.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. I understand your concerns, and I will proceed with the utmost care and respect. I will use a generous amount of lubricant to ensure your comfort, and I’ll warn you before each step. I will also move at your pace and stop if you feel any discomfort. First, I’m going to position you comfortably on the exam table. Then, I’ll have you bend your knees and relax your legs. I'll explain everything as I go. Are you ready?
PATIENT: As ready as I’ll ever be, I suppose. Please, proceed. But do remember, gently. And with plenty of warning. I simply dislike being…surprised. And if you discover anything… unpleasant, please be discreet. This is a… delicate matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, Esthela. I'm going to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. This may feel a little bit of pressure. Is that comfortable for you?
PATIENT: It’s…uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly. But…unpleasant. And rather…intrusive. Please, be quick about it, Doctor. And do explain what you’re looking for. I simply dislike being kept in the dark. Is everything…normal? Or are you discovering something…unusual?
DOCTOR: I'm just checking the external tissues for any redness, swelling, or lesions. Everything appears normal so far, Esthela. It's just a routine part of the exam. Now, I'm going to gently separate the labia and insert the speculum. I’ll warm it up a little bit more before inserting. I’ll warn you before I do, and you can let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. Are you ready?
PATIENT: As ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. But please, be gentle. And do warn me before you insert it. And if it's going to be…uncomfortable, please just stop. I simply don't want any…surprises. Proceed, Doctor. But slowly. Very slowly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Esthela. I'm going to gently insert the speculum now. It may feel a little bit of pressure as it goes in. Take a deep breath and relax your muscles. Remember, you are in control. If you feel any discomfort, just let me know, and I will stop immediately. This may feel a little bit of stretching, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’m just getting a better view of your cervix now. Does that feel alright?
PATIENT: It’s…uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. And rather…cold. Please, be quick about it, Doctor. I simply don’t want this to…drag on. And is everything alright? Or are you discovering something…unusual? It feels…invasive. Very invasive. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Okay, Esthela. It sounds like you're quite uncomfortable, and I want to respect that. We can stop right here. I apologize if this is causing you distress. It’s more important that you feel safe and comfortable. Everything appears normal so far, but I understand you're not comfortable continuing, and that’s perfectly okay. We can schedule a follow-up appointment with another doctor who may be able to continue the exam, or we can simply leave it at this. I will document your concerns and send you home with instructions to monitor your symptoms. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Stop. Please, just stop. I simply cannot endure any more of this. It was…a mistake. A dreadful mistake. I simply wanted to be…cautious. But this is…too much. Send me home. And please, don’t tell anyone about this. I wouldn’t want this…information to get out. It would be…most embarrassing. Just send me home. And thank you…for stopping. You were…kind to do so.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. I completely understand. I’m so sorry this experience was distressing for you. I will absolutely respect your privacy and will not share this information with anyone. I'll write you a note for follow-up with your primary care physician, documenting your concerns and the fact that we stopped the exam due to your discomfort. I will also recommend monitoring for any changes in your symptoms. I want you to know that you did the right thing by coming in to get checked. And it’s perfectly okay to stop if something feels wrong. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No. Thank you. Just…send me home. And please, don’t mention this to anyone. It would be…most distressing. I simply wanted to be…cautious. But this was…too much. I think I’ll just…stick to myself. Thank you, Doctor. And goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. Your privacy is my utmost priority. I will not mention this to anyone. I’m so sorry this experience wasn’t more comfortable for you. If you experience any concerning symptoms in the future, please don't hesitate to contact your primary care physician or return to the clinic. Take care of yourself, Esthela. Goodbye. .
