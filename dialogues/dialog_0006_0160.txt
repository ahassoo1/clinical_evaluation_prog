DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s ridiculous I even have to be here. But my daughter insisted. Said I was looking “pale” and eating dirt was “unhealthy.” As if she knows anything about what I need. It’s just… I’ve been tired. Really tired. And I’ve been… well, craving things. Not food things, exactly. More like… earth. Clay. You know.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Tiredness… and cravings for… earth?
PATIENT: Yes, earth. Clay. Dirt. Whatever you want to call it. It’s not like I’m enjoying it, if that’s what you’re thinking. It just… feels right. And it helps, a little. Though, honestly, everything feels wrong these days. This tiredness is… different. It’s not just being old, I can tell you that much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… well, the tiredness is new-ish. Maybe a month or two? But the… cravings? They come and go. I think it started properly after my neighbor, Mrs. Abernathy, passed. She had a lovely garden. Red clay, mostly. That's where I… first noticed it, I suppose. Though, I've always had a feeling for the earth, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: After Mrs. Abernathy passed… and red clay specifically. Hmm. And this tiredness – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Mostly. Some days are worse than others, naturally. But it's always there. Like a weight. And it doesn’t get better with rest. I sleep plenty. More than enough, probably. But I wake up just as tired. It’s… frustrating. You wouldn't understand.
DOCTOR: Well, I try to understand. And it’s good you’re getting enough sleep, even if it doesn't help. Okay. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, if that’s what you mean. And my knees ache. But that’s just old age, surely. Everything’s falling apart, bit by bit. What other changes would there be? It's not like I've grown a second head.
DOCTOR: Okay, eyesight and aching knees… normal for your age, you're right. But just to be thorough, have you noticed anything different with your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Honestly, I don't pay much attention to it. I eat when I'm hungry. I eat what my daughter makes, mostly. She worries too much. It’s… fine. Though, I haven't been wanting meat lately. Which is odd. I used to love a good roast. And I suppose I've been… less interested in sweets. But that could just be the tiredness, couldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Possibly. No recent weight loss, then?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. I haven’t weighed myself in ages. My daughter probably keeps track of it. She likes to measure everything. Honestly, it's a bit much. I'm perfectly… substantial. I’m not wasting away, if that’s what you’re getting at.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. Never had any trouble breathing. I used to walk miles, back in Ethiopia. The air was… thinner, maybe. But I was younger then. Now, I mostly sit. And worry. Though, I don’t think that affects my breathing. It’s just… a general feeling of… unwellness.
DOCTOR: Okay. This is a bit unusual, and I want to rule a few things out. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your stomach, and maybe take your blood pressure. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Honestly. It's probably just a vitamin deficiency. My daughter keeps saying I don’t eat enough greens. But I don't see why I need a whole examination for a little tiredness and a harmless craving. But… fine. Get it over with. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, though a little faint. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Blood pressure is a little low, 110/70. Pulse is also a little slow, 60. Skin appears pale, yes. Are you experiencing any dizziness or shortness of breath at rest?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No, not really. Though, sometimes I feel a bit… lightheaded when I stand up too quickly. And… well, the tiredness is so constant, it’s hard to tell if I’m short of breath. I just… feel weak. All the time. It's just… exhausting. Honestly, I don't know why I even came. This is all a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, lightheadedness with standing… and persistent fatigue. I want to order some blood work, Candis. It’ll help us rule out a few things – things like anemia, vitamin deficiencies, and thyroid issues. Also, given your cravings and fatigue, I'd like to check your iron levels specifically. And… this might sound odd, but I also want to check your lead levels. It's uncommon, but cravings for dirt can sometimes indicate lead poisoning. It's probably nothing serious, but it's better to be safe. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lead poisoning? You think I've got lead poisoning from eating a little bit of dirt? Honestly, doctor, that's ridiculous. I lived in Ethiopia, I’ve seen real problems. Not this… nonsense. But fine. Do your tests. Just get it over with. And don't expect me to be surprised if everything comes back perfectly normal. This is a waste of time, truly. And don't bother telling me to stop eating dirt, either. It's… complicated.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. I’ll order the blood work, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. It’s a standard procedure, and it’s best to rule everything out. While we're waiting for the results, try to rest as much as possible, and stay hydrated. I’ll also give you a referral to a hematologist, just as a precaution. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – fever, severe weakness, or confusion – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Questions? No. I think you’ve wasted enough of my time for one day. Just… get me the results. And don't bother calling with anything trivial. Honestly, I doubt any of this will amount to anything. Just a waste of money and energy. .
