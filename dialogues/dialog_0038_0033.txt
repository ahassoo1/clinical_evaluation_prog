DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. My name is Dr. Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here. My…assistant, I suppose, scheduled this. Something about my…senses? It’s all rather bothersome, really. I'm a very busy woman, you know. Pediatric surgery doesn't simply pause for…this.
DOCTOR: Right, I see. It looks like your assistant scheduled this appointment for a general sensory check-up. That's perfectly alright, Ms. Julie. Sometimes it’s good to just get things looked at, even if you aren’t entirely sure what's going on. So, can you tell me a little more about what's been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just…things haven’t been quite right. My hearing, I believe, is a little… muffled. And my vision…well, it’s not as sharp as it used to be. Though I doubt it’s anything significant. Probably just needing new glasses. I haven’t had much time to deal with it, what with everything. Honestly, I don't recall when it started. A few weeks, perhaps? It’s all a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing and slightly blurry vision, developing over a few weeks. That's helpful. Just to clarify, is the muffled hearing in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, of course. Why would it be just one? Honestly, Doctor, I am a surgeon. I understand the basics of anatomy. It's simply…both ears feel…distant. Everything sounds as if it's underwater, perhaps. Though I haven't been swimming lately. It's rather inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Apologies, Ms. Julie. Just covering all bases. Underwater is a good description, thank you. And you mentioned your vision isn't as sharp - is that in both eyes as well?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, both eyes. Is this truly necessary? I have patients waiting. It’s a general fuzziness, you see. Not a complete inability to see, naturally. Things are simply…less defined. Like looking through a smudged lens, perhaps. Though I assure you, my surgical precision has not been affected. Not yet, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, both ears with a muffled sensation, and both eyes with a general fuzziness. You're right to point out your surgical precision remains intact – that’s very good to know. To get a better idea of what might be going on, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any dizziness, ringing in your ears, or headaches alongside these changes?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. A mild throbbing, really. Nothing I haven't managed with a simple analgesic. Dizziness… perhaps a little unsteady on my feet a few times, but I attributed that to fatigue. As for ringing… well, now that you mention it, a slight…tinnitus, perhaps? A very high-pitched whine. But it’s fleeting, barely noticeable. Honestly, Doctor, I’m hardly one to dwell on minor discomforts. I have much more pressing matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional mild headaches, some unsteadiness, and a slight high-pitched tinnitus. Thank you for sharing that. Now, just to get a fuller picture, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, must we? Really, Doctor, I haven’t the time for a recitation of my entire life. I suppose… I had a bout of… the shingles, years ago. And a rather unpleasant hysterectomy in my thirties. Nothing else of significance. Perfectly healthy, otherwise. I maintain a rigorous schedule and a balanced diet – when I have the time, of course. I simply haven’t the patience for prolonged illness. And frankly, I doubt any of it is relevant. This is likely just a temporary inconvenience. Perhaps stress-related.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Julie. And you’re right, it may well be something minor. But it's important to rule out any underlying causes. I just want to be thorough. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I've never had an allergic reaction in my life. I find that a healthy constitution simply doesn't allow for such things. Though, I did once experience a mild rash from a particularly cheap brand of hand cream, but I wouldn’t consider that a true allergy. It was probably just the fragrance. Honestly, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this? I have a surgery scheduled for this afternoon. A rather delicate procedure, you see. It requires my full attention.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, and a delicate surgery this afternoon. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let me see… Occasionally, I take ibuprofen for headaches, as I mentioned. And a multivitamin, when I remember. That's it. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. It interferes with my judgment, you see. I need to be sharp, precise. No need for anything clouding my mind. Honestly, Doctor, I highly doubt any of this is relevant. I suspect I’m simply overworked. A good night’s sleep is all I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie. Just to clarify, ibuprofen as needed and a multivitamin. Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just a basic check of your ears, eyes, and a few neurological tests to assess your balance and reflexes. It should only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An exam? Honestly, Doctor, are you serious? I am a respected surgeon! I examine people, I don't allow myself to be examined. And neurological tests? What is this, a residency interview? It's utterly ridiculous. I haven’t got time for this…this charade. Honestly, I think I’ve wasted enough of my valuable time already. Perhaps a referral to a specialist? Someone who understands the importance of efficiency? I really must get back to my patients. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Julie. I apologize if I’ve overstepped. You are absolutely right, your time is incredibly valuable. Given your preference, I will write you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected neurologist. She is excellent at quickly identifying the cause of sensory changes. I'll also include a note outlining your concerns. Here is the referral information. Please schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
