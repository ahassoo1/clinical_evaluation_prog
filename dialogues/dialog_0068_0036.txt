DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Barban. I'm Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, Mr. Barban is correct. I am here for… a check-up before the insurance starts, I think. Medicare said I need this done. It is… necessary, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's... quite common. A welcome to Medicare visit, alright. Just to be clear, is there anything specific you're concerned about, or are we just going through a general assessment to get things started?
PATIENT: Concerned? No, not really. I feel… fine. I eat, I sleep, I work. Everything works. It is… a waste of time, but if Medicare wants it, then I am here. I do not understand why they need to poke and prod if nothing is wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Barban. It can feel unnecessary when you're feeling well. But these visits are often helpful for preventative care – catching things early, before they become problems. We’ll keep it as brief as possible. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospital? No. Never. I am a strong man. I work with… the food, you know? Cutting, cleaning. Hard work. No time for… getting sick. A little cold sometimes, maybe. But nothing a man cannot work through. My father, he was the same. Strong. Never sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear. And has your father had any major health problems that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father… he worked very hard, always. He… he had problems with his feet, I think. From standing so much. And… his hands, they were always sore. The work was hard on him. But he never went to the doctor. Said it was a waste of money. Like me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Spices, meats… everything. My mother, she made wonderful food. Very flavorful. I have never had… a reaction. No.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I take nothing. A man needs to be strong, yes? Pills make you weak. My body is strong. I do not need… assistance. I drink water. That is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. Let’s do a quick physical exam then, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: If you must. But make it quick. I have things to do. And please, no… unnecessary poking. I am not a child.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Barban. Just a routine check. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Fine. But do not squeeze too tightly. It is uncomfortable. And hurry.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, open your mouth and say "Ahhh..." Throat looks normal. No signs of infection. Let me take a look in your ears now. Ears are clear as well. Everything appears normal so far, Mr. Barban. Now, just to be thorough, I’d like to check your pulse and reflexes. Pulse is strong. Reflexes are normal. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, but your blood pressure is slightly elevated. We should monitor that. Do you have any family history of hypertension?
PATIENT: Hypertension? What is that? Is that… bad? My father… he was always a little… angry. Very passionate man. He would get… red in the face sometimes. Is that what you mean? He never went to a doctor. I do not know. He just… was. A strong man. He did not worry about… these things.
DOCTOR: Hypertension is high blood pressure, Mr. Barban. It can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. Your father’s anger could have been related to it, but it’s difficult to say without knowing more. Since you're generally feeling well, we can start with some lifestyle modifications to help lower your blood pressure: reducing salt intake, regular exercise, and managing stress. I also recommend a follow-up appointment in three months to recheck your blood pressure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? Exercise? I work with food all day. That is exercise enough. And salt is… flavor. I do not understand. Three months? Very well. But if it is just to repeat these… unnecessary checks, I do not see the point. I have important work to do. Make it quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. We’ll keep the follow-up brief. I’ll have the nurse schedule that for you. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headaches before then, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. I think… this has been a waste of time. But if the insurance requires it, then… so be it. Just… do not expect me to change my life for a slightly elevated… whatever you called it. I have work to do. That will be all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. You're dismissed. The nurse will be with you shortly to schedule your follow-up. Please have a good day. .
PATIENT: Hmmph.
