DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, to be honest, I don't really love talking about this, but a friend suggested I come in and ask about… preventative stuff. About staying healthy, you know? She called it PrEP, I think? I’m not really sure what it all means, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask. I just want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: PrEP… yes. Pre-exposure prophylaxis. Generally, that’s discussed in the context of HIV prevention. Are you sexually active, Ms. Trefren?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. HIV. That’s what PrEP is for. Yes, I am. Though, honestly, it's…complicated. I've been dating a little, but it’s not regular or anything. And it’s… different people, sometimes. That’s why my friend thought I should look into this. Is it…is it something I should be worried about? I just want to be safe.
DOCTOR: It's prudent to be informed about your health risks, Ms. Trefren. While PrEP is a viable option for reducing the risk of HIV transmission, it’s not necessarily a blanket recommendation for everyone. It does come with its own set of considerations, and we need to assess your individual situation. Before we delve further, let’s get a more complete picture of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… Not to anything major, no. I get a little sniffly with cats, but that’s it. And I had a reaction to penicillin when I was a kid, but I haven’t taken that in… decades. Does that count? I don’t really have any serious health problems, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. And the "usual aches and pains" – can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, just my knees acting up sometimes, especially when it’s cold or humid. And my back…it’ll just seize up if I lift something heavy, or if I’ve been standing for too long. Nothing a little rest and ibuprofen can’t fix, usually. I wouldn't say it's painful pain, more…annoying. I’ve just gotten used to it. Is this important for the…PrEP thing? I'm starting to worry I’m wasting your time.
DOCTOR: It’s important for me to have a full understanding of your overall health, Ms. Trefren. These seemingly minor issues can sometimes be indicative of underlying conditions. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis, or any other musculoskeletal problems?
PATIENT: No, never diagnosed with anything like that. Doctors always just said it was probably from being on my feet so much at work, or just “getting old.” I’m a parking attendant, you see. Lots of walking, lots of standing. Not a glamorous job, but it pays the bills. I just assumed the aches were part of it. I’ve never really bothered to get it checked out properly. It’s not… debilitating, you know? I can still do my job. Should I have?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any other significant medical issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… I had my gallbladder out about fifteen years ago, but that was a one-time thing. Recovered fine. Oh! And I had pneumonia a couple of years back, but that cleared up with antibiotics. Honestly, that's about it. I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. I eat reasonably well, I try to get some exercise when I can, and I definitely don’t smoke. Is this getting us anywhere closer to figuring out this PrEP thing? I really don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have this information, Ms. Trefren, though I still need a more detailed history to determine if PrEP is appropriate for you. Now, regarding your social history… Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Sexually active. Yes. I mean, on and off. It’s not a steady relationship. More… casual. Different people. It’s… complicated. I don't really have a "regular" partner, if that makes sense. I just…date. Is that…too much information? I feel like I'm oversharing. It’s just…I don’t want to get into all the details, if I don't have to. It’s not exactly polite dinner conversation.
DOCTOR: The number of partners and types of sexual activity are relevant, Ms. Trefren. Do you consistently use protection during sexual encounters?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Not always. It's…embarrassing to admit. Sometimes it's forgotten, sometimes it's just…not brought up. I know I should, but it doesn’t always happen. That's probably why my friend suggested I look into this PrEP thing. She said it was better to be safe than sorry. I feel terrible saying this out loud, like I'm a bad person. It's just… things happen. Is this a judgment thing? I really don’t want to be lectured.
DOCTOR: I'm not here to judge, Ms. Trefren. However, consistent condom use is the most effective way to prevent sexually transmitted infections. Since you’ve indicated inconsistent protection, we need to assess your risk factors further. Have you ever been tested for HIV or other STIs?
PATIENT: I… I think so. A few years ago, maybe? At a clinic, somewhere. I don’t really remember the details. It was… a while ago. Everything felt very rushed, and I was honestly just glad to get it over with. I don't have the results, I never bothered to follow up. Does it matter? Is it important to know if I have anything? This is all very overwhelming. I just wanted to see if this PrEP thing was something I should be worried about, and now it feels like I’m failing some sort of test.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Trefren. And you aren’t failing any test. Knowing your STI status is crucial before starting PrEP, as it won’t prevent infections you already have. We will need to perform bloodwork to assess your current status. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Let me see... my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes. Both died fairly young, actually. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had some kind of… arthritis, I think. Really bad pain in her hands. Other than that, not really. No heart disease, no cancer, nothing major that I know of. Honestly, we weren’t a very close family. I didn’t really talk to them much about their health. This is all feeling very…invasive, to be honest. Is this PrEP thing even worth it? I'm starting to regret coming in.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Trefren. We are gathering information to make an informed decision about your health. Now, final question before we proceed with the bloodwork: do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just ibuprofen, when my knees act up. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a melatonin tablet. That's it. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Honestly, I'm not a fan. So, does that mean we're actually going to do the bloodwork now? I really hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a shift starting in a few hours. I’m starting to feel a bit… anxious about all of this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Trefren. Based on your history, it seems prudent to proceed with bloodwork to assess your HIV and STI status, as well as your overall health. This will give us a clearer picture of whether PrEP is a suitable option for you. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood. After the results are in, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will you explain everything to me afterwards? I just want to be sure I understand what’s going on. And… what if something is wrong? I’m really nervous now. Can I at least get a glass of water before this? I feel a bit lightheaded. .
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll have the nurse bring you some water immediately. The results should be available within a week. I will thoroughly explain everything to you when they are ready, and we will discuss all available options. If anything is wrong, we will address it promptly and create a treatment plan. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please, try to relax. We will take this one step at a time.
