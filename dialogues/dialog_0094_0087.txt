DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think? The usual. Honestly, I don’t really remember why I need it, just that someone told me to come. Can we just… get it done?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. It’s not uncommon to forget details, especially when it comes to routine appointments. No problem at all. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history to ensure we're on the same page, and then we can proceed with the lab work. Do you have a list of medications you currently take, or perhaps any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications… allergies… I… think I take something for my blood pressure? A little white pill. But honestly, Doctor, I couldn’t tell you the name of it. And allergies… no, I don’t think so. Never really had trouble with anything. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be frank. Can we just skip that part and get to the blood draw?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. We can certainly proceed. However, to ensure your safety and provide the most accurate care, even a little information is helpful. Do you recall who prescribed the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, no. It was… a doctor. A long time ago. Maybe at the old hospital? Before… well, before things changed. I really don't remember. Look, is it alright if we just skip it? I feel a bit lightheaded just trying to think about it. Can we do the blood work now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. We can proceed with the blood work. However, I do want to document that you’re currently taking medication for blood pressure, but we don’t have specific details about it. This is important for accurate interpretation of the results. Before we get to the blood draw, let me quickly check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. It's a standard part of the check-up, and it will give us a baseline to work with. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… quick, please. I don't like needles. And I have… things to do later.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. We'll be as quick and efficient as possible. Just relax your arm for me. 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, regular. And your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Okay, everything looks stable. Now, let’s move on to the blood draw. I’ll have the phlebotomist come in to assist us. They’re very skilled and gentle. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable during the process?
PATIENT: Just… tell them to be quick. And don't bend the needle. I had a bad experience once. A very bad experience. Just… get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. I will personally let them know you’re a bit anxious about the needle and to be extra careful. They are very experienced and will do their best to make it as comfortable as possible for you. “Nurse Anya, could you please come in and assist with a blood draw for Mr. Croonquist?
PATIENT: Hurry up… please. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Ah, Nurse Anya, thank you for coming. This is Mr. Croonquist. He needs a blood draw. He’s a little anxious about it, so if you could be extra gentle and take your time, that would be wonderful. He also mentioned a previous negative experience with a blood draw, so please be mindful of that. He is currently taking medication for blood pressure, but we don't have the specifics on the medication name. Nurse Anya is excellent, Mr. Croonquist. She’ll explain everything as she goes. I will be right here if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Just… get it done. Quickly. And don't poke around. I really hate needles.
DOCTOR: “He’s a little apprehensive, and mentioned a bad experience previously. Please be extra gentle.” Just breathe deeply, Mr. Croonquist. You're doing great. I'm right here if you need anything at all. Let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: No… no, don't… it hurts. Just… get it over with. Hurry… please…
DOCTOR: “Slowly, please. He’s quite anxious.” “You’re doing very well, Mr. Croonquist. Just focus on your breathing. It will be over soon. You're very brave."
PATIENT: No… stop… it hurts… please… Just… finish it. Please.
DOCTOR: “Almost done. Be extra gentle with the final draw." “You're doing wonderfully, Mr. Croonquist. Just a few more seconds. Breathe deeply. You’re very strong." “All done, Mr. Croonquist. You did it! That was very brave of you."
PATIENT: Finally… Is it… over? I need to go. Just… get me out of here.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s all over, Mr. Croonquist. You did very well. Let’s have you sit down for a moment before you leave, just to make sure you’re feeling alright. I’ll get you a glass of water. The lab results should be available in a few days. We can discuss them then and determine the best course of action. While we wait for the results, if you can recall any details about the blood pressure medication you're taking – even the color of the pill or where you get it filled – that would be helpful. Otherwise, if you’re concerned, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss potential medication options. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: No… no appointments. Just… forget it. I’ll… I’ll deal with it myself. Just… let me go. I need to get home. It’s been… too much. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. You’re free to leave whenever you’re ready. But I’m concerned about your reaction, and I want to ensure you’re safe. Would you mind if I have the nurse walk you to the front desk?
