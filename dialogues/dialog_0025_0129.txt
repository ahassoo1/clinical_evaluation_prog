DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s get this over with. It’s my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Like tar, almost. And I take those pills, you know, for my joints. The red ones. Every day. Been taking ‘em for years. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Right. Black stool… and you're taking red pills for your joints. Years, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, years! Honestly, I don’t know exactly how long, but a good while. They help with the ache, you see. I can’t be hobbling around, now can I? It’s those NSAIDs, isn’t it? My niece, bless her heart, keeps reading things on the internet about them. Always something to worry about with that woman. But I figure if it was really bad, I’d know, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Hatchard, it's good you're observant, but "knowing" isn't always reliable. Black, tarry stools can indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract, which is why we need to investigate. While the pills could be a factor, we can’t rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Goodness gracious. I haven’t seen any blood, if that's what you’re getting at. Just… dark. And frankly, I haven’t been poking around checking. That’s a bit much, don't you think? I eat fine, sleep alright… everything's pretty normal, all things considered. What exactly are you trying to find out? And how long is this going to take? I’ve got a roast in the oven.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the time, Ms. Hatchard. We just need to gather some information to ensure everything is alright. No poking around is necessary. Let’s start with a review of your medical history. Have you ever had any stomach ulcers, or any bleeding problems in the past?
PATIENT: Ulcers? No, never. Not that I recall, anyway. My doctor back in Chicago… old Dr. Hemlock, a good man… he always said I had a strong constitution. I could eat anything. Though, I did have that bout of heartburn a few years back, but that was after I ate a whole plate of pierogies. Not exactly bleeding, is it? And honestly, I don't go to doctors unless something is really wrong, so I wouldn’t even know about any old problems. Medicare doesn’t cover a lot, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No history of ulcers, heartburn related to diet… understood. And you said you've been taking these red pills for years. Do you know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I just ask the pharmacist for “the joint pills”. They come in a red bottle. I’ve been getting them at Miller’s Pharmacy down the street since… well, since we moved here. Old Man Miller knows what I need. I don’t bother with names and dosages. Too complicated. And frankly, it's not like I’m a spring chicken anymore. My memory isn't what it used to be. Is it really necessary to know the name? It's red, it helps, that's all that matters.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, with all due respect, knowing the medication is very important. It allows me to determine the potential side effects and interactions. It's not about questioning your memory; it's about providing you with the best possible care. Let's try this: do you have the bottle with you?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Alright, alright. Hold your horses. Here. Now, can we please get on with it? I haven’t got all day, you know. And don't tell me I need to start writing things down, because I simply won’t.
DOCTOR: Okay… Naproxen 500mg. You’re taking 500 milligrams of Naproxen. That can cause stomach irritation and bleeding, especially with long-term use. Now, Ms. Hatchard, I’m going to need to ask a few more questions. Have you ever had any problems with anemia?
PATIENT: Anemia? Is that… low iron? I don’t think so. I eat my spinach. My husband, bless his soul, always makes sure I get enough greens. He worries about me, you see. I haven’t been feeling particularly… weak, if that’s what you mean. Just… old. You get tired when you’re old. It's natural. And honestly, I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's probably just something I ate. That new pickle relish at the store… maybe it’s something in that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, I understand your reluctance, but we need to rule out serious causes. Given the black stool and your long-term Naproxen use, I need to do a quick physical exam and order some blood work. It’s a standard procedure. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Then the lab tests will tell us more about your red blood cell count and if there's any evidence of bleeding. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. A physical exam? Blood work? It's always something with doctors. Fine. Do what you have to do. But don’t keep me long. And please, be gentle. My hip's been acting up something fierce lately. And I still think it's that pickle relish. But go ahead. Get it over with. The sooner I can get home to my roast, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! There! Right there. A little bit tender. Not terrible, but… yeah. That’s a bit uncomfortable. It’s always been a bit sensitive since… well, since the children were born. But don't go poking around too much, now. It's not pleasant, you know. And really, it's probably just gas. I had a piece of cabbage with dinner last night. That always does it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the lower abdomen. And you suspect it may be related to gas. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to get a baseline. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’ll need to draw some blood. It's a standard CBC - complete blood count - to check your red blood cell levels and look for any signs of bleeding. Do you have any allergies to latex or any difficulties with blood draws?
PATIENT: Latex? No, I don't think so. Never had a problem with gloves before. And blood draws… well, I don’t like them, but I haven’t fainted or anything. My veins aren’t the best, though. The young man at Miller’s Pharmacy always has trouble finding them. You might too. Just… be careful, alright? And don't dig around too much. I bruise easily. Honestly, this whole thing is a bother. A complete bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be as gentle as possible. It may take a few tries, but we’ll get it done. If you could extend your arm, please. I'll clean the area first. It’s going to sting for a moment.
PATIENT: Ooh, cold! That’s always unpleasant. Honestly, I don’t know why doctors insist on using that freezing stuff. It makes my skin tingle for ages. Just… hurry up, alright? I have a roast in the oven, you know. And I really don’t like needles. Not one bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, we’re done. Just hold pressure here for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. I'll hand you a bandage. The lab results will be back in a few days. We'll discuss them then. In the meantime, I recommend stopping the Naproxen until we have the results. Here’s a note for your pharmacy suggesting you hold off on the Naproxen. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Stop taking the pills? But my joints! They’ll ache something terrible. Well, that’s just lovely. Now I’ll be hobbling around like an old woman. Honestly, this whole visit has been a disaster. No, I don't have any questions. Just… get me out of here. And I still think it's the pickle relish. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab will call with the results. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – particularly dizziness, weakness, or blood in your stool – please go to the emergency room immediately. Have a good day, Ms. Hatchard. And perhaps reconsider the pickle relish. .
