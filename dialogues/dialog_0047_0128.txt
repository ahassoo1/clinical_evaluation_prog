DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… it’s my joints, mostly. They get…stiff, you know? Especially in the mornings. It’s a bit of a bother. Not terrible, just…old, I guess. I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest. A little while ago, I think?
DOCTOR: Right. “Stiff joints, mornings.” And how long have you been noticing this stiffness, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… oh dear. That's a hard one. Maybe… a year? Or two? It comes and goes, so it's hard to say for sure. Not every day, just… when it's cold, maybe? Or after I’ve been sitting for a bit. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I'm not very good with dates.
DOCTOR: A year or two… intermittent. Alright. And where exactly are you experiencing this stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… mostly my hands, I think. And my knees… a little bit in my back too, but not always. It’s hard to pinpoint. They just… ache and don’t bend so easy when I first get up. Not a sharp pain, just… slow. Like they need oiling, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: “Needing oiling.” Right. And would you describe this as worse on certain days?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. Cold days are bad. And… if I’ve been doing a lot, you know, with the little ones… lifting, playing… that sort of thing. It gets worse then. But usually it’s just a little bit of a struggle in the morning. Nothing that stops me from doing things, just… a reminder I’m not as young as I used to be. Do you want me to… show you? I can try to bend my fingers, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Demonstrations are… unnecessary at this stage, Ms. Voner. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of the overall situation. Do you have any swelling in those joints, particularly in your hands or knees?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don't think so. Sometimes they feel a little… fuller, maybe? But I just figured that was part of getting older, you know? I haven't really noticed them actually looking swollen. They just feel… thick. Is that a thing? I really don’t know much about these sorts of things. I'm not very good at noticing these things, probably.
DOCTOR: "Feels thick." Alright. Have you noticed any redness or warmth in any of these joints?
PATIENT: Redness… no, not that I’ve seen. Warmth… sometimes they feel a little bit warmer than the rest of my hand, maybe? But again, I don’t know if that’s just… normal. I have poor circulation sometimes, so it’s hard to tell. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure if this is even worth bothering you with. It's probably just old age creeping in.
DOCTOR: We’ll determine that. Now, have you had any fever, fatigue, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I recall. I get a little tired, of course. I work with children all day! That’s tiring, even if I enjoy it. But not… a sick kind of tired. And weight loss? No, if anything I’ve probably gained a little. I do love my cooking, you see. I’m a good cook, if I do say so myself. Do you need to know how much weight? I haven't weighed myself in ages. I'm sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pain relievers or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. No, not really. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, sometimes. My daughter tells me I should. But that's it. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off of it. That was a long time ago. I really don’t like to take anything unless I absolutely have to. Makes me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes, when the pollen is bad in the spring, but nothing serious. I eat everything! I love food too much to worry about allergies, honestly. I used to help my mother bake when I was little, all sorts of things… I'm just not the allergy type, I don't think. I hope I'm not!
DOCTOR: And finally, what is your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a long story. I had my tonsils out when I was little, and I broke my arm once when I was a teenager. Nothing too serious. And… I had a baby, a lovely daughter. She's all grown up now. My husband… he passed away a few years ago. That was… hard. Other than that, I haven't really been very sick. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess. Is that what you mean? I’m sorry, I don’t really keep track of all these things. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. It was a long time ago, a lot of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss potential causes. Could you please sit up and let me examine your hands and knees?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. My hands are a little rough, from all the washing. I work with little ones, you see. They’re very… messy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your hands. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, a little bit there. Not awful, but… yes, that’s a little bit sore. Especially when you press right there, on that knuckle. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like it's been rubbed raw, maybe? It doesn’t hurt all the time, just when you push on it. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. And this side?
PATIENT: Yes, that one’s a little bit sore too. Not as bad as the other one, but… yes, definitely some tenderness there as well. It’s the same sort of ache, a dull feeling. It's mostly in the knuckles, I think. Not the whole hand, just the little bumps. Is that… bad? I hope it's not something serious. I need my hands for work, you see.
DOCTOR: Now, let’s check your knees. Can you bend your knee up as far as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a little bit stiff. It doesn’t go as high as it used to, and it feels a little…creaky. Like it needs oiling, if you know what I mean? It's not really painful, just… tight. I can do it, but it’s not very smooth. And straightening it is a little difficult too, just a bit of resistance. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: And any tenderness with this movement?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! There. Right there, on the inside. It's not a sharp pain, it's more of a dull ache. It’s been a bit sore lately, especially after I've been playing with the little ones. I get down on the floor with them a lot, you see. It’s hard to explain… it's just uncomfortable. I hope it's not arthritis. My mother had that, and it was very painful. Is that what you think it is?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it appears you are exhibiting signs consistent with osteoarthritis. However, to confirm this, and rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order some blood work and X-rays of your hands and knees.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood work and X-rays? That sounds… serious. Is it really that bad? I just thought it was getting old, you see. I didn't think it needed all this… investigating. What exactly are we looking for? And will it hurt? I'm not very good with needles, you know. And I worry about radiation… Is it definitely arthritis? Can we treat it? I need my hands and knees for work, you see. I worry about not being able to look after the little ones…
DOCTOR: Ms. Voner, while your symptoms could be attributed to simply “getting old,” it’s important to get a proper diagnosis to ensure appropriate management. The blood work will help rule out other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, and the X-rays will show us the extent of any joint damage. The blood draw is a standard procedure, and the discomfort is minimal. As for radiation, the amount from the X-rays is very low, and the benefits of obtaining a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. While I can’t definitively diagnose you at this stage, osteoarthritis is a common cause of these symptoms. There are various treatment options available, including pain management, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications, depending on the severity of your condition. We will discuss these options in detail once we have the results of the tests. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. Tests… okay. I suppose I understand. It’s just… a lot. And I don't like hospitals, or doctors, or… anything medical, really. But if it's important… yes. Yes, I’ll do the tests. When do I need to go? And will it take long? And… what if it is arthritis? Will I still be able to… play with the children? I worry about letting them down… they need me, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m scheduling you for blood work at the clinic lab tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. The X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street, any time after 10:00 AM. I’ll have my assistant give you the necessary paperwork and instructions. As for your concerns… many people with osteoarthritis continue to live full and active lives. We will work together to manage your symptoms and maintain your quality of life. Physical therapy can help strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion, and we can discuss pain management options as needed. For now, try to avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms, and I’ll see you again once the results are in. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Tomorrow at nine. And the X-ray across the street. I don't think so… not right now. It’s just… a lot to take in. I suppose I’ll just… try to rest, and not bother my knees too much. Thank you, Doctor. I… I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Very well. My assistant will escort you to the exit. Have a good day, Ms. Voner.
