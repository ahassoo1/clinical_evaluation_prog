DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling quite unsteady on my feet. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest. I wouldn’t say it’s constant, but it happens enough to worry me. I seem to… lose my balance sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteady on your feet, losing your balance. That is unsettling. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That’s… a good question. It feels like it’s been gradually getting worse, but pinpointing a date… I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps… within the last few months? It’s all a bit hazy, truthfully. It’s… frustrating. I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, don’t worry about being specific. “Within the last few months” is a good start. Has anything specific happened around the time you noticed it starting?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific happenings… Let me think. My husband, Thomas… he passed away about six months ago. It was… sudden. A heart condition, the doctors said. Perhaps it’s related to that? I’ve been… distracted, naturally. And quite tired. I work out in the oil fields, you see, operating a drill… it’s a physical job. But I’ve been doing it for years, so I wouldn’t have thought that’s it. Unless… the grief is affecting me more than I realized?
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing Thomas must have been incredibly difficult. Grief can manifest in many ways, physically and emotionally. Okay, so six months ago, loss of your husband, and you work a physically demanding job. And you said you've been feeling tired. Is the tiredness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Some days I feel… almost normal, and I can get through my shift at the rig without too much trouble. Other days… well, even getting out of bed feels like a monumental effort. And the unsteadiness seems worse on those tired days, if that makes sense. It’s… a strange feeling. Like my feet aren't quite connected to the ground, you know? It’s not a dizzy feeling, exactly. More like… a wobble.
DOCTOR: Okay, a wobble, not dizziness, and worse on tired days. Has this wobble caused you to fall at all?
PATIENT: Thankfully, no. Not a full fall, no. But I’ve had a few near misses. I’ve stumbled a couple of times, had to grab onto things to steady myself. It’s… concerning, because where I work, a fall could be very dangerous. That’s why I decided to come see you, really. I don’t want to risk an injury. It frightens me to think about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Lilyanna. It's good you came in to get this checked out. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… Let me see. I was always quite healthy, thankfully. No major illnesses. I had a bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but that was it, really. No diabetes, no heart problems… nothing that I know of. My husband, Thomas, he had high blood pressure, but I don’t. I try to eat reasonably well, though it’s difficult when you’re working long hours in the field. And I don't smoke. I did have… some issues with my back a while back, but that was treated with physical therapy and hasn’t bothered me for years. Is that relevant, do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No major health conditions, high blood pressure in your husband, but not you, and past back issues treated with physical therapy. That's helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Never any surgeries. Just the physical therapy for my back, as I mentioned. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Up until recently, anyway. It’s just… this unsteadiness is so unsettling. It’s not like me to feel… vulnerable like this. I’ve always been a strong, independent woman. It’s… worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: I don’t take any regular medications, Doctor. Not usually. Though… after my husband passed, the doctor prescribed me something for sleep. Just for a short time, to help me get through the first few weeks. I stopped taking it a couple of months ago, though. It didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t want to rely on it. I occasionally take something for headaches, if I have a really bad one, but that’s over-the-counter, you know, ibuprofen or something like that. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, sleep medication for a short time after your husband’s passing, and over-the-counter ibuprofen for headaches. What about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think I have any major allergies, Doctor. I've never had a reaction to anything that I'm aware of. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the summer, but I think that's just the heat. Nothing serious. No food allergies, no medication allergies… nothing that requires an EpiPen or anything like that. I’m fairly certain, anyway. I’ve never been tested, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a bit difficult, I’m afraid. My parents… they both passed away when I was quite young. I didn’t know them very well. And I don’t have any siblings. My husband’s family… they were generally healthy, as far as I know. His mother had arthritis in her later years, and his father had high blood pressure, but nothing… major. No history of neurological problems or anything like that, as far as I’m aware. I’m not very close to his relatives, so I don’t know a great deal about their medical histories, truthfully. Is that helpful, Doctor? I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilyanna. You’ve given me a lot of good information. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. I just… I want to find out what’s causing this, and hopefully get it sorted out. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to have you stand and I’ll check your balance. Can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. It’s… a little unsteady, but I can manage. Though I do need to concentrate to stay upright.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little bit of wobble, as you said. Now, can you walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. Oh dear… that was… not very graceful. I seem to be drifting a bit to the left. And I had to… steady myself. It's harder than it looks. I'm afraid my balance isn't very good at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed that. Now I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. I’m also going to check your strength in your arms and legs. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I'm squeezing as hard as I can. I do work with heavy machinery, you know. My grip is usually quite strong. I hope that's enough.
DOCTOR: Good strength. And can you lift your legs against my resistance?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. I’m trying to push against your hand… I can feel it, but it’s a little tiring. My legs feel… a bit weak, perhaps? It's not usually this difficult. I hope I’m doing it correctly. It's hard to concentrate when I'm worried about falling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Lilyanna. That's all for the physical exam for now. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some imbalance. It could be a few things. The fact that it started around the time of your husband’s passing and is worse when you’re tired makes me suspect it might be related to grief and stress, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Given your job, there's also a small possibility of something musculoskeletal, but your strength seems relatively normal. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other potential causes. I also think an MRI of your brain would be a good idea, just to rule out anything neurological. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, then yes, please. I want to know what’s causing this. Blood tests and an MRI… I understand. It sounds a bit daunting, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to find out what’s going on. I’m just… relieved that you’re taking this seriously. I was worried I’d be dismissed as just being… overly stressed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Lilyanna, and you are absolutely right to be proactive about this. I want to assure you, I'm taking this very seriously. And it’s good you brought it up. Okay, I’ll get the orders for the blood tests and MRI sent to the lab. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work. The MRI facility will also call to schedule that appointment. It’s usually a quick scan, but it's important to remain still during the procedure. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend you try to prioritize rest and stress management techniques. Things like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or even gentle yoga can be helpful. If you’re feeling overwhelmed with grief, I can also provide you with resources for bereavement counseling. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Rest and stress management… that sounds… difficult, to be honest. But I will try. And thank you for offering the bereavement counseling. I may take you up on that. It’s just… a lot to process. I appreciate your kindness, Doctor Voytek. Truly. I’ll wait for the lab and MRI facility to contact me. And I’ll try to take better care of myself. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. It's my job, and I'm here to support you. Remember, it’s okay to ask for help. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for about two weeks from now to discuss the results of the tests. We’ll go over everything together then. Here’s a handout with information about stress management techniques and local bereavement counseling resources. If anything changes or you experience any new symptoms before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Take care of yourself, Lilyanna. And don't hesitate to reach out. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Goodbye.
