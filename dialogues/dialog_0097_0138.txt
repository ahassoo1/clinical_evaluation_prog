DOCTOR: Good morning, Alayne! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s…nice to meet you as well. Now, let me see… what brings me in… It’s my…well, it’s a bit hard to explain. It’s about…feeling weak sometimes. And…my family. There's been a bit of trouble with headaches, you see. My son…and his father…they both get them something awful. It's just…I’ve been a little worried, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling weak and some worry about headaches running in the family. That’s perfectly reasonable to come in about. Let’s take things one step at a time. First, let's talk about your weakness. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, one step at a time is good. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Well…it’s not all the time. It comes and goes. Usually it’s on one side…my left side, I think. My arm, mostly. Feels…heavy, and a little clumsy. Sometimes my leg too. It doesn’t last long, usually. Just…a little while, then it goes away. It's hard to say when it happens, though. It doesn't seem to have a pattern.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness on your left side, mostly in your arm, sometimes your leg, that comes and goes without a clear pattern. And it doesn’t last very long. That's helpful to know. Now, when you say “weakness”, can you describe what it feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear…describing it… It’s not like…paralyzed, or anything. It's just…harder to do things. Like…if I’m reaching for something, my arm feels…like it’s dragging, a little. Or if I’m walking, I stumble a bit, like my leg won’t quite lift properly. It's not painful, not usually. Just…difficult. It’s hard to explain… like trying to move through water, maybe? Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense – like moving through water. Thank you for explaining that so clearly. So, it's more of a difficulty with movement, a feeling of heaviness, rather than actual pain or inability to move. Now, has this weakness been getting worse, staying the same, or getting better recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. You know…I honestly can’t say. It comes and goes so much. Some days I don’t notice it at all, and other days…well, other days it’s a little harder to do things. I don't think it’s worse than it used to be, but…it’s always been a little bit of a worry. It's just…there. I suppose that's the best way to put it. It hasn’t gotten suddenly much worse, if that makes any sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Alayne. It sounds like it's been fairly stable, just a consistent worry. Okay, we'll definitely look into that. Now, let's switch gears a little bit. You mentioned headaches running in the family. Are you experiencing headaches currently, or is this just a concern about your son and his father?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not me really. I get little aches now and then, like anyone does, but nothing terrible. It’s my son, and his father… they get them something awful. Horrible, throbbing headaches. My son has to lie down in a dark room for hours sometimes. His father…well, his father used to miss work because of them. They're just…so bad. I just worry about them, you see. And I thought…well, maybe it runs in the family, and I should get checked just to be safe.
DOCTOR: That's very thoughtful of you to be concerned about your family and proactive about your health. Okay, so you're not currently experiencing significant headaches yourself, but you're concerned about the family history. Now, just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little bit about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I have a little bit of trouble with my blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take a little pill for that every day, I think. And…oh, my knees aren’t what they used to be. They ache a bit, especially in cold weather. Nothing major, really. And… I had a bit of a problem with my gallbladder years ago, but they took it out, and I haven’t had any trouble with it since. Does that help? I always forget what the doctor tells me!
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Alayne. High blood pressure managed with medication, some knee pain, and a gallbladder removal in the past. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear…now that’s a good question. I… honestly, I can’t remember. It’s a little white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. I just…refill the prescription when it runs out. I leave that to my son, mostly. He handles all the paperwork and things. I’m afraid my memory isn't what it used to be. I feel terrible not knowing!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Alayne. Many people find it difficult to remember medication names. We can easily look that up in your records. Okay, I see here you're taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril, yes! That’s right. See, I knew I had a name for it somewhere in my head. And allergies…hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. No food allergies, no trouble with medicine… I’m quite lucky, really. My son is the one with allergies. He can’t eat shellfish, poor thing. But me? No, nothing. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little about your family history, besides the headaches and your son’s allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother lived to be a good age, I think…early nineties, maybe? She had a bit of trouble with her heart towards the end, but she was generally healthy. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, I think. I don't remember much about him, really. And…my brother had a bit of trouble with his diabetes, but other than that… I don’t think there was much trouble in my family. We were a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother lived to her early nineties with some heart trouble, your father passed away when you were young, and your brother had diabetes. That's helpful to know. Now, just a couple of final questions. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, not me! I never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were terrible for you, and I listened to her. And alcohol…well, my husband used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I never cared for it. Too strong, I always thought. No, I don't smoke, and I hardly ever drink. Just a little sip of champagne on special occasions, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don’t smoke and only drink very occasionally. Thank you for being so open with me, Alayne. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological exam to assess your strength and reflexes. It shouldn't take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. A physical exam sounds perfectly fine. I just hope I don’t embarrass myself stumbling around too much!
DOCTOR: Don’t worry at all about that, Alayne. We're just gathering information. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/85. A little bit elevated, but not dramatically so, and consistent with your medication. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Okay, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: There! As hard as I can. Though my grip isn't what it used to be, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Alayne. Slightly weaker on your left side, as you mentioned, but nothing too concerning at this point. Now, can you lift your arms up like you're trying to reach something on a high shelf?
PATIENT: There! Like this, dear? It feels a little…stiff, on this side. Not painful, just…not as easy as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, I can see a slight weakness and a bit of hesitation on your left side. Now, if you don't mind, could you walk a few steps forward for me?
PATIENT: There we go… one, two, three… Oh dear, that was a bit clumsy! I always trip over my own feet.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Alayne. It’s good you’re steadying yourself. I see a slight weakness on your left side and a little bit of a shuffling gait, but nothing drastic. Okay, that’s all the physical exam for now. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some mild weakness on your left side, which could be due to a number of things. It could be related to age, a prior minor stroke or TIA, or something else entirely. Given your history and the subtle findings, I think it would be best to get some further testing to rule out any serious underlying cause. I'd like to order an MRI of your brain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI…oh dear. Is that…safe? I’ve heard things about those machines… Is it uncomfortable? And… what exactly will it show? I'm not a fan of being poked and prodded, you see.
DOCTOR: Those are all very reasonable questions, Alayne. Let me address each one. Firstly, MRIs are generally very safe. They use strong magnets and radio waves, but there are no ionizing radiations involved like with X-rays or CT scans. We’ll have you fill out a questionnaire to make sure you don’t have any metal implants that would be a contraindication. As for comfort, it’s not painful, but it can be a little claustrophobic. You lie inside a long tube, and it’s quite noisy. We can provide you with earplugs and a mild sedative if you’re feeling anxious. You'll be able to communicate with the technician at all times. And what it shows…it gives us a very detailed picture of your brain, allowing us to see if there’s been any past stroke, any areas of damage, or any other abnormalities that could be causing your weakness. It's really the best way to get a clear understanding of what's going on. It's a precaution, really, to rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to consider it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it all sounds a bit scary, doesn’t it? But… you’re right, it’s best to be safe, I suppose. If it’s the best way to find out what’s going on… then yes. Yes, I’ll do it. But…please, be gentle with me. And I’d definitely like those earplugs, and maybe that sedative too, if it’s not too much trouble. I don't want to be stuck in a noisy tube all alone!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Alayne. We'll take excellent care of you. No need to be scared, and we'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. We’ll schedule the MRI for next week and the technician is very experienced in making patients feel at ease. Okay, I’m sending the order to the radiology department now. They will call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I'd like you to continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. And I also want you to pay attention to any new or worsening symptoms, such as slurred speech, vision changes, or severe headaches. Do you have any questions about the MRI or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly, dear. The earplugs and the sedative sound wonderful. I’ll just…try not to think about it too much until the appointment. And yes, I’ll pay attention to any new symptoms. Slurred speech… that would be a worry, wouldn’t it? Thank you, Dr. Georgiou. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alayne. That’s my job, and I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We’ll get this sorted out, and hopefully, it’s nothing serious. I’ll see you in a few weeks, and we’ll discuss the results of the MRI then. In the meantime, take care of yourself and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you again, dear. You’ve been very kind. I will try not to worry. Bye bye to you too, Dr. Georgiou.
