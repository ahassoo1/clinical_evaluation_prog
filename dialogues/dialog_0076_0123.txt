DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cassimatis, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it's my skin. It's been so itchy lately. It's driving me a little crazy, to be honest. Not a sharp itch, just… constant. It's all over, really. Arms, legs, back… even my tummy a bit.
DOCTOR: Itchy skin, right. Constant. All over. Hmm. And how long has this “constant” itching been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I'd say, maybe a month ago? At first, it was just now and then, I didn’t think much of it. But the last week or so, it's just been… there. All the time. It's worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: A month. Worse at night. Okay. Have you tried anything to alleviate it?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, the usual things. Lotion. Different kinds of lotion. Nothing seems to really help for very long. I tried one with oatmeal in it, that helped a little for a bit, but then it just stopped working. I don't really know what to do, that's why I came to see you. Is it something serious? I haven't changed anything in my routine, not that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Oatmeal…right. Well, itching can be caused by a number of things. Let's see… do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not really. I mean, I’m allergic to being cold, laughs softly, if that counts! But seriously, nothing major that the doctors ever told me about. No bee stings, no food allergies, nothing like that. I used to have hay fever when I was a little girl, but that went away years ago. I don't take any medications regularly, either.
DOCTOR: No allergies, no medications. Alright. And any changes in soap or laundry detergent recently?
PATIENT: Oh, good question! Yes, actually. My daughter, she came to visit last month and she brought me some of that… what is it called? Eco-friendly stuff. She said it was better for the environment. It smells nice, a little lavender-y, but I guess that must be it! I switched it around the time the itching started. I didn't even think to connect the two, honestly.
DOCTOR: Lavender detergent, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Lavender. It was a big jug, she got it at the supermarket. She’s always trying to get me to use healthier things, which is nice, but sometimes… well, sometimes things just don't work, you know? Do you think that's what’s causing it? It just seemed like a nice smell.
DOCTOR: It’s possible. Those “natural” detergents can sometimes contain irritants. Alright, let's have a look at your skin. If you don't mind.
PATIENT: Oh, sure, no problem. Just a little old lady skin, nothing fancy! It’s probably just my imagination anyway. But thank you for looking. It’s good to get a professional opinion.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Some mild excoriation on the forearms, a few scattered patches of dryness. Nothing dramatic. Looks like a mild irritant contact dermatitis, likely from the detergent. Stop using the lavender detergent immediately. Switch back to whatever you were using before. And a bland, fragrance-free moisturizer. That’s usually enough. Any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… simple enough. So, just stop the lavender stuff and go back to my old lotion? And use a plain moisturizer? Okay. Is there anything I need to put on it? Like a cream or something? Because it’s really itchy now when I think about it. I'm just worried it’s something worse.
DOCTOR: If it doesn't improve in a week, then you can try a mild hydrocortisone cream, over-the-counter. But start with just stopping the detergent and the moisturizer. Don’t overthink it. It’s likely nothing serious. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A week. Okay, I can do that. No, I don't think so. Just the itching, really. And worrying about what it could be, I guess. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you looking at me, even if it’s probably just the soap. I’ll go get some plain moisturizer today. Is there a brand you recommend?
DOCTOR: Cetaphil or Eucerin are fine. Anything fragrance-free. Next patient. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mrs. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Ruocco. I really appreciate your time. I’ll go get that moisturizer and try to forget about the lavender. Have a good day! .
