DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thanks. It's…family, mostly. My mother, she had some…issues. Heart problems, mostly. And her sister, my aunt, same thing. It's just…it's always something with them. And I'm starting to feel…a little anxious about it, I guess. Just want to make sure I'm okay. You know, preventative stuff.
DOCTOR: Family history, right. Always good to be proactive, I suppose. Though, honestly, worrying won't change much. Still, let's get some details. Your mother and aunt…what specifically were their heart problems?
PATIENT: Specifics… Honestly, I wasn't always involved in all the details. My mother…she had a lot of shortness of breath, a lot of swelling in her legs. And she ended up needing…a procedure, I think. Some sort of…blockage? My aunt…it was similar, but she waited too long to get it checked out. It wasn't pretty. I don't really know the names of anything, to be honest. It was just…heart stuff. They didn’t really explain it to me in a way I understood, and frankly, I didn't push it. I just know it was bad. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Vague, but alright. Shortness of breath and swelling…that could be a lot of things. A “blockage”... likely refers to coronary artery disease, but we need more than “likely.” Any chest pain with either of them?
PATIENT: Chest pain… with my mother, yes, sometimes. She'd complain about a tightness, mostly when she was…doing things. Walking upstairs, that sort of thing. My aunt…I don’t recall her mentioning chest pain specifically. Honestly, I was younger then, and…we didn’t talk about this stuff much. It was just…a thing everyone knew. Are you writing all this down? Because I'm not really a medical encyclopedia, you know. I'm just trying to remember what I overheard over the years.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I'm documenting. Chest pain with exertion in your mother… that’s angina, probably. Look, this is helpful, but still…thin. Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, swelling, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Not really. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but who doesn't? I work long hours. I teach. It’s…demanding. I wouldn’t say I’m short of breath, and my legs aren’t swollen. I’m pretty active, actually. I go to the gym a few times a week. I’m just…worried. That's all. I feel fine, perfectly fine. I just… don't want to end up like them. It feels silly, I guess, coming in here when I feel okay. You probably have better things to do with your time.
DOCTOR: Look, you're here, so we'll do a quick check. It's called being thorough. Alright, let's just listen to your heart and lungs, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…try not to poke around too much. I hate doctors. It's not the pain, it's… the whole thing. The feeling of being… examined. It’s undignified. But, yeah, go ahead. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Another one. Good. Heart sounds… regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 120/80. Pulse is 72. Normal findings so far. You’re a relatively thin young man, not particularly overweight. You say you exercise… how often, exactly, and what kind of exercise?
PATIENT: Relatively thin? I'm athletic. And I go to the gym… three, maybe four times a week. I do mostly cardio – treadmill, elliptical. Sometimes weights, but not a lot. I don't have time to spend all day lifting things. I teach, remember? It’s physically demanding enough as it is. I’m also on my feet a lot. It's not like I’m sitting behind a desk all day. And honestly, I eat pretty well. I make my own lunches, mostly salads and… lean protein. I'm not some junk food enthusiast. Is this a test? Are you trying to imply I'm unhealthy?
DOCTOR: No, I’m not implying anything. Just gathering information. Alright, let's skip the exhaustive lifestyle interrogation. You said you're on Medicare… any other medical conditions we need to be aware of?
PATIENT: Medicare? Yes. It’s…complicated. My divorce… it left me in a bit of a situation. It's a long story, frankly. And no, no other conditions. I haven’t been sick in years. A few colds, maybe, but nothing serious. I don’t take any medication. I pride myself on being healthy. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. I just... I'm anxious about my family history. And I thought it was better to be safe than sorry. Is that so wrong?
DOCTOR: No, it's not wrong. It’s just…you’re a young, healthy-appearing man with vague family history and no concerning symptoms. We’ve established that. Look, I can order an EKG, just to be thorough, but I don’t think it’s going to reveal anything. Frankly, I think your anxiety is the bigger issue here. Are you seeing anyone for that?
PATIENT: Anxiety? Well, I… I haven't been diagnosed with anything. But, yes, okay, maybe I worry too much. It's just… my mother, and my aunt… it's always in the back of my mind. An EKG… I suppose. If it will give me peace of mind. But honestly, I suspect it will just tell me what I already know – that I’m wasting your time. But fine, do it. Get it over with. Just… try not to make a big deal out of it. I hate hospitals.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nurse will be in to get you set up. And look, if you find yourself continuing to worry, maybe consider talking to someone. It’s not a sign of weakness. It’s…practical. Now, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… tell the nurse not to poke around too much. And… thank you. I suppose. .
