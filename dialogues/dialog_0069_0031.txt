DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. And I’ve been told I have a funny heartbeat, something called… atrial… fib… something. It’s the leg I’m most worried about right now though, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Swelling in your left leg and a possible irregular heartbeat – atrial fibrillation, you mentioned. That's good you’re paying attention to what you've been told. Let's focus on the leg first, since that's what's most concerning to you. Could you tell me a bit more about the swelling?
PATIENT: Right, yes. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? It wasn’t much at first, just a bit bigger than my other leg. But it’s gotten worse each day, I think. It feels… heavy. And a little bit sore, if I touch it. Not terribly painful, just… uncomfortable. It's mostly in my calf, I’d say. Though my ankle’s a bit puffy too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about a week ago, gradually worsening, primarily in your calf but also affecting your ankle. Heavy and uncomfortable, with some soreness to the touch. Good. Has anything specific made it worse – like standing for long periods, or exercise?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not that I’ve noticed. I do stand a fair bit at work, teaching, you see. But it hasn’t gotten worse after a long day, just… consistently gotten bigger, regardless. I haven't been doing much exercise though, if that’s what you mean. Just walking to and from the bus stop, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistent swelling regardless of activity, even with mostly just walking. That’s helpful. And you're a teacher, so you do some standing during the day. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your leg – redness, warmth, or any sores?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. The skin looks… normal, I think. Same colour as my other leg. And it doesn’t feel particularly warm to the touch, or cold, for that matter. No, no sores or anything either. Just… swollen. It's a bit worrying, to be honest. I've never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nixon. It's always worrying when something new happens. Alright, let’s take a look at your leg. Could you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just there? Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfect. Okay, I do see some swelling in your left calf and around your ankle, as you described. It's definitely more prominent than your right leg. Let me feel your leg now. Alright. There’s some tenderness to touch here, and I am feeling some… pitting edema. That means when I press on your skin, it leaves a little indent for a few seconds. It’s not a huge amount, but it’s present. Do you have any pain when I bend your foot upwards like this?
PATIENT: Oh, right, yes, I can feel that indent. I hadn’t noticed that before. Ooh, yes, a little bit of pain there. Not terrible, but definitely noticeable. Like a stretch, almost. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, some pain with dorsiflexion – bending your foot upwards – and that feeling of a stretch. It’s good you told me. It could indicate a few things, and we need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to check your pulses in your feet. Okay, your pulses feel… a little diminished on the left side compared to the right. That’s another thing we need to take into account. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Alright. My heart… well, I know it’s a bit irregular, as I said. I can sometimes feel it fluttering, but I don't know what that means. It’s not a constant thing, just… comes and goes. Hopefully, that's what you're hearing?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am hearing an irregular rhythm, as you suspected. It’s not a consistent flutter, but it's definitely present. Based on what you've told me and my initial examination, it sounds like we’re dealing with a possible deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot in a deep vein in your leg – alongside the atrial fibrillation you already know about. The swelling, tenderness, diminished pulse, and pitting edema are all consistent with that. However, we need to confirm this with some further testing. I'd like to order a D-dimer blood test and a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. The D-dimer will help us see if there’s evidence of a blood clot, and the ultrasound will visualize the veins in your leg to confirm whether or not a clot is present. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A blood clot… oh dear. Yes, I think so. You mean… something is blocking the blood flow? And the test will show if that's happening? The D-dimer and the ultrasound… yes, that sounds… sensible. Will those tests be painful? And… what happens if it is a clot? I'm a bit frightened now, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be frightened, Nixon. It’s good you’re asking questions. Yes, a blood clot would partially block blood flow in the vein. The D-dimer is just a blood test – a simple needle prick in your arm. The ultrasound is non-invasive – a technician will use a gel and a wand to look at the veins on your leg; it doesn't hurt at all. If it is a clot, the good news is that there are treatments available. Typically, we treat DVT with blood thinners, also called anticoagulants, to prevent the clot from growing and to prevent new clots from forming. Depending on the severity and your overall health, you might need to be on blood thinners for a few months to a year, or even longer. I want to emphasize that we haven’t confirmed anything yet. We need the test results first. I'm going to get the orders for those tests sent to the lab right away. In the meantime, try to elevate your left leg as much as possible and avoid prolonged standing or sitting. Do you have any allergies to medications that you know of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. Elevate my leg… yes, I can do that. I suppose I should avoid walking too much too, then? It’s just… it’s all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Blood clots and blood thinners… it sounds very serious. Will I be able to teach? I don't want to lose my job. I depend on that.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, and you’re right to be concerned. We’ll take it one step at a time. Avoid excessive walking or prolonged standing until we have the test results. Light activity is fine – walking around the house – but nothing strenuous. As for teaching, that’s a good question. It will depend on the test results and the treatment plan, if any is needed. If it is a DVT, and you are started on blood thinners, in most cases, you will be able to continue teaching, although we may need to make some accommodations to minimize prolonged standing. We can also discuss a note for your employer explaining your condition and any limitations, if necessary. I’m happy to write that for you. Let's focus on getting these tests done first. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have a nurse come in and draw your blood, and then you can schedule the ultrasound for later today or tomorrow. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it for now. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. A nurse for the blood test… yes. Just… try not to think about it too much, I suppose. I'll go and wait for the nurse then. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. You’re very welcome. Remember, try to elevate your leg as much as possible. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, or if you develop any new symptoms. I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the test results. .
