DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, well, my wife thought it was a good idea I get checked for… you know… the HIV thing. Just to be sure, really. I mean, I don't think it's necessary, but she worries. She's a bit of a hypochondriac, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. While it's commendable your wife is proactive about health concerns, testing is always a sensible precaution, regardless of personal feelings about risk. It's good you're here. So, just to clarify, is there any specific reason your wife is concerned?
PATIENT: Concerned? Well, she just… likes knowing things. Always has. Honestly, it’s probably just because we… we travelled a bit last year. Southeast Asia, mostly. I didn’t… well, I didn’t do anything risky, if that's what you're getting at. It’s just… she reads things. On the internet, you know? And then she gets ideas. Women.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're clarifying that you didn't engage in any behaviors that would place you at higher risk. However, even without those behaviors, travel to certain regions can increase exposure, simply due to varying healthcare standards and potential for unforeseen circumstances. Let’s not dismiss it entirely. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a brief medical history. Have you ever been tested for HIV previously?
PATIENT: No, never. Look, I’ve been perfectly healthy my whole life. I eat reasonably well, I don’t smoke, and I certainly don’t… you know. It feels like a waste of time, honestly. But, fine. Ask your questions. I've got things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Belan, but a simple test is the most accurate way to alleviate your wife's concerns – and, frankly, to ensure your peace of mind. Dismissing it outright isn't the most responsible approach. Alright. Let’s move on then. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Seriously? You're asking me that? Look, I've been married for fifteen years. Fifteen years. To the same woman. Are you implying something? It's a little… rude, don't you think? I'm here because she worries, not because I've been… gallivanting around. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, please don’t misunderstand. I assure you, I'm not implying anything at all. These are standard questions as part of a comprehensive risk assessment for HIV testing. It’s about gathering a complete picture of your health history, not making judgments. It’s crucial for accurate interpretation of results and appropriate follow-up. Regardless of your marital status, it’s a necessary inquiry. If you prefer, we can rephrase it. Have you and your wife ever been tested for STIs together?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. No. We haven't. Look, we discussed it, briefly, years ago. But… it just never seemed necessary. We've been… careful. Obviously. And I'm telling you, I don’t have anything. This whole thing is ridiculous. Is this test going to take long? I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, with all due respect, “being careful” is not a substitute for medical testing. Transmission can occur even with precautions. And while I understand your frustration, rushing through this process doesn’t benefit anyone. Let’s move on to some broader health questions, then. Have you had any significant illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations in your life?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Let's get this over with. I had… appendicitis when I was twelve. Routine surgery, nothing major. Then, a broken arm a few years later. Skiing accident. Apart from that, nothing. Just the usual colds and flu. I'm a remarkably healthy person, Doctor. Really. I eat a lot of lentils. And I try to get enough sleep. Is that enough medical history for you?
DOCTOR: Lentils are excellent, Mr. Belan, but they don’t preclude the need for a thorough assessment. Now, have you ever received a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: A blood transfusion? Seriously? What are you getting at now? No! I've never needed a blood transfusion. I haven’t been close to needing one. This is… this is getting absurd. Are all doctors this… thorough? Or are you just trying to make a point? I told you, my wife worries. That’s it. This is for her peace of mind, not because there’s actually a reason for this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your frustration, but I assure you, every question is relevant. It's my professional responsibility to gather a complete medical history to ensure accurate testing and appropriate care. A blood transfusion, even decades ago, could potentially indicate a risk factor. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Oh, good grief. You're going to ask about my parents now? Are you trying to see if anyone in my family died of… the thing? This is ridiculous. My mother is perfectly healthy. She's 78 and still gardening. My father… he passed away a few years ago. Heart attack. Perfectly normal, age-related thing. Honestly, this is just… humiliating. I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I assure you, they are not meant to be. A family history of heart disease is relevant, but I am also attempting to establish a comprehensive risk profile. Knowing if there’s a history of certain cancers, autoimmune diseases, or other illnesses is crucial. To be clear, the HIV test itself is quite simple. It involves a small blood sample. But before we proceed, I need to ask about your social history. Do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: That’s it. I’m done. This is beyond absurd. You’re insinuating things, asking ridiculous questions… I came here because my wife told me to, and now I regret it. I do not use recreational drugs. Never have. And frankly, I’m not going to sit here and be interrogated about my personal life. Just… do the test, or don’t. I don't care anymore. I’ve wasted enough of my afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, please. I understand your frustration, but refusing to answer basic questions hinders my ability to provide you with adequate care. Furthermore, I am obligated to document a thorough history. Given your reluctance to cooperate and your dismissive attitude, I strongly advise you to seek testing elsewhere. I am not comfortable proceeding without a complete medical history. And frankly, your wife may be right to be concerned – not about HIV, but about your overall approach to healthcare. I wish you well.
