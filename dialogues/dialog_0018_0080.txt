DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fabing. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon to you too, Dr. Stilaire. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, I don’t really need anything done, not exactly. It's more that I got a letter saying I needed to fill out some forms, and I figured it’d be easier to do it here with someone to ask questions if I get stuck. Medicare sent it, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. Medicare often sends out routine health questionnaires to ensure we have up-to-date information and can provide the best possible care. That was thoughtful of you to come in and address it directly. Perhaps we can go through the form together, and I can answer any questions you have as we proceed. Before we start, would you mind confirming your date of birth for me, please?
PATIENT: Sure, that sounds good. It’s… July 12th, 1989. I always forget my age, honestly. It feels weird saying it out loud sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fabing. July 12th, 1989… that makes you 36 years of age. No need to apologize for forgetting; it happens to the best of us. Now, the form has several sections. We'll start with a brief review of your current health status. Are you experiencing any particular symptoms or health concerns at the moment – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I’ve been a little tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t? I work a lot with pipes and valves, you know, out in the field. It's physical work. Mostly just aches and pains like you’d expect. Nothing I can’t work through. No fevers or anything like that. Just… normal tired.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you are able to manage with the aches and pains, but it's always important to note any changes in your energy levels, even if you attribute them to work. Fatigue can sometimes be a sign of other underlying issues, so we want to be thorough. Now, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… let’s see. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that healed up fine. Other than that, not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I don’t really go to the doctor much unless I have to, you know? Regular check-ups haven’t ever really been a thing for me. Is there something specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you’ve been generally healthy, Ms. Fabing. And it's perfectly alright if regular check-ups haven’t been a priority in the past. We can certainly discuss the benefits of preventative care today, if you'd like. For now, let's move on to any past surgical history. Have you ever undergone any operations or procedures?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. Not even tonsils or anything like that. Always managed to avoid the knife, thankfully. My grandma always said it took a lot of luck and a strong immune system.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Avoiding surgery is always a good thing. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that has affected your parents, siblings, or grandparents?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My dad, he had some trouble with his heart later in life, but I don't know all the details. He didn't talk about it much. My mom was pretty healthy until the end, just old age mostly. And my grandma… she had arthritis really bad, but that's about all I can remember. It wasn’t really something we talked about a lot growing up, you know? Health issues. Is there anything specific I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Fabing. Many families don’t have detailed medical histories readily available. Knowing a little bit is still helpful. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never have. I work with a lot of flammable stuff, so smoking’s out of the question, and I don’t really have a head for alcohol, honestly. Just not my thing. And definitely not drugs. I keep pretty busy with work and family, don’t really have time for any of that.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Fabing. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I mean, I get mosquito bites like everyone else, but nothing serious. I've never had a reaction to any medicine the few times I’ve had to take something. I haven't really ever needed much, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't take anything regularly. Just ibuprofen sometimes for aches and pains, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fabing. That's helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. This will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, a long time, so it's probably a good idea. I'm a little worried it'll be awkward, honestly. I don't usually have people listening to my lungs.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Fabing. It can feel a bit strange if you're not used to it, but it’s a routine part of a physical exam and it helps us get a better understanding of your overall health. I'll explain everything as I go, and please feel free to let me know if you feel uncomfortable at any point. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Now, I’ll just take a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. Everything sounds good so far, Ms. Fabing. Do you have any questions about what I’ve heard or seen so far?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sounds… good, I guess. I mean, you said everything sounded normal, right? I always worry when doctors start poking around, thinking something’s gotta be wrong if they’re actually looking at something. So, is everything okay? Do I need any tests or anything? I'm kinda hoping not.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Fabing. It’s a very common feeling. And yes, everything does sound normal based on my examination. Your heart and lungs are healthy, and your ears, nose, and throat appear clear. Based on your medical history and this examination, I don’t believe any immediate tests are necessary. However, given it’s been some time since your last check-up, I would recommend a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. This will give us a baseline and help us monitor your health over time. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A blood panel… Hmm. I guess that wouldn’t be too bad. Better safe than sorry, right? As long as it doesn't involve a lot of poking and prodding. Is it covered by Medicare? I don't want to get a huge bill or anything.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Ms. Fabing. And yes, a basic blood panel is typically covered by Medicare Part B, provided it's deemed medically necessary, which I believe it is in your case as a preventative measure and to establish a baseline. There may be a small co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan, but we can verify that with the billing department before proceeding. We'll draw the blood right here in the clinic. It's a quick procedure, just a few vials. Would you like to proceed with the blood panel today?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, let’s go ahead and do it then. I figure it's best to get it over with now. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can stop worrying about it. And if everything's normal, that's one less thing to think about. Just… try to be quick, okay? I'm not the biggest fan of needles.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fabing. I understand your apprehension about needles. We’ll get it done as quickly and comfortably as possible. Our phlebotomist, Sarah, is very skilled and gentle. I’ll let her know you’d like everything to be done efficiently. I’ll just step out to get her now, and she'll come in to draw your blood. I'll also have her print out the lab requisition form for you to review before she starts. Do you have any other questions for me while I’m gone?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Dr. Stilaire. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly and not making me feel bad about not going to the doctor more often. Just… let me know when she's ready. I'm ready when she is, I guess.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Fabing. It's my pleasure to help. I'll be right back with Sarah.
