DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s get right to it. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. You know. Reflux, the lady on the phone said. It’s been happening more and more, and frankly, it’s unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Stuff coming up,” as you put it, and it’s been increasing. We'll try to figure out what's going on. When you say "more and more," can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? What kind of detail do you want? It happens after I eat, usually. Anything, really. Doesn't matter what I eat. And it's not just… sometimes it’s like, a burning sensation before it comes up, and sometimes it just… is. You know? It’s just… happening. I'm a busy man, Doctor. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It sounds quite bothersome. So, it happens after eating, regardless of what you eat, and sometimes there's a burning feeling beforehand, other times not. And it's been getting more frequent, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. More frequent. And stronger. It used to be just… a little bit. Now it's… substantial. I had to change my tie yesterday. It got… you don't need to know the details. Look, is this going to take long? I have a meeting this afternoon. Important people.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you letting me know about the meeting, Mr. Altine. We’ll move as efficiently as possible. It's good to know it’s increasing in intensity as well as frequency. To help me understand a little better, can you describe the “stuff” that’s coming up?
PATIENT: Really? You need to know what it looks like? It’s… food, mostly. Undigested food. Sometimes it's… sour. Very unpleasant. Honestly, it’s rude of you to ask such a personal question. I'm a director, Doctor, not some child describing… this. I expect you to know what reflux is without me having to go into graphic detail.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was too direct, Mr. Altine. You're right, I should have been more sensitive. It sounds like it's undigested food and sometimes has a sour taste. It’s helpful to know. To get a clearer picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I get heartburn, obviously, when it happens. Is that a symptom? I also… well, sometimes I cough a bit after a particularly bad episode. It's probably nothing. Honestly, I just want something to stop it. I don’t need a list of symptoms. I need a solution. And quickly. My wife keeps telling me to come to the doctor, and frankly, this is taking up valuable time.
DOCTOR: Okay, heartburn and coughing after episodes. That gives me a little more to work with. We will try to find a solution. To help me rule things out, have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? What are you implying? I am perfectly healthy, aside from this… unpleasantness. I haven’t weighed myself recently, I don’t have time for such things. Look, I'm a big man. I carry my weight well. I'm not losing weight. And I highly doubt it's related to… this. This is probably just something I ate. Or stress. I deal with a lot of stress.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. No recent weight loss, and you suspect it's related to diet or stress. It's good to consider those factors. Have you ever had any trouble swallowing – like food getting stuck?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No. Never. I eat perfectly fine. I'm a robust eater, always have been. This isn’t about swallowing, it’s about it… coming back up. You keep asking me strange questions. Are you even listening to me? I tell you it’s reflux, the lady on the phone said so, and you’re asking me if I can swallow? Honestly. It's a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: You are right to point that out, Mr. Altine. I apologize for not listening well enough. It sounds like reflux is very likely, and the phone triage nurse likely had a good initial assessment. Just to be thorough, let me ask a few quick questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like asthma, or had any issues with your esophagus before?
PATIENT: Esophagus? Asthma? What do those even have to do with this? I’m a director, not a… a hypochondriac. No, I've never been diagnosed with anything. Never. Perfectly healthy, as I've said. I eat a good diet, I exercise when I can, I manage stress. This is probably just a temporary thing. Look, can we just get to the solution? A pill? Something? I have a meeting. A very important meeting. I don’t have time to talk about my esophagus. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Altine. No prior medical conditions. I understand your frustration and your limited time. Let’s move forward. I’d like to briefly listen to your lungs, just to be sure. Then we can discuss treatment options. It will only take a moment. Would that be alright?
