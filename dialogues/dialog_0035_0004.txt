DOCTOR: Good morning, Teah. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Alzoubi. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s just a regular check-up, really. Gotta keep up with my shots, you know? Just making sure everything’s alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general check-up. That's good preventative care. And you're right, staying up-to-date on vaccinations is important. I see here you haven’t been in for a while. Let’s go over a little bit of your history, just to make sure I have everything current. Do you have any particular concerns or anything new going on that we should discuss today, besides the routine check-up and vaccinations?
PATIENT: Hmm, not really, no. Nothing major, anyway. I think I pulled a muscle in my back last week helping my husband with some roofing – he’s getting older, you know, and I like to help where I can. But it’s mostly okay now, just a little sore sometimes. Other than that, I'm feeling pretty good for my age, I guess!
DOCTOR: Okay, a pulled muscle in your back. That’s good you’re mostly recovered. We’ll want to ask a little more about that just to be sure. Can you describe exactly when it happened, and what makes the soreness better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, it was last Tuesday, I think. We were lifting some plywood onto the roof, and I twisted a bit to hand it to him. Felt a pop, not a bad pop, but enough to know something wasn't right. Mostly it's sore when I bend over or try to lift anything heavy. Sitting is okay, and laying down helps a lot. I’ve been putting some heat on it, and that seems to take the edge off.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tuesday lifting plywood, felt a pop, worse with bending/lifting, better with heat and lying down. Sounds like a fairly typical muscle strain. Just to get a clearer picture, have you had any pain radiating down your leg, any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet, or any weakness in your legs?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no. Just the soreness in my back, right where I think I pulled it. No pain down my legs at all, and my feet feel fine. Everything’s working as it should, I think! It’s just old age catching up, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No radiating pain, numbness, or weakness. That’s reassuring. Now, let’s briefly talk about your medical history, just to make sure I have everything up-to-date. Do you have any chronic medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise. My mom had a little bit of arthritis when she got older, and my dad had some trouble with his knees, but I haven't had any major problems myself. Blood pressure's usually a little high at the dentist, but it goes down when I'm not nervous. I try to eat pretty healthy, and I walk when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, family history of arthritis and knee issues. Blood pressure occasionally elevated at the dentist. That's good you're prioritizing a healthy lifestyle. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Oh! When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out, but that was a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was ten, climbing a tree. Aside from that, no, nothing major. No hospital stays, no other surgeries.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, broken arm. Nothing else. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything, and never had a reaction. I sometimes get itchy eyes in the springtime, but I don't think that’s an allergy, just the pollen, probably. I don't take any medications regularly, either. Just over-the-counter stuff when I have a cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, no regular medications. Alright. Before we do a quick physical exam, just one last thing. Are you currently taking any vitamins, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I do take a multivitamin every morning, just to make sure I'm getting enough. And sometimes I'll take some fish oil, for my joints. My friend swore it helps, so I figured it couldn't hurt. That’s about it, though. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and fish oil. Good to know. Alright, Teah. Let’s do a quick exam just to check things out. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Hope I haven't gained too much over the summer!
DOCTOR: 114 pounds. And I have your height at 169 centimeters. That puts your BMI at… 39.6. Okay. Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please sit up straight and take some deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I always feel a little silly when they listen to my heart and lungs. I always wonder what they're really listening for.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Just let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if I need to flex harder or anything. And no, nothing’s hurting right now, thankfully. This back muscle is a little sore if I move just the right way, but it's nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Lower back does have some mild tenderness to palpation, consistent with muscle strain. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re dealing with a mild muscle strain in your lower back. No indication of anything more serious. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that sounds about right, honestly. I figured it was just a pulled muscle. Is there anything I should be doing, besides resting it and putting heat on it? Or anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Okay. For the muscle strain, I recommend continuing with the heat application, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed. Avoid heavy lifting, twisting motions, and anything that significantly worsens the pain. Gentle stretching can be helpful once the acute soreness subsides, but stop if it causes pain. Since you're up to date on your routine vaccinations, and we’ve ruled out anything serious, we’re all good here. Would you like a printed summary of these recommendations to take home with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, thank you. A printed summary is always good to have, just to make sure I remember everything. And thank you for checking me out. I always feel better after a visit, even if it’s just to hear that everything’s alright. And could you remind me when I should come back for my next check-up?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. I'm glad I could reassure you. As for your next check-up, let’s schedule one for one year from today – August 2, 2026. Do you have any other concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Alzoubi. You’ve been very helpful! I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. I'm glad I could help. If anything changes or if you develop new concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
