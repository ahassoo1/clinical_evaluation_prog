DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 31 years of age. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s correct. It’s…well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having to go to the restroom very often lately. It’s quite disruptive, to be honest. I don’t… I don’t really know when it started, just that it’s been happening for a while now.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say. Alright. And when you say “very often,” can you give me a sense of how many times that is in a typical day, compared to what is normal for you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s…difficult to say. I suppose “normal” is relative, isn’t it? Before… well, before things started, I would say maybe four or five times a day. Now? It feels like every couple of hours. Sometimes more. It’s hard to keep track, truthfully. I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. MacVittie. We will get to the bottom of this. So, approximately eight to ten times a day now, then?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right, I think. Perhaps even more on days when I'm… busier. And it’s not just more often, it’s the feeling too. I constantly feel like I need to go, even when I’ve just been. It’s quite unsettling. It’s… distracting, to say the least. Is that normal? I truly don’t recall if I’ve ever felt this before.
DOCTOR: Constant feeling of needing to go, even after voiding… Right. And has anything changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Let me think… Not that I can readily recall, no. My divorce was finalized about six months ago, so things have been…different emotionally, naturally. But nothing drastically physical, if that makes sense? I started a new position at the hotel about three months ago, but it’s mostly the same type of work I’ve always done – concierge duties, you know? I’ve been trying to drink more water, as I heard it’s good for you, but… I’m grasping at straws here, I’m afraid. Is there anything specific I should be looking for? I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. MacVittie. We’ll try to piece this together. The divorce, a change in position... those can sometimes manifest physically. But let’s focus on the urinary symptoms themselves. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain, no burning, nothing like that. It's just… the frequency and the constant urge. And sometimes, when I do go, it's only a very small amount. It’s…frustrating, to say the least. It feels like my bladder isn't emptying completely, if that makes sense? I haven’t noticed any blood in my urine, either, if you were going to ask. Though, I confess, I don't always…examine it closely. I apologize; it's a bit of a delicate subject, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Small amounts, feeling of incomplete emptying… Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no chills. I haven't felt any pain in my back or sides. No nausea… Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit more tired lately. Just a general sense of fatigue, I suppose. I thought it was just stress from everything, but perhaps it's related? It’s difficult to say, truthfully. Is it common to feel tired with… this issue? I apologize for my continued vagueness.
DOCTOR: Fatigue…Right. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. That’s… a rather personal question. Well, I… I am divorced, as I mentioned. And… no, I haven’t been sexually active since the divorce was finalized. It’s been… a while. I apologize if that’s… not the answer you were looking for? I’m not entirely sure how that relates to the urinary frequency, but I’m happy to answer honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. MacVittie, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that's acceptable. I'll need to check your abdomen and a quick neurological assessment. It's standard procedure for these types of complaints.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I apologize in advance if I’m a bit… awkward. I’m not a fan of medical examinations, truthfully. But I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please, get changed, and we'll proceed at your pace. I’ll be right back with the necessary equipment. Alright, Ms. MacVittie, if you could lie down on your back, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen and check your reflexes. It won't take long. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. It feels… normal, I suppose. Perhaps a little…sensitive, but nothing alarming. It’s hard to say, truthfully. I do tend to get a bit anxious during medical examinations, so I might be more aware of sensations than usual. I apologize for being so unhelpful. Is that a bad sign? I confess, I’m starting to feel a bit worried.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. No apparent tenderness on abdominal palpation. Ms. MacVittie, I’d like to order a urinalysis and a complete blood count. This will help us rule out any infection or other underlying causes. Also, I think it would be prudent to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you deem necessary. I'm happy to comply. A urinalysis and blood tests… alright. And my blood pressure, of course. I apologize if I seem a bit… flustered. I'm not used to being poked and prodded, truthfully. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the blood tests? Should I fast beforehand? I'm happy to schedule another appointment for these if that’s more convenient.
DOCTOR: You do not need to fast, Ms. MacVittie. A standard CBC does not require fasting. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment for the blood work. As for the urinalysis, the nurse will provide you with a sterile cup and instructions on how to collect a sample. Given your age, and the lack of any overt signs of a serious condition, I am leaning towards a diagnosis of overactive bladder. However, we cannot rule out other possibilities until we have the lab results. I’ll also provide you with a bladder diary to track your fluid intake and urination frequency. This will give us a better understanding of your pattern.
PATIENT: Overactive bladder… Oh. That doesn’t sound very pleasant. I confess, I’m a bit relieved it’s not something more serious, but also… concerned about having to manage that long-term. A bladder diary… alright. That sounds… tedious, truthfully. But if it will help, I’m happy to do it. Will it be a very complicated diary? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. I just… I like to know what I’m getting into. And what does “managing” an overactive bladder even mean? Is there medication involved? I truly appreciate your patience with me. I’m a bit of a worrier, you see.
DOCTOR: The diary is straightforward, Ms. MacVittie. Simply note the time you drink fluids and the time you urinate, as well as the approximate amount. It’s not meant to be overly complicated. As for managing overactive bladder, it typically involves lifestyle modifications – limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, pelvic floor exercises, and, if necessary, medication. We’ll discuss medication options if the lifestyle changes aren’t sufficient. There are several oral medications available, as well as some less invasive procedures, but those are typically reserved for more severe cases. We’ll start with the diary and see what the results show. It’s important to rule out any other underlying conditions before we proceed with any treatment plan.
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable, I suppose. Lifestyle modifications… I can certainly cut back on caffeine. And I’ll do my best with the pelvic floor exercises, though I confess, I’m not entirely sure how to do those correctly. Perhaps there’s a pamphlet or website you could recommend? And I understand the need for the diary first. It makes perfect sense. Thank you, Doctor Pipkorn. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I feel a bit better now, knowing what to expect. So, to recap: bladder diary, cut back on caffeine, and we’ll see what the lab results say. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Or anything I should be avoiding? I apologize for all the questions, but I truly appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Avoid excessive fluid intake before bedtime, Ms. MacVittie. And avoid straining when urinating. As for pelvic floor exercises, the nurse will provide you with a handout and can demonstrate the proper technique. I think that covers everything for today. The nurse will be in shortly to provide you with the necessary materials and schedule the lab work. If you experience any worsening symptoms – fever, blood in your urine, severe abdominal pain – please contact the office immediately. We’ll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment in two weeks.
