DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just for my shots, really. Routine stuff. Gotta keep up with it, you know? My husband always reminds me.
DOCTOR: “Shots,” alright. And what shots are you referring to, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… honestly? I can’t really remember which ones. The nurse usually just tells me what I need and I roll up my sleeve. I just know it’s time for a check-up and boosters, I guess. Something like that. I don’t keep very good track of all that medical stuff, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that makes things… less straightforward. Do you have any idea when you last had a tetanus booster?
PATIENT: Tetanus… hmm. Let me think. It feels like… a while. Probably before the pandemic, maybe? I had a little cut gardening last spring, and I think someone asked me if I was up to date then, but I don't remember what I said. Does that help at all? I just… I get so many things mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: Let me pull up your records here. Ah… it appears the last documented tetanus booster was in 2018. And there's no record of a flu shot last season, either. We'll need to get those updated, certainly. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Oh, 2018, huh? Time really does fly. No, nothing really. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess. Nothing new or worrying. I’ve been a little tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days?
DOCTOR: "Patient reports fatigue, attributes to age and general lifestyle." Alright. And have you noticed any fever, chills, cough, or shortness of breath recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No fever, no chills, no cough. I can breathe just fine, thankfully. I did have a little sniffle last week, but it went away pretty quick. Just allergies, I think. The pollen's been awful bad this year.
DOCTOR: Allergies. Right. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Nope, eating pretty normal. Maybe a little too much, if anything! My husband makes such good food, it’s hard to resist. Weight’s probably stayed about the same, give or take a pound or two. Nothing to worry about there.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis in my hands. It's a prescription, I can tell you the name if you need it, but it’s small, white… oh dear, I’m terrible with names. It helps with the stiffness, though. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if it's really bothering me. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: The name of the arthritis medication would be helpful, if you can recall it. But, alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, you're right, sorry! It’s… Celebrex. That’s it, Celebrex. And no allergies, thankfully. None that I know of, anyway. My mom was allergic to bee stings, but I haven't had any problems with anything myself. I'm pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright, Celebrex. And no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your hands, given the arthritis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Yes, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, rate is within normal limits. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles noted. Some mild crepitus in the metacarpophalangeal joints, and slight tenderness to palpation. No significant swelling or redness. Alright. Your heart and lungs sound good, and the arthritis appears stable, as you described.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear! I do try to keep them moving, you know? Helps with the stiffness. So, what does that mean for the shots, Doctor? What do I need today?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the last tetanus booster was in 2018, you are due for a booster today. We should also administer the current influenza vaccine. And, given your age, I recommend a pneumococcal vaccine as well – it protects against pneumonia. Do you have any concerns about any of those?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Three shots? That's a bit much, isn't it? I didn’t realize it had been that long since my last tetanus shot. Pneumococcal… what does that one even protect against again? I always forget these things. And… will they make my arm really sore? I have a pottery class next week, and I don't want to be unable to work the wheel.
DOCTOR: The pneumococcal vaccine helps protect against pneumonia, bronchitis, and ear infections. It's particularly important for individuals over 65, or those with underlying health conditions. As for the soreness, you may experience some mild discomfort at the injection site. It usually subsides within a day or two. We can alternate arms to minimize disruption to your pottery class. It's important to keep your vaccinations up to date, Ms. Fornes. It's the best way to protect yourself from serious illness. Would you like to proceed with all three today?
PATIENT: Well, when you put it like that… serious illness… Okay, okay. Yes, let’s do them. All three. If it's important, then I guess I should just get it over with. Just… please be gentle with the needle. And can we do them on opposite arms, like you said? Pottery class is very important to me!
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll administer the tetanus booster to your left arm, the influenza vaccine to your right, and the pneumococcal vaccine to your left deltoid. Please remain seated. This may sting momentarily.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go then. Just… try to be quick. And… thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. All done. Remain in the waiting room for 15 minutes to monitor for any adverse reaction. If you experience any severe pain, swelling, or difficulty breathing, notify the nursing staff immediately.
PATIENT: .
