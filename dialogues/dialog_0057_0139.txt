DOCTOR: Good morning, Yamir. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I... need check for referee. For fitness. I want to... keep doing it. My wife... she liked watching. I do soccer. Mostly high school.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need a physical exam to make sure you're fit to continue playing soccer, and that it’s safe for you to do so. That’s a great idea to stay on top of your health! So, just to clarify, you're currently playing soccer at a high school level, is that correct?
PATIENT: No, no. I am not playing. I... judge. Referee. I run a lot. Need be strong. It is for... paperwork. League needs it. They want to make sure old man like me still can keep up.
DOCTOR: Ah, my apologies! You’re a soccer referee, and the league requires a physical exam for the paperwork. That makes perfect sense. It’s good they’re taking precautions to ensure the referees are physically able to keep up with the game. Okay, so we’ll do a thorough check-up. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Okay. I… mostly okay. No big problems. Had some back pain last year, but it’s better now. Used to lift heavy things for work. Refractory… fixing things for factory. Now just… running. Eat normal food. Sleep okay. Not much trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to hear. Back pain last year, and you used to do heavy lifting at a factory, but it’s mostly resolved now and you’re mainly running. Let’s get a little more detail about that back pain. Can you describe where the pain was located, and how long it lasted?
PATIENT: It was… low back. Lower back. Like… here. Lasted… a few months. Not all the time. Mostly after work. Lifting… things. Then got better with… time. And some medicine. Doctor gave me pills. I stop taking them now. It's okay. Mostly. Sometimes still feel it after long run. Not bad. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lower back pain, related to lifting at work, lasting a few months, and improved with time and medication. You’ve stopped taking the medication now, and it's only occasionally bothersome after a long run. Good. Now, besides the back pain, have you had any other medical issues in the past – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No diabetes. No high blood… pressure. Heart… okay. I think. Doctor checked before, a long time ago. Said… everything was normal. I don't… remember exactly. Just normal. No problems. My wife… she took care of all the papers. After she… gone. It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely understandable that it's hard to remember details, especially after a loss. We'll take things slowly. So, no known history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems. That’s good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgery. Never. And no… hospital. Just… one time, when little. I fall from tree. Just… broken arm. Small. Doctor fixed it. Long time ago. Nothing else. No big problems. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken arm when you were a child, but no other surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… my mother… she had… stomach problems. A long time ago. Cancer, I think. But she lived long time after. My father… he was strong. Never sick. My… wife’s family… I don't know much. We didn't talk about that. She didn't like talking about her family. Sorry. I don't know much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. You’ve told me what you know, and that’s what’s important. Stomach problems in your mother, and your father was healthy. It's understandable that you don't know much about your wife’s family history. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. No. I eat everything. No problem. I take… some pills for… sleep sometimes. But that’s all. No reaction. No trouble. I’m pretty easy. No special needs.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No known allergies. And you occasionally take pills for sleep. Now, before we do a physical exam, are you currently taking any other medications regularly?
PATIENT: No. Just the sleep pills, sometimes. When I can’t… rest. But not every night. Maybe one time a week. Sometimes not even that. I don't like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, so just occasional sleep pills. I understand you don’t like taking them, and that’s perfectly reasonable. Now, let’s move on to the physical exam. I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes and range of motion. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay. That's okay. Whatever you need. I want to make sure… I can keep doing it. I need to be… strong. For the game. Let's do it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s a little elevated, but not significantly concerning. We can monitor that. Now, let's check your pulse. Your pulse is 72, which is good. Let’s take your temperature. Temperature is normal at 98.6. And finally, your respiratory rate. Breathing is normal at 16 breaths per minute. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out…
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breath… and out… Deep breath… and out… Is everything okay? It feels… strange. Listening to my chest.
DOCTOR: Everything is sounding good so far, Yamir. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. It’s normal to feel a little strange when someone is listening to your chest, but there’s nothing to worry about. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are good, normal response. Finally, let’s check your range of motion. Can you please raise your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It’s a little… sore. Old injury. From work. Lifting… things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. I see a little bit of stiffness and limitation when raising your arms, which you mentioned is from an old work injury. That’s not unexpected. I’m also going to check your back. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Okay. Ow… that hurts. Just a little. Like I said… old injury.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. You have some discomfort with bending forward, and tenderness in your lower back. That’s consistent with your history of back pain. Alright, Yamir, that completes the physical exam. Overall, you appear to be in relatively good health. Your heart and lungs sound good, your reflexes are normal, and you have some mild stiffness and discomfort in your lower back, consistent with your history of injury. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but we can monitor that. Now, based on this exam, I don't think there's anything that would prevent you from continuing to referee soccer, but I do have a few recommendations to help you stay healthy and prevent further injury. Would you like to hear them?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I want to keep doing it. For as long as I can. Tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. First, it’s important to continue to warm up properly before each game and cool down afterwards. Stretching is also important, especially focusing on your lower back and shoulders. Second, I recommend you continue to monitor your blood pressure at home. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. If it consistently stays above 140/90, we should discuss medication options. Third, to help manage your back pain, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed. You can also try applying heat or ice to your lower back. Finally, I recommend you avoid heavy lifting whenever possible. If you must lift something heavy, use proper lifting technique and ask for help. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… okay. Warm up, stretch, check blood pressure, medicine if needed, no heavy lifting. I can do that. So… I can still referee? Even with the back pain? As long as I do those things?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. As long as you follow those recommendations, I don't see any reason why you can't continue to referee soccer. It’s important to listen to your body and rest when you need to. If your back pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms, please let me know. I'm going to write up a summary of our visit and these recommendations for you. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to check your blood pressure and see how you're doing. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time. It's good to know I can keep doing it. I'll… remember everything you said. I think.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Yamir. I'm glad I could help. It's good to hear that you're feeling more confident. And don't worry about remembering everything - that's what the written summary is for! I'll have the nurse come in shortly with the summary and schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a great day, and enjoy refereeing!
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day too.
