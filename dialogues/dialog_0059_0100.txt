DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Chagaris. It's lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Chagaris, was it? It's… nice to meet you as well. Um… well, to be honest, I mostly just remember someone said I needed to come in for a… test? Something about making sure I’m okay. It’s all a bit fuzzy, you see. My memory ain’t what it used to be. It’s a drug test, I think? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, that’s right. We sent out a notice for routine screening, and it does involve a urine sample. It’s a standard part of Medicare preventative care for individuals your age. It’s not necessarily a drug test in the way you might be thinking – we’re looking for common health issues that can be detected through a urine analysis. But let's not focus on just that. Is there anything else bothering you today?
PATIENT: Oh, preventative care… right. That sounds sensible. I do try to keep up with things, but… well, like I said, the memory. Anything else? Hmm… not that I recall, no. Just… tired, mostly. Always a bit tired. Working that equipment is hard on the body, you know? But that's just… life, I suppose. I don't think that needs a test, does it? Just old bones.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re thinking proactively about your health, Ms. Hughston. And no, being tired isn’t necessarily something that requires a test immediately, but it’s certainly something worth discussing. Fatigue can be caused by many things, and it’s important to rule out anything concerning. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about this equipment you work with?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… paving equipment. Big rollers, tampers, that sort of thing. You know, the stuff they use to make roads smooth? I’ve been doing it for… oh, goodness, almost thirty years now. Mostly out in the country, on new developments and such. It’s good work, keeps me busy. It’s… a lot of vibrations, I suppose. And long hours sometimes, especially in the summer. Does that… matter? Is that why I’m here? The vibrations? It used to bother my hands sometimes.
DOCTOR: That absolutely matters, Ms. Hughston. Thank you for telling me. Prolonged vibration exposure, like you experience with the paving equipment, can sometimes contribute to certain health issues, particularly affecting the hands and joints, but also potentially other areas. It’s good we’re discussing this. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. That was… unpleasant. And… arthritis, I think the doctor said. In my hands, mostly. It flares up sometimes, gets a bit painful. That’s why I retired from some of the finer work, you see. Couldn't hold the tools steady. Other than that… I don't really… I don't recall anything major. A bit of high blood pressure, maybe? They gave me some pills for it, but I don’t use them much anymore. I keep forgetting. Honestly, it’s a blur. My husband used to keep track of all that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Hughston. It's completely understandable that it can be difficult to keep track of everything. We can certainly look into your medical history further. I see here in the system a record of a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – in 2008, and a diagnosis of hypertension. It also notes a prescription for Lisinopril. And you mentioned arthritis in your hands. Is that pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, 2008… yes, that sounds right. The pain… it comes and goes. Mostly when it’s cold, or if I’ve been doing something with my hands for too long. Gardening, mostly. I like to potter about in the garden, but it gets… difficult sometimes. And when it rains, oh, goodness, it really aches. It’s not crippling, not usually. Just… uncomfortable. And stiff. Very stiff. I try to ignore it, mostly. It's just… old age creeping in, I suppose. Is that something you can… see in the test? Whether it’s arthritis?
DOCTOR: The urine test won’t directly show arthritis, Ms. Hughston. Arthritis is diagnosed through a physical examination and sometimes imaging like X-rays. However, the urine test can help us look for things like kidney problems, which can sometimes be associated with chronic inflammation, like arthritis. It’s part of getting a broader picture of your overall health. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Do you have any family members with conditions like arthritis, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… My mother… she had arthritis, I think. Badly, in her hips. She had to have a replacement, eventually. And my father… he had heart trouble. He smoked a lot, you see. Always did. He passed away when I was still young. My brother… he’s healthy enough, as far as I know. We don’t see each other much anymore. No one else… I don’t really… remember anything specific, to be honest. We weren't a very close family. Does that… help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Hughston. A family history of arthritis and heart disease does increase your risk, so it's important to be aware of that. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of, no. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to any pills, as far as I recall. My husband always took care of all that… making sure I didn't take anything I shouldn’t. Honestly, Doctor, I’m just a bit of a mess when it comes to remembering things. I hope I’m not making this too difficult for you.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Hughston. You're not making it difficult at all. It's perfectly normal to have trouble remembering things, and you're doing a wonderful job sharing what you can. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I have these… for my blood pressure, sometimes. Lisinopril, I think? But I don't take them every day. And… sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, when it’s really bad. Ibuprofen, I think it is. Over the counter. But honestly, it's all a bit haphazard. I forget to fill it most of the time, and then I forget to take the pills. It’s a bit of a mess, really. I’m sorry. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly okay, Ms. Hughston. It’s very helpful to know what you’ve been taking, even if it's not a regular routine. It’s common for medications to be taken intermittently. Alright, thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your hands and joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I don't mind. My husband always said I needed to get checked out regularly. He was very… conscientious. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready. Just… try not to poke too much, if you don’t mind. My arthritis makes me a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. Just a few moments. Take a nice, deep breath for me... and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/88. Nothing immediately alarming, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Now, let's take a look at your hands. I see some mild swelling and tenderness in the knuckles of both hands… particularly the distal interphalangeal joints. Range of motion is slightly limited, but not severely. Do you experience pain with these movements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s where it hurts the most. Especially in the mornings, or when it’s cold. And if I’ve been gardening, oh, goodness, it really flares up. It’s just… a dull ache, mostly. But it can be quite stiff. It makes it difficult to do things, you know? Little things. Opening jars, buttoning my coat… that sort of thing. It’s just… getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have some classic signs of osteoarthritis, Ms. Hughston. The stiffness in the mornings, the pain with use, and the swelling in the knuckles are all consistent with that diagnosis. It's very common, especially as we age. Now, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out other potential causes of joint pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout, just to be thorough. I'll also order a urine analysis as we discussed, to assess your kidney function and look for any other abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… sensible. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Blood work and… the urine test. It’s just… a bit of a bother, I suppose. But if it will help, then… go ahead. Where do I… do I need to go somewhere else for that? Or can you do it here? I don’t drive much anymore, you see. It’s easier if I don’t have to go too far.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Ms. Hughston. We can do both tests right here in the clinic. The blood work will just require a quick pinprick. And for the urine sample, I’ll give you a cup and instructions. You’ll just need to collect a sample and bring it back to the nurse. It shouldn’t take too long at all. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to manage your pain with over-the-counter Ibuprofen as needed. Also, gentle hand exercises can help maintain range of motion and reduce stiffness. The nurse will have some information on those exercises for you. Would you like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in a week or so?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… good. Right here. That’s much easier. And information on exercises… yes, that would be very helpful. A follow-up appointment… yes, please. A week sounds… reasonable. I just hope the results aren’t… too bad. I just want to be able to… keep doing my gardening, you see. It’s… important to me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Hughston. Many people find gardening to be a very fulfilling activity. We'll do everything we can to help you manage your arthritis and continue to enjoy it. Alright, let's get those tests ordered. The nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to collect your blood sample and provide you with the urine cup and instructions. She’ll also schedule your follow-up appointment and give you information on hand exercises. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very… thorough, Doctor. And patient. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and not making me feel… foolish about forgetting things. My husband would have liked you very much. Just… thank you. I’ll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns between now and your follow-up appointment. Sarah will be with you shortly. .
