DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Afternoon. Look, Doc, I ain't got all day. Just need somethin' signed. A… a paper. For… fixin’ myself up a bit. Don't rightly remember all the details, to be honest. Seems important though. My niece, she said I needed clearance from a doctor. Is that you? Just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you have a form that requires a physician’s signature. Of course, I’m happy to help if I can. To ensure I can complete it accurately and responsibly, could you tell me a little more about why you need the form?
PATIENT: Responsible? Look, I been workin’ with towers and antennas my whole life. I know what I’m doin’. This ain’t brain surgery. Some… some woman at the place said somethin’ about… cosmetic? Is that what you call it? I just want to look a little… tidier. That’s all. Don’t need a whole life story asked for, just sign the paper. It’s probably somethin’ to do with… smoothin’ things out. You understand?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you explaining that. “Smoothin’ things out” could mean a number of things, and it’s my responsibility to understand the context before signing any medical documentation. To clarify, are you referring to a cosmetic procedure?
PATIENT: Procedure… well, I suppose. It ain't like I’m gettin' a new hip or somethin’. It’s… on my face. It's just a little bit of… saggin’. Been workin’ in the sun too long, I reckon. It’s a quick fix, they said. They showed me pictures… look, are you gonna sign it or not? I got things to do. And honestly, I don't understand why you need to know so much. Seems like a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop, and I apologize if I’m asking too many questions. It’s not about doubting you, but about ensuring I can responsibly complete the form. Knowing the specific procedure – even just the name of it – helps me assess whether it’s safe for you, and if there are any potential risks I should be aware of. Could you tell me the name of the place where you're getting this done?
PATIENT: Look, it was… somethin’ fancy. “Eternal Youth Clinic” or somethin' ridiculous like that. My niece booked it. She’s always tryin’ to get me to do things. I don’t remember the full name, and frankly, I don't care. It’s down the street, near the… the bakery. They showed me a picture of… a needle. And a smooth face. That’s all I know! And I really don’t see what any of this has to do with you signin' a paper. It’s not like you're gonna do the procedure. Just sign it and let me go. Honestly, I’m startin’ to regret comin’ here.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. "Eternal Youth Clinic," near the bakery… that's helpful. And you mentioned a needle, and the procedure is to address some sagging on your face. Before I can sign anything, I need to understand a little more about your medical history. Have you had any procedures like this done before?
PATIENT: Procedures? No! Never. I been too busy workin’ on towers to worry about… foolishness like that. I got a few scrapes and bruises, from climbin’ around, but nothin’ fancy. And I ain't been to a doctor in… well, I can’t rightly remember. Why would I be? I'm a strong man! I fix things! I don’t need procedures. This is the first time. Just get it over with, Doc. I got a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Now you're just fishin'. Look, I told you, I’m a strong man. I work outside, climb towers, I’m perfectly healthy! Never been sick a day in my life, except for a little cold now and then. No high blood pressure, no sugar problems, no nothin’. Just sign the paper! It’s gettin’ ridiculous. You askin’ me about my health like I'm some kinda invalid. I swear... this is a waste of my time and energy. I’m beginnin’ to think I should just forget the whole thing. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I must emphasize the importance of gathering this information. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, it’s my professional responsibility to ensure this procedure is safe for you. A simple procedure can sometimes have unforeseen complications, and knowing your medical history is crucial for minimizing those risks. Before I can sign this form, I need to at least do a basic examination to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Would you be willing to allow me to do that?
