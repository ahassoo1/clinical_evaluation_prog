DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. And please, call me Aurthur. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, I've been having a bit of trouble lately… mostly with feeling sick to my stomach in the mornings. It's been happening for a few weeks now, and my neighbour, Agnes, she kept telling me to come see someone, so here I am. It's not a bad sick, just… uncomfortable, you know? And I've got a touch of… well, they told me years ago it was my heart, needing a bit of looking after.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Aurthur. It’s good of you to come in when you’re experiencing discomfort. A few weeks of morning sickness, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, a few weeks now. Not every morning, mind you. Maybe three or four times a week. It usually passes after I've had a bit of toast and a cup of tea, but it's enough to ruin my appetite for the rest of the day. And it's a bit worrying, with the heart trouble and all. Not wanting to push it, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially given your history with your heart. We’ll certainly investigate this thoroughly. To get a better understanding, could you describe the sensation when you feel sick?
PATIENT: Right, well… it’s not like a violent heave, if you know what I mean. More of a… queasiness, really. A churning in my stomach, and a bit of feeling like I might be, well, you know. But it doesn’t usually come out, if that makes sense. Just… unsettled. And it's always first thing, before I've had anything to eat. It fades after breakfast, usually.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. So, a queasiness, primarily in the mornings, before eating, and it subsides with breakfast. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it, besides just the time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don’t think so, not really. I’ve been trying to think. I haven’t changed my diet, I eat pretty much the same things every day. And I haven't been travelling or anything. It just… started. Agnes said maybe it was stress, but I haven’t been particularly stressed lately, not any more than usual, anyway. I do a bit of gardening, which helps keep me occupied.
DOCTOR: Gardening is excellent, a good way to manage stress indeed. And you haven’t noticed any other symptoms accompanying this nausea?
PATIENT: Not that I've noticed, no. No dizziness, no headaches, no trouble breathing… just the sick feeling. I do feel a bit tired sometimes, but I'm 63, Doctor! I suppose a bit of tiredness comes with the territory, doesn’t it? I get a wee bit short of breath when I’m doing heavy work in the garden, but that’s been the case for years, ever since they told me about the heart.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And just to clarify, when you say they “told you about the heart,” could you tell me a little more about what was diagnosed, and when?
PATIENT: Right, well… it was about ten years ago now. I was getting a bit breathless, even with just walking up the hill to the shops. The doctor sent me for tests, and they said I had… heart failure, I think it was called. Not severe, they said, but needed to be managed. I take a couple of tablets every day for it. Can't remember the name of them, to be honest. Little white ones, mostly. And I try to watch my salt intake, like they told me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Aurthur. Knowing the approximate timeframe and that you're currently taking medication for heart failure is very helpful. To get a more complete picture, could you please tell me if you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, within reason, of course! I've never had any trouble with penicillin or anything like that. My wife, God rest her soul, she was allergic to shellfish, but I never had any bother myself.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Aurthur. That’s good to know. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never have. My father smoked, and it wasn't a pretty sight, so I stayed well clear of it. Always thought it was a silly habit, to be honest. And my wife, she hated the smell of it.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And what about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Well, I used to enjoy a wee dram of whisky now and then, especially on a cold evening. But I’ve cut right back in recent years. Maybe a glass or two at Christmas, or if I'm out with friends. Nothing regular, mind you. It didn’t seem to agree with the heart tablets, so I decided it was best to be cautious.
DOCTOR: That's very sensible, Aurthur. Now, finally, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the heart tablets?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I used to take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but I haven't bothered with it lately. I think I had some indigestion tablets in the cupboard, but I haven't used them for ages. And that's about it, I think. Just the little white heart tablets, twice a day.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Aurthur. That provides a very complete picture. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to be poked and prodded, if it’ll help. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m a fairly sturdy old chap, so don’t be afraid to have a good listen!
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in... and out... good. Heart sounds reveal a normal rate and rhythm with a mild murmur consistent with previous cardiac evaluation. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles auscultated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Blood pressure is 138/82 mmHg. Everything appears within normal limits based on the initial examination, Aurthur, but to rule out any underlying issues, I would like to order some blood tests. These will help assess your kidney function, electrolytes, and thyroid levels. We should also check a complete blood count. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests can’t hurt, can they? If you think it’s best, then go right ahead. I’m happy to have whatever tests you deem necessary. Just let me know where I need to go to get them done, and I'll get it sorted.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The clinic has a laboratory just down the hall, room 3. They're expecting you, and the nurse will draw the necessary samples. The results usually take about two to three business days. While we await the results, I recommend continuing your current medication regimen. In the meantime, please monitor your symptoms. If the nausea worsens, or if you experience any other symptoms like vomiting, dizziness, or significant weight loss, please contact the clinic immediately. Would you like a printed summary of these instructions?
PATIENT: Aye, that would be grand, Doctor. A wee bit of paper to remind me of everything is always helpful. My memory’s not what it used to be, you know. And thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing it as just an old man complaining. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aurthur. It's my pleasure. We take all concerns seriously, regardless of age. This summary includes the list of tests ordered, instructions on monitoring your symptoms, and contact information for the clinic. Given your history of heart failure and the fact that the nausea is intermittent, it’s also prudent to review your medication list with your cardiologist. Perhaps they can assess if any adjustments are needed. Would you be agreeable to me sending a summary of this visit to their office?
PATIENT: That's a very good idea, Doctor. Agnes always said it was best to keep all the specialists in the loop. Aye, please do send a message to my cardiologist, that would be brilliant. I can’t remember their name off the top of my head, but they know me. They're at the city hospital, the cardiology department. Whatever information you need, they'll have it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll ensure they receive a comprehensive summary of our discussion and the results of your blood tests. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Aurthur?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and I feel much better having talked it through with you. Thank you again for your time and patience. I’ll get those blood tests done tomorrow, and I’ll let the clinic know if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aurthur. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll review the results as soon as they are available and discuss the next steps. Have a good day, Aurthur, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. And thank you again. I will. Bye bye now.
