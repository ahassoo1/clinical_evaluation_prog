DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, somethin’ about insurance. My… my wife, she took care of a lot of things. After she… passed. Somethin’ about makin’ sure I’m covered for… long term stuff? I don’t really remember all the details. It’s the insurance people, mostly. They sent me here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like this visit is partly related to reviewing your insurance coverage, and potentially addressing any health concerns that might be relevant given your wife’s passing. That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly sort through things. To get a better picture of your overall health, and to help with the insurance review, could you tell me a little bit about why you are seeking medical attention today?
PATIENT: Attention? Well… nothin’ major, Doc. I get a little tired, maybe. Older now, I guess. Used to work on the docks, movin’ freight. Hard work. Don’t do that anymore, though. Just… slowin’ down. I mostly just… keep busy. Fix things around the house. Don’t really need to see a doctor, if you know what I mean. It’s the insurance folks… pushin’ me to come. My wife always said I was stubborn about this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you're generally feeling the effects of aging and previous work, but haven't had any specific concerns prompting you to seek medical attention until now. And it’s understandable to be hesitant, especially if you’re generally feeling okay. Just to clarify, when you say “tired,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: It ain’t like… sick tired, Doc. More like… heavy. Like carryin’ somethin’ all the time. Even when I ain't. Hard to explain. I used to be able to work all day, come home and still help with things. Now, I gotta sit down after a few hours. And… sometimes my memory ain't what it used to be. Little things, mostly. Forget where I put my keys. Forget what I was talkin’ about. Not all the time, mind you. Just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy” fatigue and some memory lapses. That gives me a better understanding. It's good you're able to articulate that distinction. And just to get a full picture, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My hands… they get kinda shaky sometimes. Not bad, just… a little tremble. Especially when I’m tryin’ to do somethin’ small, like buttonin’ a shirt. And… I get kinda… cold easier, I think. Used to not bother me much, bein’ out in the weather. Now, I gotta layer up even on warm days. That’s… about it, I guess. I don’t really pay much attention to things unless somethin’ really bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so we're talking about fatigue, some memory issues, hand tremors, and increased sensitivity to cold. That's helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Uh… I had the usual childhood stuff. Measles, mumps… nothin’ serious. Broke my arm once when I was a kid, fallin’ outta a tree. As an adult… I had my tonsils out, I think. And… I had high blood pressure for a while, Doc. Took pills for it, but I… stopped takin’ them a few years ago. The doctor said it wasn’t too bad, so I figured it was okay. And… my wife… she was sick for a long time. Cancer. It was… rough. I don’t really remember much else, to be honest. It’s been a long time, and… I don’t have all the records. She took care of all that.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, childhood illnesses, tonsillectomy, a history of high blood pressure that you were previously treated for, and your wife’s illness. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Rover. It’s understandable that things are a bit fuzzy, especially with everything that's happened. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of, Doc. Never had a reaction to anything. I ate just about everything as a kid. My wife always said I had an iron stomach. I don't recall ever bein’ allergic to any pills or nothin’. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but that's just from spicy food. Nothing serious. Never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I live alone now, in the same house my wife and I always had. It's small, but comfortable. I mostly keep to myself. I like to fix things – old radios, furniture, whatever needs repairin'. I walk a little bit, when the weather's nice. I don’t really… socialize much anymore. Used to go fishin’ with my wife, but… it ain’t the same without her. I eat pretty regular. Not fancy, just… simple food. Soup, sandwiches, that sort of thing. I don't drink much, and I don't smoke. Never really got into that stuff. Mostly just… quiet.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Rover. It sounds like you maintain a relatively quiet and self-sufficient lifestyle. Now, to get a better sense of things, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a quick neurological assessment. That will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sure, Doc. That’s… fine. Whatever you need to do. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, so I guess it’s a good idea. Just… be gentle, okay? My bones ain't what they used to be. And… I might get a little cold easily, so maybe a warm room?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rover. We’ll take it slow and easy. And absolutely, we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. A warm room is no problem at all. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably with your feet flat on the floor and your arm relaxed?
PATIENT: Sure. This table feels kinda cold. Just lettin’ you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 82. Your heart rhythm is a bit irregular, and I’m hearing some mild crackling in your lungs. It’s not anything alarming right now, but we'll need to investigate further. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. This feels kinda strange. Haven't done this in a long time. A little stiff, you know? Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, your reflexes are a little diminished, and your balance seems slightly off. It’s not anything drastic, but it’s something we need to keep an eye on. Now, to finish up, I’d like to check your thyroid gland. Could you please tilt your head back slightly?
PATIENT: Tilt my head back? Is somethin’ wrong? It feels a little… uncomfortable. I don’t usually get checked for my… thyroid, whatever that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rover. Your thyroid gland feels a little enlarged. It’s not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it's something we need to investigate further with some blood tests. That will help us determine if it's functioning properly. Alright, that completes the physical exam for now. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, I want to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. These tests will check your thyroid function, kidney function, liver function, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah… blood tests. Okay. Sounds… thorough. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I don’t really understand all that stuff, but… if you think it'll help figure things out, go ahead. Just… tell me if it's gonna hurt. I ain't good with needles. And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to keep comin’ back if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Mr. Rover. The blood draw itself is usually very quick and causes minimal discomfort. It's just a little pinch. And I understand your concern about not wanting to come back unnecessarily. The results should be back in about 3-5 business days. We can discuss them over the phone or schedule a follow-up appointment, whichever you prefer. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all for now, Doc. Just… three to five days, you said? And you’ll call me? That’s good. Thank you. You’ve been… patient with an old man. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. It’s my job. And please, don’t worry. We’ll get to the bottom of this. If anything changes before then, or you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. The nurse will be with you shortly. Just relax, and she’ll take good care of you.
PATIENT:
