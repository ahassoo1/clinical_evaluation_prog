DOCTOR: Hi Kahrin, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, um, hi Doctor. Just the results, please. I’m pretty busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that’d be great. I remember scheduling this just to go over those blood tests from last week.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No problem at all. Let's take a look. Okay, I see here your blood tests from August 1st. I’ve got them pulled up on the screen here, if you’d like to take a look with me. Or I can just walk you through the important parts. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Just tell me the important parts, please. I trust your judgment. I’m not really good at reading those charts, honestly. And quickly, if that’s alright?
DOCTOR: Of course. Okay, so overall, most of your results are within a normal range, which is good. Your complete blood count looks fine – no signs of anemia or infection. Your thyroid levels are also normal. However, your Vitamin D level is a little low, and your cholesterol is slightly elevated. It's not drastically high, but something we should definitely discuss. Do you have any questions about those specific things before I go into a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Vitamin D? Okay. And cholesterol… is that bad? I don’t really know what that means, exactly. I eat pretty healthy, I thought. What does “slightly elevated” even mean? Numbers would be good, if you have them.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. So, for Vitamin D, your level is 28 ng/mL. We generally like to see that above 30. It’s not terribly low, but it can contribute to fatigue and muscle aches. As for your cholesterol, your total cholesterol is 210 mg/dL. Ideally, we want that under 200. Your LDL – that's the "bad" cholesterol – is 145 mg/dL, and we like to see that under 100. Your HDL – the "good" cholesterol – is 55, which is good, and your triglycerides are 150, also pretty good. So, it’s not a major concern, but it's worth addressing to prevent it from becoming one. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Okay, numbers help. So, under 30 for the Vitamin D, and under 200 for the total cholesterol… I remember those now. What do I do about it? Pills? Diet changes? Because honestly, if it's a huge diet change, I'm probably not going to stick with it. I try, but… life gets busy.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's great you’re being realistic about what you'd be able to manage. Luckily, we have several options. For the Vitamin D, a simple supplement would likely be enough. We could start with 2000 IU daily. As for the cholesterol, we could consider medication, but given that it's only slightly elevated, I think we could try some dietary adjustments first. I'm not talking a complete overhaul! Just a few small changes. Things like incorporating more soluble fiber – oats, beans, apples – and focusing on healthy fats – avocados, olive oil, nuts – can make a big difference. Reducing saturated and trans fats – found in processed foods, red meat, fried foods – is also helpful. Would you be open to trying that for a couple of months and then rechecking your levels?
PATIENT: Okay, pills are fine. I can do pills. And… I think I can manage those food things. I already eat apples sometimes. No promises about the red meat, though. So, pills and… try to eat more apples and less junk. Two months, then check again. Is that right? Because if it's more complicated than that, I’m going to need a written list. I forget things, you know?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Pills for the Vitamin D – we’ll start with 2000 IU daily. And focus on adding more apples, beans, and healthy fats, and reducing processed and fried foods. No pressure about eliminating red meat completely! We'll recheck your levels in two months – I’ll schedule that appointment for you now. And absolutely, I can print out a summary of these recommendations for you – a list of foods to focus on and avoid. It includes specific examples, too. Here you go. Does that sound like a plan you can work with?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Two months, Vitamin D pills, and the list. Perfect. Okay, I think that’s everything. I appreciate you not making me sit here for hours.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome! I understand your time is valuable. We'll get those blood tests rescheduled for you, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions in the meantime. I'm glad we got things sorted out. Have a good day, Kahrin.
