DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Tofani, good to see you, though I am a bit behind schedule today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Ruocco. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain. Things haven’t been quite right, you see. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. She’s worried about some… weakness I've been having. And, oh dear, my mother, she had terrible headaches, migraines, they called them. It runs in the family, I think. But I can't quite put my finger on everything… it’s all a bit foggy.
DOCTOR: Foggy, right. Happens at your age, Mrs. Tofani. Look, let’s try to be… concise. Weakness. Where exactly are you feeling this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, concise. Good idea. Let me think… It’s mostly on this side. <points to her right side with a shaky hand> My arm, mostly. And sometimes my leg feels… heavy. Not all the time, you understand. It comes and goes. It's like it doesn't quite listen to me when I try to move it, if that makes any sense. And then, sometimes, a little bit of… trouble speaking, but only for a moment. It’s fleeting, really. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: Fleeting, you say. Right side weakness, intermittent. And some…speech difficulties. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It feels like… a while now. Months, certainly. But it’s not constant. There are days I feel perfectly fine, and then other days… well, like today, a little bit shaky. I suppose it started gradually. At first, I just thought I was getting old, you know? A little bit slower. My daughter, she noticed it more than I did. She said I was dropping things more often. Honestly, it's hard to pinpoint when it really started starting, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Gradual onset. Let’s try to focus, Mrs. Tofani. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… oh dear. Let me think. <squints, taps her chin> I do need new glasses, I’ve been meaning to get that done. But… changes? Not that I’ve noticed, specifically. Everything looks a little blurry sometimes, but I just put that down to the age of these lenses. No double vision, no… spots, nothing like that. But blurry, yes. Definitely blurry. Is that what you mean, Doctor? Or are you asking about something else? It’s just… sometimes I have trouble reading small print.
DOCTOR: Okay. Bluriness. We'll note that. Any headaches accompanying this?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the headaches. Like my mother’s. They’re not… the kind that make you want to lie down and be quiet, if you understand. More of a… throbbing, behind my eyes. And sometimes in my temples. They come and go, like everything else. They’ve been happening… well, probably as long as the weakness has. Though they are not every day. Sometimes a week goes by without one, and then suddenly… there it is. Dull ache mostly, not sharp. And they don't last very long. Just a few hours. Do you want me to be more specific? It's just so hard to remember…
DOCTOR: Alright. Throbbing headaches, intermittent. Look, Mrs. Tofani, to be perfectly frank, this is a bit vague. I need to do a quick neurological exam, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. An exam. That makes sense. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Though, honestly, I’m not very good with… with tests. I always feel a bit clumsy. But I’ll try my best. Just tell me what you need me to do. I’m happy to cooperate, truly. And… if it's alright, could you speak slowly? It helps me focus.
DOCTOR: Alright. Slowly. Fine. If you could just sit up straight for me… and I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arms. <pauses, begins tapping Mrs. Tofani’s knee with a reflex hammer> Right leg first.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, relax. I can do that. <sits up straighter, looking a bit nervous> My reflexes… are they alright? I haven’t really thought about them. Oh dear, is this going to hurt? I’m a bit ticklish, you see. Just be gentle, if you wouldn’t mind. <winces slightly as the hammer touches her knee> Oh! That’s… a bit startling. <looks down at her leg> Is that normal? It didn’t… jump very much, did it? I’m afraid my legs don’t work as well as they used to.
DOCTOR: A little diminished, yes. Normal for your age, but we’ll note it. Now, let’s check the other side. <taps the other knee with the reflex hammer> And just try to say “banana” while I do this, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, banana… <winces again as the hammer touches her knee, but tries to focus> Ba-na-na… It's funny, my granddaughter loves bananas. She makes smoothies with them. <pauses, struggling> Ba-na-na… Is that alright? It's a bit harder to say when I'm… when I’m being tapped, I suppose. It feels a bit strange. And… <frowns> did I say it properly? My speech is a bit slurred sometimes, isn’t it? Is that what you're looking for? <looks at Dr. Ruocco with concern> It didn't jump much on this side either, did it?
DOCTOR: Diminished reflexes bilaterally. Speech… slightly slurred, intermittent. Okay, Mrs. Tofani. Now I want you to close your eyes and tell me when I touch your fingers. <demonstrates, gently touching her fingers and then his own> Don't open your eyes until after I remove my hand. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh, close my eyes… yes, I can do that. <closes her eyes tightly, looking apprehensive> Don't open until after… right. <pauses, breathing a little heavily> This is a bit scary, isn't it? I always worry about falling. <waits a moment, then speaks hesitantly> Is… is my hand being touched? No, not yet, I don't think so. <pauses again, then a flicker of confusion crosses her face> Wait… was it touched just now? It’s hard to tell. Everything feels a little… numb. Oh dear. I’m afraid I'm not very good at this. Please be patient with me. It's just… my senses aren't what they used to be. <frowns, trying to concentrate> Are you touching my finger now?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Tofani. I’m going to order a CT scan of your head. And an MRI. I need to rule out a stroke, or something more serious. I'm going to be frank with you, this constellation of symptoms is… concerning.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A scan… and an MRI? <eyes widen with alarm> Is… is something wrong? A stroke? That sounds very serious, Doctor. <clutches her chest, looking panicked> I don’t… I don’t feel very well. Are you sure? Is there… is there something you can do right now? My heart is racing. My daughter… she told me I shouldn’t ignore these things. I just didn’t want to worry her. What… what will the scan show? Will it hurt? <looks at Dr. Ruocco with pleading eyes> Please tell me everything will be alright. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Tofani, please. I understand you're anxious, but you need to calm down. The scan will give us information. We need to have information. I'm not saying you have a stroke, just that we need to rule it out. The scan itself is painless, just… a bit noisy. I'm going to write you a referral to the radiology center. They’ll schedule it for you as soon as possible. It’s best to get this done today, if possible. And I am going to prescribe a mild sedative to take before the scan. It'll help with the anxiety. <begins writing rapidly on a prescription pad> We'll go from there. Now, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. <pauses, tapping her chin thoughtfully> I don’t think so. Not that I know of. My mother was allergic to… to something in the flowers, I think. But I never had any problems myself. No, no allergies. Though, I do get a little… upset if I’m around too much perfume. It gives me a headache. <winces slightly> But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… a sensitivity. <looks at Dr. Ruocco with concern> Are you sure this is the right thing to do? All these tests… it sounds so serious. And a sedative? I don’t like taking pills, Doctor. I always worry about side effects. <clutches her purse tightly> Perhaps… perhaps we could just wait and see? I feel a little better when I rest, you know. A nice cup of chamomile tea… that usually helps. <looks at Dr. Ruocco with pleading eyes>
DOCTOR: Mrs. Tofani, with all due respect, "waiting and seeing" is not a viable option given your symptoms. We need to be proactive. The sedative is a low dose, just to help you get through the scan. And frankly, I’m not comfortable discharging you without this imaging. Here's the referral and the prescription. The radiology center will contact you to schedule the appointment. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – weakness, slurred speech, headache – go to the emergency room immediately. <hands her the papers> I have other patients waiting. Now, do you have any further questions before I need to move on?
PATIENT: Oh… I… <takes the papers with trembling hands, looking overwhelmed> I suppose… no. Not right now. I just… <pauses, tears welling up in her eyes> Thank you, Doctor. I… I will call the radiology center. And… I’ll try not to worry. But it’s just… so much. <clutches the papers tightly> Chamomile tea… yes. I think I need a cup of chamomile tea. <stands up slowly, looking lost and confused> Thank you again, Doctor. I… I don’t know what I’m going to do.
