DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Kelder. Welcome. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it's been… a bit of a rough patch lately. I mostly just feel sick to my stomach, you know? And I don't get very hungry. Even a little bit of food fills me up way too fast. It’s… unsettling, to say the least. I don’t remember exactly when it started, now… maybe a few weeks ago? It's all a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of feeling sick to your stomach and not much appetite, getting full quickly. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about the sick feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it's not… violent, if that makes sense. Not like I'm throwing up all the time. It's more of a… queasy feeling. Like when you're on a boat, maybe? But not as bad. It just sits there, a little roiling around. It happens most of the time, I think... after I eat, maybe a little bit before. Honestly, it’s hard to say for sure. My memory… isn't what it used to be. Is that making sense? I hope so.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Ms. Kelder. A queasy feeling, sometimes before or after eating. Alright. And has anything in particular seemed to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. I’ve tried to eat… lighter things, you know? Soup, crackers… but it doesn’t seem to matter much. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. I just can't put my finger on it. I used to love my fried chicken, but even that doesn’t sound good anymore. Which is… strange. I don’t think it's the food, though, really. It just feels wrong, inside.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not linked to any specific foods, and even foods you normally enjoy aren't appealing. And you describe it as a general feeling of something being “wrong.” I see. Let’s try to get a little broader picture. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Oh dear… other changes… well, now you're asking. I get tired easier, I suppose. A little more than usual. And… I've lost a little weight, maybe? I haven't been keeping track, and I don't weigh myself much anymore. My daughter, bless her heart, she says I look thinner, but I don't really… notice things like that. Everything feels a bit… distant, you know? It’s hard to explain. Does that make any sense at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Ms. Kelder. Fatigue and some unintentional weight loss, in addition to the stomach issues. Okay. Let me ask about your bowel movements. Have you noticed any changes in those lately?
PATIENT: Oh my… well, that's a bit personal, isn't it? Let me see… they've been… regular, I suppose. Not different, exactly. But… maybe a little darker? I don’t know if that means anything. It’s just… I haven’t really paid much attention, honestly. I feel so… out of sorts, everything’s a bit of a blur. Is that helpful? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. You’re doing just fine. Darker stools could be something, but it’s not necessarily concerning. Let’s move on. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really pain, no. But… a sort of discomfort, high up in my tummy, sometimes. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. It comes and goes. It doesn’t keep me up at night or anything, but I notice it when I’m… well, just sitting around, I guess. It's hard to describe. Is it important if it's not pain exactly? I worry I'm just being a bother, and not explaining things clearly.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being a bother at all, Ms. Kelder, and the discomfort is important. A dull ache in your upper abdomen… alright. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a long time ago. Let me see. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… I had a bit of trouble with my heart, a long time back, but they fixed it. I think. It was a long time ago. And… well, my daughter told me, not too long ago, that I have… cancer? It’s… it’s been a lot to take in, to be honest. I don’t remember all the details. It was a few years back, I think. Something about my stomach, maybe? Is that helping? I’m so sorry, I just… my brain isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. It seems you were diagnosed with early-stage stomach cancer about three years ago and underwent treatment. The records indicate you completed chemotherapy and had a follow-up endoscopy that showed no recurrence at that time. I see here you also have a history of hypertension. Are you currently taking any medications for that, or for any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, yes. Hypertension… my daughter reminds me. I take… a little white pill, every morning, I think. And… another one, a little blue one. I just take them with my breakfast. She puts them out for me, you know? I don't remember the names, or what they're for, exactly. But I take them. That’s what’s important, isn’t it? Just taking the pills. It’s all a bit much, sometimes. Cancer… pills… I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see… It looks like you’re on Lisinopril for your blood pressure, and… Metoprolol, also for blood pressure. And no known allergies listed. Okay. Ms. Kelder, given your history of stomach cancer, even though it was treated successfully, your current symptoms – the queasiness, loss of appetite, weight loss, discomfort – are concerning. I want to do a thorough physical exam, and I also think we need to order some blood work and possibly repeat an endoscopy to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… another endoscopy? Those aren’t very pleasant, are they? But… yes, Doctor, if that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just… I want to know what's happening. And I want to feel better. I do get scared, sometimes, that it’s… come back. But… yes, let’s do whatever you think is necessary. Just… please be gentle. And explain everything to me, okay? I'm not good with… complicated things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Kelder. We will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain everything every step of the way. First, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Then we'll get the lab orders and discuss scheduling the endoscopy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. As long as you explain everything. And please… don't rush. My brain… it takes a little longer these days. I appreciate you being patient with me, Doctor. Let’s get it done, then. I just want to know what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale slowly. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise sounds normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your abdomen. I’m going to gently press on different areas. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a little. Right… about there. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, you know? It's not terrible, but I notice it when you press. And… maybe a little bit here too. Everything feels… tender, really. It's hard to explain. Please don't press too hard, Doctor. It's a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. I’m just trying to get a feel for things. There is some mild tenderness in both upper quadrants, as you pointed out. No masses or other concerning findings at this time. Blood pressure is 140/90, a little elevated. Okay. Ms. Kelder, given your history, symptoms, and the findings of this exam, I think it’s important to rule out any recurrence of your stomach cancer or other gastrointestinal issues. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a repeat endoscopy with biopsies. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear… biopsies? That means… they’re going to take pieces of… everything? Is it going to hurt? And… what if they find something? I… I don't know if I can handle another round of… all this. Can you explain it to me again, slowly? And… what if it is cancer again? What happens then? I’m getting very scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, it’s perfectly understandable that you’re scared. It’s okay to feel that way. Let's take things one step at a time. The endoscopy is a procedure where we use a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end to look inside your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum – the first part of your small intestine. The biopsies are very small tissue samples taken during the procedure to be examined under a microscope. They help us determine if there are any abnormal cells present. The biopsies themselves usually don't cause much pain, though you might feel a slight pressure or discomfort. We'll give you a sedative to help you relax and minimize any discomfort during the procedure. As for what if they find something… let's not jump to conclusions. We’ll cross that bridge if and when we come to it. If we do find something abnormal, we'll discuss all your options, including further testing and treatment. Treatment for stomach cancer has come a long way in recent years, and there are many different options available depending on the stage and type of cancer. We'll make a plan together, and I’ll be with you every step of the way. Does that help to clarify things a little?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s… a little better. Thank you, Doctor. It’s just… it’s all so overwhelming. I remember being so sick before… the chemotherapy, the tests… I don’t want to go through that again. So… the sedative will make me… sleepy? And they’ll just take tiny pieces of… inside? Will it bleed? And… how long does it take? And… Will I be able to eat afterwards? I get so worried about… everything. It's silly, I know. But my brain… it just keeps going and going.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Ms. Kelder. These are all very valid concerns, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious. Let me address each one. Yes, the sedative will make you relaxed and drowsy. You likely won’t remember much of the procedure itself. You will need someone to drive you home afterwards. The biopsies are very small, about the size of a grain of rice. They rarely cause significant bleeding. There is a small risk of minor bleeding, but we take precautions to minimize that risk. The procedure itself usually takes about 30-60 minutes. After the procedure, you’ll be monitored for a little while to make sure you’re recovering well. You will be able to eat after the procedure, but we’ll likely start with clear liquids and gradually reintroduce solid foods. You might have a sore throat for a day or two, but that usually resolves on its own. I’m going to write down all of these instructions for you, so you have them to refer to. And I'll make sure you understand everything before you leave. Does that help alleviate some of your worries?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. Having it written down… that does help. It makes it feel… less scary, somehow. So… who should come with me? My daughter, probably. She's good at… all this. And… do I need to do anything to prepare? Stop taking my pills? Fast overnight? I don't want to mess anything up. And… how long will it take to get the results? A few days? A week? I just… I want to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Your daughter is a good choice to come with you. Regarding preparation, you will need to stop taking your Lisinopril 24 hours before the procedure. You should also avoid eating or drinking anything after midnight the night before. You can continue taking any other medications you are on, unless I specifically tell you otherwise. We will schedule the endoscopy for next Tuesday, giving us time to get everything arranged. The results usually take about a week to come back. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I know waiting is difficult, but it’s important to allow the lab enough time to complete the analysis. Here is a number to call if you have any questions or concerns before your procedure. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Stop the Lisinopril… okay, I can remember that. My daughter will help me. And… a week for the results. That seems like a long time, but… I understand. No, I think that's… everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me, and you’ve explained everything so clearly. I appreciate it more than you know. I think… I think I can handle this. With my daughter, and with your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. I'm glad I could help. And you absolutely can handle this. Remember, we're a team. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. I’ll see you next Tuesday. Have a good afternoon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I think… I think I’ll be alright. .
