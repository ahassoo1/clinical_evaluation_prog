DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my back, you see. Lower back. Been botherin’ me for a bit now. Feels…old, I guess is the best way to put it. Not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, always there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your lower back. And you said “for a bit now”?
PATIENT: Yes, “for a bit.” Maybe… three, four months? It comes and goes, but it’s mostly there. I used to think it was just gettin’ old, you know? But it’s not gettin’ better, and sometimes it makes it hard to even bend over.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four months of a constant, dull ache, worsening to the point where bending over is difficult. Can you tell me a little more about what makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, standin’ for long periods is bad. Like, if I’m helpin’ with a fundraiser – I do a lot of that, you see – and I’m on my feet for hours… that’s when it really flares up. And liftin’… even nothin’ too heavy. Just bendin’ to pick somethin’ up off the floor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so prolonged standing and bending seem to be the biggest triggers. And does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Well… sittin’ helps. Lyin’ down, even better. But I can’t always sit or lie down, right? I gotta keep goin’. And… warm baths. A nice warm bath feels good for a little while, but it doesn't last long.
DOCTOR: Alright, sitting and lying down provide relief, warm baths help temporarily. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, no pain in my legs. Just right in my lower back. Sometimes it feels…stiff, like I can’t move it properly. Like an old rusty hinge, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no radiating pain, just stiffness in your lower back. And you mentioned helping with fundraisers. What kind of work do you usually do at those events?
PATIENT: Oh, all sorts! Talkin’ to people, collectin’ donations, movin’ boxes, settin’ up tables… the usual. Lots of walkin’ around, lots of standin’. I used to not mind it at all, but now… now it's somethin' else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fair amount of physical activity with the fundraising. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever had any back problems before – injuries, surgeries, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, never. This is… new. Always been pretty healthy, all my life. A few aches and pains, what you expect with gettin' older, but nothin' like this. No injuries, no surgeries… nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior back problems or surgeries. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications. Just a little something for my blood pressure, years ago, but I stopped takin' it. And no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, no known allergies. Now, before I do a quick exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… my mother, she had bad arthritis in her hands when she got older. Real bad. My father… he was healthy as a horse, lived to be 90. But I don’t know about back problems, specifically. No one ever talked about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with arthritis, father healthy. Thanks. Now, I’m just going to have you lie down on your back for me, if you don’t mind. I’m going to gently feel around your back to see where the pain is most prominent, and check your range of motion. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go right ahead. Just be gentle, okay? It’s… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vankampen, can you point to where you’re feeling the most pain right now?
PATIENT: Right… right about here. And when I bend forward… it’s all kinda sore, but especially right there. It feels… tight. Like a knot.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to palpation in the lumbar spine, with pain on forward flexion. I’m also noticing some limited range of motion. No radiating pain with leg raises, which is good. Your reflexes are normal, and I don’t detect any weakness in your legs. It sounds like we're dealing with a muscle strain, likely aggravated by your activities. Now, given your age and the fact you haven't had any previous back issues, I don’t think we need any imaging right away. However, I'd like to start with a course of physical therapy. It'll help strengthen your core and improve your flexibility. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… yes, that sounds good. I’d like that. As long as it’s not too painful, you know? I don't want to make it worse. And… is there anything I can take for the pain in the meantime? Just something to help me get through the day?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can discuss some over-the-counter pain relief options. I’d recommend starting with ibuprofen or naproxen – they're both anti-inflammatory and can help reduce the pain and swelling. Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle carefully, and don't exceed the maximum recommended dose. Acetaminophen is also an option, but it doesn't address the inflammation. I'm going to write you a prescription for a referral to physical therapy, and I’ll give you a handout with information about managing lower back pain. I also want you to try to avoid heavy lifting and prolonged standing as much as possible for the next few weeks. And listen to your body – if something hurts, stop doing it. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Avoiding the heavy liftin' and standin'… that'll be hard with the fundraisers, but I’ll try. And the pain pills… ibuprofen, you said? Okay, I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor Voytek. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I'm glad I could help. Here’s the referral information and the handout. If the pain doesn't improve after a few weeks of physical therapy, or if it gets worse, please schedule another appointment. Have a good day, and take care of your back.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
