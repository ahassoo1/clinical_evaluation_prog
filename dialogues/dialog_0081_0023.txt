DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Um... my chest hurts. Not all the time, but... yeah, it hurts sometimes. Like a ache, you know? It’s my… my breast.
DOCTOR: Your breast, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It feels… sore. Mostly on this side. <points to left chest> Not like a bad pain, just… uncomfortable. My wife, she told me to come see you. She got worried.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this discomfort been present, Mr. Bulaong?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a week? A little more than a week, I think. It started small, and then it got… noticeable. It’s not getting worse fast, but it’s not going away either. It feels… kind of heavy, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Heavy, you say. And does anything specific seem to bring it on or make it worse?
PATIENT: Not really. I work on roofs, you know? Lots of moving around. Sometimes after a long day, it feels… more sore. But even when I’m just sitting, it can bother me. I don't think anything special makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Roofing, yes. Physically demanding work. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel tired sometimes, but that’s from the work, I think. No fever. Nothing coming out… nothing like that. Just the ache in my chest. And the heavy feeling. My wife asked if it changed the shape, but I don't think so. I don't really check. <shrugs>
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any changes to the skin in that area?
PATIENT: Changes to the skin…? Hmm. I don’t know. Let me see… <looks down at his chest, pulls at his shirt a little> It looks the same to me. Maybe a little red sometimes, but that could just be from the sun, you know? I work outside all day. I don't really pay attention to my chest. Sorry.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Bulaong. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time. Just the usual colds and stuff. I work hard, eat okay, and try to stay healthy. No big problems. No diabetes, or… heart stuff, or anything like that. My wife keeps telling me to go to the doctor more, but… I just don't get sick much.
DOCTOR: And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. No hospital. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that’s it. It healed up fine. Everything else… just bumps and bruises from work. Nothing serious. <rubs his upper arm>
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… um… my mom, she had… something with her stomach, I think. She got sick when she was older. My dad, he was okay. Worked hard his whole life. No one really talked about sickness much, to be honest. I don’t know if anyone had… chest problems, or anything like that. Sorry, I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: It's alright. Let's talk about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I don't like it. I drink a little beer sometimes, with my friends after work, maybe a couple on the weekend. Nothing much. And no… nothing like that. I need to be strong for my job, you know? I can’t be messing with… that stuff.
DOCTOR: And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I just try to be careful with what I eat, you know? My wife makes good food, so that helps. Everything okay so far? What do you think it is? <looks hopeful>
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Bulaong, given your description, we need to rule out a few possibilities. This could be a benign issue, perhaps related to muscle strain from your work. However, given the location and the fact that you haven’t had this evaluated before, we need to be thorough. I'm going to perform a physical examination of your chest and surrounding areas. Then, I'll need to order some imaging tests, a mammogram and an ultrasound, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Mammogram and… ultrasound? <frowns> I don't know… those sound… serious. Is something wrong? Is it cancer? My wife is going to be so worried. I just thought it was a sore muscle! Is it really that bad? What do these tests… do? <looks anxious>
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, please don’t jump to conclusions. I said we need to rule out possibilities. A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast, and an ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image. They help us identify any abnormalities. It doesn’t automatically mean anything is wrong. It’s simply a precautionary measure, given your description and the fact you’ve never had this checked before. It's important to be proactive about your health. It’s far better to identify any potential issues early on. Now, if you’ll please remove your shirt, we can begin the examination. The tests are standard procedure. Do you have any questions about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: Remove my shirt…? In here? <blushes slightly> Okay… I guess. But… what if it is something bad? My wife… she's already stressed about everything. And I don't have insurance, so how much will all this cost? <looks worried> Is it going to be very expensive? And what if I need… surgery? <rubs his forehead> This is a lot.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, we’ll discuss costs after the tests are completed. Worrying about finances before we even know what’s happening isn’t productive. As for your wife, try to remain calm and reassure her that we are simply taking all necessary precautions. Now, are you ready to proceed with the examination, or would you prefer to leave without any further investigation?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I’ll do the examination. I don't want to worry my wife more by putting it off. But… please be quick. I hate hospitals. And… please just tell me what's going on, okay? No… hiding things. <looks up with a pleading expression> I just want to know. <begins to slowly remove his shirt>
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. Deep breaths, please. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little… right there. <points to the left side of his chest> And… a little bit here too. <points slightly higher> It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable when you push. Like a bruise, almost. Is that bad? <looks anxious>
DOCTOR: I see. And are there any noticeable lumps or changes to the skin in that area?
PATIENT: I… I don’t think so. It just feels… swollen, maybe? But I can’t really see anything. It’s hard to see myself, you know? My wife would notice if it changed, wouldn't she? She always notices everything. <looks worried>
DOCTOR: Any tenderness or lumps here?
PATIENT: Ouch! A little bit… yeah, a little bit sore there. Not bad, just… sensitive. Is that… is that a bad sign? <looks very concerned> My wife told me about lumps being bad… <rubs his arm>
DOCTOR: And here?
PATIENT: No, that side feels okay. Not sore, no lumps. Just normal, I think. Like it always is. <sighs with relief> That side feels better. This is scary, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on. <looks pleadingly>
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bulaong. Based on my initial examination, I'm noting tenderness in your left breast and some mild sensitivity in the left axillary lymph nodes. These findings warrant further investigation. I've already prepared the orders for a mammogram and ultrasound. I'll also order a complete blood count to get a broader picture of your health. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A complete blood count…? Is that… is that because you think it might be serious? <looks panicked> My wife… she's been so stressed lately. What if it's something bad? What are the chances it's nothing? And… how long will it take to get the results? I need to go back to work tomorrow… <looks desperate> I can’t afford to miss too many days. Is there anything I should be doing right now? <looks pleadingly>
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, please. We have only just completed a basic examination. Jumping to conclusions won’t help anyone. The blood count is a standard procedure to rule out infection or other underlying causes. As for your work, we will discuss a temporary leave of absence if necessary, once we have the results. At this stage, it is impossible to determine the cause of your symptoms without further investigation. I understand your concern, but I need you to remain calm and allow me to do my job. The radiology department is down the hall. They will schedule your mammogram and ultrasound immediately. After the tests, you can return to me, and we can discuss the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I understand. Radiology department… down the hall. <sighs heavily> Just… please, Doctor, let me know as soon as you have the results, okay? I just want this to be over. And… thank you. <stands up slowly, looking anxious> I’ll go… I’ll go get the tests done. <hesitates at the door> Thank you, Doctor. <exits slowly>
