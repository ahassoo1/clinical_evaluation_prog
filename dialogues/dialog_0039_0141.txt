DOCTOR: Hello Brendan, welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It's good to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it's this itching. Everywhere, really. It's been going on for… oh, let me think… about three weeks now, I’d say. Started on my arms, but now it's all over. It's not like a rash, just… itchy. Really bothersome, especially at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks of generalized itching… that sounds uncomfortable, especially disrupting your sleep. And it started on your arms and has spread from there. Is it constant itching, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty constant, to be honest. Some days are worse than others, but it’s always there, at least a little. Like a… a nagging feeling, you know? And it doesn't really seem to be connected to anything. I haven’t changed soaps, haven’t eaten anything new… I’m a pretty simple man, really. Oatmeal for breakfast, usually. Oatmeal and… well, whatever’s on sale at the store.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant itching for three weeks, no obvious triggers like new soaps or foods… Oatmeal is a good choice! It sounds like you’ve already done some good detective work trying to figure it out. Now, have you noticed any changes to your skin at all?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. No bumps, no redness, no blisters… it just feels itchy. Sometimes, after I scratch a lot – and I do scratch a lot, I admit – it gets a little… raw-looking, but that’s from the scratching, I think. Not like… a rash spreading or anything. Just red where I’ve been at it. I’m sorry, I know it sounds silly. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: No, not silly at all, Brendan. It’s frustrating because it’s hard to pinpoint, and that makes it harder to treat. And it's good you're noticing the redness is from scratching, that helps rule things out. Alright, let’s talk a little more broadly then. Have you had any other symptoms alongside the itching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Well, I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But I’m 53, Doctor! A man gets tired, you know? But… thinking about it, maybe a little more than usual. And… now that you mention it, my stomach has been a bit off. Nothing major, just… a little queasy sometimes. Not like throwing up or anything, just… unsettled. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Brendan. Increased fatigue and some stomach upset alongside the itching… okay. And has anything been happening with your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… that's a good question. It’s been a little… off, too. Not that I’m not hungry, exactly, but I don’t feel like eating as much as I used to. My oatmeal still goes down okay, but things like… meat, or anything heavier… not so much. I just haven’t been craving things like I normally do. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… everything feels a little muted, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, muted appetite alongside the fatigue and stomach upset… thank you for explaining so clearly. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… Well, yes, actually. A little. I’ve been… more regular, if you know what I mean. And… softer. I haven’t had any trouble getting to the bathroom, just… not as firm as usual. Sorry to be so blunt, Doctor. It’s not a pleasant topic. It's just been happening alongside everything else, and I figured it was worth mentioning.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Brendan. It's important information, and you're doing the right thing by telling me everything. Okay, so increased fatigue, muted appetite, stomach upset, and changes in bowel habits… Now, let's go back a bit. Have you travelled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, not recently. Last time I left the state was… oh, goodness… five years ago, maybe? To visit my daughter in Florida. But that was a long time ago. I mostly stay around here. Just the grocery store and… well, the occasional fishing trip down by the river. Nothing exotic, I assure you. I don’t do well with heat, to be honest. That’s why I stay put.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright. And do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve taken some over-the-counter allergy pills for hay fever in the spring, but that’s about it. And I had a tetanus shot a few years back at the clinic, but no problems with that either. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor, remember? Not much to react to, generally.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm starting to get a good picture. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, besides the occasional allergy pill?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid pills if I can. I've always believed in letting my body heal itself, you know? My wife used to make me all sorts of herbal teas… she knew everything about that sort of thing. But… well, she’s gone now. So, no, no medications. Just… oatmeal and hope, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. And I’m very sorry for your loss. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. Just… try not to poke too much, alright? I’m not a fan of poking.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath in for me?
PATIENT: Like this? I used to be a pretty good fisherman, you know. Lots of deep breathing waiting for a bite. It’s good practice, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear, Brendan. No abnormal sounds that I can detect. Now, let's take a look at your skin. I’m not seeing any obvious rashes or lesions. Your skin is a bit dry, but that’s not unusual, especially given the time of year. There's some mild redness in areas where you've been scratching, as you mentioned, but that's consistent with irritation. Overall, the exam isn't revealing anything obvious. Now, I’d like to order some blood work. It will give us a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work is good. Better to know, I suppose. Yes, alright. Whatever you think is necessary. Just… please let me know what’s going on. It’s a little unsettling, not knowing. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Brendan. And we will figure this out. I’m ordering a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a thyroid panel. These tests will help us assess your overall health, check your organ function, and rule out any thyroid issues. The nurse will draw the blood before you leave. It will take a few days to get the results back. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them and we can discuss them. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a hypoallergenic moisturizer to help with your dry skin and reduce the itching. And please, try not to scratch. I know it’s hard, but it can worsen the irritation. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. Hypoallergenic moisturizer… and no scratching. Easier said than done, but I’ll try. It’s good to know you’re on top of things. And I appreciate you taking the time to listen. My wife always said a good doctor is worth their weight in gold. I’ll see what the nurse says about the blood work. And I’ll wait for your call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. And your wife sounds like a very wise woman. We'll take things one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. If you have any questions at all before you leave, or after you get home, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s a printout with instructions for the blood work and information about hypoallergenic moisturizers. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much. I’ll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day now. .
