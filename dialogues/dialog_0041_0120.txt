DOCTOR: Hi Carmaleta, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, okay? I just... I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be easy. My sister, she had problems, a real mess. I don’t want that. I just want to know what I need to do so it doesn’t happen to me. Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's smart to be proactive, and wanting to avoid potential issues is a really good idea. We can definitely talk through things to help make the process as smooth as possible. Just to get a better picture, have you been trying for a while now, or are you just starting to think about it?
PATIENT: Trying? No, not really. Not yet. I just… lost my husband last year. It's still pretty recent. But I’m not getting any younger, and I don’t want to leave it too late, you know? I want a baby, and I want it now, if that makes sense. Before anything else goes wrong. Honestly, I just want to know if there's something I should be doing now, even before we start… trying. Is that clear? I don't want to be waiting around.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Carmaleta. And I’m very sorry for your loss. It's completely understandable that you’d want to be prepared and proactive after everything you’ve been through. So, even before actively trying, there are definitely things we can look at. It's good you're thinking about this now. We want to make sure everything's in good working order, so to speak. Let's start with your overall health. Do you have a regular doctor you see?
PATIENT: Ugh, doctors. Honestly, not really. I usually just… deal with things myself. I take some vitamins, I eat okay, I guess. I’m not… sick. Why does that matter now? I just want to know what I need to do for the baby thing. All this general health stuff seems like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It can feel like a lot of unnecessary steps when you just want a clear answer. But even if you feel healthy, certain things can impact fertility. Think of it like building a strong foundation for a house - you need to make sure everything is solid before you start building. It's less about whether you're “sick” and more about optimising things to give you the best chance of success. Since you don't have a regular doctor, maybe we can start with a basic check-up?
PATIENT: A check-up? Really? What will that even do? I’m perfectly fine. I just need some… advice. Or maybe a pill? My friend took a pill and she got pregnant right away. Can’t I just get something like that? I don’t have time for tests and… and all that. Honestly, I’m starting to think this was a waste of my afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your wanting a quick solution, and it’s good you’re hearing what’s worked for friends. However, what works for one person doesn’t always work for another, and taking medication without knowing the underlying cause of any potential difficulties isn’t ideal. The check-up would involve some basic blood tests to check your hormone levels and general health markers – things like iron levels, thyroid function, and vitamin D. It’s just to make sure everything's working as it should. Then, we can talk about your menstrual cycle – when it started, how regular it is, things like that. It doesn’t have to be a huge ordeal. It’s about gathering information so we can give you the best possible advice. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And I swear, if you start asking me about… about things I don’t even want to think about, I’m leaving. I just want a baby, not a lecture. What kind of blood tests? And how long will this take? Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. We'll keep it as streamlined as possible. The blood tests will be pretty standard: hormone levels to check your ovarian function, a complete blood count to check for any underlying health issues, and some vitamin levels. It should take about 15-20 minutes to draw the blood, and then the results usually take a few days to come back. We’ll also just quickly go over your medical history - any past surgeries, medications, allergies, and your family history. Nothing too intense, I promise. It's just to get a complete picture. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t ask me about my mother. We… don’t talk. And I don’t really know anything about my family history, to be honest. Just… get it over with. Where do I go for the blood tests? I have another appointment later, so I really can’t be here all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely no problem. We won’t delve into anything you’re not comfortable with. Here's a requisition for the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’re expecting you. It should take about 30 minutes total, including the wait. Once the results are back, we can schedule another appointment to discuss them and go over a plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes, that works. Now, can I go? I really need to be somewhere else. And don't call me unless you have something useful to tell me. I'm not interested in small talk. Honestly, this whole thing has been… a lot. .
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. And you can absolutely reach out if you have any questions in the meantime. Have a good afternoon, Carmaleta. And please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you need anything. .
