DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it’s this fever. Keeps comin’ back. It’s… annoying, to say the least. Been happenin’ for a couple weeks now, I reckon. Not all the time, but enough to bother a fella.
DOCTOR: A couple weeks, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, somethin’ like that. Hard to keep track exactly, you know? It’ll go away for a day or two, then boom, it’s back. Not super high, not like I'm delirious or anything, but enough to feel kinda wiped out. Mostly just tired and achy.
DOCTOR: "Wiped out," alright. And where are you feeling these aches, specifically?
PATIENT: Mostly in my back, you know, lower back. But sometimes it's in my legs, kinda like a dull throb. It’s hard to explain. Feels like I overdid it workin’ in the garden, even when I haven’t. I’m a chiropractor, so I should know what it is, but… when it's you it’s different, right?
DOCTOR: A chiropractor, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, been one for forty years. Sounds silly, doesn't it? A back doctor with a bad back. Been treatin' folks since… well, since a long time. But this fever thing… that's what's got me worried. It ain't muscle pain, I can tell ya that much. It's… different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Forty years is a long time. And you're right, it’s always different when it's you. Let’s get some more details. Have you checked your temperature when it spikes?
PATIENT: I have, doc. Took it a couple times. Highest it got was 101, maybe 101.5. Not terrible, but enough to make me feel sluggish. My wife usually does the checkin’, to be honest. I’m not good with all those gadgets. She's the organized one.
DOCTOR: 101 to 101.5. Okay. And besides the fever and aches, any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… I've been a little sweaty at night, but I live in Puerto Rico, it's always humid. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but like I said, the fever knocks me out. No cough, no sniffles, no nothin' like that. Just… feelin' off. And this fever keeps comin' back, which is the main problem. It’s disruptin’ my sleep, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it... my wife says I haven’t been eatin’ as much. I usually have a good appetite, but lately… not so much. And yeah, I reckon I’ve lost a few pounds, but I hadn't really noticed it 'til she said somethin'. She keeps a close eye on me, bless her heart. She worries.
DOCTOR: Alright, decreased appetite and some weight loss. Have you noticed any other changes – any rashes, any swelling in your legs or feet, anything at all out of the ordinary?
PATIENT: No rashes, no swellin’. Everything else seems… normal. I mean, I’m an old man, things ache all over sometimes, right? But this fever... It just won’t go away. I'm tellin' ya, doc, it's been a few weeks now and it keeps comin' back. It's frustratin'. Is there anything serious it could be? I’m probably just worryin’ too much.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Brege, it is good you're getting it checked out. Recurring fevers can be a sign of several things. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and take a look at your lymph nodes. It's standard procedure. Then we'll decide if any lab work is needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, doc. I’m just wantin’ to figure out what’s goin’ on. I’m a practical man, so just tell me what you need to do. Let's get it over with. I got appointments later this afternoon, so if we can hurry, I’d appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's get started. Please have a seat on the table. I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please try to breathe deeply and evenly for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Now I'm going to check your lymph nodes. Neck nodes are slightly palpable, but not significantly enlarged or tender. Axillary and inguinal nodes are not palpable. Alright, everything seems relatively normal so far. However, given the recurring fever and weight loss, I think we should run some basic blood work. It’ll help rule out some possibilities. I'm thinking a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and maybe a sedimentation rate to check for inflammation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. Blood work's probably a good idea. I don't like needles, but I'll manage. I just want to know what I'm dealin' with. Inflammation, you say? That doesn’t sound good. How long will it take to get the results? I got patients waitin', you know. Not tryin' to rush ya, but… time is money.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Brege. We'll get this done as quickly as possible. The lab usually takes about 24 to 48 hours to get the results back. We can call you as soon as they're available. Inflammation can be caused by a lot of things, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. The blood work will help us narrow down the possibilities. I'm ordering the CBC, metabolic panel, and ESR now. The nurse will come in to draw the blood shortly. In the meantime, I'm going to document everything we've discussed. Do you have any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Nothing at all. My wife always checks, though, she's good about that. Just… get the blood work done, doc. I appreciate ya takin’ the time, even if it means a wait. I just want to feel normal again. This fever's been a real nuisance. .
