DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Courtnye is fine. Um, well, it’s my… friend. He’s been bruising really easily lately, and he's on blood thinners. That's why I'm here. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Courtnye. It is worrying when someone on blood thinners starts bruising easily. Let's gather some more information. First, could you tell me a little bit about your friend?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. His name is Ben. He’s… 72. Been on the blood thinners for, oh, maybe five years now? After a little heart thing. He usually doesn't have problems, but the last couple of weeks... it's been different. He bumped his arm just getting out of a chair and ended up with a bruise the size of my hand. It's just… a lot more than usual.
DOCTOR: Five years on blood thinners after a cardiac event, that's helpful to know. And you’ve noticed a significant increase in bruising recently – larger bruises from minor trauma. Could you describe the bruises themselves?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… purple-ish, dark, like you'd expect, I guess. And they don’t seem to be going away as quickly as they used to. Usually a bump will be a little color and fade in a week, but these… these are hanging around for almost two weeks now. He hasn’t changed anything, no new medications or anything, as far as I know. He's a pretty simple guy.
DOCTOR: Purple-ish, darker than usual, and slower to resolve… that’s important information. And you say he hasn't started any new medications or supplements recently?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing new. He takes his heart meds, the blood thinner - I think it's… Warfarin? - and a little something for his water retention. That's it. He's not one for trying new things, honestly. He worries a lot about side effects. He gets everything from the same pharmacy too, so they would have caught anything new.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Knowing he consistently uses the same pharmacy is very helpful. Let’s talk about his medical history a bit more broadly. Besides the cardiac event that led to starting Warfarin, does he have any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. He has a little bit of high blood pressure, but it’s usually well-controlled with medication. And his knees… his knees are just bad. Arthritis, really bad arthritis. He complains about them all the time. Oh! And he had his gallbladder out years ago, but that’s it, I think. Nothing else major that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with medication, and significant arthritis in his knees… alright. Has he had any recent falls or injuries, aside from the bumping his arm that you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, no falls. He’s pretty careful, actually. He walks with a cane sometimes, because of the knees, but he’s not clumsy or anything. The arm bump was just… a regular bump, like he gets sometimes. It just bruised up way worse this time. It's just... strange. It worries me, because, you know, blood thinners and all.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Courtnye. It’s always best to investigate unexplained bruising in someone on Warfarin. Let’s move onto his family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any bleeding disorders or unusual bruising tendencies that run in his family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… that’s a tough one. His side of the family isn't big on talking about health stuff. I know his grandpa had some sort of stomach problem, but I don't know what. And his mom… she had really thin skin, always bruised easily, but everyone just said it was part of getting old. Nothing like a bleeding disorder or anything. I really don't know much beyond that, sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Courtnye. It’s helpful to know what you don’t know as well. Now, let's talk about his lifestyle. Does he drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. He likes his beer. Not a lot, but he has a couple of beers most evenings. It's his little thing. And he smokes... he tries not to, but he still has a few cigarettes a day. He’s been trying to quit for years, but… well, you know how it is. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does matter, Courtnye. Both alcohol and smoking can interact with Warfarin and potentially contribute to increased bruising. Finally, let's briefly discuss his diet. Does he eat a consistent diet rich in Vitamin K-containing foods?
PATIENT: Vitamin K… Oh, goodness. I have no idea. He's a pretty simple eater. Lots of potatoes, some meat, a bit of vegetables... not a lot of fancy stuff. I wouldn’t say he avoids anything, but he's not a health food nut, if that makes sense. He likes a good roast dinner, that’s for sure. He gets take-out sometimes, too. I really don't pay attention to what he eats, sorry. Is that important? It all sounds so complicated!
DOCTOR: It is complicated, Courtnye, and you shouldn’t feel bad about not knowing the specifics of his diet. Vitamin K intake can impact Warfarin’s effectiveness, but we can assess that further. Okay, let's move on to a physical exam. I'd like to take a look at the bruise on his arm, as well as check his overall condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. I brought him with me, he's just in the waiting room. He's probably getting impatient. I’m just worried, you know? It's been unsettling seeing him bruise so easily. I just want to make sure everything is okay. Let's get to it, then.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I completely understand your concern, Courtnye. Let me go get Ben and we'll begin the examination. Please follow me to examination room two. Now, Ben, Courtnye tells me you’ve been experiencing some increased bruising recently. Let’s start by taking a look at your arm. Could you please extend it for me?
