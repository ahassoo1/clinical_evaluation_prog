DOCTOR: Alright, Mikeisha, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Um… it is my sinuses, I think. They… they bother me. A lot of pressure, you know? It's been… a while now. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. Just… feels long.
DOCTOR: Hmm, sinus pressure. Okay. And you said it's been going on for a while... do you remember if anything started it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. Nothing that I recall. Maybe… the weather? It has been very hot, yes? Or… maybe work? But everything at work is… loud. Always loud. I work with the drills, you see. It’s hard to say what made it start. Everything just… feels stuffy.
DOCTOR: Okay, loud noises at work, hot weather… and stuffiness. Is it just stuffiness, or do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my head hurts. Not a bad hurt, but… a pressure, like with the sinuses. And… I think I cough a little? But everyone coughs, yes? It’s… difficult to breathe through my nose, mostly. And… sometimes I feel very tired. But I work long hours, so… maybe that is just from that.
DOCTOR: Right, so headache with pressure, some coughing, nasal congestion, and fatigue. Okay. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches with this?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t… checked, really. Chills? No, it is very hot. Too hot for chills. And… body aches? Sometimes. But again, work is very hard. Lifting, bending… everything aches a little. I am not sure if it is… the sickness, or the job.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you tried anything to relieve the symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… just… water. I drink a lot of water. And… sometimes I try to rest. But… with the job… it is hard. I don't really take… medicine. Not usually. I don't know… what to take, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medication. Okay. Now, I'm going to do a quick exam, just to listen to your lungs and take a look at your sinuses. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… good. If you think it will help, please do. I trust your judgement. Just… tell me if it will be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. It shouldn't be. Please, have a seat here. I’m going to listen to your lungs first. Just breathe normally. Okay, lungs sound…clear. A little bit of distant wheezing, but nothing concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to palpate your sinuses. Just tell me if you feel any pain when I press here. Anything here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. There. That… hurts a little. And… here too. Not a bad pain, but… definitely feels tender. Everything else… feels okay. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness over the frontal and right maxillary sinuses. Alright. It sounds like you likely have some sinusitis, possibly a sinus infection. However, since it’s been going on for a while and you haven’t had a fever, we’ll want to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to get a chest x-ray just to be safe, rule out anything else. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An x-ray… yes, I think. If you believe it is best, Doctor. I… I don't understand what it will show, exactly. But… I trust you. Is it… dangerous? The x-ray, I mean.
DOCTOR: No, an x-ray is not dangerous, Mikeisha. It uses a very small amount of radiation, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. It will allow us to see if there is anything else going on in your lungs, and confirm whether it's just a sinus infection. I’ll write you a referral for one at the imaging center down the street. They take walk-ins, so you shouldn't have a long wait. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: An imaging center… no, I don’t. Walk-ins… that is good. I work, you see. Difficult to schedule things. And… is there anything I should do before the x-ray? Like… no metal? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. Yes, it's best to avoid wearing any jewelry or anything with metal on it when you go for the x-ray. And, if you've recently had any contrast dye for another medical test, you'll want to let the technician know. Otherwise, just wear comfortable clothes. I’m going to write this referral now. While I do that, I'll also give you some recommendations for symptom relief. It’s important to stay hydrated, as you've been doing. And, over-the-counter decongestants and pain relievers like ibuprofen can help with the pressure and discomfort. Would you like me to write those down for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Write it down. My memory… it is not so good. Ibuprofen… that is the red box, yes? And decongestants… I don’t know which one to choose. So many choices. Thank you for writing it down.
DOCTOR: Here you are. Ibuprofen, yes, it usually comes in a red box. As for the decongestant, I've written down pseudoephedrine. You’ll need to ask the pharmacist for it, as it’s kept behind the counter. Make sure to follow the dosage instructions on the label. In the meantime, once we have the results of the x-ray, we can discuss further treatment options. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if you develop a fever, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Pseudoephedrine… okay. I will remember that. And… a week, if it doesn’t get better. Yes, I can do that. No fever… I will check. Um… I think that is all, Doctor. Thank you very much for your help. You have been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. We’ll get this sorted out. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
