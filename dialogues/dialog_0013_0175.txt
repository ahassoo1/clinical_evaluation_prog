DOCTOR: Hi Michae, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Honestly, it's just…pain. It's been bothering me for a bit now, and it's getting harder to ignore.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain. That's a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It's mostly in my lower back, right here. It's not like a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, you know? And it kinda…radiates down my leg sometimes. Not all the way, just the back of my leg.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache in the lower back radiating down the leg. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started… maybe a couple of weeks ago? It wasn't too bad at first, just a little stiffness after I’d been sitting for a long time. But it’s gotten worse each day, I think. It’s really bothering me now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started gradually a couple of weeks ago and has been worsening. Does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Definitely bending over. That really gets it. And… walking for too long, too. I like to take walks in the morning, but I can’t do as much anymore. It feels like it's putting pressure on something.
DOCTOR: And what about things that make it better?
PATIENT: Sitting down actually helps, believe it or not. Or… lying down flat. And when my wife rubs it, that feels good for a little while, but it doesn't last. I’ve also been trying to use a heating pad, and that takes the edge off some, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sitting and lying down help, and a heating pad provides some relief. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm, you know… Now that you mention it, yeah. My left foot feels a little numb sometimes, especially in the evening. Not all the time, and it’s not bad numbness, just…like it’s falling asleep. And maybe a little weaker, too, when I try to lift it. But I wasn’t sure if that was just me getting older, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, some numbness and weakness in the left foot, particularly in the evenings. Okay. Have you had any changes in your bowel or bladder habits lately?
PATIENT: Changes in…what now? You mean…like going to the bathroom? I… I don't think so. Everything seems pretty normal there, if you don't mind me saying. I haven't noticed anything different. Is that… is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was asking, thank you for being open. Sometimes back pain can be related to those things, so it's important to check. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a bit, a few years back, but the doctor said I got it under control with diet and exercise. And… oh! I had a really bad bout of sciatica when I was younger, maybe in my thirties. I don't remember all the details, but I was laid up for a week. That was a long time ago, though. Other than that, I think I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Okay, so history of high blood pressure that's currently controlled with diet and exercise, and a previous episode of sciatica. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Nothing like that. Just… the usual stuff when I was a kid, like tonsils out, but nothing major as an adult. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a baby aspirin every day, the doctor told me to start taking it a while ago for my heart. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen when the pain gets really bad, but not regularly. And my wife gives me glucosamine for my joints, she thinks it helps, but honestly, I'm not sure. That’s about it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so baby aspirin daily, ibuprofen as needed, and glucosamine. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, that I can remember. No allergies to any medicines, not that I know of. Nope, nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, just a couple more quick questions before we do a quick physical exam. Are there any other symptoms you've been experiencing that we haven't talked about yet?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, I've been a little more tired lately, now that you mention it. Just kinda run down, you know? But I figured that was just from being older. And my appetite hasn’t been great, but again, I didn't really think much of it. Nothing major, just small things. I guess that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little more tired and decreased appetite. Thank you, Michae. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, I’m just going to feel along your spine and lower back. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Okay, bending forward… and now sideways… and backward. And finally, I'm going to lift your leg straight up. Let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg with this. Okay, I’m noting some tenderness along your lumbar spine, particularly on the left side. Your range of motion is somewhat limited, especially with bending forward. And you do experience some pain radiating down your left leg with the straight leg raise test. Your reflexes appear normal, and your strength is 5/5 in both legs, though there's some mild weakness with dorsiflexion of your left foot. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little tender there. Yeah, that's where it really hurts. And, yeah, lifting my leg does it too, like you said. It's not terrible pain, just that radiating ache. I guess that's why you did that test? It all makes sense, I suppose. What do you think it is, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, based on the history and the physical exam, it’s highly likely you have a lumbar radiculopathy, which essentially means a pinched nerve in your lower back, likely caused by some compression of the nerve roots. The radiating pain down your leg, the numbness in your foot, and the weakness with dorsiflexion all support that diagnosis. It could be caused by a herniated disc, spinal stenosis – narrowing of the spinal canal – or other degenerative changes in the spine. Now, before we jump to conclusions, I’d like to order some imaging – an MRI of your lower back – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on and confirm the diagnosis. We also want to rule out other potential causes of your pain. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A pinched nerve? That sounds…serious. A herniated disc? Oh dear. Imaging… an MRI. Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. If that’s what it takes to figure out what’s wrong, then yes, let’s do the MRI. I just want to know what’s causing this pain, and how to fix it. Will it hurt? Is it expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. An MRI is a non-invasive test, so it doesn’t involve any pain. You'll lie still on a table, and a strong magnet creates detailed images of your spine. It’s a bit loud, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Regarding the cost, I realize you mentioned you don’t have insurance. Let me see what options are available. Our clinic has some financial assistance programs, and we can also explore options for a lower-cost MRI facility. I’ll have my staff look into that for you, and they’ll contact you with the details. In the meantime, while we’re waiting for the MRI results, we can start some conservative treatment to help manage your pain. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as you’ve already been taking, and continue with the heating pad. We can also discuss some gentle stretching exercises and physical therapy to help strengthen your back muscles and improve your flexibility. Would you be interested in a referral to a physical therapist?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know. Good. That's one less thing to worry about. And you can help with the cost? That would be a lifesaver, truly. Stretching… physical therapy… yes, that sounds good. I'm willing to try anything, really. I just want to be able to walk without hurting. A referral to a physical therapist… yes, please. That sounds like a good idea. Anything to help get me back on my feet. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. My staff will contact you shortly to schedule the MRI and discuss financial assistance options. I’ll also write you a referral for a physical therapist – I recommend [Physical Therapist's Name/Clinic Name], they’re excellent. They’ll be able to develop a personalized exercise program to help strengthen your back and alleviate your pain. I’m also going to give you a handout with some gentle stretching exercises you can start doing at home today. Remember to listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain. We’ll review the MRI results once they’re available and discuss further treatment options at that time. It's possible we can manage this with conservative treatment, but if your pain doesn’t improve, we may need to consider other options like injections or, in rare cases, surgery. But let's focus on getting you feeling better with the initial steps first. Do you have any questions for me right now before we finish?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. [Physical Therapist's Name/Clinic Name], good. I’ll look them up. And yes, I think I understand. Start with the exercises, see how it goes… wait for the MRI. Hmm… well, how long will it take to get the MRI results? And… is there anything I shouldn't be doing right now? Like, should I avoid lifting anything? Or certain movements? I don’t want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Michae. The MRI results typically take 2-3 business days to come back once the scan is completed. My staff will contact you as soon as they’re available. Regarding what to avoid, it’s a good idea to avoid any activities that significantly aggravate your pain. That means lifting anything heavy, bending over repeatedly, and twisting motions. Try to maintain good posture when sitting and standing, and avoid prolonged sitting or standing in one position. Gentle walking is okay, as long as it doesn’t cause pain. It’s also important to pay attention to your body and rest when you need to. If you feel any sharp or radiating pain, stop the activity immediately. I'm also going to give you a handout detailing "red flags" – symptoms that warrant immediate medical attention, such as sudden weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or severe, unrelenting pain. If you experience any of these symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you feel comfortable with those instructions?
PATIENT: 2-3 business days… okay, I can wait. Avoid heavy lifting, bending… listen to my body. And the red flags… yes, very important. Weakness, loss of control… yes. Thank you for writing that down. Yes, I feel much better now. I think I understand everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I really appreciate your patience and kindness. I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you again. I'll wait for the staff to call about the MRI. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Michae. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your MRI. And remember, listen to your body and take it easy. We’ll get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better soon. Have a good day, and I’ll see you when we have the MRI results.
