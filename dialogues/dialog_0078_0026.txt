DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. My name is Dr. Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Solero, you said? Hmm. Well, it’s this tiredness, you see. Just… exhausting. It comes and goes, but when it’s here, I can barely lift a thing. My husband, Tenzin, says I’ve been sleeping more, but it doesn’t help. And something about… numbers being off? The nurse mentioned it. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ardelle. It sounds very frustrating to be dealing with this exhaustion, even with increased sleep. And yes, the nurse did mention some slightly abnormal lab results. We’ll definitely get to the bottom of both of these things. To start, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just a little tiring, Doctor. It’s… debilitating. Like all the strength has just… leaked out of me. It started a few months ago, I think. Maybe spring? Time all blurs together, you know. It’s worse after I’ve been… doing things. Even just a bit of gardening. Though, I haven’t been doing much of that lately, not with this. And it doesn’t go away with rest. It just… lingers. A heavy feeling, mostly in my arms and legs.
DOCTOR: I understand. A debilitating fatigue that worsens with activity and doesn’t improve with rest is certainly concerning. And you mentioned it started a few months ago, around springtime. You also feel this heaviness in your arms and legs. Is this heaviness constant, or does it come and go with the fatigue?
PATIENT: It comes and goes with the tiredness, mostly. When I'm really tired, they feel like lead weights. Not painful, exactly, just… heavy. And weak. Like they won't cooperate. Though sometimes, even when I haven't done anything, they just feel… sluggish. It's hard to explain. My husband says I complain about them a lot, but he doesn't understand. He's always been strong as an ox, that one. Never had a problem with… well, with feeling anything, really.
DOCTOR: That’s a very helpful description, Ardelle. It sounds like the heaviness and weakness in your arms and legs are directly related to the fatigue. And it's understandable that it's difficult to explain if your husband hasn't experienced it himself. Now, beyond the fatigue and heaviness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Well, I've been a bit more… clumsy, I suppose. Dropped a few things, bumped into furniture. Nothing major. And my muscles ache sometimes, a dull sort of ache, not sharp. It’s mostly after I’ve been sitting for a long time, and then I get up. Oh, and I’ve been feeling a bit… breathless lately. Not when I'm doing anything, just… sometimes. It's probably just my age, though. Everything starts to go when you get old, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased clumsiness, muscle aches, particularly after sitting, and some breathlessness. It’s good you’re sharing all of this with me, Ardelle. And while some changes can be a normal part of aging, it's important to investigate these symptoms to make sure there isn't something else going on. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long list, probably. I've lived a long life, you know. Let me see… I had a touch of arthritis in my knees years ago, but it’s mostly managed with… well, with ignoring it, mostly. And my blood pressure was a little high at one point, but the doctor put me on a pill for that. I stopped taking it a while back, though. Didn't seem to be doing much good. And… oh, yes! I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was a terrible business. But other than that… I can’t really recall anything major. I don't pay much attention to doctors, honestly. They always want to poke and prod.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ardelle. So, arthritis in the knees, a history of high blood pressure – and you stopped taking medication for that – and gallbladder removal. It’s helpful to know about these things. And, just to clarify, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little bit of ibuprofen now and then for the knees, when they're acting up. And sometimes, Tenzin gives me some sort of ginger tea when I’m feeling unwell. He swears by it. But that’s it. I don’t like taking pills, as I said. They always make me feel… funny. And I don’t trust those herbal remedies. Too many strange ingredients, if you ask me. My mother used to make teas, but I never paid much attention to what she put in them. Just tasted like leaves, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen as needed for your knees and occasional ginger tea from Tenzin. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don’t think so. Never really had a problem with allergies. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose in the spring, but that’s just the pollen, I suppose. And I can’t stand shellfish, but that’s just because I don’t like the taste. Not an allergy, just… a strong dislike. Tenzin loves it, though. He can eat a whole plate of those little creatures. Disgusting, if you ask me. But no, no real allergies. I’m quite hardy, you know. Lived a long life without much trouble.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ardelle. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a bit of a muddle, honestly. My parents… well, they both lived to a good age, I think. My mother had arthritis, like me. And my father… he had a weak heart, I believe. He was always very quiet, didn't do much. I think he had some trouble breathing towards the end. But other than that… I don't really know much about it. We didn't talk about these things much in my family. Just… didn't bother with it. Everyone just carried on, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of arthritis in your mother and a possible heart condition in your father. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. My husband used to smoke a little when he was younger, but he gave it up years ago. Said it wasn't good for him. And he was right, of course. Always a sensible man, that one. No, no smoking in our family. Always believed in fresh air and good food. Though, I haven’t been getting much exercise lately, with this tiredness. It’s hard to do anything, you know?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ardelle. No history of smoking is wonderful. And I understand that it’s difficult to exercise when you’re feeling fatigued. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit now and then. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, on special occasions. Nothing more. Tenzin likes a bit of beer sometimes, too. But we don’t really drink much. Never been much of a drinking family. It always seemed a bit… frivolous, if you ask me. And it doesn't do you any good, of course. Best to stick to water, really. Though a little bit of wine now and then isn't going to hurt, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a small amount of alcohol occasionally. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, I just want to ask one last question about your social history. Do you live alone, or do you have support at home?
PATIENT: Oh, I live with my husband, Tenzin. We've been married for… goodness, I don't even know how many years now! A long time, anyway. He's a good man, very helpful. He does most of the cooking now, since I haven't been feeling up to it. And he takes care of the garden, which is good. I don't think I could manage it on my own, not with this tiredness. He's always been very… practical, you know? Takes care of everything. I'm lucky to have him.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ardelle. It sounds like you have excellent support at home with Tenzin. That’s very important. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. This will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a few other basic things. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. I don't much like doctors poking and prodding, but I suppose it's necessary. Just… be gentle, alright? And don't take too long. I get cold easily, you know. And I don't like having my back touched. Makes me nervous. But do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you to be… efficient.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ardelle. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. I will definitely respect your wishes and avoid touching your back. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Your heart sounds regular, but a bit quiet. And I hear some slight crackling in your lungs. It’s not alarming, but it's something we need to investigate further. Your blood pressure is a little low, 100/60. And your pulse is 72, a little on the slower side. Your reflexes are slightly diminished in your arms and legs. And there’s some mild weakness in your grip strength. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything appears normal overall, but the diminished reflexes, weakness, and low blood pressure are concerning, especially given your fatigue and the crackling in your lungs. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Crackling in my lungs… blood tests… X-rays… It all sounds rather serious. But alright, Doctor, if you think it’s necessary. Do what you need to do. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long, alright? And tell me what it all means when you get the results. I don’t want to be left in the dark, wondering what’s wrong with me. And make sure Tenzin can come with me to the next appointment. He'll want to know what's going on, too. He's always been good at understanding these things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ardelle. It's good we're being thorough to figure out what's going on. The tests will help us rule out potential causes for your symptoms. I will explain everything clearly when the results come back. And of course, Tenzin is welcome to join you at any appointment. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology department. The nurse will give you instructions on how to schedule the chest X-ray. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible, and stay hydrated. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not at the moment, anyway. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? I don't like being poked and prodded, and I don't like waiting around. And please, explain everything clearly when you get the results. I don’t want any medical jargon, alright? Just… plain English. And make sure Tenzin can come with me. He'll ask all the important questions. I always forget what to ask. But… thank you, Doctor. For listening, at least. I just want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ardelle. It’s absolutely not too much to ask. And I completely understand your desire to feel like yourself again. That’s what we’re here for. I will do my best to be as efficient as possible. And I promise to explain everything in plain English, without any medical jargon. I'll also make sure Tenzin is included in the discussion. The nurse will come in shortly to review the lab orders and schedule your X-ray. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Thank you for coming in today, Ardelle. And please, take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
