DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started, oh, maybe a couple of weeks ago? I can't quite pinpoint it.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, alright. And is it all over, or just in certain spots?
PATIENT: Mostly on my arms and my back. It’s hard to reach, so my daughter had to help me look. It’s not… a rash, exactly. Just red and bumpy and itchy. It gets worse at night, which makes it hard to sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: Worse at night, yes. That's… helpful information. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I haven’t started using any new soaps or lotions, nothing like that. I did change laundry detergents, maybe a month or so ago? But I thought I got a nice, gentle kind. It's… hypoallergenic, I think. I don't really pay attention to all that stuff, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hypoallergenic… alright. And how is your overall health otherwise?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, for seventy, not bad! A little arthritis in my knees, but who doesn’t at this age? And my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but I try to watch my salt. I get tired easily, but I just figured that's getting older. I haven't been to the doctor in a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think... I take lisinopril, I think it's called, for the blood pressure. Just a small dose, the doctor prescribed it a few years back. And sometimes, when my knees are really acting up, I take ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter stuff, you know? Nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright, lisinopril and ibuprofen as needed. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I know of! I used to be allergic to penicillin when I was a little girl, but I haven't had that problem in… oh, goodness, decades. Nothing else comes to mind, no. I'm pretty good with most things. It’s just this itchiness that’s got me worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a look at your skin. If you don’t mind, I'm going to need to examine your arms and back. Please, go ahead and turn around. We’ll start with your back.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. It's a little embarrassing, but if it'll help… I’m not as flexible as I used to be!
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Cassimatis. No need to rush. Now, if you could just face forward... Hm. There is some mild erythema and excoriation, consistent with scratching. No wheals or obvious lesions. Arms are similar – redness and some evidence of scratching. It doesn’t appear to be anything… dramatic.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that doesn’t sound good, does it? Ex-what-now? I’m sorry, I don’t always understand all the doctor-talk. Is it something serious? It just feels so uncomfortable, and I’m afraid it’s going to get worse. I haven't been sleeping well at all.
DOCTOR: Excoriation simply means the skin is irritated from scratching. It's not… serious, per se. It’s more… annoying. It's likely a form of dermatitis – inflammation of the skin. Given your history, and the timing with the laundry detergent change, that’s my initial thought. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a basic allergy panel and a complete blood count. Just to be thorough. Also, I want you to discontinue use of the new detergent immediately. Go back to whatever you were using previously.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That makes a little more sense. Laundry detergent, huh? I guess that could be it. I just thought hypoallergenic meant… well, I don't know what I thought it meant. Discontinue, you say? That’s easy enough. I can do that. And the… allergy panel and blood count… is that going to cost a lot? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, lab tests do have a cost. I’ll have the receptionist provide you with a price list. It’s difficult to give you an exact figure without knowing the specific panels, but we can discuss options if the cost is prohibitive. We can prioritize the allergy panel first, as that seems the most likely culprit. In the meantime, I recommend an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream, 1% concentration, to apply to the affected areas twice daily. And try to avoid scratching, even though I know that’s easier said than done. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Hydrocortisone cream… yes, I think I’ve used that before. For bug bites, maybe? Twice a day… okay, I can remember that. No, I don't think I have any questions about that. Just… how long before it gets better? I really need to sleep, Doctor. This itching is driving me crazy. And… is this something I’ll have to deal with forever?
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say definitively. If it is the detergent, and you discontinue use and use the hydrocortisone cream, you should see some improvement within a week or so. If it doesn’t improve, or if it gets worse, we’ll need to investigate further. As for whether you’ll have to deal with it forever… some people are simply more prone to skin sensitivities. It’s possible you may need to be more careful with products you use in the future. I’ll order the lab tests, and the receptionist will schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. If you have any concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me, even if it’s just… silly itching. And I’ll talk to the receptionist about the prices and the appointment. I just hope I can get some sleep tonight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Try the hydrocortisone cream, and avoid scratching. The receptionist will assist you with the rest. Have a good day.
