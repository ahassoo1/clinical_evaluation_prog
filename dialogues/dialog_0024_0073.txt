DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I don’t have a lot of time for chit-chat. It’s my stomach. Just… constantly running to the bathroom. It's been awful, and nothing seems to help. I've tried… stuff. You know, things people take. It just keeps going.
DOCTOR: "Stuff," you say. Right. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don't remember the names. Over-the-counter things. Pink stuff, white stuff, little pills… I don’t do details, okay? My husband always handled all that. It's just… I keep getting sicker, and I need it to stop. It's been weeks. I don’t want to give you a list of every single thing I’ve tried, it's a waste of time.
DOCTOR: A “waste of time,” you say. Very well. When did this start, approximately?
PATIENT: Around… well, it feels like a month, maybe a little more? Right after the memorial, I think. Everything’s been a blur since then, to be honest. I just… started feeling off, and then it was just… this. Look, is there anything you can give me to make it stop? Because I’m really not in the mood to play twenty questions.
DOCTOR: A memorial. For whom, Ms. Woodring?
PATIENT: My husband. He… passed away a couple of months ago. It’s not important, really. I just… the stress, I guess. But I need something for this now. I have things to do, people to see… well, had things to do. This is interfering with everything.
DOCTOR: I see here you have private insurance. That's… helpful. Now, aside from the diarrhea—and let's be precise with our terminology, Ms. Woodring—have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Ugh, "terminology?" Seriously? Look, I'm tired, and frankly, I'm a little insulted. It's just… my stomach. I'm weak, I guess. And thirsty. And I’ve lost some weight. I’m not an idiot, doc. I know what’s happening. Is this going to take all day? I need to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: Weight loss is concerning. Can you estimate how much weight you’ve lost?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't know... ten, maybe fifteen pounds? It’s hard to say. Clothes are looser. I haven't really been eating much. Everything just goes right through me. I don’t have the energy to cook, frankly. This isn't rocket science, doc. I'm sick. Can you just give me something? A stronger pill, a shot, something? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Right. And any fever?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I haven’t felt hot or anything. Just… weak, and constantly running to the bathroom. I’m telling you, it’s exhausting. Honestly, doc, I'm starting to feel like you're not listening to me. I've explained this. Is there anything you can do, or should I just go somewhere else? I really need help.
DOCTOR: Let's not be hasty. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Really? Now you’re asking that? Look, I’m not going to… I mean, no. No blood. I would know if there was blood. This is… ridiculous. Just give me something to stop it, please. I've got a life to get back to, or had a life, before this started. I don't understand why this is so complicated.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Specifically, I need to palpate your abdomen. Please lie down on the table.
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry. I really don’t have all day. And be gentle, okay? I'm already feeling awful.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, Ms. Woodring. I am going to listen to your abdomen, and then gently press on it. Tell me if you experience any pain. Normal bowel sounds… somewhat hyperactive. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little… yeah, a little tender there. Not awful, but… uncomfortable. Honestly, everything hurts right now, doc. It’s hard to pinpoint anything specific. Just… stop pushing so hard. It’s making it worse.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, patient reports. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, not there. It’s… just the right side. Like someone’s poking me. It’s… irritating, mostly. It’s not sharp pain, it’s just… unpleasant. Look, can we just skip the poking and get to the part where you give me something to fix this? I'm really starting to feel faint.
DOCTOR: Given your symptoms—the diarrhea, abdominal tenderness, and weight loss—and given the recent passing of your husband, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a severe case of gastroenteritis, but we need to rule out other causes. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample to check for infection.
PATIENT: More tests? Seriously? I told you I don’t have time for this! Look, I appreciate you trying, doc, but I just want something to stop it. Can't you just give me some stronger medication? I don't need a whole battery of tests. This is ridiculous. I'm starting to think I should have just stayed home.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration. However, responsible medical practice requires a thorough investigation. To simply prescribe medication without knowing the cause of your illness would be… negligent. I strongly advise you to follow through with these tests. Furthermore, given your weight loss and the recent loss of your husband, a referral to a gastroenterologist and perhaps a therapist might be beneficial. I will print out the lab orders and a referral form for you. If you change your mind and would like to discuss this further, my nurse will be happy to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Look, I’m done. I don’t need a lecture from you, and I certainly don’t need a referral to a therapist. I’m perfectly capable of handling my own grief, thank you very much. I came here for help with a medical problem, not a psychological evaluation. I’m wasting my time here. Just… print the papers and I’ll go. I’m finding another doctor. .
DOCTOR: As you wish, Ms. Woodring. The lab orders and referral form are on the counter. Good day. .
