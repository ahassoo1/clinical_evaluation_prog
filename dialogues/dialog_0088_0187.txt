DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning. Just… chest. Hurts sometimes. And… heart goes fast. Doctor said blood pressure high last time. Old man problems, you know? Want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chest pain and a fast heartbeat, and you were told your blood pressure was high recently. “Old man problems” as you say… we’ll try to figure things out. To start, can you tell me a little more about this chest pain?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to tell? It hurts. Like… squeezed. Not all the time. When I… walk. Or get… excited. Not happy excited, just… you know. Like when someone cuts me off in traffic. Makes me… feel things. It goes away when I sit. Fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a squeezing pain that comes on with exertion – like walking – or with strong emotions, and goes away when you rest. That’s helpful. And about how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm. Long time. Maybe… six months? Hard to say. Things blend together when you get old, you know. Not new. Just… worse lately. Wife keeps telling me to come. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be hard to keep track. Six months of this squeezing pain that's been getting worse… Okay. Now, when you say "fast heartbeat," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Like… drum. Fast drum. In chest. Not steady. Like… thump-thump-thump. Like bird flying in cage. Makes me… dizzy sometimes. Not often. Mostly just… annoying. I feel it. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fast, irregular heartbeat that feels like a “drum” or a “bird flying in a cage.” And that causes some dizziness occasionally. Do you notice anything specifically triggers this fast heartbeat, besides the exertion that causes the chest pain?
PATIENT: Triggers? Hmph. Stress. People. Just… life. Everything triggers it these days. Young people… always on phones. No respect. Makes my blood pressure go up. Then heart goes fast. It’s a cycle. A bad cycle. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Stress seems to be a significant factor. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Maybe. Old doctor… lots of pills. For… something. I don't remember all the names. He kept changing them. Wife handles all that. She'll know. Something with… water? And… sugar. I think. Don’t ask me to remember. It’s too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can check your records to see what medications you’re currently taking and any other conditions that have been diagnosed. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Used to eat everything. Now I mostly eat… bland. Wife makes it bland. Doesn't want me to… you know. Get sick. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Never had a problem. Don't waste my time with allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you mentioned your wife handles most of your medications – that’s helpful to know. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Pills. Lots of pills. White ones. And… blue ones. And some small yellow ones. Every morning. And some at night. For… sleep. And… blood pressure. Wife gives them to me. I just swallow them. Don't ask me the names. Really. I don't know. It's too much for an old man.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll definitely get a list of your medications from your wife, and from your records. Let’s move on to family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had problems with heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family? Hmph. My father… he smoked too much. Died young. Lung problems. Mother… she was fine. I think. Lived a long time. Lots of kids. That's all I remember. No one talked about… hearts. Or blood pressure. Old times. People just… died. You know? No fancy doctors then. Just… died. Not helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A father with lung problems, and a mother who lived to a good age. That’s useful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoked? Hmph. When I was young. Everyone smoked. Cigarettes. Then… stopped. Long time ago. Thirty… forty years ago? Wife made me stop. Good for my lungs. She's a good woman. Now… no. Not since then. Never touched one.
DOCTOR: Okay, you quit smoking many years ago. That's excellent. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes. A little wine with dinner. Not much. Wife likes it too. Maybe… one glass. Sometimes two. On weekends. Not every day. I don't get… drunk. Just… relaxed. It helps with the stress. A little bit. Don't make a big deal out of it. It's just wine.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass or two of wine on weekends. That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz, before I do a physical exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your general health. Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Weight? Maybe. A little heavier. Getting old. Everything goes down. Everything slows down. Appetite… okay. Eat enough. Not big meals. Wife makes small portions. Energy? Low. Very low. Tired all the time. What do you expect? Old man. That's all. Don't need to ask more questions. Let's just… get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. I'll also check your pulse and reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Just… be quick. Don't poke too much. And don't tell me I need to change my diet. I eat what my wife gives me. And don’t tell me to exercise. I'm too old for that. Just… do it. Get it over with. Fast.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe normally. Okay. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and a bit of diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes of both lungs. Blood pressure is 150/90. Pulse is 88, and a little uneven. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to touch. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age.
PATIENT: Hmph. Uneven? Diminished? What does that mean? Just tell me if something is wrong or not. Don’t give me fancy words. Is it bad? Am I… dying? Just tell me straight. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s not an emergency, and you're not dying. However, the uneven heartbeat and diminished breath sounds do indicate some things we need to investigate further. Your blood pressure is also a little elevated. It’s likely a combination of factors – your age, your history of high blood pressure, and potentially some underlying heart or lung issues. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart, a chest X-ray to see what’s going on with your lungs, and some blood work to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and other important markers. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Hmph. Just what I needed. More poking and prodding. Fine. Do the tests. Just… hurry up. I don't want to spend all day in this place. And… can my wife come with me? She understands these things better than I do. I just want to go home. And eat dinner.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, your wife is more than welcome to accompany you for the tests. We’ll schedule them as quickly as possible, and try to make it as convenient as we can. The lab is right across the hall, and the X-ray technician is very efficient. I’m going to write up the orders now, and then the nurse will come in and explain the process to you and your wife. In the meantime, I’m going to start you on a low dose of a medication to help regulate your heartbeat. It’s a beta-blocker, and it can help reduce your blood pressure as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Beta… what? Just… give me the pill. If it makes me feel better, fine. If not, I don’t want it. Don’t give me a lecture about side effects. I’m too old to worry about side effects. Just make it quick. And tell the nurse to hurry. I’m waiting. And tell her to explain it to my wife. I don't understand fancy words. Just… hurry. .
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. Just one pill, once a day. The nurse will be in shortly to explain everything to both of you. And I'll have the nurse schedule those tests for you right away. Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your frustration, and I'll do my best to make this process as quick and easy as possible. Please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns.
