DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s try to be brief, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, brief is rather sensible, I think. I’m not one for drawn-out affairs, generally. Though, I suppose one gets used to those in my line of work. Now, about this diet… it was a suggestion from a younger colleague, and frankly, it sounds a bit… enthusiastic.
DOCTOR: “Enthusiastic,” you say?
PATIENT: Precisely. He called it the “Sunfast Protocol”. Apparently, one subsists almost entirely on sunlight and… a single grapefruit a day. Rather dramatic, wouldn’t you agree? It was meant to… enhance vitality, I believe. Though, at my age, I’m beginning to suspect vitality is a diminishing return.
DOCTOR: Sunlight and a grapefruit. Yes, that is… unconventional. And you came to me because…?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve been in special effects and animation for quite a long time – nearly seven decades, if you can believe it. One develops a certain… skepticism about things that seem too good to be true. And this felt… rather spectacularly untrue. I thought a professional opinion might be wise before I deprive myself of a proper meal. My wife – ex-wife, I should add – always said I needed more than just grapefruit. A rather astute woman, really. Though, terribly impatient.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, let’s get a quick overview of your medical history, if you don’t mind. I see you’re 85… any significant past illnesses or surgeries I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not particularly, no. A bout of pneumonia in '68, standard fare, really. And I had my appendix removed in my youth, a rather undignified affair. Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably fortunate. I’ve always been quite active, even now. Though, admittedly, the activity is mostly confined to supervising these young whippersnappers with their computers. They wouldn't know a matte painting if it bit them. A good constitution, I’d wager. Perhaps that's why this… Sunfast Protocol appealed to my colleague; he thought I’d sail through it.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Nothing significant, Doctor. A slight rash with penicillin in my twenties, but that was decades ago. No, I'm rather unencumbered in that regard. I eat most things, thankfully. Though I’ve always had a preference for a good roast dinner. Perhaps that’s why this grapefruit business seems so… bleak. A man needs variety, wouldn’t you agree? And a decent Yorkshire pudding.
DOCTOR: Very well. And currently, are you taking any medications at all, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of lisinopril for slightly elevated blood pressure. Nothing dramatic, the doctor prescribed it a few years back. And a daily multivitamin, naturally. One must keep oneself fortified, you understand. It's not a glamorous life, this aging process, and a little support never goes amiss. Although, I suspect the multivitamin is mostly for show, to appease my daughter. She worries, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said this "Sunfast Protocol" involves only sunlight and one grapefruit daily?
PATIENT: Precisely. The young man – terribly enthusiastic, as I mentioned – insisted it was a “cellular reset”. He had charts and graphs and… well, frankly, it was rather overwhelming. Something about harnessing the power of the sun and… I confess, I stopped listening after the second graph. It seemed… improbable. And rather cold, to be perfectly honest. I enjoy a good breakfast, Doctor. A proper English breakfast. Bacon, eggs, sausage… the works. This grapefruit feels… restrictive. Is that a clinical term? “Restrictive”?
DOCTOR: It is a term, yes. Mr. Vantine, with all due respect, this sounds… profoundly unwise. What prompted this colleague to suggest such a… radical change in your diet?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it seems young Timothy – that’s his name, Timothy – believes I’ve become… “stagnant”. Apparently, my creativity has “plateaued”. He’s one of these digital artists, you see, very bright but… lacking in perspective, perhaps. He thinks this “cellular reset” will somehow… unlock my artistic potential. He's convinced it will revitalize my mind and, consequently, my work. Honestly, I think he just wants to see if it will make me miserable. A rather impish young man. Though, a talented one, I must concede. He's simply prone to… eccentric ideas.
DOCTOR: And how long have you been following this… protocol?
PATIENT: Thank heavens, only three days, Doctor. Three days of grapefruit and rather gloomy sunlight. I started on Monday, you see. The artist insisted on a full week for optimal results. But after three days, I felt… diminished. And frankly, rather irritable. My daughter called yesterday and remarked I sounded “peakishly”. A rather damning assessment, I assure you. So, I decided to seek a more… sensible opinion. I thought a professional might dissuade me from continuing this folly. Though, I suspect Timothy will be disappointed. He’s rather invested in his “cellular reset”. And he's terribly stubborn, that boy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes since starting this diet?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, my energy levels are… lower, certainly. And my digestion, shall we say, is not as… regular as it once was. And I’ve been experiencing a rather persistent headache. Not debilitating, but… noticeable. And I’ve found myself increasingly preoccupied with the merits of a full roast dinner. A rather unwelcome obsession, I assure you. And my sleep has been… fitful. I keep dreaming of bacon. It's quite disturbing, actually. Honestly, Doctor, this entire endeavor feels… ill-advised. I suspect my ex-wife would be quite pleased to see me suffer, too. A rather uncharitable thought, I admit. But entirely plausible.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, this is… concerning. Sunlight and a grapefruit are not a balanced diet, and these symptoms—the headache, fatigue, digestive issues—are likely related. I strongly advise you to immediately discontinue this "protocol" and return to a normal, healthy eating pattern. We need to rule out any underlying issues exacerbated by this deprivation. Let's start with a full blood workup – complete metabolic panel, vitamin levels, thyroid function. And I want to know about your fluid intake, are you drinking enough water?
PATIENT: Thank heavens, Doctor. I was rather hoping you’d say that. Yes, immediately discontinue… that sounds eminently sensible. And a full blood workup… yes, that seems prudent. I haven’t been drinking as much water, admittedly. I’ve found myself… preoccupied with the lack of proper beverages. Tea, mostly. A good strong English breakfast tea. But water… less so. I suppose I should be more diligent. And as for underlying issues… well, I’ve always been a healthy man, but one never knows, does one? And I wholeheartedly agree about the “healthy man” part. It is simply good to hear someone confirm that. So, blood workup and… proper hydration, is that correct? And perhaps a small piece of bacon to restore my spirits? Just a thought, of course.
DOCTOR: We'll focus on the blood work and hydration first, Mr. Vantine. No bacon at the moment. We need a baseline. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, resume your normal diet and drink plenty of water. And please, refrain from any further "cellular resets" without consulting a qualified medical professional. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Absolutely, Doctor. Perfectly clear. No further cellular resets. And a return to proper nourishment… and hydration. And I shall leave the bacon to its rightful place… on a plate, enjoyed with a full English breakfast. And I shall await your results with… anticipation. And perhaps a cup of tea. Yes, a cup of tea would be most welcome. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been most… reassuring. A rather competent physician, I must say. Now, about this nurse… is she a proponent of cellular resets? Just a precautionary question, of course.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Vantine, none of my staff subscribe to such… unconventional practices. The nurse will be right in to draw your blood. I think we've covered everything for now. And perhaps, after the results, we can discuss a more sensible approach to maintaining your vitality. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: .
