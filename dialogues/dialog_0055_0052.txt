DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. EADDY. It says here you're 63 years of age. I trust you’re aware of the date – the 2nd of August, 2025. Now, please, tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today. Try to be concise; my time is quite valuable, you understand.
PATIENT: Aye, good mornin’ to ye, Doctor. And yes, I’m well aware o' the date. It’s a bit hard to forget a date, ye see. I’m here about… well, a bit o' mornin’ sickness, I suppose ye’d call it. Though I’m a bit too old for that sort o' sickness! It’s been happenin’ more often lately, and it’s makin' it a wee bit difficult to start the day. Especially with… well, with my heart not bein’ as strong as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Mornin’ sickness… at your age. Yes, quite unusual. I see you mention some cardiac concerns in your self-reported history. Let’s clarify a few things. When you say “not as strong,” could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Aye, well, a few years back now, the doctor – Doctor MacIntyre, back in Inverness – he told me I was havin’ heart failure. It’s not somethin’ I talk about much, to be honest. It’s… a bit frightening, ye see? I get short o' breath with any real effort, and my ankles swell up somethin’ awful at the end o' the day. And like I said, this mornin’ sickness... it’s just added to it all. It makes me feel right weak, and I worry it’s makin’ the heart trouble worse. I take some pills, but I cannae rightly remember what they’re for, now. Old age, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, memory is often the first to go. And heart failure... a serious condition, certainly. It’s crucial we understand the specifics. Let’s try to access your records electronically. Ah, here we are. It seems you were diagnosed with congestive heart failure, NYHA class II, approximately three years ago. You were prescribed Lisinopril 20mg daily and Furosemide 40mg twice daily. Are those medications still being taken, and have there been any changes to your regimen since then?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… Furosemide… aye, those ring a bell. I think I am takin’ those, yes. Though I get a bit muddled wi’ the pills, to be honest. My niece, Fiona, she helps me wi’ them most days. She fills the wee pill boxes, ye see. I don’t think there’s been any changes, not that I’m aware o’. She does the orderin’ and such. But listenin' to ye say those names… it's bringin’ it all back a bit. I just… I worry, ye ken? This mornin’ sickness feels different this time. It’s not just a wee bit queasy, it’s makin’ me right exhausted.
DOCTOR: Exhaustion… and this "mornin' sickness" is a new development. Very well. We need to rule out any potential exacerbations of your heart failure, or any other contributing factors. I’m going to perform a physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your ankles for edema. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Benic. And please, try to relax.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… sensible. I’ll lie down, as ye say. It's no bother at all. I'm used to bein' poked and prodded, these days. Though I must say, I’ve never been one for doctors. Too much fuss, if ye ask me. But I understand it's necessary, especially wi’ the heart condition. Just… be gentle wi’ my ankles, if ye would. They’re a bit tender this mornin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 150/90 – slightly elevated, but not critically so. Heart rate is 72, regular rhythm, though there is a faint S3 gallop present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, although I detect some mild basilar crackles. And, as you mentioned, there is significant pitting edema in both lower extremities, up to the mid-calf. Given your history of heart failure and these findings, it appears your condition may be worsening. The morning sickness, while unusual, could be related to electrolyte imbalances secondary to diuretic use or, less likely, a more systemic issue. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a BNP to assess your heart function. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: A BNP… right. Sounds complicated. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies, no. Fiona keeps a list o' my medications and allergies, and she says it's all clear. I’ve had a few pills over the years, but never had a reaction, not that I recall. Though… now that ye mention it, I did get a bit o' a rash once, years ago, after takin' some sort o' antibiotic for a chest infection. But it wasn’t too bad, and it went away on its own. Just a wee bit itchy, that’s all. Should I mention that to Fiona? She'd know the details better than me, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: A mild rash… noted. While likely insignificant, it's good to have the information. Fiona sounds like a valuable asset, Mr. Benic. Yes, it would be prudent for her to review the medication list and any previous allergic reactions. In the meantime, I’m going to increase your Furosemide dosage to 80mg twice daily. This should help reduce the fluid overload. I’ll also prescribe a potassium supplement, as diuretics can deplete potassium levels. It’s crucial you monitor your weight daily and report any significant changes. If you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. I want to see you back in one week for a follow-up appointment to review the lab results and assess your response to the increased medication dosage. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Aye, I understand, Doctor. Increase the Furosemide to eighty milligrams twice a day, and take a potassium supplement. Weigh myself every day, and look out for breathlessness, chest pain, and dizziness. And come back in a week. Fiona will be pleased to hear that you're takin' this seriously, and she’ll be keepin' a close eye on everything, I assure ye. She's a very capable girl. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Anything at all? I wouldn't want to forget somethin’ important.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Benic, I believe that covers the essential information. Just continue to monitor your symptoms closely and adhere to the medication regimen. Given your current condition and lack of insurance, I recommend utilizing the local community health resources for any necessary follow-up care. I have a pamphlet outlining those services, which the receptionist will provide to you upon your departure. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Community health resources… right. No, I don't think so, Doctor. Not at the moment, anyway. Fiona will be askin' all the questions I forget to ask, I'm sure. She's very thorough. Thank ye for yer time, and for lookin’ after me. I appreciate it, even if yer a wee bit… brisk. I suppose I'll be seein’ ye in a week then. And thank ye again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Benic. I expect a detailed report on your condition at your follow-up appointment. Please inform the receptionist you’ll require the list of community health resources. That will be all. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Aye, I will, Doctor. Thank ye. .
