DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. I am having some… trouble with my breathing. A wheezing sound, when I breathe. It has been happening for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Wheezing for a few days… that’s good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… harder when I walk. Not so bad when I am sitting still, like now. And sometimes it feels tight in my chest when it happens. I do not know if that makes sense. I used to be very good at running, you know. A long time ago. But now… walking is enough.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mrs. Kilton. And thank you for sharing that you used to be a runner – that gives me a good baseline to understand your usual activity level. So, it sounds like the wheezing and chest tightness are worse with exertion – specifically when you’re walking. Is it constant when you are walking, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Not all the time. Sometimes I walk and feel nothing. Other times… after a few minutes, it starts. And then it gets worse the more I walk. It is strange. I try to stop and rest, and then it feels better. But it happens again if I walk too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent with activity, and rest helps. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed anything that specifically seems to trigger it, besides walking?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I do not know if anything specific. But it seems… worse when the air is warm and humid. Like yesterday, it was very sticky outside, and I had to stop three times on my little walk to the shop. It was not so bad the day before, when it was cooler. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense, Mrs. Kilton. Warm, humid air can certainly make breathing more difficult for some people. Have you had a fever, cough, or any other symptoms along with the wheezing and chest tightness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. And no cough. Just the… the sound when I breathe. And the tightness. My son, he asked if I was feeling tired, and maybe that is true. I am a little more sleepy than usual, but I thought that was just because of my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or cough, just the wheezing, chest tightness, and some increased tiredness. And you suspect the tiredness is age-related, which is understandable. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general health questions, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – COPD?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never been told I have either of those things. I used to be very healthy, very active. I worked with athletes for many years, helping them with their breathing and… well, everything! I was always running and doing exercises, so I always thought my lungs were strong. I do not know much about those illnesses you mentioned.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, and it sounds like you were very active in the past! It's helpful to know you haven't been previously diagnosed with asthma or COPD. Okay, let's talk about your medical history a little more broadly. Do you have any other medical conditions, like heart problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My blood pressure was a little high a few years ago, but the doctor gave me a pill, and it went down. I do not take the pill anymore, though. He said it was okay, that it was fine. Other than that… no, I do not think so. I have had some aches and pains, of course. Old age, you know. But no serious illnesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past that was managed with medication, and is currently stable. And aches and pains related to age, which is very common. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never had surgery. And I have never been in the hospital, thankfully. I always tried to stay healthy and avoid getting sick. I always told the athletes I worked with, prevention is the best medicine. I guess I followed my own advice.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mrs. Kilton! That’s a very good philosophy. Alright, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have asthma, COPD, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had some trouble breathing when she got very old. I think it was her heart, but I do not remember exactly. My brother, he smoked for many years, and he had a cough a lot, but he stopped a long time ago. Other than that… no, I do not think so. Not that I remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some breathing difficulties later in life, potentially heart-related, and your brother was a smoker. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. I can eat anything and take any medication. I have never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I am very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mrs. Kilton. That’s all very helpful information. And it does sound like you’ve been very fortunate with your health. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope and check your heart rate and blood pressure, if that's alright with you. Would you mind taking a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. I am happy to do whatever you need. Please listen carefully. I hope you can find out what is wrong with my breathing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Kilton, just breathe normally now. …Alright. I do hear some wheezing in both lungs, particularly when you exhale. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise normal. And your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not overly concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and what I'm hearing, it sounds like you may be experiencing a mild exacerbation of asthma, even though you haven't been previously diagnosed. The wheezing and chest tightness are classic symptoms. The fact that it's worse with exertion and in warm, humid air is also consistent with asthma. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a simple breathing test called a spirometry to measure how much air you can blow in and out of your lungs. And I may also order a chest X-ray to rule out any other lung problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If that will help find out what is wrong, then please do those tests. I trust your judgement. Spirometry… and the X-ray. Whatever you think is best. I want to be able to breathe easily again, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mrs. Kilton. We want to get you breathing easily again as soon as possible. Alright. I’ll have the nurse come in to schedule the spirometry test for you, and we’ll get the order for the chest X-ray sent to the radiology department. That should be within the next few days. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler. This will help open up your airways and relieve the wheezing and chest tightness. It's a puff or two as needed when you feel short of breath. Do you have any experience using an inhaler before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never used an inhaler before. I have seen them on television, but I do not know how to use one. Perhaps you could show me? I do not want to do it wrong and not help my breathing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Kilton. It's very simple, and I’ll make sure you feel comfortable using it before you leave. Here. This is what it looks like. You want to hold it with the mouthpiece at the bottom. First, shake the inhaler well. Then, take a deep breath and exhale all the way out. Now, put the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips tightly around it. As you start to inhale slowly and deeply, press down on the canister to release the medication. Continue inhaling slowly and deeply for about five seconds. Then, hold your breath for about ten seconds. Do you want to try it?
PATIENT: Yes, please. It feels… strange. I think I did it wrong. I did not hold my breath long enough, and I did not breathe slowly enough.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel a little awkward at first, Mrs. Kilton. It takes a little practice to get the coordination right. Don’t worry, we'll keep practicing until you feel comfortable. Try it again. Remember, shake the inhaler, exhale all the way out, put it in your mouth, and as you start to breathe in, press down on the canister. Slow, deep breath. And hold it for ten seconds. That’s better! A little bit shaky, but much better. You're getting it. It’s important to practice this a few times a day, even when you’re not feeling short of breath, so you’re comfortable with the technique when you need it. We have some pamphlets here that explain it with pictures, and I can also have the nurse go over it with you again before you leave.
PATIENT: Yes, please. The pamphlets would be very helpful, and if the nurse could show me one more time… that would be wonderful. I want to make sure I am doing it correctly. It is good to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Kilton. I’ll ask the nurse to come in and go over it with you before you leave. And I'll also print out those pamphlets for you. So, to summarize, we've ordered a spirometry test and a chest X-ray to help determine the cause of your breathing difficulties. I’ve prescribed you a bronchodilator inhaler to help relieve your symptoms in the meantime. And the nurse will go over the proper inhaler technique with you before you leave. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you have explained everything very clearly. I am a little worried, of course, about what the tests might show, but I trust you to take good care of me. I am grateful for your help. Perhaps… how long will it take to get the results of the tests? And will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mrs. Kilton. The results of the spirometry test usually come back within a few days. The chest X-ray results may take a little longer, perhaps a week. Once I have the results, I will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever – please go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. Thank you very much for your kindness and for taking the time to listen to me. I feel much better knowing that you are looking into this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. It was my pleasure. Remember to practice with the inhaler, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I’ll have the nurse come in now to go over the inhaler technique with you and schedule your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
