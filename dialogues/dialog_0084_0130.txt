DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my sister... she got sick. Real sick. Cancer. And my mother, she had something... not cancer, but always tired, always in the hospital. I just... I want to make sure I’m okay. You know? I don't want the same thing to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. It’s very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history like that. It’s good you’re thinking about this. Let’s talk a bit more about what’s been going on with you. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms at the moment – anything that’s feeling different or concerning?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. I feel... okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work hard. Sales, you know? Lots of driving. And I’m not getting any younger. I don't feel sick, if that makes sense. Just... worried.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Schwer. Worry can definitely make you feel off, even if there isn’t anything physically wrong. It’s good you're able to articulate that. Since you mentioned feeling tired sometimes, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like... fall-down tired. Just… at the end of the day, I just want to sit. A lot. More than I used to, maybe. And sometimes I wake up… not rested. But I figure that’s just getting older. I'm 73, you know? Things start to go.
DOCTOR: It's good you're aware of your body and changes, Mr. Schwer. And you're right, things can change as we get older. But it's still important to rule out any underlying causes for that fatigue. Just to get a baseline and put your mind at ease. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Let me think… My appetite… it’s not as big as it used to be. I don’t eat much when I’m not working. But I thought that was because I'm always on the road, eating fast food. Not good, I know. And… sometimes my stomach feels a little… funny. Not pain, just… off. Like something’s not right. But it goes away. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good information, Mr. Schwer. It’s helpful to have the full picture. Changes in appetite and any stomach discomfort are worth checking out, even if they come and go. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. And I broke my arm once, falling off a horse. But nothing… serious. I haven't been to the doctor much. I always figured, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, though. The doctor gave it to me a few years ago. Just a small one.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out, broken arm, and blood pressure medication. That’s helpful. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… No, I don’t. It’s a little white pill. I just… take it every morning. My wife used to remind me, but… she's gone now. I just keep getting refills at the pharmacy. They know what I need. I don't remember the name. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Schwer. We can certainly look that up. I just need to ask a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, maybe not snails. But that's just a preference, not an allergy. Never liked snails. And I don't think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything. My wife always said I had an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, regarding your family history… you mentioned your sister and mother. Could you tell me a little more about their illnesses?
PATIENT: Well, my sister… she got cancer a couple years ago. Lung cancer, I think. She smoked, you know? Lots of cigarettes. She… she didn't make it. And my mother… she was always tired. The doctors said it was her heart, something wrong with her blood. She was in and out of the hospital a lot when I was a kid. It wasn’t cancer, but it was… bad. She just… wore out, I guess.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your sister and mother, Mr. Schwer. That sounds very difficult. Knowing your family history helps me understand what to look for. Just to finish up with the history, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work. A lot. Sales, like I said. Driving all over. I don't really have hobbies. Used to like fishing, but haven't been in years. I eat when I can, mostly fast food on the road. And… I don't drink much anymore. Used to, but not so much now. I don't smoke. Never did. Just work, mostly. That's my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's fine. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know what you're doing, okay? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schwer. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or discomfort. Anything there?
PATIENT: No, not really. Feels… normal, I guess. A little sore, maybe, but I eat a lot of bad food. Ooh, that’s a little tender there. On the left side. But it’s probably just… gas, or something. I get gas a lot. Old man problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. And finally, I’ll take your blood pressure and pulse. Okay, everything seems within normal limits, Mr. Schwer, but your blood pressure is a little elevated – 145 over 90. Not drastically high, but something we should keep an eye on. Given your family history, your fatigue, the slight tenderness in your abdomen, and the elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. Just to rule out anything serious and get a better baseline. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds… okay. If that's what you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Blood work, huh? Will it take long? And… will it hurt? I don’t like needles. Not a fan.
DOCTOR: It won't take long at all, Mr. Schwer. Just a few vials of blood. And the discomfort is minimal – just a quick pinch. Most people don't even notice it much. The phlebotomist is very good. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a medication to help lower your blood pressure. It’s a low dose, just to start. Is there anything else you're concerned about today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not making me feel like I'm crazy. My sister always said I worried too much. Maybe this blood work will give me some peace of mind. That’s all I want, really. Peace of mind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. It’s important to address your concerns, and I’m glad I could help. We’ll get those results back as quickly as possible and go from there. Here’s the prescription. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the medication instructions with you. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there a work note that you need?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please. If I could get something for work, that’d be great. I drive a lot, and sometimes I get tired. A little note saying I might need to take it easy would be helpful. Thank you. You've been very kind, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schwer. Here’s a note for your employer explaining that you may experience some fatigue and need to take occasional breaks. It’s good you’re prioritizing your health. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate your time. And your patience. I guess I’ll just wait for the nurse now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. Take care, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
