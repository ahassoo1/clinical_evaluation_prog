DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bahta. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I am here… because I need to understand if my mother is able to receive care at home. Or, if hospice is a better option, if that makes sense. It’s a difficult situation, and I want to be certain we are doing what is best for her.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense to explore all options, and you're right to want what’s best for your mother. That’s very thoughtful of you. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with her?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My mother, Simone Bahta, is… she is 87 years old. She has been… weaker, lately. She fell about three weeks ago and broke her hip. She had surgery, and the surgery went well, according to the doctors at the hospital. But… she is not recovering as quickly as they hoped. She is very confused sometimes, and she struggles to… to do things she used to do easily, like getting dressed or… eating. It’s just… a decline, overall. I worry about her being alone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Simone Bahta, 87 years old, hip fracture three weeks ago with surgery, and you've noticed a decline since then – weakness, confusion, and difficulty with activities of daily living. That’s helpful. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the confusion a bit more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… not constant. Some days she is quite clear, and we can have a normal conversation. Other days… she doesn’t recognize me, sometimes. Or she thinks she is back in her childhood home, which is… a long way away now. She also gets agitated easily, especially in the evenings. It’s very upsetting for everyone. It's like she’s… not fully present, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: That does make sense. Fluctuating confusion, especially with agitation, is important information. And you mentioned agitation being worse in the evenings – that's something we should definitely keep in mind. Now, has she had any similar episodes of confusion before this hip fracture?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. No, not like this. She has always been… very sharp, very independent. She did have a small stroke about five years ago, but she recovered very well from it. She had some weakness on her right side for a little while, but it went away with therapy. This is… different. It feels… more significant, somehow. More concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, a stroke five years ago with full recovery. And you're right, this does sound different from that. Now, let's talk about her medical history a bit more broadly. Aside from the stroke, does she have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes. She has… high blood pressure, which she takes medication for. And she was diagnosed with arthritis a long time ago, in her knees and hips, mostly. She also had… a gall bladder issue a few years back, but that was removed surgically. No diabetes, as far as I know. She sees her general doctor regularly, but… this seems beyond what he normally handles, that's why I am here.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, arthritis, and a previous gallbladder removal. Okay. And is she currently taking any medications for her high blood pressure or arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes, she is. For her blood pressure, she takes… lisinopril, I believe it is called. And for the arthritis, she takes… naproxen, most days. She also takes a baby aspirin, Doctor, the doctor said it was good for her heart. She used to take something else for the arthritis, but it upset her stomach, so they switched her to the naproxen. I have a list at home, a complete list of everything she takes, if that would be helpful?
DOCTOR: That would be extremely helpful, thank you. Knowing all her medications is very important. In the meantime, you mentioned she sees her general doctor regularly. Do you know the name of the doctor, and perhaps the last time she had a check-up?
PATIENT: Certainly. Her doctor is Doctor Dubois, Jean-Pierre Dubois. She saw him… let me think… about six months ago, I believe. It was a routine check-up, and he said she was doing well, overall. He’s a very good doctor, but… he is very busy, and I worry he doesn’t see the full extent of her struggles when she isn’t with him. I usually take her to her appointments, so I am the one who tells him everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Doctor Dubois. Six months since her last check-up. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about her living situation. Who does she live with?
PATIENT: She lives alone, Doctor. She always has, really. She is very independent, as I said. But… since the fall, I have been staying with her most days, to help her. My wife helps too, when I am at work. It’s… difficult. We are worried about leaving her alone for any length of time. She sometimes forgets to take her medications, or she doesn’t understand how to use the walker. It's… concerning.
DOCTOR: That’s understandably concerning. It sounds like you’re doing everything you can to support her. Now, I’d like to ask about her family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in her family had issues with memory loss or dementia?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think... My grandmother, her mother, she… she had some confusion towards the end of her life, but it was attributed to old age, mostly. She lived to be 95, so… it was just assumed it was part of getting very old. No one else, as far as I know, has been formally diagnosed with dementia. My mother always prided herself on her clear mind, so it's been… surprising, to see this decline.
DOCTOR: Okay, grandmother with late-life confusion, but no formal dementia diagnosis in the family. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on right now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic neurological exam, to check her reflexes, balance, and cognitive function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I just hope it doesn't upset her too much. She gets easily frustrated when she feels… tested. But if you think it’s important, I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I’ll do my best to keep it as gentle and brief as possible. We'll take it slow. Nurse, could you please assist us with a quick neurological assessment?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. I am ready when you are. Just… please be patient with her.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bahta, let’s start with just watching your mother walk a few steps. Nothing fancy, just a normal walk. Okay, good. Now, if you're comfortable, could your mother try standing with her feet together and closing her eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: She is… hesitant. She doesn't like to close her eyes. She says it makes her dizzy. But… she will try. She needs a little help, Doctor. She feels unsteady.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Bahta. I see some instability with eyes closed, requiring assistance to maintain balance. And a slight sway even with support. Her reflexes are a little diminished in her extremities, but still present. Now, I'd like to do a very brief cognitive assessment, if she's up for it. Just a few simple questions. We'll start with her orientation - can she tell me what today's date is?
PATIENT: Simone, dear, can you tell me what day it is today? She says… August 1st. But… today is August 2nd, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight disorientation to date. Now, can she tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Simone, what year is it, dear? Do you know what year we are in? She… she doesn't know, Doctor. She says… "a long time ago." She’s very frustrated.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s enough for now. We don't want to upset her further. From what I’ve observed, and based on what you’ve told me, your mother is exhibiting signs of cognitive impairment – specifically, disorientation to date and some difficulties with balance. Coupled with her recent hip fracture and fluctuating confusion, this warrants further investigation. Now, I need to ask some difficult questions, and I understand it will be difficult, but I need to know her baseline mental state.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. I… I want to do what is best for her. I am just worried. What does this mean? Is it… dementia? And what are our options? I need to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Those are very reasonable questions, Mr. Bahta. It’s too early to definitively diagnose dementia without further testing, including a more comprehensive cognitive assessment and potentially some brain imaging. Her recent surgery could be contributing to her confusion, and we need to rule out other potential causes like infection or medication side effects. But based on the evidence so far, dementia is a strong possibility. As for options, we need to determine the severity of her impairment. We can start with bloodwork to rule out other causes. Then, a referral to a neurologist is crucial for a proper diagnosis and to discuss potential treatments and long-term care planning. This could include medication to manage symptoms, therapy, and support for both your mother and your family. In the meantime, we need to focus on her safety and comfort. Are you able to provide 24/7 supervision, or would you consider exploring options like assisted living or in-home care?
PATIENT: Twenty-four-seven supervision… that would be very difficult. My wife works full-time, and I… I have my job. We’ve been managing, but… it’s becoming increasingly challenging. Assisted living… she would hate that. She’s always been so independent. In-home care… that might be a possibility, but we would need to find someone trustworthy and reliable. And the cost… it’s significant. What about hospice care, Doctor? Would that be an option at this point? If her condition continues to decline… I don’t want her to suffer.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like you're grappling with a lot right now. Hospice is an option to consider, but it’s typically reserved for patients with a prognosis of six months or less to live. Based on what you’ve described, it’s too early to determine if your mother meets those criteria. However, we should certainly discuss it further as we gather more information. Right now, the priority is getting a clearer picture of her cognitive function and ruling out any reversible causes of her confusion. I'm going to order some bloodwork – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I’ll also write a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist specializing in geriatric cognitive disorders. She’s excellent. Would you like me to help you schedule that appointment?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be… immensely helpful. Scheduling the appointment. And… any information you can provide about Dr. Sharma. What is her approach? Does she… work with families? I need to know what to expect. And… what are the next steps after the bloodwork? How long will that take? I am just trying to prepare myself, and my wife, for whatever comes next.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Dr. Sharma is very thorough and compassionate. She takes a holistic approach, meaning she considers not just the medical aspects, but also the emotional and social impact of cognitive decline. She absolutely works with families, and she has a team of social workers who can provide support and resources. Here’s her contact information and some information about her practice. These brochures explain what to expect during a neurological assessment and offer some resources for caregivers. The bloodwork should take about 24-48 hours to process. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, please monitor her closely for any changes in her condition – increased confusion, falls, or changes in her behavior. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you. Thank you for your time, and your patience. And for… being honest with me. It’s a lot to process, but… I feel a little better knowing we are taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. It’s my job to help, and I'm here for you and your mother every step of the way. Please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you and your mother all the best.
