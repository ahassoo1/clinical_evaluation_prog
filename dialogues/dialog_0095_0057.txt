DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you. It’s been… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see here you were recently diagnosed with cancer. That is difficult, and it's completely understandable you're feeling overwhelmed. To help me understand what’s going on, and how I can best help, can you tell me a little more about the diagnosis?
PATIENT: If you don't mind me asking, what kind of cancer did they say I have? I… I was still trying to process everything when the doctor told me, and I don't think I heard it all correctly. It just… sounded like a lot of big words.
DOCTOR: Of course, no problem at all. It's very common to not fully absorb everything in those initial conversations. Let me pull up your records here… Okay, it looks like you were diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Does that sound familiar at all?
PATIENT: Hodgkin’s… Lymphoma. I think… maybe I’ve heard of it before. Is that… bad? I’m sorry, that’s probably a silly question. It’s just… I don’t know anything about cancer, really. And it feels very scary.
DOCTOR: It’s not a silly question at all. It is scary, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. Hodgkin’s Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects your lymphatic system – basically, the part of your body that helps fight infection. It's generally very treatable, especially when caught early, and there have been a lot of advances in treatment. But let’s focus on you right now. Can you tell me when you first started noticing something was wrong?
PATIENT: Well… it started with the swelling. My neck, mostly. I thought it was just a sore throat at first, but it didn’t go away. And then… I started getting really tired. More tired than usual, even. I work with people all day, so I'm used to being tired, but this was… different. It was hard to even get out of bed some mornings. And I lost my appetite. I didn't think much of it at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so neck swelling, fatigue, and loss of appetite. And when did you first see a doctor about these symptoms?
PATIENT: It was… around June, I think. Maybe the beginning of July. My family doctor, Dr. Reyes, she felt the lumps and sent me for some tests. Then she told me about the cancer. It happened very quickly. Everything just felt like a blur. I’m still trying to wrap my head around it. She referred me to an oncologist, and then to you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any other symptoms since then?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been getting night sweats, actually. I wake up soaked sometimes. And… I’ve had a bit of an itchy skin rash. It’s mostly on my chest and back. It doesn’t hurt, just… bothersome. Is that… related, do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, night sweats and an itchy rash. Those can be related to Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. It’s good you’re telling me all of this. Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss, fever, or cough?
PATIENT: I… I haven't weighed myself recently, so I don't know about weight loss. I haven’t had a fever, no. And no cough. Just… the tiredness and the itching. It's hard to concentrate at work, too. I keep forgetting things. Not important things, but… little things. Like where I put my keys, or appointments. It’s frustrating. Is the cancer… affecting my memory? I’m sorry, I’m asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Chellsea. It’s important to understand what's going on. Memory issues can sometimes be a symptom, although there could be other explanations as well. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like asthma or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had pneumonia when I was a child, but I recovered fully. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy, usually. I try to eat well and exercise when I can. It's just… this. I’m a widow, if that matters. My husband, Daniel, passed away three years ago. It was… sudden. He had a heart attack. I still… miss him a lot.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Daniel. That must have been incredibly difficult. It’s understandable that you’re still grieving. And no, it absolutely matters - significant life events like that can impact your overall health and wellbeing. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything besides the pneumonia as a child?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Just the hospital for the pneumonia when I was little. I don’t really remember much about it. I had all my vaccinations, of course. And… regular checkups with Dr. Reyes until all this happened. She was a good doctor. I trusted her. Do you need to know about medications? I don’t take anything regularly. Just… occasional pain relievers for headaches.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional pain relievers. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I’m… I’m not sure what else to tell you. Is this… is this going to be a long process? I have to go back to work eventually, you know. I help people. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. And you're right, we need to think about getting you back to work eventually. It will be a process, Chellsea, but we’ll take it one step at a time. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Does anyone in your family have cancer, or any other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had breast cancer, I think. A long time ago. She recovered, though. And my uncle, Daniel’s brother, he had heart problems, like Daniel. He had to have a pacemaker. Other than that… not really. We don’t really talk about medical things much in my family. It’s… complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of breast cancer in your grandmother and heart problems in your uncle. That's helpful to know. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. I… I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped after Daniel passed away. And no, I don't use any drugs. I’ve never been interested in that. I just… want to get better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I… I just want to know what’s going on. And what we can do about it. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't hurt at all. It's just a routine check. Okay, let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your lymph nodes. I’m just going to gently feel around your neck, under your arms, and in your groin. Okay… I do feel some swelling in your neck, as we already discussed. They're slightly tender to the touch. And I feel a few small, non-tender nodes under your arms as well. Now, let me just feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems consistent with what Dr. Reyes already told me. Now, I've reviewed your records and completed the exam. We’ll need to discuss the next steps, which will likely include reviewing your previous biopsy results in more detail and potentially ordering some additional tests to stage the lymphoma. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. What kind of tests? And… what does “staging” mean? I'm sorry for asking so many questions, but I really am trying to understand.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Chellsea. It’s important you understand everything. “Staging” refers to determining how far the cancer has spread. We do this with imaging tests – usually a CT scan, and potentially a PET scan – to see if the lymphoma has affected any other parts of your body. It helps us determine the best treatment plan. We'll also need to review the pathology report from your biopsy. That will tell us the specific type of Hodgkin’s Lymphoma you have. Okay, I’m pulling up the report now. It confirms the diagnosis of Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, specifically the nodular sclerosis subtype. It also indicates the presence of the Reed-Sternberg cells, which are characteristic of this type of lymphoma. Do you want me to explain any of that in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. What are Reed-Sternberg cells? And what does “nodular sclerosis” mean? It all sounds very… complicated. I just want to know what’s going on inside my body. Is it… is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s break it down. Reed-Sternberg cells are abnormal cells that are found in Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. They’re essentially the hallmark of the disease, and the pathologist looks for them under a microscope when they analyze a biopsy sample. They're a type of white blood cell that has become cancerous. “Nodular sclerosis” refers to a specific pattern of how the cancer cells are arranged in the lymph nodes. It’s one of the most common subtypes of Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and generally has a very favorable prognosis. Now, to answer your question about seriousness, Hodgkin's Lymphoma is a serious disease, but it's also one of the most treatable cancers. The vast majority of patients achieve long-term remission with chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy. Your specific subtype, nodular sclerosis, tends to respond very well to treatment. We'll need to schedule those imaging tests to determine the stage, and then we can discuss a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a little more sense. So… it’s not a death sentence? And… chemotherapy? I’ve heard… things about chemotherapy. Is it… painful? Will I lose my hair?
DOCTOR: No, Chellsea, it is absolutely not a death sentence. It’s a very treatable cancer, and we have a lot of effective treatments available. Regarding chemotherapy, it does have side effects, and those can vary from person to person. Common side effects include nausea, fatigue, and hair loss. However, there are medications we can give you to help manage the nausea, and many people find ways to cope with the fatigue. Hair loss is a common side effect, but it's usually temporary. Your hair will grow back after treatment is completed. We'll discuss all of the potential side effects in detail before you start chemotherapy, and we'll develop a plan to help you manage them. We also have supportive care services available, such as nutrition counseling and psychological support, to help you cope with the emotional challenges of cancer treatment. Before we get ahead of ourselves, let’s schedule those imaging tests first. Then, we can have a more detailed discussion about treatment options and address all of your concerns. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that sounds better. Knowing there are things to help… it’s a relief. Yes, let’s schedule the tests. When can I have them done? And… will my insurance cover them? I have Medicare.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that. Okay, I’m scheduling a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis for next Tuesday at 9:00 AM. We’ll also schedule a PET scan for the following week. Regarding your insurance, you have Medicare, which should cover these tests. However, it’s always best to double-check with Medicare directly to confirm your coverage and any potential out-of-pocket costs. Our billing department can assist you with that. They can also pre-authorize the tests for you. Here’s the referral form for the CT and PET scans, and here’s the scheduling confirmation. Please bring your insurance card and a photo ID with you to the imaging center. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… you’ve explained everything very clearly. And you’ve made me feel a little bit better, knowing there’s a plan. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I’m here for you throughout this process. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. We'll see you next week after your scans. In the meantime, try to take care of yourself and focus on things that make you feel good.
