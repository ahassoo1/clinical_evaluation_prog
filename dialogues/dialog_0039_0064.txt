DOCTOR: Hello Sherion, welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It's… my chest. It’s been hurting. Not all the time, but… yeah. Like a tight feeling, you know? It started maybe… three days ago? I think. It’s hard to remember exactly when.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight feeling in your chest for about three days. I understand it can be hard to pinpoint exact dates. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a bad pain, not like if you broke something. More like… someone is squeezing it? And sometimes it goes into my arm. My left arm, I think. It happens when I walk, usually. Or if I’m doing something around the house. Not when I'm sitting still. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A squeezing sensation, radiating to your left arm, and brought on by activity. That's helpful. Does anything relieve the pain, Sherion?
PATIENT: Hmm… letting me rest, mostly. I just… stop. Sit down for a bit, and it goes away. Not right away, but… after a few minutes. And sometimes, a cup of chamomile tea. My husband makes it for me. It’s calming. I don’t know if it helps the pain, but it makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay, rest and chamomile tea seem to provide some relief, or at least, make you feel more comfortable. Have you noticed anything else happening with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes I feel a little… short of breath. Not like I can’t breathe at all, but like I have to take a few extra breaths. And… maybe a little bit dizzy? But that doesn't happen every time. Mostly just the tight feeling and the arm. And the breathing sometimes. It's all a little confusing. I don’t usually get sick, you know? This is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath and occasional dizziness alongside the chest pain and arm discomfort. And you said this is new for you. Have you had any fever, cough, or nausea with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Definitely no cough. And… no, I haven’t been feeling sick to my stomach. Nothing like that. I eat normally. Everything tastes okay. It’s just… this chest thing. It worries me a little, to be honest. My mother… she had problems with her heart when she was older. I don't want it to be like that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your mother’s history. We'll figure this out together, Sherion. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything before – high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. The doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, so he gave me a pill. I took it for a while, but he said it was okay to stop if it stayed good. And… I think he mentioned my cholesterol was a little bit high too, but he didn’t give me anything for that. He said watching my diet would help. I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of fruits and vegetables. My husband is a very good cook! I don’t have… diabetes, no. Never been told that. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. So, history of slightly elevated blood pressure and cholesterol, both managed with lifestyle changes. And no diabetes. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh! I had my appendix out when I was young. Maybe… fifty years ago? Something like that. And… I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my wrist, but that was a long time ago too. No other surgeries, no. Just the appendix and the wrist. Nothing serious, really. I’ve been very lucky, you know? Until now, maybe. This chest pain… it’s different.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy many years ago and a wrist fracture. And no other hospitalizations or surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family history. Besides your mother's heart problems, are there any other significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had… high blood pressure too, I think. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had… cancer. Lung cancer, I believe. But that was a long time ago. My brother is healthy as a horse, always working in the garden. And… my sister, she had arthritis, but that’s not… really serious, is it? Mostly just aches and pains. Oh! And my uncle… he had a stroke, I think. That was scary. But that’s all I can really remember, to be honest. It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure, lung cancer, stroke and arthritis. We're getting a good picture here. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, never! I don’t like smoking. My husband used to smoke, a long time ago, but he quit years and years ago. It smelled terrible. No, I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. I like fresh air, you know? And… I drink maybe one glass of wine with dinner sometimes. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking history and only occasional alcohol use. That’s good to know. Alright, Sherion, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your arms and legs. It’ll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Go ahead, please. I hope it’s nothing serious. This chest pain… it’s just a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds… regular, but I am hearing a very slight murmur. It's not immediately concerning, but we’ll want to investigate further. Your lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure… Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 148 over 92. I'm also going to take a look at your arms and legs… No swelling, and your pulses are good in both arms and legs. I'll also check your reflexes quickly... Your reflexes are normal.
PATIENT: Oh! That’s a little… surprising! I don’t remember ever having that done before. Is everything okay, Doctor? The blood pressure… is that bad? I try to eat healthy, you know. And I walk every day. I don't want to take pills if I don't need to.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a normal reaction, some people find that a bit surprising! And you’re right to be proactive about avoiding medication if possible. Your blood pressure is a little higher than we’d like, but it can fluctuate depending on stress and other factors. The important thing is we are getting a full picture. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, it could be a few things. Given your age, family history, and symptoms, we need to rule out any potential heart issues. I also want to consider angina, which is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. To be thorough, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, a blood test to check your cholesterol and other levels, and a chest X-ray to rule out any lung problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I don't like hospitals, you know? But… I want to know what’s going on. Is it serious, Doctor? Do you think… it’s my heart? The angina… what is that? Is that bad? I just… want to feel normal again. This chest pain… it’s scary. I don't want it to get worse. My husband… he worries too.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sherion. It is scary when you don’t know what’s going on. And you’re right to be proactive. The tests will give us a clearer picture and help us determine the best course of action. Angina, simply put, is chest pain caused by a reduced blood flow to the heart. It’s not a disease in itself, but a symptom of underlying heart disease. It can range from mild discomfort to severe pain, and we need to find out the cause. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious, but it can be a sign of something that needs to be addressed. That's why the tests are important. I’m going to write you a referral for these tests. The EKG and chest X-ray can be done at the clinic downstairs, and the blood test can be done at the lab across the street. The receptionist will help you schedule appointments. In the meantime, please avoid any strenuous activity that brings on the chest pain. If the pain becomes severe, or you experience shortness of breath, dizziness, or nausea, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Once we have the test results, we can discuss them in detail and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… tests downstairs and blood work across the street. No strenuous activity. And… go to the emergency room if it gets bad. I think I can remember that. My husband can help me schedule the appointments. He's very organized. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very well. I still feel a little scared, but… I’m glad we’re doing something about it. I just… I want to feel better. And… I want to be able to walk in the park with my husband again. That’s all. Is it okay if I ask one more question? What if the tests… show something bad?
DOCTOR: Of course, you can ask as many questions as you need. And that's a very valid question, Sherion. If the tests do show something concerning, we'll discuss all your options. There are many things we can do to manage heart conditions, from medication to lifestyle changes to more advanced procedures. We'll go through everything together, step by step. It's important to remember that knowing what's going on is the first step to feeling better. We'll have a detailed plan tailored to your specific needs. You won't be alone in this. I’ll be here to guide you through everything, and we’ll work with your husband to make sure you get the best possible care. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You’ve answered everything, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve made me feel a little bit better, just talking to you. I’ll go see the receptionist now, and schedule those tests. My husband is waiting for me outside. Thank you again, Doctor Kamahele. I appreciate your kindness. And… I’ll see you when we have the test results.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. It was a pleasure meeting you, and please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you soon.
