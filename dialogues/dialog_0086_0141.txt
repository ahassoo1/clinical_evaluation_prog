DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this itching. Everywhere, really. Been going on for a couple weeks now, just driving me crazy. Not a rash, not really. Just…itchy. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Itching, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, just…itchy skin. All over. Arms, legs, back… even my scalp sometimes. It's not like a bug bite or anything. It doesn't look like anything’s wrong, which is… frustrating. I keep scratching, of course, but that doesn't really help, does it? I feel like I’m going a bit mad.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, it’s often difficult to diagnose something when there’s no visible sign. Itching without a rash…could be a number of things, and frankly, most of them aren’t particularly serious, though incredibly annoying. Let’s try to narrow it down. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. Routine, you know? I go to the market, read the paper… I haven’t started using any new soaps or detergents, nothing like that. My diet’s the same. Oh! Well… I did get a new laundry detergent, come to think of it. About three weeks ago, maybe? A big box store brand. I figured it couldn't hurt to try something different.
DOCTOR: A new detergent…and this started around the same time?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I switched it over, did a load, and…well, around then is when the itching really started to bother me. I didn’t immediately connect the two, honestly. Old man brain, you know? Everything’s a bit fuzzy sometimes. But now that you mention it… it could be that. Could a detergent really cause something like this? It seems…silly.
DOCTOR: It’s not “silly,” Mr. Ferneding. Contact dermatitis is quite common. Although, it's more typical to have some visible reaction. Let’s just go through the motions, shall we?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Whatever you think best. I just want to get some relief, honestly. It’s keeping me up at night. Anything’s worth a try, I suppose. Should I… stop using the detergent? Even if we’re not sure it’s the problem? I can go back to the old stuff. No trouble at all.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Ferneding, absolutely stop using the new detergent immediately. That's basic common sense. And we'll need to do a quick examination to rule out anything more… concerning. Please, have a seat on the examination table and remove your shirt and shoes. I need to assess your skin.
PATIENT: Right, okay. Of course. Examination table, right. Shoes and shirt off. No problem at all. I haven’t been on one of these in… well, quite a while. Just let me know if you need me to adjust anything. It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard temperature, Mr. Ferneding. Now, if you'll just lie back. I'm going to start with a visual inspection. Don’t worry, I’ve seen it all.
PATIENT: Right, okay. Visual inspection. That’s… reassuring, I suppose. I always feel a bit like a prize steer when I’m lying here. Just let me know if you see anything…unusual. It’s mostly on my back and arms, I think. And my legs, a bit. It's hard to get a good scratch when you're lying flat, you know. Just saying.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Skin appears generally normal. No visible rash, excoriations, or hives. Some mild dryness, particularly on your lower back, but nothing significant. Pressure doesn’t elicit any… acute discomfort. Your skin turgor is within normal limits. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, Mr. Ferneding. But we’ll need to rule out a few other possibilities. Have you traveled recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Haven't left town in… well, years, honestly. Routine, you know? Market, paper, the occasional visit from my niece. No travel, no new pets, no swimming in ponds. I keep a pretty quiet life. Does that… help? Knowing I haven’t been anywhere exotic? I just want to stop itching! Is there a cream or something you can give me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Ferneding, I understand your frustration. But a diagnosis isn’t simply a matter of eliminating possibilities. It requires a process. However, given your unremarkable history and the lack of visible signs, it's most likely a mild irritant dermatitis, exacerbated by dry skin. I'll prescribe a topical corticosteroid, a low-potency one, to reduce the inflammation and itching. And I recommend an emollient lotion, fragrance-free, to be applied liberally twice daily. But, and this is important, if the itching persists or worsens after a week, you must return. We may need to consider allergy testing. And frankly, I’d like to order a complete blood count just to be certain. Do you have any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: A cream… okay, that sounds good. A week… I can manage a week. And lotion, yes, I can do lotion. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. A bit sensitive to dust, maybe. Used to get hay fever as a boy, but that was… decades ago. Nothing serious. No bee stings, no reactions to medications… I take a small blood pressure pill, but I’ve been on that for years with no problems. Will the cream make me sleepy? I like to read in the evenings.
DOCTOR: The corticosteroid is a topical application, Mr. Ferneding. It’s absorbed through the skin, not ingested. It shouldn't cause drowsiness. However, read the instructions carefully. Avoid applying it to broken skin, and don't overuse it. I'm also going to order the complete blood count, just to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. The lab requisition is here. You can go there at your convenience. If the itching doesn’t improve within a week, despite the cream and lotion, schedule a follow-up appointment. And seriously, consider allergy testing. We need to get to the bottom of this. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think so. Cream on the skin, not in my mouth. Lotion twice a day. Blood test…got it. And come back if it doesn't get better. A week, right? It's a lot to remember. But thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I'm just… tired of itching. I think that's everything, isn't it? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Ferneding. That’s all for now. Follow the instructions, and don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. And try to relax. Next!
