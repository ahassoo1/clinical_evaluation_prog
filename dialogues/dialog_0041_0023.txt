DOCTOR: Hi Aron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Uh, it's my chest. It hurts a little. Not all the time, but... yeah, my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. I see. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm... it's not a bad pain, like, not a sharp pain. More like... sore. Like when you use muscles too much. It's on this side. <points to left chest> It's hard to explain. Sometimes I feel it in my arm too, a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore feeling, mostly on the left side, and sometimes radiating into your arm. That's helpful. Does anything specifically bring it on, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Uh... not really. I work on roofs, you know? Maybe when I'm lifting stuff... heavy tiles... but it's not always. Sometimes it's there even when I'm just sitting. I don’t know. It's weird.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to be aggravated by lifting, but also happens at rest. That is a bit unusual. And how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe two weeks? Not sure exactly. My wife, she noticed it first, I think. She tells me I'm always rubbing my chest when we watch TV. I didn't really pay attention before.
DOCTOR: Two weeks, noticed by your wife... okay. And has anything else been going on?
PATIENT: Uh... no. Not that I know of. I eat okay, I guess. I sleep okay. I'm tired after work, but that's... work. Everything feels normal, other than the chest. Is this… bad? <looks worried>
DOCTOR: It's good you're bringing this to my attention, Aron. It's hard to say if it's "bad" without checking things out. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel around your chest wall. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… okay. I hope it's nothing serious. <nervously adjusts shirt> My wife will worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table here, that would be great. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs that I detect. Lungs sound clear as well. Now, I'm going to gently press on a few spots on your chest to see if I can pinpoint any tenderness. Let me know if anything feels particularly sore.
PATIENT: Okay. <winces slightly as Dr. Polczynski presses a spot near his left armpit> Ow. That one. That feels… tender. Not super bad, but yeah, that’s it. The others are okay. Just that one spot.
DOCTOR: Alright, tenderness near your left armpit. That's good information. Now, just to get a better picture, do you have any history of heart problems or any problems with your ribs, like a previous injury?
PATIENT: No, no heart problems. My father had high blood pressure, but not me. And no, I never broke a rib or anything. I fall sometimes on the roof, but never really hurt bad. Just bumps and bruises. Nothing serious. <shakes head>
DOCTOR: Okay, no personal history of heart problems, and your father had high blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I haven't really taken much medicine before. Maybe some for headaches, but nothing regular. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. My wife gives me vitamins though, if that counts? <chuckles nervously>
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, just some vitamins from your wife. That’s good. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just the vitamins. She says they're good for my bones. I take them with breakfast. She worries about me falling on the roof, you know? <shrugs> I'm strong, though. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aron. So, to recap, you've had left-sided chest pain for about two weeks, sometimes radiating to your arm, not brought on by anything specific, but occasionally worse with lifting. It feels more like muscle soreness, and we found some tenderness near your left armpit on the exam. No known allergies or current medications besides vitamins. Given your age and what you’ve told me, it could be musculoskeletal – something related to the muscles or joints in your chest wall, perhaps a strain from work. However, we can't rule out other possibilities without a bit more information. I'd like to order a basic blood test – just to check your heart enzymes and rule out anything more serious. And, just to be on the safe side, I think an EKG – an electrocardiogram – would be a good idea to look at the electrical activity of your heart. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood test and... EKG? Is that… serious? My wife will be really scared if I tell her I need tests. Is it something bad? I just thought it was a pulled muscle, you know? I can probably rest it and it'll get better. <looks worried and fiddles with his hands>
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Aron. It's always a little unsettling when tests are involved. But think of it as being thorough. It’s better to be sure. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. The blood test will just check for any signs of heart damage, and the EKG is a very quick, painless scan that shows how your heart is functioning. It's a common procedure. I want to rule out anything concerning, especially given the pain in your chest. If everything comes back normal, then we can probably chalk it up to a muscle strain, and I can give you some advice on how to manage that. It's a precautionary measure, alright?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. If you think it's important… then I guess I’ll do the tests. But please, tell me if it's nothing bad. My wife… she worries so much. Can we do them today? <looks relieved but still anxious>
DOCTOR: Alright, Aron, that's a good decision. I understand about your wife, we'll definitely talk through the results as soon as we have them. And yes, we can do the blood test and EKG here today. I'll put in the orders now. The nurse will come in shortly to take a blood sample and then escort you to the EKG room. It shouldn't take long at all. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity. And if you experience any worsening pain, especially if it's accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Okay. No hard work… and go to the hospital if it gets worse. I remember. Thank you, Doctor. <nods gratefully> I hope it’s just a muscle. My wife will be so relieved. Where will the nurse find me? <looks around nervously>
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aron. I hope it is just a muscle as well. The nurse will find you right here in the examination room. She’s been notified. Just let her know you're ready when she arrives. Do you have any other questions for me before she gets here?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you again, Doctor. <takes a deep breath> I'm a little scared, but I'm glad I came. <fiddles with his hands, waiting for the nurse>
DOCTOR: You did the right thing coming in, Aron. I'm here if you need anything. We'll get to the bottom of this.
