DOCTOR: Hi Sherrell, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good day to you, Doctor. It is… well, it is the words. They do not come so easily now. A difficulty, you understand. It started… some time ago, I believe. I struggle to find the right ones. It is frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with finding the right words when you speak – a sort of word-finding difficulty. And it's been going on for a while, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. A while. Not sudden, you see. It is… gradual. Like mist, slowly covering things. I do not remember exactly when it started, but it is not new. Perhaps… six months? Or longer? It is hard to say, truthfully. My memory… it is not what it was.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradually worsening over at least six months, maybe longer. And you also mentioned some memory issues. Can you tell me more about the memory problems?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. The memory. It is not… complete loss, you understand. More like… faded photographs. I remember things… sometimes. Dates… names… they slip away. I forget what I had for breakfast, but I remember… my wife. Her face is clear. But… details of recent events? They are… elusive. It worries me, Doctor. It truly does.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherrell. It’s good you’re bringing this up. So, to clarify, you’re experiencing both difficulty finding words and some memory loss, particularly with recent events?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… quite correct, Doctor. The words, and the… the slipping away of things. It is a troubling combination. I apologize for being… vague. It is difficult to explain. It feels like… a fog. A persistent fog. I do not know if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Sherrell. Don’t apologize at all; you’re describing it perfectly well. Let’s try to get a little more specific, if you’re comfortable. When you're struggling to find words, does it happen more often when you're speaking, or when you're writing?
PATIENT: Ah… a good question. I do not… write much these days. Mostly letters to my grandchildren. But… it is worse when I speak. When I try to say something, the words… they hide. When I think, it is easier. But when I open my mouth… it is a struggle. A very frustrating struggle. I hope that clarifies things, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. It sounds like it’s primarily affecting your expressive language – your ability to get the words out when you speak. Now, has this difficulty with words been impacting your daily life in any way?
PATIENT: Yes. It… it makes conversations difficult. I avoid talking to people sometimes. I do not want to… stumble and frustrate them. And my grandchildren… they are very patient, but I can see the… concern in their faces. It is… isolating, Doctor. A little bit isolating. I used to enjoy a good discussion, you see. Now… it is harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. That sounds really difficult, and it's understandable that you’re feeling isolated. Let’s move on to some other questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed any other changes in your thinking or behavior?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. That is… a difficult one. I… sometimes feel a little more… tired than usual. And… perhaps a little slower to react. Not much, you understand. But… I do not have the same… sharpness, perhaps. It is subtle. And… I worry more easily. Small things bother me now that did not used to. But I attribute that to… well, to being older, and… missing my wife. But perhaps it is more than that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased fatigue, feeling a little slower, and increased worry. Those are all things to consider. Now, I’m going to ask you about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. A few things, over the years. High blood pressure, many years ago. It is controlled with medication now, I believe. And… arthritis in my knees. It bothers me sometimes, but it is manageable. And… I had a bout of pneumonia, some years ago. Nothing major, but it was… unpleasant. But otherwise… I have been generally healthy, Doctor. Or, I was generally healthy. Before all of this, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure – well-controlled, that’s good – arthritis in your knees, and a past bout of pneumonia. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. One surgery. A gallbladder removal, many years ago. Perhaps twenty years ago? It was… routine, I believe. No complications. And… that is all, Doctor. Just the gallbladder. Nothing else. I do not believe so, at least. My memory… it is not always reliable, you see. But I am fairly certain it was just the gallbladder.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the gallbladder removal. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My family… that is a… difficult subject. My wife’s family was quite healthy, as far as I know. But my… my mother had dementia, in her later years. It was… very sad. And my father… he had heart problems, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young, actually. But beyond that… I do not know much about my family history, Doctor. We were not very close. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. That’s alright; you've given me a lot of good information already. So, your mother had dementia, and your father had heart problems. Let’s talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Yes. Just these, I believe. For my blood pressure… this one. And something for my arthritis, to help with the pain. And… a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I was low in it. I… I can read you the names, if you wish. But I do not know what they do, exactly. I just take them as prescribed. I trust the doctors, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me take a look at those. Okay, I see here Lisinopril for your blood pressure, a common medication. And Naproxen for your arthritis, which is an anti-inflammatory. And Vitamin D, as you mentioned. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies that I know of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I… I used to worry about it, but I seem to be alright. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I do not recall any allergies, no. I think I would remember something like that, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you definitely would. Okay, that's good to know. Now, Sherrell, before I do a quick physical exam, I want to ask a bit more about your daily routine. Can you tell me a little about what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: Well… it is not very exciting, Doctor. I wake up, usually around seven o'clock. Have a small breakfast – toast and coffee, mostly. Then I read the newspaper. I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees… they make it difficult now. I spend most of the day reading, or watching television. I have my grandchildren visit sometimes, which is… lovely. And I have a neighbor who helps me with the groceries. It is a quiet life, Doctor. A very quiet life. I miss my wife terribly, you see. She always kept me busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet life, mostly reading and watching television, with visits from your grandchildren. That’s good to know. And I understand you miss your wife. It sounds like you’ve adapted to a new routine after her passing. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment completely. Please, proceed. I am here to help in any way I can. I just… hope you can find something to explain all of this. The words… and the slipping away. But I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not drastically so, given your history. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Coordination seems slightly diminished, but could be due to age. Balance is a little unsteady. Okay, Sherrell. Everything seems within normal limits, but as I mentioned, your coordination and balance are a bit diminished. I also noticed a slight tremor in your hands. It’s subtle, but worth noting. I'm going to ask a few questions to assess your cognitive function more thoroughly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you need. I want to understand what is happening. The tremor… I had not noticed it myself. But if you see something, then it must be there. Please, ask your questions. I will do my best to answer them truthfully. I just… hope it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. Don't worry, we’ll take things one step at a time. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions about memory and orientation. First, can you tell me what today's date is?
PATIENT: Today's date… Hmm. That is… difficult. August… I believe it is August. But the day… the number escapes me. Is it the… second? Or the third? I am not certain, Doctor. I apologize. It is right there, on the tip of my tongue… but I cannot seem to grasp it. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright, Sherrell. It’s August 2nd, today. That’s perfectly fine, these things happen. Now, do you know where we are right now?
PATIENT: We are… in a doctor's office, of course. But… which doctor's office? I believe it is… in the country? A rural area, perhaps? I remember a long drive… and trees. But the name… the name of the clinic… it eludes me, Doctor. I apologize. My memory… it is not what it was.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. That’s alright. We're at the Willow Creek Clinic. Don’t worry about remembering the name; it’s not the end of the world. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions about recall. Can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words, you say? Very well. Please, go ahead, Doctor. I will do my best to remember them. My concentration may not be at its peak today, but I will try. Just tell me the words, and I will repeat them as best I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Ah… apple… table… and… penny. Is that correct, Doctor? I believe those were the words. It took a little effort, but I think I have them. It’s… it's like grasping at smoke, you see? They were there a moment ago, and now… I hope I have remembered them correctly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Sherrell. You repeated them correctly. Now, let’s come back to your symptoms. You mentioned difficulty finding words and some memory loss. How long would you say this has been impacting your daily life – your ability to do things, interact with people, etc.?
PATIENT: Impact… it has been growing, Doctor. Slowly, insidious. Perhaps… six months, as I mentioned before. But in the last few months, it has become more noticeable. I avoid conversations sometimes, because I fear stumbling over my words. I used to enjoy a good discussion, you see. Now… I find myself withdrawing. And my grandchildren… they are very patient, but I can see the concern in their eyes. It’s not just the words, you see. It’s the… feeling of slipping away. It’s impacting my life, Doctor. It truly is. Perhaps not drastically, but… significantly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. I appreciate you being so honest and thorough. Based on what you've told me, your medical history, and the brief exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The memory loss and difficulty with words, along with the slight tremor and diminished coordination, could be indicative of early cognitive impairment. Now, it’s important to note this doesn't automatically mean anything definitive. It could be due to a number of factors, including age-related changes, medication side effects, or underlying medical conditions. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood work to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or other medical issues. And I would also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation, including cognitive testing and possibly an MRI of the brain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Blood work and a neurologist… whatever you need to do to find out what is happening. I just want to understand. I want to know what is causing this… this slipping away. Whatever you recommend, I trust your judgment completely. Please, proceed. And thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. It is… a relief to finally be talking about it. Perhaps… perhaps there is hope.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. You're very welcome. I'm glad you feel comfortable discussing this. I’ll order the blood work right away, and I'll give you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly-regarded neurologist in the area. I’ll also give you a list of resources about cognitive impairment and support groups, in case you find them helpful. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay mentally active – reading, doing puzzles, socializing – and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. We’ll get this figured out, together. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have answered all of my questions. I just… thank you. Thank you for listening, for taking me seriously, and for giving me hope. I will follow your recommendations, and I will see the neurologist. I trust your judgment completely. And thank you for the resources. I may look into those. For now… I just want to go home and rest. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. You're very welcome. I’m glad I could help. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will come by to draw your blood before you leave. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon. .
