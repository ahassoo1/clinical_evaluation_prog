DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. AlCorta. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, frankly, it’s my sight. It’s… diminishing. Not suddenly, thankfully, but steadily. It’s becoming quite inconvenient, and I assure you, I’ve always taken pride in my… perception. I’m Delano, by the way. Though I suspect you already know that.
DOCTOR: Right, Delano. Yes, I do have your chart here. Diminishing sight… Okay. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it's difficult to pinpoint precisely. Perhaps… six months, give or take a month? It began subtly, I initially dismissed it as fatigue. I do a great deal of reading for my work, you understand. Important documents. Not just anything. But it hasn’t improved, and if anything, it’s gotten… blurrier. Especially at a distance. I find myself squinting quite a bit. It’s rather bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is this blurriness in both eyes, or is it worse in one than the other?
PATIENT: Both, I believe. Though… now that you mention it, my left eye feels… weaker. Not painful, mind you. Just… less sharp. It’s always been the slightly poorer of the two, if I'm honest. A minor imperfection I’ve simply learned to compensate for. But now… it’s becoming more noticeable, even to me. I do hope it’s nothing serious. I’ve always had excellent health, you know. My family has good genes.
DOCTOR: Right. We'll certainly look into it. Do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: No, I do not. Never have. I’ve always had perfectly adequate vision, thank you very much. I've often prided myself on not needing corrective lenses. My father, he wore glasses for much of his life, and… well, let’s just say he wasn’t the most… discerning man. I always associated glasses with a certain… lack of vitality. Perhaps a foolish notion, in retrospect. But I’ve managed just fine without them until now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I had a touch of… indigestion a few years back. Nothing a little bicarbonate of soda couldn’t fix. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder while… pruning some rose bushes. A rather unfortunate incident, really. But other than that, no. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I eat well, I exercise regularly… mostly walking, mind you. I find strenuous activity rather… undignified. But no chronic illnesses, no surgeries, nothing of consequence. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I prefer to let my body function naturally. All these… pills and potions… I have little faith in them, frankly. I believe in a strong constitution and a sensible diet. I might take an occasional aspirin for a headache, but that’s the extent of it. I find most pharmaceuticals to be… rather barbaric. A temporary fix for a deeper problem, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of vision problems – glaucoma, macular degeneration, cataracts – in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had something with her eyes, later in life. I believe it was cataracts. She needed surgery, I recall. A rather unpleasant affair, by all accounts. And my grandfather, on my father's side… he was almost entirely blind in his final years. Something to do with… the sugar, I think. He was a rather indulgent man. But beyond that… not that I’m aware of. My family, generally, were a robust, outdoorsy sort. Not prone to ailments, thankfully. It’s a good lineage, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none whatsoever. I’ve always been remarkably resilient. I can eat anything, touch anything, without so much as a sniffle. I pride myself on my constitution. It’s a gift, really. My mother always said I was… “hardy.” I suspect it’s the Cherokee blood. We’re a strong people, you know. Not easily afflicted. Though, I suppose everyone has some weakness. But allergies are not among my concerns. Certainly not.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, before we do a quick examination, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I find all three… distasteful. Smoking is a barbaric habit, alcohol impairs judgment, and recreational drugs are… beneath me. I maintain a very disciplined lifestyle, as I've mentioned. I occasionally enjoy a cup of chamomile tea before bed, but that’s the extent of my indulgences. I believe in clarity of mind and a sound body. These… vices… they simply don’t align with my principles. I assure you, I am a man of moderation. A very respectable lifestyle, if I do say so myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that's good to know. Let's take a look at your eyes. If you’ll have a seat, I’ll just do a quick visual acuity test and check your pupils. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, I’m rather skeptical of these tests. I’ve always been able to see quite clearly, you understand. But I suppose it's best to be thorough. Proceed, Doctor. Though I trust you’ll find nothing amiss.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. AlCorta, just focus on this chart. Start with your right eye, covered the left one. Read the smallest line you can see clearly. Don't strain, just tell me what you see. …Okay, I’m seeing a bit of difficulty at 20/30. And now your left eye… covered the right one. …Hm. That’s… a bit worse. 20/40. And with both eyes open… 20/35. Okay. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light… but a slight pallor to the optic disc in both eyes. Let me check your peripheral vision.
PATIENT: Twenty-thirty? That’s… unacceptable. I assure you, I’ve always had far better than that. Perhaps the lighting is poor? Or the chart itself is substandard? Twenty-forty? This is… disconcerting. I’ve never experienced such difficulty. Are you certain the machine is calibrated correctly? A pallor? What does that mean? It sounds… ominous. I trust you’re not alarmingly me unnecessarily, Doctor? I've always been a very healthy man, you know. This simply doesn’t align with my… constitution.
DOCTOR: The equipment is calibrated, Mr. AlCorta. The pallor is a slight fading of color, which can indicate a number of things – it's not necessarily alarming, but it warrants further investigation. We’ll need to rule out a few possibilities. Peripheral vision is… slightly constricted. Not dramatically, but enough to note. I’m reviewing your chart now. You haven’t had a comprehensive eye exam in… well, ever, it seems. I’m going to order some tests – a visual field analysis, optical coherence tomography to get a detailed look at your retina, and possibly a blood sugar test to rule out any diabetic issues. It's unlikely to be anything drastic, but we need to be thorough. I’ll also give you a referral to an ophthalmologist for a more specialized evaluation.
PATIENT: Never had a comprehensive exam? That’s… preposterous. I’ve always taken excellent care of myself. I simply didn’t require one. And diabetic issues? Absolutely not. I maintain a very sensible diet. Fruits, vegetables, lean proteins… certainly no sugary indulgences. This is… quite unsettling, Doctor. A visual field analysis… optical coherence tomography… these sound… invasive. And a referral? To an ophthalmologist? Is this truly necessary? I’m beginning to suspect a misdiagnosis. Perhaps a second opinion would be prudent? I assure you, my vision has always been… exceptional. This entire process is rather… unsettling. And quite frankly, a waste of my time. I have important matters to attend to, you know. These tests… are they absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, I understand your concern. It's never pleasant to hear there might be a problem. However, these tests are not about suggesting you've been neglecting your health, but about ruling out potential causes for the changes I'm observing. The visual field analysis is a non-invasive scan of your peripheral vision; it simply maps what you can see. The OCT is a similar scan, using light waves to image the layers of your retina. It doesn’t involve any injections or incisions. It’s true you maintain a healthy lifestyle, but diabetes can develop even in those with good habits. A simple blood sugar test will provide valuable information. And while I’m confident in my assessment, a referral to an ophthalmologist provides a specialist’s perspective and allows for more in-depth evaluation. I wouldn’t recommend these tests if I didn’t believe they were necessary to ensure your visual health. It’s better to be proactive and rule out any serious concerns. I'll write the orders now. We can discuss scheduling these tests with the receptionist. Do you have any questions about them?
PATIENT: Proactive… yes, I suppose that's… sensible. Though I still maintain this is… unwarranted. And a specialist? Very well. If you insist. But I trust they will be… efficient. I have a great deal on my plate, you understand. Efficient, and discreet. I would prefer not to… advertise my potential ailments to a room full of strangers. Will these tests require a significant time commitment? And will they… interfere with my schedule? I trust the receptionist is capable of accommodating my… availability. Though I doubt she's accustomed to scheduling appointments for someone of my… stature. Just write the orders, Doctor. Let's get this… unpleasantness… over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. AlCorta. I’ll ensure the receptionist understands your schedule and does her best to accommodate your needs. The tests shouldn't take an excessive amount of time – perhaps an hour for both. The ophthalmologist’s appointment will likely be longer, but we can schedule it for a time that's convenient for you. Here are the orders and the referral information. I’ve included a note for the ophthalmologist outlining my findings. If you experience any sudden changes in your vision – blurred vision, double vision, loss of vision – please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. I’ll leave you to schedule the tests. And if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I hope everything turns out well. .
PATIENT: Very well. I trust it will all be… straightforward. Sudden changes? Preposterous. I’m perfectly capable of monitoring my own health, thank you very much. I sincerely hope this doesn't prove to be a significant waste of my time, Doctor. Good day. Honestly, the inconvenience… .
