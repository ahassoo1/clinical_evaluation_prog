DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Vodzak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I ain't got all day, you know? Just wanna get this over with. It's... well, it's my belly. It's too big. Always has been, really. Even when I was young and strong, driving them piles. Now it's just… hanging. My wife, bless her soul, she used to say… never mind what she said. Just want it fixed. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you're concerned about the size of your abdomen, and you're hoping to find a solution. You mentioned it's been a concern for a long time, even when you were younger. When you say “too big,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Describe? What you want me to draw it for you? It sticks out! Like a… a sack of flour, maybe? I ain't no artist. It's just… there. And it's gotten worse since my wife passed. Not from eating more, I assure you. I eat sensible. Always have. Just… flabby. That’s the word. Flabby and hanging. Is that good enough for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Trendler. “Flabby and hanging” gives me a good idea. And you mentioned it's worsened since your wife passed. I'm very sorry for your loss. Sometimes changes in our bodies can be related to significant life events. Now, besides the size, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? It aches sometimes, if I've been doing too much. Lifting things, you know? Like I used to. Not as much anymore, obviously. And… it feels loose. Like… empty, almost. Though it ain't empty, is it? It’s full of… well, you know. Flab. Look, I ain't a doctor, I just know it ain't right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some aching with activity, especially lifting, and a feeling of looseness. When you say aching, can you tell me where exactly it aches?
PATIENT: Right in the middle, mostly. Low down. Like… where a man’s gut should be firm, it just wobbles and aches. Especially after I’ve been trying to help my neighbor with some work. He’s got a bad back, you see. I try to lift things for him, and then… oof. It reminds me I ain't a young man anymore, even if I feel like one sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. Aching in the lower middle abdomen, especially after lifting. Mr. Trendler, I see here you have a history of high blood pressure, and you were seen for a bout of diverticulitis a few years back. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Diverticul… what now? Look, I go to the doctor when I have to. They poke and prod, give me pills, and tell me to eat more fiber. That’s about all I remember. High blood pressure? Maybe. I take a little white pill every day. But that's it. Don't bother me with the details, I just want this belly sorted. Is that possible, or not?
DOCTOR: Alright, we can focus on the belly. To understand what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical examination. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and gently press on it to feel for anything unusual. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Poke and prod, you say? Just get it over with then. The quicker we're done, the better. I got things to do, you know. And don't be gentle, I'm a strong man. But don’t go digging around too much, alright? Just a quick look.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I will be as efficient as possible. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay, I'm listening now. Your bowel sounds are present, though a little quiet. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. How does this feel?
PATIENT: Feels like… poking. What did you expect? It's a little sore there… on the left side. Right there. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like somethin's… pushed. Like a knot, maybe? And it hurts more when you push hard. Stop poking so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the left side, below the ribs, feeling like a knot and increased discomfort with pressure. I also notice some fullness in the lower abdomen, as you mentioned. There’s no obvious distension or rigidity. To help us understand what's going on, I'd like to order some blood work. It will give us a better picture of your overall health and help rule out any underlying causes for your discomfort. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking and prodding, just with a needle this time? Look, I don't like needles. And what’s the point of all this, anyway? Is it gonna fix my belly, or not? Just tell me straight. Can you suck it in, or can’t you? That’s all I wanna know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I wish I could simply “suck it in” for you, but unfortunately, it’s not that simple. The blood work will help us determine why your abdomen is enlarged and uncomfortable. It's not about finding a quick fix, but about identifying the root cause. It helps rule out things like infections, liver problems, or other issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. It's a standard test, and it will give us valuable information to make the best decision about how to proceed. We can discuss the results and options afterward. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And don't tell me it’ll be “just a little pinch.” I know what needles feel like. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. I'll need to draw a few vials of blood. The nurse will be in shortly to do that. While we wait, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. They give me a little white pill for the pressure, like I said. And I had a shot for… something… when I was younger. Traveling, it was. But I don't remember the name. Never had trouble with anything, though. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. The nurse should be right in to collect the blood samples. After that, we can discuss some lifestyle adjustments that may help with your discomfort. In the meantime, are you experiencing any other symptoms, like changes in your bowel habits, weight loss, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I eat sensible! Bowel habits are… regular enough. And I ain’t lost any weight, no. If anything, I'm getting bigger! That’s the problem, isn’t it? This belly! Just… get the nurse in here, alright? I’m wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. We'll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. While we wait for the nurse, just try to relax. I’ll be right here.
