DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, let’s get on with it, shall we? I’m here for… a clearance. For a bit of work. The surgeon sent me. Don’t have all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. A surgical clearance. I understand. Just to be clear, what kind of work are you planning to have done?
PATIENT: It’s… cosmetic. A face lift. Honestly, it’s about time. My wife always said I should get one, but she… well. Doesn’t matter now. Point is, the fellow says I need a check-up first. Seems a lot of bother, if you ask me. I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: I see. A facelift. And yes, a pre-operative check-up is standard procedure, even if you're feeling well. It's just to ensure everything is optimal before you go under anesthesia. To start, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What do you mean? I eat. I sleep. I… mostly sit. Used to do a lot more, you know, with the… tiling. Terrazzo work. Very physical. Now… not so much. I get a bit of stiffness in the mornings. And my eyesight isn’t what it was. Other than that, I’m… durable. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, “durable” is good to hear. And it’s helpful to know about the previous terrazzo work – that gives me a sense of your activity level. The morning stiffness is good to know. Could you describe that stiffness a little more?
PATIENT: It’s… in my hands, mostly. And my back. Takes a bit to get going. I creak, you know? Like an old ship. Not painful, exactly. Just… reluctant. And it eases up after I’ve had a cup of coffee and hobbled around a bit. It’s just age. Not rocket science.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stiffness that improves with movement and coffee. That’s helpful information. Now, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve always been lucky. Doctor said my blood pressure was a bit high once, years ago, but he put me on something… a little pill. Stopped taking it after a while. Didn't seem to be doing much. And I don't bother with doctors much, if I can avoid it. Always telling you to do things you don't need to do.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Old age, you know. Figured it couldn't hurt. And sometimes I take something for… well, to help me sleep. Just when I can’t get off. Doesn’t work every time, mind you. It’s nothing strong. Just one of those over-the-counter things. The blue bottle. I forget the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and an occasional sleep aid. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. Don't believe in them, frankly. People just invent things these days. A little sniffle isn’t an allergy. It’s just… air. A bit of dust. Now, are we nearly done? I have an appointment with the butcher later. Good quality lamb, you know. Can't be kept waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more questions, Mr. Orwin. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My appendix, when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder when I was doing some tiling. That’s about it. Nothing serious. And again, all ages ago. Really, doctor, this is quite unnecessary. I feel perfectly fit for this operation.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a broken arm. And finally, do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… My father had a bit of a cough at the end. Lung trouble, I think. And my mother… well, she lived to be 90, so I suppose she didn’t have much trouble. Everyone on her side was strong. Look, are you sure you need all this information? The surgeon knows my medical history. He wouldn’t schedule the operation if there was a problem. I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Orwin. It’s true your surgeon likely has some of this information. However, it’s my responsibility to perform a thorough assessment before any procedure, to ensure your safety and optimize your outcome. It’s standard procedure, and doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem. Now, before we move on, would you mind if I quickly listened to your heart and lungs, and checked your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect me to sit here all day. And no cold instruments, if you please. I hate the cold. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I’ll be as quick as possible. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, though a little bit of a murmur. Your lungs are clear, but you do have slightly elevated blood pressure today, 148 over 85. I'll note that in your chart.
PATIENT: Elevated? Well, that's probably just the bother of being here. And the stress of it all. Honestly, doctor, you’re making me nervous. Can we be done now? I really must go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it seems you are generally in good health. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur I detected, and the nature of the surgery you are planning, I do recommend a few further tests. Specifically, an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm, and a basic blood panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly! Look, I'm not a fan of poking and prodding. I've lived a long life, I've never needed all these fancy tests. If the surgeon says I'm fit, I'm fit! I'm telling you, I feel perfectly fine. This is a complete waste of my time. I think I've had enough. I'll talk to my surgeon, and we'll see. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, but I must emphasize that these tests are for your safety. It’s not about questioning the surgeon’s judgment, it’s about ensuring we have a complete picture before proceeding with any procedure, especially one requiring anesthesia. If you're unwilling to proceed with the tests at this time, I strongly recommend postponing the surgery until you’ve had a complete medical evaluation. I can provide you with a referral to a cardiologist for a more thorough assessment, if you wish. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but I want you to be aware of the potential risks involved.
