DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… pain. Yes, pain when I… when I breathe deep. It's… hard to explain exactly. It just hurts when I take a big breath. Been happening a little while now, I think. Not sure how long, to be honest. Old man problems, probably.
DOCTOR: “Old man problems,” you say. While I appreciate your… candor, Mr. Ruocco, dismissing symptoms isn’t particularly helpful. “A little while now” isn’t very specific. Can you give me a better estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh… a few months, maybe? It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s barely there, other times… well, like today. Hard to say for sure. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. I used to build things, big things… construction, that was my life. But things… fade.
DOCTOR: Construction, alright. And this pain… is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, something else?
PATIENT: Dull, I think. Not sharp, no. More like… a pressure. Right here…… in my chest. It doesn’t go up to my arm or anything. Just… here. And it feels worse when I… try to do something. Like walking fast, or even just reaching for something.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does anything relieve the pain, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Resting, mostly. Just… sitting still. Not doing much. I don’t really… do much anymore. It’s hard to explain. It's just… easier when I don't push myself. Is that… helpful? I don’t know what you want me to say.
DOCTOR: It's… adequate. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart. Please take a deep breath for me when I tell you. And I'll need to feel around your chest a bit. Just to get a better understanding of what's going on. It's a standard procedure, Mr. Ruocco. It will be quicker if you cooperate.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just… tell me what you’re doing, alright? I don’t like surprises. And… be gentle, please. My ribs… they get sore easily.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I'm just going to listen to your breathing, front and back. Take a deep breath in… and out. Good. Again. Breathing sounds… somewhat diminished on the left side. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Now, I’m going to palpate your chest. I'm just feeling for tenderness or any unusual masses. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Tenderness… present on the left lower chest wall. Not significant, but noted. Now, I need to check your pulse and blood pressure.
PATIENT: Yeah, that's… a little sore there. Been feeling that for a bit, actually. Not sure what it is. Old injury, maybe? I used to lift a lot of heavy things, you know. Construction work. It takes a toll on your body.
DOCTOR: Construction work. Yes, you’ve mentioned that. Pulse is 82, blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now, Mr. Ruocco, I’d like to get a chest X-ray. It will help me rule out anything serious. Do you have any metal implants or anything that might interfere with the X-ray?
PATIENT: X-ray? Metal… uh. I don’t think so. Maybe a filling in my tooth? But that’s it. I had a bad fall a long time ago, broke my arm, but they took the cast off years ago. I don't feel anything in there anymore. Is it… safe? I don’t like radiation. I read things…
DOCTOR: The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is minimal, Mr. Ruocco. It’s significantly less than what you receive from a cross-country flight. And yes, a dental filling won't interfere. It’s a standard diagnostic procedure. It's necessary to rule out pneumonia, a collapsed lung, or something more concerning. We'll need to go down the hall to radiology. Can you walk alright?
PATIENT: I can walk. Slow, maybe. My knees aren’t what they used to be. But I can walk. Just… take it easy, alright? And… what if it is something bad? I don't want any… procedures. I’m an old man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: We will cross that bridge when, and if, we come to it, Mr. Ruocco. Worrying prematurely is unproductive. Let’s get the X-ray first. I’ll explain everything afterward. It's much easier to discuss options once we have more information. The technician will need you to remove any jewelry or metal objects you’re wearing. Come on, let’s go.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… be patient, Doctor. I'm not as quick as I used to be. And… what about my wallet? Will I need that? Or my phone? I like to have my phone.
DOCTOR: Yes, bring your phone. And your wallet, if you wish. The radiology department has secure storage, but I see no reason to leave them behind if it makes you more comfortable. Now, let's proceed. The longer we delay, the more anxious you become, and frankly, the less productive this appointment will be. I'll walk with you.
PATIENT: Anxious is an understatement, Doctor. I just don't like doctors. Never have. Too many… poking and prodding. And… what if they find something? I don't want any surprises. Just tell me everything, alright? No secrets.
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I assure you, my intention is not to cause you distress. However, I cannot provide a diagnosis or discuss treatment options without a proper assessment. That is the purpose of the X-ray. As for "secrets," I adhere to the highest ethical standards. Everything will be explained to you in a clear and understandable manner. Now, can we please proceed to radiology?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just… lead the way. I’m getting too old for all this fuss. And… try not to poke too much, alright? It hurts my ribs.
DOCTOR: I make no promises regarding "poking," Mr. Ruocco. A thorough examination is necessary. The radiology department is just around the corner. Please try to remain calm, and listen to the technician's instructions. They will explain everything to you. Here we are. I'll be waiting outside.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Honestly. Some people… .
