DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Though frankly, I haven’t much time for pleasantries. It's… work. The students these days. Utterly lacking in respect for knowledge, you understand. It's causing a… disturbance. A rather significant one, if you must know. I suppose that’s what you call burnout, isn't it? Though I find the term… simplistic.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds as though you’re experiencing considerable stress related to your work. “Burnout” is indeed a broad term, and it’s important to explore exactly what you’re feeling. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about your work?
PATIENT: My work? Really, Doctor. I am a Library Science Teacher, Postsecondary. I impart knowledge – or at least, attempt to – to young people who seem to think everything can be found on… the internet. It's a thankless task, I assure you. And the administration… well, let's just say they’re not terribly supportive of maintaining standards. Though, what do they know? It’s all very… disruptive. Do you need specifics, or is that sufficient? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, thank you. Library Science Teacher, postsecondary… I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like you are passionate about your field and committed to upholding standards, which is admirable. And it's certainly understandable that changes in how information is accessed and administrative support can be sources of stress. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a typical day at work?
PATIENT: A typical day? Honestly, Doctor, it’s a parade of… inadequacies. Lectures, mostly. Though ‘lecture’ feels rather generous. More like… attempts at communication with individuals who prefer moving pictures to the written word. Then there’s grading – an endless cycle of poorly researched papers. And meetings. Oh, the meetings. Endless discussions about… curriculum adjustments and “student engagement.” Honestly, it's a waste of perfectly good time. I suppose there’s some cataloging involved, but even that is becoming automated. It’s all rather… demoralizing. Are we finished? I believe I mentioned my luncheon.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're feeling increasingly frustrated and undervalued in your role. The sense of losing control and the constant struggle to maintain standards can certainly be demoralizing. To help me assess the impact this is having on you, could you tell me a little about how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Feeling? Doctor, I am a rational man. I don’t dwell on ‘feelings’. However… I suppose I have been… less enthusiastic. I find myself… irritable. And I haven’t been sleeping particularly well. Though that could be the new mattress. It’s rather… firm. And my appetite… fluctuates. But honestly, that's probably just the weather. It’s been quite humid, you know. Are we getting anywhere? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schlatterer. It takes courage to acknowledge these things, even when you prefer to focus on rationality. So, you've experienced decreased enthusiasm, increased irritability, difficulty sleeping, and fluctuations in your appetite. These can all be signs of stress and burnout. To get a more complete picture, and rule out any other potential causes, may I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Good heavens. Must we? I suppose… very well. But make it quick, Doctor. I assure you, it’s largely unremarkable. I had the flu, once, many years ago. And a rather unpleasant bout of indigestion in 1987. Beyond that… nothing of consequence. I’ve always been a remarkably healthy individual. Just… increasingly exasperated, I suppose. Do proceed, but please, be brief. I have a reputation to uphold, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. Just a few quick questions to establish a baseline. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? Heart disease? Doctor, are you implying something? I assure you, I maintain a perfectly sensible diet – mostly. And I walk – when the weather permits. The very suggestion! No, absolutely not. Perfectly healthy, as I said. Though, my wife… ex-wife, now… she had a touch of arthritis. But that was entirely her own doing. All that gardening, you see. Really, I fail to see the relevance. Are we nearing the end of this… inquiry?
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Schlatterer. And I apologize if my questions seemed presumptuous. It’s simply part of a standard assessment. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hospitalized? Goodness, no. Utterly unnecessary. I maintain a robust constitution, as I've stated. Though… I did have a rather bothersome wisdom tooth extracted in my youth. A minor procedure, hardly worthy of mention. And once, I sprained my ankle playing… well, never mind. It was a long time ago. Frankly, Doctor, this feels like an interrogation. I’m a teacher, not a patient. Are we finished? I have commitments. Important commitments. I believe I’ve answered sufficiently. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. Now, regarding medications – are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
