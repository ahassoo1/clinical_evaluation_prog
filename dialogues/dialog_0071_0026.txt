DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. I'm Dr. Galena. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful tiredness. I don’t get up to much these days, not like I used to. Used to be a strong woman, you know. Commercial diving isn’t for the faint of heart. But now… I just feel drained. And the young man at the lab said something about my numbers being… off? Something about my muscles, I think. Honestly, all this talk goes right over my head.
DOCTOR: Right, tiredness…and something about lab results. Okay. Commercial diving – that is demanding work! And don't worry about the numbers, that's what I'm here for. Let’s try and sort through this. When did you start noticing this tiredness, Ardelle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I start…? It’s been creeping up on me, I suppose. Not all at once. Maybe… six months ago? No, longer. A year, maybe? It’s hard to say. Everything just feels… slow. And I’ve been sleeping more, but it doesn’t help, you know? It’s not a restful sleep. My husband, Tenzing, keeps telling me I look pale. He worries too much, that man. But he’s a good man. Very good.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset over a year… and not feeling rested despite more sleep. That's helpful to know. And Tenzing noticing you look pale… that's good he's paying attention. Now, besides the tiredness and paleness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Let me think. Well, my bones ache a bit sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. Mostly in the mornings, getting out of bed. And I seem to… stumble more than I used to. Nothing serious, just a little wobbly. And I’ve lost my appetite. Everything just tastes… bland. Tenzing makes lovely curries, he really does, but I just don’t enjoy them like I used to. It's probably just old age, really. Things wear out, don't they?
DOCTOR: Bone aches in the mornings, some unsteadiness, and a decreased appetite… and things not tasting as good as they used to. Alright. And has anything specifically worsened these symptoms?
PATIENT: Worsened…? Hmm. Not really. They just… are. It's not like I do much to worsen them. I mostly sit and watch television these days. Although, after a bit of gardening, I feel absolutely exhausted. And I do try to help Tenzing with the cooking, but even that leaves me breathless. It's just… frustrating. I used to be able to do anything.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ardelle. It sounds like even gentle activities are becoming difficult. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any health conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, the doctor back in Bhutan—years ago now—he said I had something with my blood pressure. It went up and down, he said. Put me on a little pill for it. I took it for a while, but it made me feel dizzy, so I stopped. And I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. That healed alright, thank goodness. Mostly just aches now, when the weather changes. And I get these… little spells of dizziness sometimes. Not often, thankfully. Is that what you need to know? I forget things so easily these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of blood pressure issues—stopped medication due to dizziness—a past wrist fracture and occasional dizziness. And you mentioned spells of dizziness...can you describe those?
PATIENT: Oh, they’re just… a wooziness, really. Like the room is spinning just a bit. It doesn’t last long, a few seconds maybe. Usually happens when I stand up too quickly. Tenzing is always telling me to be careful. He’s a worrier, I tell you. He makes me sit down before I even think about standing. It’s just… inconvenient. I want to be independent. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand wanting your independence. And that sounds like what we call positional dizziness – happening when you change positions quickly. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pill you stopped?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Just a little something for my arthritis sometimes. When my knuckles are particularly bad. It’s a little cream, I rub it on. Tenzing gets it for me at the pharmacy. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me to take it, something about not getting enough sunshine. I try to remember to take it, but…well, you know how it is. Everything just gets jumbled up in my head these days. It’s not like I’m sick, though. Just…tired. Very, very tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, topical cream for arthritis, vitamin D supplement. And you’re feeling very tired… Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or insects?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… Let me think. I don't think so, not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything. Tenzing likes to experiment with different spices, and I’ve never had a reaction. And I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything in years. I used to be very careful when I was diving, though. You have to be aware of everything, you know? It’s a dangerous job. But now…I mostly just sit. And I’m not allergic to anything I know of, no. Just…tired. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Ardelle. You're giving me a lot of helpful information, thank you. Now, let's talk a bit about your family. Are there any health conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… Well, my mother, she had…something with her heart, I think. She was always very frail. She didn’t live a long life. And my father, he had bad knees. He was a farmer, always working the land. He was a strong man, but his knees gave out in the end. And my brother, he had… something with his memory, I think. He was a bit forgetful towards the end. Not like me, though. I still know who everyone is, mostly. It’s just… the little things I forget. It’s probably just old age, really. Everything wears out, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: History of heart problems in your mother, knee problems in your father, and some memory issues in your brother. Alright. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? Oh, goodness. What does that even mean? Well, like I said, I mostly sit. I watch television. I try to help Tenzing with the cooking, but I don’t do much heavy lifting. We don’t go out much anymore. It’s too much effort. We used to travel, years ago, when I was diving. Went to all sorts of exotic places. But now… mostly just quiet. I try to eat healthy, Tenzing makes sure of that. He’s very particular about my diet. And I don’t drink much alcohol, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. It’s a very…sedentary lifestyle, I suppose. Very quiet. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m just stating the obvious.
DOCTOR: Sedentary, quiet lifestyle... Alright. And finally, Ardelle, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit! My mother always said they were terrible for your health, and I always listened to my mother. Tenzing doesn’t smoke either. He’s a very healthy man, very careful about what he puts into his body. No, never smoked. Never will. It's a dreadful thing, smoking. Absolutely dreadful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ardelle. That's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn't take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's necessary. I'm not one to object. Although, I'm not very good with all the medical things. Always a bit nervous when doctors start poking and prodding. But if you think it will help, then go ahead. Just be gentle, please? My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are a little faint, but regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness… a little bit of fullness, but nothing concerning. Blood pressure is 110/70, pulse is 60. Temperature is normal. You said you've been feeling pale?
PATIENT: Yes, Tenzing keeps telling me so. He says I’m looking like a ghost. Not that I can see it myself, but he's very observant. Always has been. So, what does it all mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I don't want to be a bother, you know. And I certainly don't want to end up in a hospital. I like my quiet life.
DOCTOR: Ardelle, you’re not a bother at all. And I understand your concerns. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, several things could be going on. The tiredness, paleness, diminished reflexes, and decreased appetite are concerning. Your blood pressure is a little low, which could contribute to the tiredness. The faint heart sounds are also something we need to investigate. I suspect it might be anemia, a low red blood cell count, which can cause all of those symptoms. However, there are other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us check your red blood cell count, your thyroid levels, your vitamin levels, and other important things. It's a routine test, and it shouldn't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work… More poking and prodding, you mean? I don’t like needles very much. But… if you think it's necessary, then alright. I suppose I can manage. Will it be very painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to wait for weeks and weeks. I just want to feel normal again, you know? A little energy would be wonderful. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be nervous, Ardelle. The blood draw itself is usually quick, and most people don’t find it very painful—just a little pinch. It will only take a few minutes. And the results usually come back within a few days – I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, try to eat iron-rich foods if you can—lean meats, leafy green vegetables, and fortified cereals. And stay hydrated. But the most important thing is to get the blood work done so we can figure out what’s going on. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood for you right now, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Iron-rich foods…I'll try my best. Tenzing is a wonderful cook, he makes a lovely spinach curry, so that might help. And spinach is green, isn’t it? Very well. Let's get it over with then. The sooner I know, the better. Just… try not to poke too hard, alright? I’m an old woman, you know. And tell your nurse to be gentle, too. I don’t want to be bruised all over. Lead the way, then. Let’s get this blood work done.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ardelle. I will personally make sure everything goes smoothly. And I'll ask the nurse to be very gentle. Please come with me, and I'll introduce you to her. She’s very experienced and will take good care of you. We’ll have answers soon, I promise. We’ll get you feeling better. .
