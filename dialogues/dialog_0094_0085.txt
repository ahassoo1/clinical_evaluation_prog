DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Yes, well, it's this… patch on my skin. It’s quite bothersome, really. Not that I don’t take care of myself, you understand. It’s just… appeared.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. “Appeared” – could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it wasn’t there a few weeks ago, certainly. I’m very observant, you see. I do a lot of work with old documents, very detailed work. And I noticed it after a weekend at my in-laws’. Honestly, their house is… not known for its cleanliness. It’s probably something I picked up there. Though I did sanitize thoroughly when I got back.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So, it presented after a weekend visit, and you've noticed it since then, despite sanitizing. Can you describe the patch for me?
PATIENT: It’s… brownish. Not a pleasant brown, mind you. More of a muddy sort of color. And it's flat. Not raised or bumpy, thankfully. It's on my forearm, here. . About the size of a quarter, maybe a little smaller. It doesn’t itch, which is good, but it doesn't look good.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see it. Brownish, flat patch, about the size of a quarter on your inner forearm. No redness or swelling that I can see at first glance, and you said it's not itchy. Has it changed in size or shape at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: No, not that I've observed. I mean, I look at it. Regularly. It's… concerning to have something new appear. I'm very careful with my skin, always have been. I’ve never had anything like this before. My mother always said Ukrainians have delicate complexions.
DOCTOR: That’s good you’ve been keeping a close watch on it. It's always best to investigate something new. And your mother is right – everyone's skin is different. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any other changes on your skin recently – any new moles, freckles, or other unusual spots anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I assure you. I perform a self-examination every month, religiously. After my aunt… well, it’s best not to dwell on it. But, yes, I’m very diligent. I’m quite healthy overall. Good diet, regular walks… nothing too strenuous, of course. I wouldn’t want to overdo it.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear. Staying on top of things is excellent. And you mentioned a good diet and regular walks – that's fantastic. Now, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not much to tell, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. No allergies, thankfully. My husband is the one who gets every bug that goes around. I’m very careful to avoid whatever he brings home. I’ve had my Medicare check-ups, of course, everything’s always been… normal. Perfectly normal.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even a tonsillectomy. I’m rather… delicate, you see. I bruise easily, so I avoid anything risky. My husband keeps trying to get me to take up golf, but I told him absolutely not. Far too dangerous.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… some skin issues, years ago. Nothing diagnosed, just… sun spots, mostly. She was a farmer, you see. Always out in the sun. And my father… he had heart problems, but that’s on his side of the family. Not really relevant, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to complete the picture, could you tell me if you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I prefer to… be natural, you understand. I eat a very healthy diet, and I get plenty of rest. My husband tries to give me vitamins, but I always refuse. He means well, but I don’t need them.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to take a closer look at the patch and perhaps do a quick examination of your skin overall, just to be thorough. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Though I do hope it isn’t anything… unpleasant. I really do try to take good care of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. The patch is flat, as you said, and the skin feels normal to the touch. No tenderness when I press on it. I don’t see any other concerning spots on your hands, neck or face. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing, but based on what I see now, it could be a number of things - a simple age spot, a mild reaction to something, or even a benign growth. To be certain, I’d like to perform a skin scraping, a very quick and painless procedure, to look at the cells under a microscope. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A scraping? Oh dear. Is it really necessary? I mean, couldn't it just be… stress? I did have a rather difficult time with my sister recently. She's… well, that's another story. But perhaps it's just a manifestation of that. I'd rather not have anything… invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Bartock. It's a very reasonable concern. The scraping is quite superficial – we simply take a tiny sample of cells from the surface of the skin. It’s not invasive at all and usually doesn’t cause any discomfort. It will give us a much clearer idea of what we’re dealing with and help us rule out anything more serious. While stress can sometimes manifest as skin changes, it's always best to investigate any new growth to be on the safe side. We can also discuss other options if you'd prefer - perhaps monitoring it closely over the next few weeks and seeing if it changes, but I would feel more comfortable having a sample to examine. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… if it's truly not painful, and it’s just a tiny sample… I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get it checked. But please, be very gentle. And don't poke around too much. I have… sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bartock. I will be very gentle. We'll just take a very small sample, and it will be over quickly. I’ll explain everything as I go. Let me just prepare the area with a gentle cleanser.
PATIENT: Alright. Do be careful. And perhaps… tell me what you’re doing as you go? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I’m just applying a gentle cleanser to ensure the area is clean. Now, I’m going to use a small scalpel blade – it looks intimidating, but it's very shallow, just a gentle scrape across the surface of the skin. It may feel like a slight scratch, but it shouldn't be painful. There, that's done. Just a tiny sample. I’ll apply a small bandage to protect the area. Now, I'll take this sample to the lab, and it should take about a week to get the results. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, just keep the area clean and dry. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A week? Oh dear. That seems a long time to be… uncertain. Very well. No, I don’t suppose I do. Just… call me as soon as possible. I really dislike waiting. And please, don't use any… complicated medical terms when you explain the results. I get quite flustered easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bartock. I will call you as soon as the results are available, and I promise to explain them in simple terms. I understand your anxiety about waiting, and I’ll do my best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. In the meantime, if you notice any changes – if the patch gets bigger, starts to bleed, or becomes painful – please call the office immediately. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… a week. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bartock. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions in the meantime. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. .
