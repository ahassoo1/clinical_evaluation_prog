DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Todoro… Todoro-vich, is it? Yes, good to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… now, let me think. It’s… paperwork, I believe. Something about time off? My wife, she handles most of these things, you see. Something about needing a form… for work. I think it has to do with… well, I’m not quite sure, to be honest. Is it for leave? Or… disability? She mentioned something about both, I think. It’s a bit of a blur, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Right. A form…for work. And you're unsure if it’s for leave or disability. Honestly, it’s… helpful when patients know these things. But alright. Let's start with what’s going on with you, Mr. Limtiaco. What’s been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. What’s bothering me… well, it’s not one thing, exactly. Just… feeling tired, mostly. Very tired. And a bit… achy, you know? In my bones, I think. It comes and goes. Some days are better than others. I’ve been… slowing down, I suppose. Not as much energy as I used to have. It's hard to explain. I still do my work with the church, but… it takes more effort. I don't recall anything specific causing it, just… a gradual thing. Does that make sense? I hope I'm not being too vague.
DOCTOR: "Gradual thing…" Yes, vague is putting it mildly. Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Tired and achy…and it’s been slowing you down. Let’s try to be a little more specific. When did you first start noticing this tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did I first notice it… that's a good question. I want to say… maybe last spring? Or was it the winter before? It’s difficult to pinpoint, you see. Everything sort of… blends together after a while. I think it was after a particularly busy time at the church. We had a big event, and I put in a lot of hours. It felt like I never quite recovered, to be honest. Just… didn’t bounce back like I used to. It was subtle at first, just needing a bit more sleep. But it’s gotten… more noticeable lately. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: "Subtle…" Right. So, started last spring, possibly after a busy event at the church, and hasn’t improved. Any other symptoms along with the tiredness and aches?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. Well, my wife has been saying I'm a bit more forgetful lately. Which… isn't new, if I'm being honest. But she says it's worse. I sometimes have trouble remembering names, or where I put things. Nothing major, you understand. Just… little things. And… I don’t know if this is related, but I haven't been sleeping very well. I wake up a lot during the night. Not every night, but… often enough. And maybe a little bit of… trouble concentrating? It’s hard to focus sometimes. Does that make sense, Doctor? I’m sorry if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness, trouble sleeping, difficulty concentrating…Yes, well, that’s what happens when people get older, Mr. Limtiaco. But alright. Let's get a better picture of this. You said you wake up during the night. How often would you say that happens?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I wouldn't say every night. Maybe… three or four times a week? It's hard to be precise. Sometimes I wake up once, sometimes… two or three times. I usually get back to sleep, eventually. But it’s not a very restful sleep, you understand. I toss and turn a bit, and sometimes I just lie there awake for a long time. And I often feel… groggy in the morning. Not fully refreshed, if that makes sense. My wife says I snore a lot too, but I wouldn't know about that. She’s the one who has to listen to it!
DOCTOR: Snoring… Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in my appetite… Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t know if I’d say a change exactly. I still eat, you see. I enjoy my food. But… maybe not as much as I used to? I don’t feel as hungry, sometimes. And I find myself… losing interest in things I used to like. Not just food, but… other things too. I just don't have the same… energy for them, I suppose. It’s hard to explain. It's not like I'm not eating, just… not enjoying it as much. And maybe eating smaller portions? Does that make sense, Doctor? I'm afraid I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Let's move on. Any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical problems… Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that was a long time ago. And I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but they fixed it with some… medication, I think. I’ve been taking pills for that ever since. Other than that… nothing major, I don't believe. I’ve always been a fairly healthy person, to be honest. I’ve always tried to stay active, you see. But my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I could be forgetting something. My wife would probably know more about that. Is there anything specific you're looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: "Something specific?
PATIENT: Oh! I didn't mean to be difficult, Doctor. Just… trying to recall. My wife keeps all the records, you see. I have trouble remembering all the details. Maybe… high blood pressure? I think they mentioned something about that a few years back. And… arthritis in my knees, I suppose. It bothers me sometimes, especially when it’s cold. But it’s not too bad, really. Mostly just a bit of stiffness. I'm sorry if I'm rambling. Is this helpful, Doctor? I just want to be sure I’m telling you everything you need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure, arthritis… We’ll get it all eventually. Now, are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, medications. I have a few. Let me see… for the blood pressure, I take… amlodipine, I think. Yes, amlodipine. And for my heart… something with a “-olol” in the name, I believe. I can’t recall the exact name. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees when they bother me. Nothing else, really. Just those three. My wife handles refilling them, you see. She knows all the names and dosages. I just take them as she tells me. I’m sorry I can't be more helpful, Doctor. I just want to be sure I'm telling you everything correctly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it’s… concerning that you don’t know the names of the medications you’re taking. It’s very important to be aware of these things. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. You're right, you're absolutely right. I should know these things. It's just… so many pills, you see. And my memory… well, you know. Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think I have any allergies, but I haven't really been exposed to anything new lately. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a boy, but I haven't been stung in years. And I don’t think I’m allergic to any foods. My wife makes sure I don’t eat anything that might bother me. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies, Doctor. But if you ask my wife, she might have a different answer. She's very careful about these things. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. I just want to be sure I'm telling you everything correctly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Please lie back on the exam table.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical exam. Very good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you see. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m getting a little nervous, I must admit. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little irregular. Blood pressure is elevated, as expected. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Lungs are clear to auscultation, but your breathing is a little shallow. Overall, your exam findings are consistent with the symptoms you’ve described. Now, I’m going to order some blood work and an EKG to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work and an EKG… is something wrong, Doctor? Is it serious? I’m a little worried now, I must admit. My wife will be very concerned if she finds out. Is it something I should be worried about? And when is my follow-up appointment? I hope it's not too long from now. I just want to get this sorted out as soon as possible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, let’s not jump to conclusions. These tests are just to rule things out. Your symptoms could be caused by a number of factors, and we need to investigate further. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and an EKG. The lab will draw your blood right here in the clinic, and the EKG technician will be in shortly. The results typically take a few days to come back. I’ll have the nurse schedule your follow-up appointment for next week. In the meantime, try to get some rest and avoid strenuous activity. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Rest and avoid strenuous activity… yes, I can do that. A complete blood count… a metabolic panel… a thyroid test… yes, that sounds… thorough. I suppose I don’t have any questions right now, Doctor. I’m just a little overwhelmed, to be honest. My wife will be glad to hear we’re getting things checked out. She’s the one who usually handles all these details. Just… please let me know if anything is seriously wrong, okay? I trust your judgment, Doctor. And thank you for taking the time to see me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. We'll contact you with the results. Try not to worry. .
PATIENT: Oh. Very good. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll just… wait for the nurse then. Thank you again, Doctor. Rest and avoid strenuous activity… that shouldn’t be too hard.
