DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, when I go to the bathroom. It feels like there’s always some left in there, you know? It’s been happenin’ for a little while now. Not gettin’ better, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Difficulty with complete bladder emptying. And you say this has been ongoing for “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. Maybe… three, four months now? It’s hard to say exactly. Time… it goes by fast these days. It wasn’t somethin’ I worried about right away, but it’s gettin’ more bothersome, and sometimes it feels… uncomfortable. Like somethin’ is still there, even after I try. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… full. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Three to four months of incomplete bladder emptying with a sensation of residual fullness, no pain reported. And you haven't noticed any fever, chills, or blood in your urine, have you?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. No fever, no chills. And no… red stuff. Everything looks normal, just doesn’t feel right, you know? I make sure to drink plenty of water, like I always have. Helps with everything, mostly. Though, it don’t seem to be helpin’ this problem.
DOCTOR: Right. So, consistently drinking adequate fluids. Have you experienced any changes in your urinary stream – weakness, hesitancy, or dribbling – alongside this incomplete emptying?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, sometimes it takes a little bit to start. Not every time, but some days I gotta push a little, you know? And the stream ain’t as strong as it used to be, I reckon. It’s kinda… weaker, like it’s not as powerful as it once was. Never really thought much of it, just figured it was… gettin’ old, maybe. But it's happenin' more often lately, same as the other thing.
DOCTOR: Hesitancy and a diminished urinary stream, in addition to incomplete emptying. Do you have any history of diabetes, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, ma'am. Never been told I had diabetes. I go to the clinic for check-ups when I need to, but they never said nothin' about that. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and berries, the way my wife used to make it. She always said a good diet was the best medicine. But… she’s gone now. It’s been a few years. Sorry, I didn’t mean to… wander off. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And I appreciate you sharing that. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Aside from this current issue, have you ever been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… let me think. When I was a young man, I broke my arm fallin’ out of a tree, but that was a long time ago. And I had my appendix taken out, I think. That was… maybe fifty years ago? Other than that… nothin’ much. I always been a pretty healthy fella, until lately. I haven’t been sick with the flu or nothin’ like that in years. Mostly just gettin’ old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: No significant past medical history besides a childhood broken arm and an appendectomy many years ago. Have you had any surgeries other than the appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Just the appendix. Never needed nothin’ else taken out or fixed. My wife, she had her gallbladder taken out once, but I never had any trouble with mine. Except… Oh! When I was real young, I had my tonsils out, I think. But that was so long ago, I barely remember it. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not a one. I don’t like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. My wife, she had somethin' for her arthritis, but I never needed nothin'. I try to take care of myself, eat good food and stay warm. I do take a little fish oil sometimes, for my joints. Helps a little with the aches and pains, but that's it. Just the fish oil, when I remember.
DOCTOR: Fish oil occasionally. And you have no known allergies to medications or anything else, correct?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never been allergic to nothin'. I can eat any kind of berries, any kind of fish, never had a problem. My wife, she was allergic to bee stings, but I never had that trouble. I ain't had no allergies, that I know of. Always been lucky that way, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’ll need to check your abdomen, and I’ll also perform a digital rectal exam. This will allow me to assess your prostate gland and check for any abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a what now, Doctor? You wanna… check me where? I… I ain't comfortable with that, if you don't mind. I don’t understand why you gotta do that just to find out why I can't empty my water all the way. Is there another way? I’m an old man, Doctor, and I ain't used to folks… pokin' around down there. I’d rather just try somethin’ else first, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, I understand your discomfort, but a digital rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating urinary issues in men. It allows me to assess the size and consistency of your prostate, which can often be a cause of incomplete bladder emptying. Without this examination, it’s difficult to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. I assure you, this is a necessary step. It is quick and, while not entirely comfortable, should not be overly painful. We take every precaution to ensure your privacy and comfort. However, if you absolutely refuse, we can proceed without it, but be aware that this will significantly limit my ability to diagnose and treat your condition. It may necessitate referral to a urologist for further evaluation, which would likely include this exam anyway. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A urologist…? That sounds… expensive. And complicated. I just want somethin’ to help me empty my water all the way, Doctor. I don’t want a whole lot of… procedures. Is there anything else we can try first? Maybe some pills? Or… a test? I don't want no pokin’ around, if I can avoid it. I’m an old man, and things… ain't as strong as they used to be. It just feels… private, you know? And I ain't used to folks touchin' me like that. Maybe we can try the pills first? Please?
DOCTOR: Very well. While I strongly recommend the examination, I understand your reluctance. We can start with a urinalysis to rule out infection, and I'll prescribe a medication called tamsulosin. It’s an alpha-blocker that can help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder neck, potentially improving urine flow. However, I need to be clear: this is not a definitive solution. If the medication does not provide adequate relief, or if your symptoms worsen, a full urological evaluation – including a digital rectal exam – will be necessary. And delaying proper diagnosis can lead to complications. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your response to the medication. Do you have any allergies to sulfa drugs?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. No allergies to… sulfa drugs. Thank goodness. I'm glad we can try somethin’ else first. I appreciate that, Doctor. Will the medicine have… side effects? My wife, she always said every pill has a price. I don’t want to feel worse than I already do, just to empty my water all the way. And how long will it take to start workin'? I just want to feel normal again, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Tamsulosin can cause some side effects, including dizziness, lightheadedness, and retrograde ejaculation – meaning semen goes into the bladder instead of out of the penis during orgasm. These are not dangerous, but they can be bothersome. It's also important to take it with food to minimize dizziness. It usually takes a few days to a week to see noticeable improvement. If you experience significant side effects, or if your symptoms don’t improve after two weeks, you need to contact me immediately. I’ve also provided a handout with more detailed information about the medication and its potential side effects. Be sure to read it carefully. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I think… I think that's all for now. I appreciate your patience with me, Doctor. And thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. I hope this medicine works. I just want to feel like myself again. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome. Follow the instructions on the handout and schedule a follow-up appointment as instructed.
