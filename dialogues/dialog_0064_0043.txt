DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this headache I've been having. Right in the back of my head. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, let me think… about a week now, I reckon. Not constant, mind you, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And it comes and goes... can you describe the headache a bit more for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it's not a throbbing kind of pain, not like a migraine my daughter used to get. It’s more… a dull ache, like someone’s tightened a band around my head. Sometimes it feels like pressure, buildin’ up. And it doesn’t really radiate out, stays pretty much right in the back. I can still see and all that, thankfully. Just… uncomfortable. Makes it hard to concentrate on my work, you know? I do a lot of numbers, gotta be sharp.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache, pressure in the back of the head, not radiating… and affecting your concentration. That's helpful. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you say this headache usually is?
PATIENT: Oh, zero to ten… hmm. It’s rarely a ten, thankfully! Most days it’s a… maybe a three or four. Sometimes it gets up to a five, especially if I've been lookin' at a screen for too long. But it usually doesn't stay there for very long. I can usually take a break and it’ll calm down. It's just… it's there, you know? A constant worry. And it's happenin' more often lately.
DOCTOR: A three or four, spiking to a five with screen time, and it’s becoming more frequent… Alright. Have you noticed anything that makes it better besides taking a break?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… lyin' down seems to help. When I can get a good nap in, that really eases it. And a cool cloth on the back of my neck, that's good too. My wife used to do that for me when I had these years ago, before… well, before things changed. Just feelin' relaxed, I suppose. And drinkin’ plenty of water. I try to stay hydrated, you know? Old man’s gotta keep things movin’.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, staying hydrated and finding things that provide some relief. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… no fever, thankfully. No dizziness or blurry vision. No nausea or anything like that. Just… tired. I've been feelin' more tired lately, but honestly, Doctor, at my age, who isn’t? I haven’t noticed any weakness on one side or trouble speakin’. Just the headache and the tiredness. And maybe a little trouble sleepin’ sometimes, but that's usually just my mind racin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, dizziness, nausea, or neurological symptoms… Just headache, tiredness, and occasional trouble sleeping. Have you had headaches like this before, Mr. Gibbel?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. On and off for years, really. Not this frequent though, not for a long time. They used to flare up when I was stressed, workin’ long hours. Used to be a real busy man, you know? Accountin’ and all. But they always went away on their own, with rest and a bit of quiet. This one’s stickin’ around longer, and that’s what’s botherin’ me. And it’s a little… sharper, maybe, than I remember. Not by much, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright, so these headaches are similar to ones you’ve experienced before, but more frequent and slightly sharper. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but that's been under control for years now with medication. Take a small pill every day, that's all. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for an old man. I try to eat right, walk when I can, and I don’t smoke or drink much alcohol. My wife always said I was a stubborn case, always takin’ care of myself. She’s gone now, but I still try to live like she wanted me to. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothin’ like that. Just the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright, just controlled high blood pressure. And you’ve been managing that well with medication. Good. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was a long time ago, didn’t cause any trouble since. And I had a knee replacement about fifteen years ago. That’s it, really. Both went smoothly, no complications. Nothing major, just the usual wear and tear. Getting old ain't for the faint of heart, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. Appendix and knee replacement, both without complications. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one pill for the blood pressure. I try to avoid takin’ too many pills, if I can help it. My wife always said, "The less you put in your body, the better." She was a practical woman. I also take a multivitamin every day, just to be on the safe side. But that's it. No pain relievers or anything like that, unless I really need them, and I rarely do.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the blood pressure medication and a multivitamin. Now, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I eat all sorts of foods, no problems there. Been lucky in that regard, I suppose. No hay fever, no dust allergies, nothin’ like that. My wife used to tease me, said I had a cast iron stomach. She was always lookin' out for me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… my mother had arthritis when she got older, real bad in her hands. And my father had heart trouble later in life, but he didn’t take care of himself like he should have. Smoked and drank too much, I reckon. My sister had high blood pressure too, but she managed it with medication, like me. No history of cancer or anythin’ really serious, that I know of. It was a small family, mostly just us three kids. We didn’t talk about medical history much, back then.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis, heart trouble, and high blood pressure in the family. Now, just a couple more questions before we do a quick exam. What do you do for work, or did you retire already?
PATIENT: Oh, I retired a good few years back. I was an accountant, mostly did taxes and bookkeepin’ for small businesses. Spent my life with numbers, you know? Still do a little helpin’ out now and then for friends, keeps my mind sharp. But mostly I just enjoy my garden, spend time with my grandkids, and try to stay busy. It’s a good life, even without workin’ all the time.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely. Keeping busy is good. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been a smoker. I used to have a beer or two with dinner sometimes, but I haven't had any alcohol in years. My wife didn’t like it, and frankly, I don’t miss it. And no, never touched any recreational drugs. Always been a straight and narrow man, I reckon. Always believed in takin’ care of myself, and livin’ a clean life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel, thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I've always believed in gettin' checked out when somethin' feels off. And I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm going to start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I’ll do a quick neurological exam, just to make sure everything is working as it should. Just relax and breathe normally. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning, given your history. Now, let me listen to your heart. Sounds are regular, but a slight murmur. I’ve noted that in your chart from previous visits. Now, your lungs… Lungs are clear. Ears and throat look clear as well. Now, let's do a quick check of your reflexes... Reflexes are normal. Finally, I’ll check your strength and sensation. Can you squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: There you go. Feels pretty strong to me. And how about this? Feels alright, Doctor. Nothing feels weak or numb. I still have a good grip, and I can feel everything just fine. It's just this headache… and a little tiredness, like I said. But everything else seems to be workin' just fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, strength and sensation are normal. Good. Overall, your physical exam is largely unremarkable, with the exception of the slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur, which we already knew about. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you're dealing with a tension headache, likely related to stress or concentration. The tiredness could be contributing as well, and we should consider some lifestyle factors. However, given your age and the fact that this headache is new and persistent, I want to be cautious and rule out anything more serious. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out anything structural. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI, huh? Well… I’ve never had one of those before. But if you think it’s best, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. I’d rather be safe than sorry, especially at my age. A little worried, I reckon, but I understand you’re just bein’ thorough. Yes, go ahead and schedule the MRI and the blood tests. Whatever you think is best to figure out what’s goin’ on. Just hope it’s not somethin’ too serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Gibbel. It's always unsettling to consider the possibility of something serious, but most of the time, these headaches are benign. The MRI is just a precaution, and the blood tests will give us a good baseline. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and the imaging center right away. They'll contact you to schedule the appointments. The lab work should only take a few minutes, and the MRI will take a little longer, about 30-45 minutes. Here’s a requisition form for the lab work and information about preparing for the MRI. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, as needed, for the headache. Stay hydrated, try to get plenty of rest, and manage your stress levels. Avoid prolonged screen time if possible. I also want you to be aware of any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, stiff neck, blurry vision, weakness, or difficulty speaking. If you experience any of those, go to the emergency room immediately. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results of the tests, to discuss the findings and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. I appreciate you bein’ so thorough, and explainin’ everything so clearly. I'll try to stay calm and follow your instructions. I'll get the tests done as soon as I can, and I'll keep an eye out for any new symptoms. And I will definitely let you know if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. I reckon I'll head home now and rest a bit. Hopefully, this headache won't stick around too long.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. Get some rest, and we’ll talk soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day now. And thank you for your time.
