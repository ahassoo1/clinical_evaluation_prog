DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it's... a bit embarrassing to talk about, but a friend suggested I look into this PrEP thing. She said it could help, and well, I figured it couldn't hurt to ask. I'm Helaina, by the way.
DOCTOR: It’s no cause for embarrassment at all, Helaina. We discuss all aspects of preventative healthcare here, and I appreciate you bringing this up. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a very effective method for HIV prevention, and it’s wonderful that your friend mentioned it. To ensure it’s the right option for you, and to understand your individual needs, I’d like to ask you a few questions, if that’s alright. We’ll cover some medical history, lifestyle factors, and then discuss the medication itself in detail. First, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Sure, that sounds good. Overall… I’m okay, I guess. I’m 55, and I try to stay active, mostly walking. I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, nothing major. I’m single, never been married. I’m on Medicare, which is… helpful. I don't really go to the doctor much unless I absolutely have to, you know? It's just… never seemed necessary before. Is that enough for now?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good start, Helaina. Thank you. Walking is excellent! And it’s good to know you’re generally healthy. The arthritis is noted. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with, or any surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Let me think... Nothing major, really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long, long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. Honestly, that’s about it. No serious illnesses, no diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I've been pretty lucky, I think. Though, my mother had high blood pressure, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Knowing about your mother’s high blood pressure is good information. Family history is important. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just some ibuprofen sometimes, for my knees when they're acting up. And a multivitamin, every morning. That's it. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills when I can, honestly. I don't like feeling… medicated, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Many people feel the same way. Okay, ibuprofen as needed and a daily multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. I’ve been stung by bees a few times, but just a little bit of swelling, nothing serious. I don't think I’ve ever had a true allergic reaction, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, before we discuss PrEP specifically, I'd like to ask a few more personal questions, if you don’t mind. These questions are important for assessing your risk and ensuring this medication is the right choice for you. They will be kept confidential, of course. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Um… yes. I am. It’s… complicated. I’ve been with the same person for a little while now, but it's not exclusive. We both… see other people sometimes. It's just… how things are, I guess. I don't really like talking about it, but I want to be honest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Helaina. Thank you for being honest with me. It’s very important that we discuss all aspects of your sexual health. And I assure you, this is a safe and confidential space. To clarify, are these partners male, female, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly male, honestly. I've had a few female partners in the past, but not recently. It’s… mostly men, these days. And, um… sometimes I don’t always know their status, if you know what I mean. That's… part of why I’m here, I guess. It's hard to ask, you know? And sometimes… people aren't truthful.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Helaina. It can be very difficult to have those conversations, and it’s commendable that you’re taking the initiative to protect your health. It sounds like you're aware of the potential risks involved, and that's a very important step. To help me assess your overall risk, could you tell me if you’ve ever been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection, or STI?
PATIENT: Yes. A long time ago. When I was younger. I… I had gonorrhea, once. It was… a difficult time. And I think… maybe chlamydia too, but I'm not entirely sure. It was treated, though. Years ago. I haven't had anything since, but it… it made me more cautious, I guess. That’s why I'm here now. It's just… I don't want to go through that again. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Helaina. Thank you for sharing that with me. It takes courage to discuss these things, and knowing your history is vital for making the best decisions about your health. It's good that it was treated, and that you’ve been cautious since then. Now, let's talk about PrEP itself. Do you have any questions for me about how it works, potential side effects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A lot, probably. My friend said you take a pill every day, but… what happens if I miss a day? And… are there bad side effects? Like, will I get sick? And… what if my partner doesn’t know I’m taking it? I don't want to… cause problems. It's… complicated. Honestly, I'm a little scared. I don’t want this to be… difficult.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Helaina, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a little scared. We’ll address each one. First, regarding missing a day: PrEP is most effective when taken consistently. Missing a day doesn't mean it stops working immediately, but it does lower the level of medication in your system. If you miss one dose, take it as soon as you remember, and don’t double up on the next day. If you miss several doses, it’s best to get tested for HIV to ensure you haven't been exposed, and to restart PrEP as soon as possible. As for side effects, most people experience very few. The most common are mild nausea, headache, or fatigue, which usually go away within a week or two. Serious side effects are rare, but they can include kidney problems or bone density loss, which is why we’ll need to do regular blood tests to monitor your health. Regarding your partner, you are absolutely not obligated to disclose you’re taking PrEP. It’s a personal decision. However, open communication about sexual health is always recommended, if you feel comfortable. Before we proceed, it is important to understand that PrEP does not protect against other STIs, so regular STI testing remains essential. Would you like me to explain the testing process for HIV and STIs, as well as the blood tests required for PrEP?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be helpful. I feel a little overwhelmed, honestly. And... what about cost? I'm on Medicare, but will it cover all of this? It's… a lot to think about, and I don't want any surprises. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, by the way. It's… reassuring.
DOCTOR: You're right to feel overwhelmed, Helaina. There is a lot of information. We'll take it one step at a time. Let's start with the testing. For HIV testing, we can do a blood test here in the clinic. We'll also need to test for other STIs, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and potentially others depending on your risk factors. These tests are also done with a blood sample. We typically recommend testing every three months while you're on PrEP. As for the blood tests required for PrEP, we need to check your kidney function, liver function, and CD4 count – which is a measure of your immune system strength. We'll also need to test for hepatitis B virus, as PrEP can sometimes reactivate it. Regarding cost, Medicare Part B generally covers the office visits required for PrEP, including the STI testing. However, the PrEP medication itself can be expensive. Fortunately, there are several programs available to help cover the cost, including the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and manufacturer assistance programs. We have a dedicated financial counselor here at the clinic who can help you navigate these programs and determine your eligibility. I will have her reach out to you after our consultation to discuss your options. Does that help clarify things a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… much better. Knowing there's help with the cost is a big relief, honestly. And the testing… I can handle that. It's just… it's all a bit scary, you know? I've been… careful, but you never know. So, if I start taking the pill, and I miss a day… it doesn't mean I'm automatically infected? That's what I'm most worried about. And… how long does it take to start working? I don't want to… put myself at risk before it kicks in. I'm probably asking a lot of questions, I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Helaina. It's important to address all your concerns, and I appreciate you being so open. To answer your question directly, missing a day of PrEP does not mean you’re automatically infected. It simply lowers the level of medication in your system, making you slightly more vulnerable to HIV exposure. It's not an immediate risk, but it's a reminder to stay consistent with the medication. As for how long it takes to start working, PrEP generally takes about 28 days to reach maximum effectiveness. However, it begins to offer some protection within a week or so. During that initial period, it’s crucial to practice safer sex – using condoms consistently – to minimize your risk. We recommend using condoms even while on PrEP, as it doesn't protect against other STIs. Before starting PrEP, we would also need to confirm you are HIV negative with a baseline test. Would you like to discuss the different types of PrEP medications available, and their potential side effects in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good. I… I think I'm ready to start. It's just… a lot to take in. I'm glad I came. It's reassuring to know there's a way to… protect myself. And… about the tests… how long will that take? And… is it painful? I'm… a little nervous about needles, if I'm honest. I apologize. I know it's silly.
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all, Helaina. It’s perfectly normal to be nervous about needles. Many people feel the same way. The tests will take about 15-20 minutes. We’ll draw a small sample of blood from your arm. Most people only feel a brief pinch, and it’s over quickly. We have a very skilled phlebotomist who is experienced in working with patients who are anxious about needles. She can use techniques to minimize discomfort, such as numbing cream or distraction techniques. There are two main PrEP medications currently available: Truvada and Descovy. Both are highly effective, but they have slightly different formulations and potential side effects. Truvada has been around longer and has a more extensive safety profile, but Descovy has a slightly lower risk of kidney problems. The choice between the two depends on your individual health factors and preferences. Before we decide which medication is right for you, we’ll need to review your medical history and discuss any other medications you’re taking. We'll also need to perform some blood tests to assess your kidney function and overall health. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you to have those tests done?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good. And… maybe if I can talk to the phlebotomist beforehand? Just to… calm my nerves a little? I really appreciate you being so patient with me, Doctor. I know I’m asking a lot of questions. And… just one more thing. If I start taking the pill, and I… I meet someone new, do I have to tell them? It feels… awkward, to just bring that up. I'm sorry. I'm probably being silly again. It's just… complicated. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Helaina. We can definitely arrange for you to speak with the phlebotomist beforehand. She's excellent at putting patients at ease. It's perfectly reasonable to want to discuss your concerns with her directly. And you are not being silly at all. Your questions are important, and I’m happy to address them. Regarding disclosing PrEP to a new partner, you are not legally obligated to do so. However, open communication about sexual health is always recommended. It allows you both to make informed decisions about safer sex practices. You can frame it as a way to protect both of your health. It's a personal decision, and you can choose what you feel comfortable sharing. Some people find it helpful to discuss it before any sexual activity, while others prefer to wait until they’ve established a closer relationship. I'm glad you came in today, Helaina. I think PrEP can be a very effective tool for protecting your health, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let me schedule you for an appointment next week to have the blood tests done and meet with the phlebotomist. Does Tuesday afternoon work for you?
