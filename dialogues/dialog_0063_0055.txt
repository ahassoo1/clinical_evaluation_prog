DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's try to be brief, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Brief is always preferable, in my experience. Though I must say, I do find these waiting rooms…lacking. But never mind that now. I understand you're the one who can assist me with this…medical marijuana matter?
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. That is precisely what I said. My daughter, bless her heart, has been quite insistent. She says it’s the modern cure for…well, a number of things. Frankly, I find the whole concept rather…undignified. But one tries to be open-minded, I suppose. And she’s the one who found you, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what, specifically, are you hoping to address with this… “treatment”?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not for me, Doctor. Not directly. It’s for my sleep. I’ve always been a light sleeper, you see, and these recent… disturbances are quite bothersome. My daughter assures me this will allow me to rest without resorting to…stronger measures. She says it’s perfectly legal now, and far safer than those pills the other doctors kept pushing. Though I still have my reservations.
DOCTOR: Sleep disturbances. And you’ve tried other remedies, I presume?
PATIENT: Oh, countless. Warm milk, chamomile tea, a darkened room… even one of those weighted blankets my granddaughter insisted upon. Honestly, it felt like sleeping under a sack of potatoes. No lasting effect, I assure you. And the doctor before this one wanted me on… something that sounded rather unpleasant. I distinctly recall the word “dependence” being mentioned. I’d rather suffer a few sleepless nights than risk that.
DOCTOR: And how long have these disturbances been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It comes and goes, you understand. But it’s been particularly troublesome these last… six months, perhaps? Ever since my sister passed, if I'm being truthful. Not that grief excuses a lack of sleep, mind you, but it certainly doesn’t help. It's just… unsettling, waking up at all hours. And my husband, bless his heart, snores like a lumberjack.
DOCTOR: Six months. And are there any other symptoms accompanying this insomnia?
PATIENT: Well… no, not really. Just…tiredness, naturally. And a slight irritability, perhaps. My husband says I'm more "particular" than usual. He always has a way with words, that man. But nothing serious, Doctor. Just…the usual complaints of someone who isn't getting enough rest. I don't go around imagining things or anything like that. I assure you, my mind is perfectly sharp.
DOCTOR: Very well. And your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I had a rather nasty bout of influenza in '87, and a touch of bronchitis a few years back. My knees are beginning to give me trouble – it's the weather, you know – and I had my gallbladder removed in '92. Otherwise, quite healthy, all things considered. I’ve always been a very active woman. I don't believe in letting myself go. And I’ve never been one for complaining, Doctor. Unless absolutely necessary, of course. Do you need specifics? Dates? I don't keep a detailed ledger of my ailments, you understand.
DOCTOR: Just the gallbladder removal for now. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve always been very careful about what I put into my body. My mother instilled in me a healthy skepticism of these modern concoctions. And, truthfully, I don’t take much of anything. A little aspirin now and then, if absolutely necessary, but that’s about it. I prefer natural remedies, when possible. Though, I’m willing to humor my daughter, if it means a good night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely none. I repeat, none. I’ve just explained that. I take pride in my independence and dislike being beholden to…pharmaceutical interventions, shall we say. It's not a matter of distrust, you understand. It's simply a matter of…preference. A well-rested mind is often the best medicine, in my opinion. Though, as I’ve said, my sleep has been…less than optimal lately.
DOCTOR: Right. Let me examine you quickly, just to…get a baseline, shall we?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, I do find all this rather unnecessary for a simple request. But if it will appease my daughter, and get me this…certificate…I suppose I can endure a brief examination. Please be gentle, Doctor. My joints aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Please lie down on the table. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs first. Please, try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. The table. Relaxing is easier said than done when one is anticipating a…thorough assessment. But I shall attempt it. Do try not to be too…vigorous, Doctor. I bruise easily, you see. And please, do let me know if I’m lying at an awkward angle. My back isn't as pliable as it once was.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. Temperature is normal. Within normal limits for your age.
PATIENT: “Normal limits,” you say? Well, that's reassuring, I suppose. Though I’ve always prided myself on being above normal limits, to be frank. It's good to hear my lungs are clear, at least. My mother always warned me about the dangers of… drafts. Is this all you require, Doctor? Because honestly, I’m beginning to feel rather… exposed. And I do have a luncheon engagement this afternoon. A rather important one, with the Ladies’ Auxiliary, you understand.
DOCTOR: Just a quick neurological assessment. I need to check your reflexes. Please relax your leg. And the other leg. Reflexes are present and equal bilaterally.
PATIENT: Oh, my! Goodness, that was rather… unexpected! I haven't had my reflexes checked since… well, I can’t even recall. Are you certain everything is alright? It feels a little…tingly. I do hope you haven’t damaged anything. Honestly, I preferred the lying down part. It’s all very… invasive, you know. And my knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Everything appears normal, Ms. Ranells. No significant findings. Given your age and the lack of any concerning symptoms beyond sleep disturbance, and after this brief examination, I can sign the necessary paperwork for you to obtain a medical marijuana certificate, if that is still your desire.
PATIENT: Well, that's… good to hear. "Normal," you say? Most reassuring. Yes, Doctor, it is still my desire. My daughter would be most pleased. Though, truthfully, I’m still skeptical. But if it means a peaceful night’s sleep, and allows me to avoid those dreadful pills… then I suppose it's worth a try. So, what exactly does one do with this paperwork? Is it a lengthy process? And will it be discreet? I wouldn’t want the neighbors gossiping, you understand.
DOCTOR: You will take this form to a licensed dispensary. They will verify your identity and then…process the transaction. It is a fairly straightforward procedure. As for discretion…that is, unfortunately, beyond my control. Here. This is valid for one year. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: A licensed…dispensary? Honestly, the terminology! It sounds rather…questionable. Well, I suppose it’s a small price to pay for a good night's sleep. No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Though, truthfully, I’m still rather uncertain about the entire process. But I suppose I shall trust my daughter’s judgment. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And for not making me feel too…ridiculous. It's been…an experience, to say the least. Good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Good day to you as well, Ms. Ranells.
