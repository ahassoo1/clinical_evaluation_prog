DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I'm Dr. Pitmon. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day. It's my… well, it's my stool. It's black. And I take pills, you know, for the arthritis. The red ones. Been taking 'em for years. Is that what you need to know? Because frankly, I haven't got time for a whole lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Right. Black stool… and you're taking red pills for arthritis. Okay. It is important that we understand all the details, Ms. Hatchard, so please bear with me. While the pills are a good starting point, we need to rule out other possibilities. “Black stool” can mean a few different things, some of which are more concerning than others. First, how long has your stool been black?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. A couple of days, maybe? I don't spend my time inspecting my… output. It was black when I noticed it. Is that good enough? Look, I'm seventy-three years old, not a chemist. It just is black. And these pills are supposed to help my joints, not… turn me into something else.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. A couple of days. And you haven’t noticed any changes in the amount of stool, or any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting alongside it?
PATIENT: No! Nothing! Look, I’m a practical woman. I take a pill, I get a little relief, and now my… waste is a funny color. I’m not about to start cataloging every little ache and pain. I feel fine, mostly. A little creaky, what do you expect? I’m not about to go running a marathon. Is this taking long? My husband is waiting to go fishing.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hatchard, it is taking a bit longer than I’d hoped. And I understand your frustration, but a change in stool color, especially black stool, warrants a thorough assessment. It’s not about “cataloging aches and pains,” it’s about identifying potential internal bleeding, which can be serious. Let's try this. Do you experience any fatigue or weakness?
PATIENT: Internal what now? Look, I’m not a delicate flower. I’ve worked hard my whole life, fixing trucks and buses. I'm a mechanic, you know. Not some… some shrinking violet. Fatigue? Of course I’m tired! I'm seventy-three! And I’ve got aches and pains everywhere. It’s called getting old. Honestly, are you even listening to me, or just trying to scare me? I need a simple answer. Is this pill doing this, or not? My husband is waiting, and I'm wasting a perfectly good fishing day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, I am listening. And I understand you're a robust individual. However, we cannot dismiss potential issues simply because you're strong. Your red pills could be contributing to the black stool – iron can cause that, but it’s also a symptom of other things, some more concerning. Now, to be certain, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any stomach ulcers, or had any bleeding problems in the past?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Bleeding problems? Oh, honestly! I’ve never had anything more than a scrape or a bruise in my life! I've been fixing engines since I was a girl, not sitting around complaining about my stomach. I don’t have time for this. Look, I’m on Medicare. I’ve got doctors who’ve seen me for years. Just tell me if I need to stop the pills, or not. My husband will have a fit if I keep him waiting. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, with all due respect, I need more information to provide you with a safe and accurate assessment. Dismissing potential issues based on your perceived robustness is not responsible medical care. Given your insistence and limited information, I'm hesitant to make a definitive recommendation regarding your medication. However, I strongly recommend we run a few basic tests – a complete blood count and a stool occult blood test – to rule out any serious underlying causes. Would you be willing to allow me to order those tests?
