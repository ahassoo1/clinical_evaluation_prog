DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Hatchard, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about my… well, my poop. It's black. And I take those pills, you know, for the arthritis. Every day. Been taking 'em for years. Is that what's doing it? I just want to know if it's something serious or if it's just those darn pills. Don't have time for a lot of fuss, you understand.
DOCTOR: Black stool…right. Those arthritis pills, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! The red ones. Little red pills. Doctor Schmidt gave them to me, but he retired, and now I just keep getting them filled. And the stool… it's not just dark, it's black. Like…tar. And it smells awful, if you must know. Not my usual smell, definitely not. Is that bleeding in there, or something? I really don't want to mess with this if it's nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Black, tarry stool is…concerning. It could indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract. The pills can sometimes cause stomach irritation, but we need to rule other things out. Tell me, have you noticed any weakness, dizziness, or fatigue lately?
PATIENT: Weakness? Well, I'm 73! Of course, I'm weak. But no more than usual. Dizzy… sometimes. When I stand up too fast. But I've always been a little dizzy. And tired? Everyone's tired these days. What does that even mean? Honestly, I just want to know if I need a test or not. I've got things to do, you know. My garden needs weeding.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No throwing up. Never do. And my stomach…it's not painful exactly. Just…uncomfortable. Bloated, maybe. Especially after I eat. And I eat regularly, you know, good Czech cooking. Lots of dumplings. But it’s not like a sharp pain or anything. It's just…there.
DOCTOR: Bloated… Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Oh, I eat just fine. Always have. Big appetite. Used to feed a whole army, my mother used to say. Don’t go around feeling all stuffed, just… normal. What's all this have to do with my poop, anyway? It feels like you’re asking me about my whole life!
DOCTOR: It’s important to get a full picture, Mrs. Hatchard. Now, any nausea, or any recent weight loss, even unintentional?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I've probably gained a few pounds since the summer started. All the berries, you know? Fresh berries are wonderful. And no, no sickness, no throwing up. I told you all that. Are you going to actually do something, or just keep asking me questions?
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Specifically, I want to check your abdomen and take your blood pressure. And I'll order a stool test to check for blood. That’s the most efficient way to proceed, alright?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, that sounds… sensible. Just get it over with quickly, please. My tomatoes are probably needing staking right now. And please don’t poke too hard; I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Hatchard. Lie down on the table, please. Breathe normally. Now, I'm just listening for any unusual sounds. Feels a bit tender here… on the left side. Nothing alarming, but we'll need the test results to be sure. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, 145/90. Not critical, but something to monitor.
PATIENT: Elevated? Well, I get a little worked up talking to doctors. Always poking and prodding. And you're pressing hard! Are you almost finished? I swear, if I miss tomato staking season because of this… It's all just a waste of time, probably. Old age, that’s what it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just a few more seconds. Okay. We’ll send that stool sample off to the lab. It should take a few days to get the results. In the meantime, try to relax and stay hydrated. We’ll call you with the findings. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, vomiting blood, or feel significantly weak, go to the emergency room immediately, understood?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Goodness. No, I won't be going to the emergency room. Just call me with the results. And don’t take too long, please. I've got a garden to run. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Hatchard, that’s all for now. We’ll be in touch. And please, try not to stress. Next patient! .
