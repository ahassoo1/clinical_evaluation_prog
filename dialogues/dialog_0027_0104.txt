DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have much time. My throat… it hurts. Been hurting for a few days now. Not sure why it’s hurting, and frankly, I don’t really have time to sit here and figure it out. Just… can you fix it?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this quickly. A few days of sore throat… alright. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: More… well, it’s just sore. Like, when I swallow. And… it feels a bit scratchy. I drink a lot of tea, but that doesn’t seem to be helping much. Is that important? I really don’t see what all the questions are for, honestly. Just… can you look at it?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Let’s take a look. It is helpful to ask questions, to get a better understanding. But we can certainly start with a quick examination. Please open wide and say “ah.”
PATIENT: Ah… There. Quickly, if you please. I have errands to run. And it is rather uncomfortable having someone poke around in there.
DOCTOR: Okay. It does look a little irritated. Not terribly severe, but definitely some inflammation. Do you have a fever or any chills?
PATIENT: Fever…? I haven’t checked. Chills…? No, I don’t think so. I haven’t been feeling well enough to notice, to be honest. Really, Doctor, I just want something to make it stop hurting. Is that too much to ask? I don't have time for all this fuss.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. We’ll get you feeling better. Let’s just quickly run through a few more questions, just to be sure. Have you noticed any cough, runny nose, or body aches?
PATIENT: A little bit of a cough. Just a tickle, really. Not a bad cough. And… maybe a little tired. But I’m always tired. Work is… work. Runny nose, no. Body aches… not particularly. Honestly, I think it’s just a sore throat. Can we please just get to the medicine now? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like a fairly typical viral sore throat. We'll treat the symptoms. Since you're uninsured, we'll focus on supportive care. Plenty of fluids, rest, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Do you have any allergies to either of those medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No, I don’t think so. I’ve taken painkillers before. I can’t recall any… reactions. Look, Doctor, are you going to write me something or not? I really need to be going. This is… inconvenient. And frankly, I'm not sure why you need to know all these details anyway. It's a sore throat!
DOCTOR: Okay. Here's a handout with information about sore throats and how to manage them at home. It lists common over-the-counter medications and their dosages. If it doesn't improve within a week, or if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain, please see a doctor immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I suppose. I really must be going now. I have errands. And I don't have time to sit around getting sick. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Tammie. And don’t hesitate to seek medical attention if things worsen. .
