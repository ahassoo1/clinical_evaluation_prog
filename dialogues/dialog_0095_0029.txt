DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… well, I get full awful quick now. Used to be able to put a plate away, you know? Now, just a few bites and I feel like I’ve eaten a feast. It’s been happening for a few months, I’d say. Not sure what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of early fullness. That’s helpful. Can you tell me a bit more about that feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not painful, not exactly. More… uncomfortable. Like my stomach just stops. Like it’s saying “nope, no more”. Even if I’m not really full, full. It’s strange. And it happens with pretty much anything I eat, doesn’t matter if it's soup, or a sandwich, or… well, anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, discomfort and a sense of fullness with only a small amount of food. No pain, which is good. And it's consistent, regardless of what you eat. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting associated with this, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no vomiting. And not much nausea either, just… sometimes a little queasy after I stop eating, but not often. It doesn't last long if it happens. Mostly just the uncomfortable full feeling, that's the worst of it. It's making it hard to enjoy meals with my wife, you know? She's a good cook.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s frustrating when something like this interferes with everyday life. Okay, let’s get a little more background. Have you had any changes in your weight recently – either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t weigh myself regularly. My wife does, sometimes. I think… maybe I’ve lost a little bit? Not much, but she mentioned something about my pants fitting a bit looser. I’m not sure how much, though. I haven't been keeping track. I'm always a pretty small fella, so a little change feels big, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss alongside the early fullness. That’s something we need to investigate. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in… my bowels? Well, now you’re asking! I… I guess everything's been pretty normal on that front. Regular, you know? No trouble there, thankfully. Nothing different to report, if that makes sense. A little constipated sometimes, but that’s just getting old, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant changes in bowel habits other than occasional constipation, which you attribute to age. Do you have any trouble swallowing, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing at all. I can eat anything my wife puts in front of me, it's just... I don't want to, after a few bites. It’s not like it hurts to swallow, it just feels… full. Does that make sense? It’s a weird feeling, hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does make sense. A weird feeling is a good way to put it. Let me ask about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And my knees bother me some days, but that's just arthritis, the doctor said. Nothing else major, not that I can think of. I've always been a pretty healthy fella, all things considered. Haven't spent much time in the doctor's office, until now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed in childhood and arthritis. No other significant past medical history. Any family history of stomach problems, like cancer, ulcers, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one. My mother… she had something wrong with her stomach, a long time ago. I don't remember exactly what, I was just a boy. She was sick for a while, and then… well, she passed. My father, he was always strong as an ox, never a day of sickness in his life. So, not really. Nothing I can recall, anyway. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mother with some unspecified stomach illness, and a generally healthy father. And you said you haven’t spent much time in the doctor’s office. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees when they’re really bad. Something my wife picks up for me. I don't even know what it’s called, to be honest. A little white pill. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little bit of that stuff you can get at the drugstore, you know, for sleep. But that’s it. Nothing regular, not really.
DOCTOR: Alright. A white pill for your knees and occasional over-the-counter sleep aid. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental things?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. My wife always says I eat anything she puts in front of me, and she cooks everything! I've never had a reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I'm a pretty simple fella, don't need much to make me happy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll feel your abdomen. It’ll just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Okay, and now I'm going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Okay. Your abdomen is soft, and doesn’t seem to be particularly tender. I do notice it's a little bit distended, meaning it's slightly larger than usual. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I think it would be helpful to order some blood work and a stool test, just to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood work and… a stool test. Alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Will that take long to get the results? And will my wife need to drive me anywhere for any of this?
DOCTOR: The blood work will just require a simple draw, and the stool test is a sample you can collect at home. We’ll give you the instructions and the container when you leave. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Your wife won’t need to drive you anywhere. We’ll call you as soon as we have them, to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and make a plan. In the meantime, try to eat smaller, more frequent meals and stay hydrated. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Smaller meals, more often. I can do that. And drink more water. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's good to know what's going on, even if it's just tests right now. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: No, nothing specific at this point. Just focus on those smaller meals and staying hydrated. And avoid any over-the-counter medications that might upset your stomach, like ibuprofen or naproxen. If you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or vomiting, please call the office immediately. Here's a copy of the lab orders and instructions for the stool test. And here’s my card, with the office number. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind a little bit at ease, just knowing we're looking into it. I’ll make sure my wife knows everything too.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, you have a good day, Mr. Obarr. We’ll be in touch soon.
