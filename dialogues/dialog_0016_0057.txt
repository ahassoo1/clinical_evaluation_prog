DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It's nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it's... about the cancer. I was told to come speak with someone. I don’t really know what happens next, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s completely understandable. It’s a lot to take in. To help me understand what’s been happening, and what information you’ve already received, could you tell me a little bit about when you first found out about the cancer?
PATIENT: Um… it was back in February, I think. The doctor called with some test results. He said it was… in my blood. I’m sorry, I don’t remember exactly what he called it. It was a shock. My husband… he helped me understand a little, but he’s… not here anymore.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. That must be incredibly difficult, especially while navigating something like this. It is a shock, and it's perfectly normal not to remember everything. February... okay. Do you remember what kind of tests were done?
PATIENT: I… think it was a blood draw. And then… a scan? Like a big machine. They laid me down and it took pictures. It wasn’t painful, but I was nervous. They sent the results to my other doctor. I’m sorry, I'm not very good at remembering things like this. It all happened so fast.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Chellsea, don’t apologize. It did happen fast. A blood draw and a scan… that’s helpful. Do you know which doctor sent you here?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was Doctor… Ramirez. Yes, Doctor Ramirez at the hospital. He said I needed to see someone who… specializes. And he gave me this appointment card. He was very nice, but I was still pretty upset then.
DOCTOR: Doctor Ramirez, excellent. He's a good physician. Okay, so we’ve established you were referred by Doctor Ramirez in February after some blood work and a scan. And you were told it involved cancer in your blood. To be more specific, do you recall anything about the type of cancer they mentioned?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. He said a long name. Something with “emia” in it? Or maybe it was “oma”. It sounded scary. I asked him to repeat it, and he did, but I still didn't understand. I just kept hearing “cancer” over and over. I was mostly trying not to cry.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Emias" or "Omas"... those are long and complicated terms. It’s common to only remember “cancer” in a situation like that, and it's perfectly okay not to recall the specifics. It sounds like you were likely diagnosed with a form of leukemia. Do you know if they told you what kind of leukemia, perhaps acute or chronic?
PATIENT: Leukemia? Is that… in the blood? I think I’ve heard that name before. And… acute or… something? No, they didn't say. He just said it needed treatment right away. I was so worried about getting it right for my husband… he was always good with medical stuff. I'm sorry. I just... I feel so lost.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Chellsea. It's perfectly understandable to feel lost, especially after receiving such news, and grieving your husband at the same time. We'll take things slowly. Leukemia is a cancer of the blood, and it sounds like your diagnosis requires prompt treatment, which is why you were referred here. Let's start with some basics. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy. A little tired sometimes, but everyone is these days, right? I don’t take any medicine regularly. My husband… he had some problems with his heart, but that’s… not me. I used to walk a lot, but… I haven't been doing much of that lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, no regular medications. And you mentioned some fatigue, but overall, you’ve been feeling relatively well?
PATIENT: Well, I have been bruising easily. I didn't think much of it at first. Just little bumps, like from knocking into something. But now… I have a few bigger ones. And I've been feeling… weaker, I guess. It's hard to explain. I get tired just doing simple things. It started a few weeks ago, maybe a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see those. Bruising easily and feeling weaker… those symptoms can definitely be associated with leukemia, and are good things you brought up. Have you noticed any fever, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Um… I have been sleeping really hot. I wake up soaked sometimes, even with the window open. I thought it was just the summer, but now that you mention it… And I think I’ve lost a little weight, but I haven’t been eating much. Everything just… tastes different. Not very good. It’s hard to get excited about food when I'm feeling… like this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Hot flashes or night sweats, and a decreased appetite with unintentional weight loss. These are all things we need to investigate further. It sounds like we're gathering more and more information that is consistent with a diagnosis of leukemia. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a physical exam, and I'll need to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a peripheral blood smear. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s happening, and what we can do about it. I’m ready. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad to hear that, Chellsea. We’ll take things one step at a time. First, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your lymph nodes. It won’t take long. After that, we’ll get the blood work ordered, and once the results are back, we can discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any questions before we start?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… will it hurt? I'm not very good with needles.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t hurt, Chellsea. The blood draw will be quick, and I'll make sure the phlebotomist is as gentle as possible. It's a small pinch, and then it's over before you know it. I’ll be right here with you the whole time, and we can talk to distract you if you like. We can also apply some numbing cream if you'd prefer. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Numbing cream sounds good, actually. Thank you. I think… I think that would help. I appreciate that. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let me get that applied first. It takes a few minutes to work. While that's working, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Lymph nodes are… slightly enlarged. Okay, Chellsea, I'm feeling some mild swelling in your neck lymph nodes. It’s not alarming, but it’s another piece of the puzzle. Now, let’s give the cream a few more minutes to work, then we’ll proceed with the blood draw. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, not right now. Just… is it bad? The swelling, I mean. Is it serious? I’m trying not to panic, but…
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Chellsea. It is serious that you’re experiencing these symptoms, which is why we’re doing all these tests to get a clear diagnosis. The swelling in your lymph nodes could be a sign of the leukemia, but it’s also important to remember that there are other possible causes. We need to wait for the blood work results to get a definitive answer. Panicking won’t help, and right now, we have a plan in place. We’re gathering information, and once we have that, we’ll be able to discuss treatment options. Let’s focus on getting through the blood draw first, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… yes. You’re right. Let’s do the blood draw. I’m ready. I think.
DOCTOR: You are doing great, Chellsea. I've got a patient here ready for a complete blood count and peripheral blood smear. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. They are very skilled, and I’ll be right here with you the entire time. Just relax, and try to take some deep breaths. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m okay. Just… being here with you helps. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. That's what I'm here for. And just to reiterate, we'll take everything one step at a time. We'll analyze the results carefully, and then we will discuss all of the treatment options with you. Hi, Maria. This is Chellsea, and we are ready for a CBC and peripheral smear. Please let me know if you need anything. Just try to relax your arm. Maria is going to apply a tourniquet, and then she'll clean the area with an alcohol swab. It's a small pinch.
PATIENT: Okay... I'm a little scared of needles, so just let me know when it's almost over.
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Chellsea. Just breathe deeply. Maria is very skilled, and it will be over before you know it. Almost done… just a few more seconds. There you go. All finished. Just keep gentle pressure on that for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. And that’s it. You did great! How are you feeling?
PATIENT: A little dizzy, I think. And my arm feels a bit sore. But… it’s over. Thank you both. What happens now? Do we just… wait for the results? How long will that take?
DOCTOR: Yes, you did it wonderfully, Chellsea. It's perfectly normal to feel a little dizzy after a blood draw, and your arm will likely be sore for a bit. Just try to rest for a few minutes. As for the results, it usually takes about 24 to 48 hours for the lab to process everything. My office will call you as soon as they're available. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail, and then we can develop a treatment plan. Do you have anyone who can drive you home?
PATIENT: Yes, my friend Sarah is picking me up. She's on her way now. Do you think… do you think it’s bad? Like, really bad? I’m trying not to think about it, but it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Chellsea, it's understandable that you're feeling anxious and worried. We don’t have the results yet, so we don’t know for sure how serious things are. I want to be honest with you: the symptoms you’ve described are concerning, and the initial blood work will give us a clearer picture. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions. We'll wait for the results, and then we’ll discuss all of your options. We have a lot of tools available to us, and we will work together to develop the best possible treatment plan. Right now, let's just focus on getting you home safely and resting. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Would you like me to write down the phone number for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s… it’s a lot to take in. I think… I think I’m ready to go home.
DOCTOR: Here you go. And you’re very welcome, Chellsea. That’s what I’m here for. Don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. And remember, we'll take things one step at a time. I believe your friend is here now. Get some rest, Chellsea, and we’ll talk soon. Have a good day, and take care.
