DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It feels like there’s always some left, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now. Not sure how long exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing difficulty completely emptying your bladder. That can be uncomfortable, and it's good you're addressing it. When you say "a little while now," could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… a rough estimate… maybe three, four months now? It started slow, I think. I didn’t think much of it at first, figured it was just getting older. But it hasn't gotten better, and sometimes it feels… uncomfortable, like a fullness. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A gradual onset is common with these kinds of issues. And the feeling of fullness is important to note. Besides the feeling of incomplete emptying and the fullness, have you noticed any other changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. Sometimes I have to… push a little harder to start. Not every time, but more often than I used to. And, now that you mention it, I seem to be going to the bathroom a bit more often during the day. Not a lot more, but enough that I notice it. Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: Okay, so we're talking about difficulty initiating the stream and increased frequency. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. It doesn’t hurt when I go, just… hard to get it started sometimes, and then not feeling like it’s all coming out. And the extra trips. No pain though, thankfully. It’s just… bothersome, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It definitely sounds bothersome, and it's good we're trying to figure out what's going on. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… not much. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And my wife… she passed away a few years back. That was… hard. But other than that, I’ve mostly been healthy, knock on wood. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing like that. I’m on Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Hilber. I’m sorry to hear about your wife. And it’s good to know you haven’t had any major medical issues. Medicare is helpful information as well. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your appendix?
PATIENT: No, just the appendix when I was little. Nothing else. And no… I don't take any regular medicines, not pills or anything. Sometimes I use a cream for my skin when it gets dry in the winter, but that’s about it. Just a little something the store sells.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries or regular medications. That simplifies things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat just about anything. My wife used to make a good salmon chowder… but that’s another story. Nope, no allergies. Never had a problem with anything like that. I don’t have any trouble breathing or rashes or anything when I try new foods.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's good to know. Now, let’s briefly talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—things like prostate problems, kidney disease, or bladder issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That’s a tough one. My dad… he didn’t talk much about his health. And my mother… she passed when I was young. I know my uncle on my mother’s side had some trouble with his kidneys, I think. But other than that… not really. We weren't much for talking about that sort of thing, to be honest. Mostly fishermen, we were. Didn't have time for doctor visits.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me something to work with. Kidney trouble in your uncle is worth noting. And I understand the situation with your family history. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I live alone now, in the same house I always have. I try to stay active. I still do a little fishing, when the weather’s good. Mostly just for myself, not like I used to. I walk the dog most days. A little husky named Luna. She keeps me going. I don't smoke or drink. I used to, a long time ago, but I quit when I got married. It was my wife's wish.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful about Luna, and it’s great that you're staying active. It’s good you don’t smoke or drink. So, to summarize, you're experiencing difficulty emptying your bladder, increased frequency, and difficulty initiating the stream. No pain, burning, allergies, or regular medications. History of appendectomy, kidney issues in an uncle, and a healthy lifestyle. Now, I would like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve checking your abdomen and a brief neurological exam. We will also need to do a urine test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A physical exam and a urine test. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I’m ready when you are. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber. Let’s start with your abdomen. Please lie down on your back for me. I’m just feeling for any areas of discomfort or anything unusual. … No significant tenderness to palpation. Abdomen is soft and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normal. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Now, we'll collect a urine sample. I'll give you a cup, and I’d like you to collect a midstream sample. I’ll leave you a few minutes of privacy.
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. A midstream sample. I’ll be right back with it. It might take me a minute, you know… getting older.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. Now, we’ll send this off to the lab, and it will take a few minutes to get the results. While we wait, I will document our findings. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam, several things could be going on. It could be a simple urinary tract infection, an enlarged prostate, or something related to the nerves controlling your bladder. The urine test will help us rule out an infection. We may need to do further testing depending on the results.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining it all to me. An infection, or the prostate… I’ve heard stories about that. My friend, old man Hemlock, he had trouble with his prostate. It’s good you’re checking all these things. I just want to feel normal again, you know? I’ll wait for the results, whatever they are. Just let me know what happens.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Hilber. Feeling normal again is the goal. And we will figure out what’s going on. Okay, the results are back. The urine test is clear – no evidence of infection. That’s good news. However, the lab also noted a slightly elevated PSA level. PSA stands for Prostate-Specific Antigen, and it’s a protein produced by the prostate gland. An elevated level can indicate an enlarged prostate, but it can also be caused by other things, like inflammation or even age. Given your symptoms and the elevated PSA, I recommend we proceed with a digital rectal exam and potentially a referral to a urologist for further evaluation, including a possible prostate biopsy.
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? And a biopsy? That… that doesn’t sound very pleasant, Doctor. Is it… is it necessary? I mean, I just want to feel better. I’ve never had anything like that done before. My friend Hemlock… he didn’t like the idea of a biopsy much. Is it painful? What does it even involve? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Hilber. It’s perfectly natural to feel worried, and you’re right to ask questions. A digital rectal exam is a physical exam where I gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It’s uncomfortable, but it’s generally not painful. It takes only a few seconds. The PSA level is slightly elevated, and while it doesn’t automatically mean you have prostate cancer, it’s important to investigate further to rule it out. A prostate biopsy involves taking a small tissue sample from your prostate gland to be examined under a microscope. It’s the most definitive way to diagnose prostate cancer. It can cause some discomfort, and there's a small risk of infection, but it’s generally a safe procedure. I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it was necessary to get you a proper diagnosis and ensure you receive the best possible care. We can discuss all the risks and benefits in detail, and you have the final say in whether or not you proceed with it. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… explain it again, please. The biopsy, specifically. What would happen, step by step? And what are the chances… what are the chances it is something serious? My wife… she always told me to get things checked, but I never liked going to doctors. This all feels… overwhelming. And what if I don't want to do it? What happens then? Do we just… wait and see?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber, let’s take this one step at a time. During a prostate biopsy, you would lie on your side, similar to how you were for the abdominal exam. I would insert a small probe into your rectum. This probe has a very thin needle that takes several small tissue samples from your prostate gland. You’ll likely feel some pressure, and a brief, sharp pinch with each sample, but it shouldn’t be excruciating. The procedure usually takes about 10-15 minutes. After the biopsy, you might experience some mild discomfort, bleeding, or bruising in the rectum. We’ll give you instructions on how to manage any discomfort. We also prescribe antibiotics to prevent infection. As for the chances of it being something serious… it’s difficult to say without the biopsy results. An elevated PSA doesn’t automatically mean you have cancer. Many men have elevated PSAs due to benign prostatic hyperplasia – an enlarged prostate that isn’t cancerous. However, it’s important to rule out cancer to ensure we can provide you with the appropriate treatment if necessary. And you absolutely have the right to decline the biopsy. If you choose not to proceed, we can monitor your PSA levels over time. If the levels increase significantly, that would be a sign that further investigation is needed. We can also discuss managing any symptoms you’re experiencing, such as difficulty urinating. I want you to feel comfortable and empowered to make the best decision for your health. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Okay… antibiotics, that’s good. And monitoring the PSA levels… that sounds less scary than a biopsy right now. But if the levels go up… then I’d have to do it anyway, wouldn’t I? And waiting… I don’t like waiting. My wife always said I was a worrier. What are the chances… what are the chances it would be cancer? Just a rough estimate, Doctor. I need to know what I’m facing. And if it is cancer… what happens then? What kind of treatment is there? I’ve heard… things.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those tough questions, Mr. Hilber. It’s important to be prepared. The chances of an elevated PSA indicating prostate cancer vary depending on several factors, including your age, race, family history, and the degree of elevation. In your case, given your age and symptoms, the risk is roughly estimated to be between 20-30%. That means that for every 100 men with a similar PSA level, 20-30 might have prostate cancer. But remember, that also means 70-80 would not. If a biopsy were to confirm a diagnosis of prostate cancer, the treatment options depend on the stage and grade of the cancer. For many men with early-stage prostate cancer, active surveillance might be an option – closely monitoring the cancer without immediate treatment. Other options include surgery to remove the prostate gland, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. We would discuss all of these options in detail and create a personalized treatment plan based on your specific needs. It’s important to understand that prostate cancer is often slow-growing, and many men live long, healthy lives with the disease. Early detection and treatment can significantly improve your prognosis. I know this is a lot of information to take in. I want to assure you that I’m here to support you every step of the way. We can take things at your own pace. Do you want me to go over any of this again?
PATIENT: Okay… 20-30 percent. That’s… not as bad as I thought, I guess. But still… it’s there. And all those treatments… surgery, radiation… it sounds scary. Active surveillance… that sounds a little better, but what if it grows? I… I think I need some time to think about it. To talk to my daughter. She’s a nurse, she might have some ideas. I don’t want to make a rash decision. Can I… can I schedule another appointment? To talk about it more? And maybe get a second opinion?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hilber. That’s a very sensible approach. Taking the time to consider your options and discuss them with your daughter is a wise decision. And getting a second opinion is always a good idea. We can definitely schedule another appointment to talk about this further. I’m happy to answer any questions you have. I can also provide you with a referral to a urologist for a second opinion. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A referral to a urologist would be great. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. I still feel worried, but… I feel a little better knowing what’s going on. And knowing I have time to think about it. I guess… that’s all for today. I’ll call to schedule another appointment. .
