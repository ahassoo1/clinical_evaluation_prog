DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Oh… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been having some… pain. Down there. It’s… in my testicles, I think. Though, honestly, I’m not very sure what is what, if you understand. It’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright to feel embarrassed, Noelani. These things happen, and we're here to help. "Down there" is a perfectly acceptable way to start. And it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. Could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… well, it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, and other times… it’s quite uncomfortable. I think it’s worse after I’ve been… doing things. You know, physical work. I do a lot of woodworking, so I’m often on my feet and… moving about. But it’s hard to say for sure. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that comes and goes, and seems to be aggravated by physical activity, especially woodworking. That’s helpful. You mentioned it's been going on for "a little while now"—can you give me a rough estimate of how long?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It feels like… several weeks, maybe? Perhaps a month or two? It’s difficult to pinpoint, truly. I’ve been rather preoccupied with a large commission, a dining room set, and… well, time just seems to slip away. It wasn't sudden, that's for certain. It just… gradually became noticeable. I truly apologize for not being more precise.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Noelani. It’s very common to lose track of time, especially when busy. Several weeks to a month is a good starting point. Now, besides the ache, have you noticed any other changes or symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven’t noticed any… swelling, I don’t believe. And no fever, thankfully. Oh! There was a bit of… heaviness, perhaps? A feeling of… weight, down there. But it could just be my imagination. I often feel tired, being on my feet all day. It’s hard to say what’s normal and what isn’t, really. Is heaviness a sign of something bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, heaviness is good to know. It's not necessarily a sign of something bad, Noelani, but it’s important information. We'll need to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A physical exam sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to… feel better, you know? It’s distracting me from my work, and I enjoy my work very much.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. That's perfectly reasonable. Alright. I'm going to need you to lie down on the examination table. I'll need to examine your abdomen and, of course, the area you’ve been describing. I’ll explain everything as I go, and please, don’t hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. I’ll start with your abdomen. Could you please bend your knees and lift your upper body slightly?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. This is… rather cold. Bending my knees… yes, like this? Is this alright? I hope I’m doing it correctly. I haven’t… been to a doctor in quite some time.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Noelani. You're doing great. This is just to check for any general tenderness or abnormalities. I'm not feeling anything concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to need to examine your testicles. I’ll use a little lubricant to make it more comfortable. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s alright. Lubricant sounds… sensible. I’m a bit embarrassed, but… I understand it’s necessary. Please, be gentle. And… if it becomes too uncomfortable, please just stop. I truly appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just checking for any lumps, tenderness, or changes in size. I’m not feeling any significant lumps at this point. There is some mild tenderness on the left side, but it doesn’t seem to be anything acute. The size and shape appear normal. Do you feel any pain specifically when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. A little. It’s not sharp, but… definitely uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, as I described before. It’s… radiating a bit now, I think. Is that… bad? I apologize for being so anxious. I just don’t like being touched down there, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Noelani, and I apologize if that was uncomfortable. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about this. The tenderness on the left side is something we need to investigate further. It could be a number of things, including a mild inflammation, a small varicocele – that’s a slightly enlarged vein – or, less commonly, something else. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a scrotal ultrasound. It’s a non-invasive imaging test that will allow us to see the structures inside your scrotum in detail. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help determine what’s wrong, then yes, I’m comfortable with that. Non-invasive is good. I’m not fond of… invasive procedures. When would that be? And… will it be painful? I truly hope not.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I can order that for you right away. The imaging center is just down the hall, and they usually have appointments available within the next 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have my assistant schedule that for you before you leave. It is completely painless, Noelani. The technician will simply apply a gel to your scrotum and move a small probe over the area. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. While we wait for the results of the ultrasound, I’m going to prescribe you a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help with the pain and tenderness. It’s not a definitive treatment, but it may provide some relief in the meantime. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. Anti-inflammatory medication… alright. And scheduling the ultrasound… excellent. It’s good to have a plan. A plan is always good. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I apologize for being so… anxious and forgetful.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Noelani. It’s my job to be patient, and you have nothing to apologize for. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about these things, and I’m glad we’re getting this sorted out. My assistant, Maria, will come in shortly to schedule the ultrasound and give you the prescription. She’ll also go over the instructions for the ultrasound with you. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think… no, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Maria will handle the scheduling and the prescription… excellent. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. And… I appreciate your kindness. I think that’s all for now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your ultrasound appointment. Maria will be in shortly. Have a good day, and please, try to rest and take it easy.
