DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s…Esthela Pandolfi, actually. And frankly, it’s about this…situation. I’m dating someone, and I just want to make sure everything is…above board, you understand. One has to be careful these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Discretion and your health are very important. It sounds like you'd like to get some testing done, perhaps for sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Well, testing is a rather blunt way to put it, Doctor. But yes, that is…part of it. More than anything, I need to know what risks I’m exposing myself to. He’s…quite charming, but one can never be too certain, can one? And I have a very…particular standard of health I maintain. I wouldn’t want to compromise that for anyone.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's very wise to be proactive about your health, and wanting to protect your well-being is excellent. To make sure we cover everything, could you tell me a little more about your dating partner?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? He’s…older. Significantly older, actually. And…well, he’s a bit of a…free spirit. Travels a lot. Which, of course, is exciting, but also…concerning. He doesn’t share much about his past, which I find…suspicious. He says he prefers to live in the moment, but I believe there’s more to it than that. He’s very…continental, shall we say? And insists on meeting at rather…exclusive establishments. It all seems a bit…fast, if you understand my meaning.
DOCTOR: Okay, traveling frequently, doesn't share much about his past… and meeting in exclusive locations. That definitely gives us some things to consider. Have you been sexually active with him yet?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. Such directness. But…yes, we have. A few times. It was…pleasant. Very pleasant, actually. But that’s precisely why I’m here, isn’t it? One doesn't want a pleasant experience to lead to…complications. And frankly, I expect a certain level of…responsibility from someone I allow myself to become intimate with. It’s a matter of principle, you see. And good health. Always good health.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's smart to be thorough. Given the circumstances you've described, I think a comprehensive STI screening is a very good idea. We can test for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and herpes. Would you like to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Herpes? Oh, goodness. Is that…common? I certainly hope not. I’ve always been…very careful. But yes, if that’s what’s recommended, I suppose. Though I must say, the thought of herpes is…unsettling. Is it…painful? And is it…visible? I do maintain a rather…pristine appearance, you see. One wouldn't want anything…noticeable.
DOCTOR: Herpes is quite common, unfortunately, and many people don't even know they have it. It can be painful, but not everyone experiences symptoms, and the severity varies. Sometimes there are visible sores or blisters, but it's also possible to have no visible signs. We’d be testing for both types, HSV-1 and HSV-2. Even if you test negative, it's important to know the signs to look out for. Would you like me to explain the testing process, and what a positive or negative result would mean?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. I prefer to be fully informed. Though, frankly, the idea of a positive result is…distressing. What exactly happens if…if one tests positive? Is it…curable? And what about…my husband? Would he need to be tested as well? He wouldn’t be pleased, you understand. He’s a man of…routine. Any disruption would be…unwelcome.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's go through this step-by-step. If you test positive for an STI, it doesn't necessarily mean a life-altering diagnosis. Some STIs, like chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, are curable with antibiotics. Others, like herpes and HIV, are manageable with medication, though they aren't curable. With herpes, antiviral medications can significantly reduce the frequency and severity of outbreaks, and also lower the risk of transmission. If you did test positive for herpes, it would be important to inform any sexual partners, including your husband. Regarding your husband, yes, he should be tested if you test positive for any STI, as he could be at risk, even if he doesn't have symptoms. I understand your concern about disrupting his routine, and we can discuss how to approach that conversation sensitively. Before we proceed with the testing, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Thank goodness. My mother always insisted on a very…strict diet. Everything organic, everything natural. It was…exasperating, but I suppose it did some good. This conversation…it’s rather unsettling, Doctor. I’m not accustomed to discussing such…intimate details with anyone. Though I suppose it’s necessary, given the…circumstances. And I appreciate you being so…thorough. So, what exactly is involved in the testing? Is it…painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a luncheon next week, and I wouldn’t want to be…distracted.
DOCTOR: I understand it's a difficult conversation, and I appreciate you sharing everything with me. We'll make this as comfortable as possible. The testing involves either a urine sample, and/or a quick swab of the affected area, depending on which tests we’re doing. It’s generally not painful – more of a mild discomfort, like a quick pinch. The lab usually takes 3-5 business days to return results, so we should have them back well before your luncheon. We can also discuss scheduling a follow-up appointment to go over the results together and answer any questions you may have. Shall we proceed with collecting the samples now?
PATIENT: Yes, let’s get it over with. The sooner this is done, the better. Though I must say, I do prefer a female nurse for…such procedures. Is that possible? And please, be gentle. I have sensitive skin. And I do hope there won’t be…any lingering discomfort. I have a rather important engagement this evening.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will ensure a female nurse assists with the sample collection. And I’ll make a note of your preference for gentleness. It’s important you feel comfortable. I will have Nurse Anya prepare the room. It will only take a few minutes. Please follow her in when she's ready. She will explain everything in detail. Is there anything else I can address before I step out to let the nurse know?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all. Just…please reiterate to the nurse to be extremely gentle. And to maintain complete discretion, of course. One’s reputation is…fragile. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been…surprisingly accommodating, considering the…circumstances. I appreciate your professionalism. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ll wait here. The sooner this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will personally speak with Nurse Anya to ensure your comfort and discretion. Please make yourself comfortable, and I'll be right back to check on you shortly.
