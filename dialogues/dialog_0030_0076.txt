DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs... my shins, to be exact. They’re red and kinda painful, you know? Been bothering me for a little while now. Not sure what they are, that’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Red, painful bumps on your shins. And you said this has been going on for “a little while” – can you be a bit more specific about how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… maybe a month? A little over a month, I guess. It started with just one or two, and then more kept popping up. They don't itch, thankfully, just ache sometimes, especially when I’m walking a lot. I do a lot of walking at work, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month or so with progressively more bumps, mostly achey rather than itchy. And you mentioned walking at work – could you tell me a bit about your job?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. I work moving… well, everything. Freight, stock, materials. By hand, mostly. It’s a warehouse job. A lot of lifting and walking on concrete floors all day. It's honest work, but it can be hard on the body, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine. A physically demanding job like that could certainly contribute to some issues. Have you noticed if the bumps get worse after a particularly long or strenuous shift?
PATIENT: You know, now that you mention it… yeah, actually. They definitely feel more achy and look a little redder after a really busy day at work. Like, if we have a big shipment come in and I’m on my feet for ten, twelve hours straight… that’s when they really bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And have you tried anything at home to help with the pain or redness?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I haven’t tried anything special. Just… tried to rest my legs when I could. Maybe put some lotion on ‘em, but that didn’t seem to do much. I'm not one for a lot of creams and stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with these bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No fever, no swelling anywhere else, nothing like that. Just the bumps on my shins, and the ache. Sometimes they feel a little warm, but I figured that was just from being on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had anything like this happen before, or any similar skin issues?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I’ve gotten scrapes and bruises from work, of course, but nothing with bumps that are red and achey like these. This is all new to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's take a look at those shins. If you wouldn’t mind, could you please roll up your pants legs a bit so I can get a better view?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Here you go, Doctor. You can see ‘em pretty clearly now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There are several erythematous papules and plaques along both tibias. No open lesions or drainage noted. They appear to be somewhat tender to the touch. Based on the location, appearance, and your description of the symptoms, and considering your occupation, it's possible these are shin splints with overlying dermatitis, or potentially some form of contact dermatitis exacerbated by friction and repetitive strain. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to get a bit more information. Do you have any allergies to any medications or topical products?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of, really. I haven’t taken any new medications lately. I had a bit of a rash once when I was a kid, but my wife said it was just from poison ivy. Nothing serious. As for creams and stuff, I told you, I don't use much. So, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything topical.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my appendix taken out when I was young, and I’ve had the usual colds and flu. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but I take a little pill for that every day. Keeps it under control, thankfully. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and hypertension managed with medication. Do you remember the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a little white pill. Oh, wait! I remember now. It’s Lisinopril. My wife always reminds me to take it, she's got a good memory.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. And do you have any family history of skin conditions or other medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had some eczema when she was older, I think. And my father, he had diabetes. He had some problems with his legs later in life, but I don’t remember exactly what. Other than that, not really. We weren't much for talking about health stuff when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never been much for any of that. My wife doesn't allow it, anyway! I try to eat healthy and stay active, even with the hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Aluia, that’s very helpful. Based on everything you’ve told me, and the examination, my initial thought is that these bumps are likely a combination of shin splints – which are common with repetitive strain – and some degree of contact or irritant dermatitis. The friction from your work boots and the environment could be contributing to the inflammation. However, to be certain, I'd like to order a basic blood test – just to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions and check your kidney function, given the Lisinopril. And I'm also going to recommend a topical corticosteroid cream to help reduce the inflammation and itching, if any develops. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Blood test and a cream? Alright. I trust your judgement. I just want these bumps to go away, you know? They’re starting to bother me. So, how do we do the blood test? And what kind of cream are we talking about? Is it something I have to get special?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll start with the blood test. We can do that right here in the clinic. It's just a standard panel; we'll need a small sample from your arm. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes, and we'll get the results back in a few days. As for the cream, I’m going to prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid called Triamcinolone 0.1%. It's a prescription medication, so I’ll send it electronically to your pharmacy. They’ll be able to fill it for you. You'll apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice a day for two weeks. In the meantime, I also recommend trying to avoid prolonged friction on your shins. Make sure your work boots fit properly and consider wearing moisture-wicking socks to help keep the area dry. Elevating your legs when you're not at work can also help reduce inflammation. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay, Triamcinolone, got it. And yes, I think my boots are getting a little tight. And I will try the socks, good idea. So, just to be clear… blood test now, cream from the pharmacy, and better socks and boots? Is that everything? And… how much will the blood test cost, roughly? Medicare should cover most of it, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct: blood test now, Triamcinolone from the pharmacy, and better socks and boots. Regarding the cost, let me check your Medicare coverage. Okay, it looks like Medicare will cover the majority of the blood test. You may have a small copay, depending on your specific plan – typically around $20-$30. Our billing department can give you a more precise estimate when you check out. I’m going to have the lab technician come in and draw your blood now. And after that, I’ll give you a written summary of everything we discussed, including the medication information and instructions. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect, Doctor. $20-$30 is fine. I was just worried about a big bill. Thank you for checking that. Yes, a written summary would be great. I forget things easily, you know. Alright, let’s get this blood test done. I'm ready when the technician is.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll let the technician know you're ready. And don't worry about forgetting things – that’s perfectly normal. The written summary will be a helpful reminder. Just one moment, and they’ll be right in. In the meantime, if you start experiencing any fever, increased pain, redness spreading beyond the bumps, or any signs of infection, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and your help. You've put my mind at ease a bit. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I'm ready for the blood test now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. It was my pleasure. We're here to help. “Technician, could you please come to room two for a blood draw?
PATIENT: .
