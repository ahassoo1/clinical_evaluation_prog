DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. My back… my low back, it’s been bothering me. Hurts a lot, it does. Mostly when I stand for too long, or try to lift things. I think it’s my bones, you know? They feel…weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Low back pain, worse with standing and lifting. You feel like it might be your bones…that’s good information. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like when I fell last year. It’s more… a dull ache. Constant, mostly. But gets worse like I said, with moving. Sometimes it feels like it shoots down my leg a little, but not always. And it's been getting worse slowly over… oh, maybe six months now. I don’t remember exactly. It just… came on.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, constant ache that radiates down your leg sometimes, worsening over the last six months. And it’s not related to your fall last year?
PATIENT: No, no, not the fall. That was different. That was a quick pain, and it healed up pretty good, thank you. This… this is different. It’s like a weight, you know? Always there. And getting heavier. I try to ignore it, but it makes it hard to do things. Even gardening, and I love my garden.
DOCTOR: Alright. So a constant, gradually worsening ache, not related to a specific injury like the fall. It’s impacting your daily activities, even gardening. Have you tried anything to relieve the pain so far?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A little bit. My daughter, she gave me some of those… what are they called? Ibuprofen. They help a little, for a few hours. And I try to sit down more, rest it. But it doesn't really go away, you know? It just… lessens for a bit, then comes back. I’ve also been using a heating pad, that feels nice for a while, too. But nothing seems to really fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen and a heating pad provide some temporary relief, but it doesn't last. Good to know you've tried those. Now, let's talk about your overall health a little bit. Do you have any other medical problems – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I had a little bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was okay now. He gave me some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. Felt better without them, to be honest. No diabetes, no heart problems that I know of. Just… getting old, I guess. And this back. I’ve always been pretty healthy, for the most part. Except for this, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, some previous blood pressure issues that are currently managed without medication. And you feel generally healthy otherwise. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital, thank goodness. Just a few trips to the doctor for colds and flu over the years, that’s all. Nothing serious, never needed anything like surgery or a hospital stay. My mother always said I was a tough one! She was right, I think. But this back pain… this is something different. It worries me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no previous surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother, she had arthritis, in her hands mostly. And my father… he had some trouble with his bones when he was older. He broke his hip, I think. But other than that, not really. Nobody in my family had anything serious, like cancer or heart disease. We were mostly a healthy bunch, I think. Except for my mother’s arthritis, and my father’s… well, I don't know exactly what he had, just something with his bones. It wasn't talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis and some unspecified bone issues in your father. Let’s talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no smoking for me. Never liked it. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Never really had the taste for it. Always been a coffee man, though. Maybe two or three cups a day. And I used to be a very active gardener, like I said. But it’s getting harder now, with this back pain. I try to walk when I can, but not as much as I used to. Mostly just around the house.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking or alcohol, moderate coffee drinker, and decreased activity due to the back pain. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. My daughter always asks me that, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. She worries about me, that one. A good girl, but she worries too much. I’ve taken all sorts of pills over the years, for colds and headaches and stuff, and never had a problem. No allergies, to my knowledge. Just… this back. It’s the one thing that’s really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for all that information, Mr. Vankampen. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam of your back. Just need you to lie down on your side for a moment. I'll check your range of motion, feel for tenderness, and do a few simple tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust you. Just tell me what to do. I hope you can find out what’s wrong with this back, it’s really been bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Alright, I’m feeling some tenderness along your spine here, and your movement is a bit limited, especially when bending forward. Now I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Just relax your legs flat on the table. Okay, your strength and reflexes are good, which is reassuring. I'm also going to perform the straight leg raise test. And that causes some discomfort down your left leg, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that one! That’s the one that shoots down my leg. Not too bad, but I feel it, definitely. It's like a… a stretching pain. Not sharp, but uncomfortable. It’s the same kind of pain I sometimes get in my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Based on your history and the exam, Mr. Vankampen, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain, possibly with some mild nerve involvement on the left side, causing the pain that radiates down your leg. The straight leg raise test supports that. However, to rule out any other potential causes – like a compressed vertebra or other structural issues – I'd like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. If it helps find out what’s wrong, then yes. I just want to know what’s going on. I don't like feeling like something is broken or… or something serious. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray itself won’t hurt at all. It's just a quick imaging test. The technician will position you to get a clear picture of your spine, and it takes just a few seconds. It does involve a small amount of radiation, but it's a very low dose, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. I’ll write the order for the X-ray now, and the receptionist will schedule it for you. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend continuing with the ibuprofen as needed, and applying heat to your lower back. We can also discuss some simple exercises to help strengthen your back muscles, once we have the X-ray results. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Ibuprofen and heat, and exercises later. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you looking into this. I just want to be able to get back to my garden, you know? It means a lot to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand completely. We'll do our best to get you back to gardening as soon as possible. I’ll also give you a handout with some basic information about lumbar strains and some gentle stretches you can try, even before we get the X-ray results, as long as they don't cause any significant pain. And once the results are back, we can discuss a more tailored exercise plan. I'm going to write down a few things for you, and the receptionist will let you know as soon as the X-ray results are available. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much. A handout and then the results later. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's nice to have someone explain things so clearly.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. That's what I'm here for. Here you go. This has some helpful information and some basic exercises. Just remember to stop if you feel any pain. I'll also write a note for you to take to your primary care doctor, explaining what we discussed today and the X-ray order. The receptionist will take care of scheduling the X-ray and notifying you of the results. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve answered everything I was worried about. Thank you again, for everything. I’ll wait to hear from the receptionist about the X-ray. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Okay, you too, Mr. Vankampen. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before then. We’ll get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better. Have a good day and take it easy. .
