DOCTOR: Good morning, Aron. I’m Dr. Auelua. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, my chest... it hurts sometimes. Not all the time. It’s… in my breast. It’s a little strange, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aron. That is good information to start with. It's definitely worth getting to the bottom of. When you say it hurts, can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm... it’s not a sharp pain. More like… a dull ache. Like when you use a muscle too much. And it’s not always in the same spot. Sometimes it's here… and sometimes it’s a little over there. It comes and goes. Not every day.
DOCTOR: Right, a dull ache that shifts around a bit. And it's not constant. That gives us a starting point. Is there anything that seems to trigger the pain – like specific movements, exercise, or even just certain times of day?
PATIENT: Well... I do roofing, you know? So, lots of reaching and lifting. Maybe that does it? It feels worse after a long day at work, for sure. And… I think when I lie down sometimes, it feels a little better. Not always, but often. I don’t really notice it at certain times of the day, though. Just… after work.
DOCTOR: Okay, roofing – that's physically demanding work, so that’s helpful to know. The fact that it’s better when you lie down is also good information. Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or any changes to the skin in your chest area?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. It doesn’t look different. Feels different, but not look different. No bumps, no red spots, nothing. Just… sore. It's hard to explain. I just thought it was a muscle thing at first. But it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this pain been gradually getting worse, or has it been pretty consistent since it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it started small. Like, just a little ache after work. Then it started to happen more often. Now, it's… more noticeable, I guess. Not really bad, but enough that I wanted to check. It's been maybe a month or so. It’s not getting worse every day, but it hasn't gone away either.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been building gradually over about a month, and it's not significantly worsening recently. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the chest pain – things like a cough, shortness of breath, fever, or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I feel okay, otherwise. No cough, no trouble breathing. Not sick. And my weight... I don't know. I haven't really checked. My wife cooks good food, so I'm probably still the same. No fever, for sure.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your nipples – like any discharge, scaling, or inversion?
PATIENT: Discharge? Uh… no. I haven't really… looked, to be honest. It’s not something I check. No, nothing like that. I don’t think so. Scaling… I don’t know what that looks like. And inversion… is that when they go… inside? No, they look normal. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aron, that's perfectly alright. No need to feel embarrassed about checking. It’s just part of trying to figure things out. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical problems that you’re aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy. Maybe a cold every now and then, but nothing serious. No high blood pressure, no sugar problems. My wife always tells me I need to eat more vegetables, but that’s all. I haven’t been to the doctor much in my life, to be honest. I try to stay active with the roofing, so I figured I was okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. Just… a few cuts and scrapes from work, but nothing that needed a doctor. Mostly just band-aids.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And what about your family – do any of your close relatives have a history of breast cancer, or any other types of cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. My mom... she had something, a long time ago. Not breast cancer, I don't think. Maybe something with her stomach? I'm not really sure. She passed away a few years back, and my wife handles all that kind of remembering. My dad... he was healthy as a horse, until the very end. No cancer that I know of. I don't really know much about my family's medical history, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aron, that's alright. It’s common for people not to have a complete family medical history. Let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My wife wouldn't let me. She says it's bad for my health. And she's right. I do drink sometimes, a beer with dinner maybe. Not too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you do any regular exercise besides the roofing?
PATIENT: Well... the roofing is exercise, right? No, not really. I used to play soccer when I was younger, but not anymore. Too busy with work. I try to stay active, just with the job. It keeps me moving. Not much time for other things, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just to finish up with some basics, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can take most things, I think. Never had any bad reactions to anything. Nothing I'm aware of. My wife gives me medicine when I'm sick, and it always seems to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aron. That’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll examine your chest area, just to get a better feel for things. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Alright, everything sounds clear on your heart and lungs. Now, I'm going to gently examine your chest area. I'll be feeling for any lumps, swelling, or tenderness. Please relax and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay... I'm noticing some mild tenderness here, on the left side, near your pectoral muscle. It’s not a distinct lump, but it’s definitely more sensitive to the touch than the right side. No obvious swelling or redness. Do you feel that tenderness when I press there?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's it. That's where it hurts. Not all the time, but when you press there, yeah. It feels… achy. Like a bruise, almost. It's not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It feels like it's deep inside, not right on the skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aron. That's helpful to know. Given your description of the pain, the gradual onset, and what I’m feeling on the exam, it could be a muscle strain or inflammation of the cartilage in your chest wall – costochondritis. However, because of the location, and to be thorough, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a chest X-ray just to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It will help us to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. If that's what you think is best, Doctor, then go ahead. I trust your judgement. An X-ray sounds fine. I just want to know what it is, so I can get back to work!
DOCTOR: Okay, Aron. I understand. I'll write the order for the X-ray now, and the receptionist will schedule it for you. It's usually a quick procedure. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the discomfort. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just... how long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back here? I just need to know if it's something serious, so I can get back to work. My wife will be worried if I'm out for too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aron. The X-ray results usually come back within 24-48 hours. The receptionist will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We’ll review the images together, and I’ll explain what we find. If the X-ray is clear, we can likely manage this with conservative treatment – rest, pain relievers, and possibly some physical therapy exercises. If it does show something concerning, we’ll discuss further steps, which might include a referral to a specialist. Do you have any allergies to contrast dyes, just in case?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. My wife always asks before I get anything. She's very careful. I don't think they'll need any dyes, though, right? Just a regular X-ray?
DOCTOR: No, you’re right. A standard chest X-ray doesn’t require any contrast dyes. I just ask as a precaution. Okay, Aron, I’m going to write up the order for the X-ray now. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if your pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, shortness of breath, or coughing. Here's the order for the X-ray. The receptionist will help you schedule it. Do you have any questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I feel a little better just knowing what might be going on. I'll call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aron. I'm glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take it easy, and try not to overdo it. And if you have any concerns at all, please don't hesitate to call. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Okay, you too, Doctor. Thank you again. Bye now.
