DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it’s about this…letter. For a pet, you see. A little…thing they need. Somewhere official, I suppose. I can’t quite recall where exactly they need it for, though. It's a bit of a fuss, isn’t it? All this paperwork for an animal.
DOCTOR: A letter?
PATIENT: Yes, a letter! My niece, she's…well, she's got a thing for animals. Rescuing them, fostering them... it's constant. And now this one needs…permission, I think? To…stay somewhere. A special place. Honestly, I barely remember the details. She asked me to get the letter because…well, because I'm good with people, I suppose. Though why they can’t handle it themselves, I really don’t know. They’re perfectly capable, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, this is a medical practice. I’m a physician. Are you here for a medical concern, or are you looking for assistance with…animal paperwork?
PATIENT: Oh! Right, right. A doctor’s office. Yes. Well, the paperwork…it feels medical, doesn’t it? Like, proof of…something. Healthy…ness, maybe? For the animal. She said I needed a letter from a doctor. That’s all I know, honestly. Do you…write letters like that? I just need someone official to say…something. It’s all a bit silly, really.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I can certify medical conditions. I cannot simply write a letter stating an animal is “healthy.” That would be…inappropriate. Is your niece concerned about a specific medical issue with this animal that requires documentation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A specific issue… hmm. No, I don’t think so. She didn't say anything about a problem. Just… requirements. For where she wants to keep it. Is that not enough? A doctor’s signature? It just seems like a lot of trouble for a little…creature. Honestly, people these days. So many rules for everything. I really don't understand why it needs me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand you're frustrated, but I need you to be clear with me. Is this animal your pet?
PATIENT: My pet? Heavens, no! I have…had pets, in the past. But no, this isn’t my animal. It belongs to my niece, Fatima. She lives…well, she lives a bit outside of town. Honestly, she’s a bit of a free spirit, my Fatima. Always rescuing things. That’s why she needs this letter, I presume. It’s for a…sanctuary, I think? Somewhere special where she wants to take it. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: So, to be clear, you are here on behalf of your niece, Fatima, to obtain a medical document for an animal she wishes to place in a sanctuary?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s it exactly! You’re a clever one, Doctor. A sanctuary. That’s what she said. And she needs a…a health certificate, I suppose? Or something official from a medical professional. Though why she can't get it herself, I truly don't know. She's perfectly capable. It's just…she asked me, and I’m trying to be helpful. Honestly, the things I do for family.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I still need to understand why a health certificate requires a visit to my office. Is Fatima unable to take the animal to a veterinarian?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, she…she said something about needing someone…established. You know? Someone with…standing in the community. She said the sanctuary…they prefer a doctor's letter. Apparently, it carries more weight. Honestly, I don't make the rules. She just said you were the best. She’s always going on about how wonderful you are, Doctor. Such a dramatic girl, my Fatima. But lovely, truly. It’s just…a lot of fuss over an animal.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I appreciate the compliment, but a “doctor’s letter” from a physician who hasn’t examined an animal is not a substitute for a veterinary evaluation. I can not and will not provide documentation for an animal’s health without a proper examination performed by a licensed veterinarian. That is unethical and frankly, irresponsible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s…unfortunate. Honestly, you’re being very difficult. My niece said this was a simple request. She clearly explained everything. It’s just a formality, a signature… I don’t understand why you’re making such a fuss. Perhaps I should just call Fatima and let her explain it to you herself. She's very persuasive, you know. And she’s always right. I’m sure she'll be very disappointed.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I am not being difficult. I am practicing medicine ethically. A veterinary evaluation is required to determine the health of an animal. I can provide you with the number for the closest veterinary clinic if you would like. I will not compromise my professional integrity to fulfill a request that is not medically sound. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Fine! No, thank you. I'll…I'll just have to explain to Fatima that you were…unhelpful. She won't be pleased. Really, I came here expecting a simple signature, and this is what I get? The things I do for family… I’m wasting my time.
