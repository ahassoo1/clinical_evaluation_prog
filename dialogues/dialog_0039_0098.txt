DOCTOR: Hello, Demondre. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Kamahele. Good to meet you too. Uh, well, I just… wanted to check things out. I ain't really sick sick, you know? Just kinda curious, I guess. Been workin' on the boats a long time and thought maybe I should see if everything's alright inside.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible, Demondre. Preventative care is always a good idea, especially with physically demanding work. “Checking things out” is a perfectly valid reason to come in. Okay, so you’re not experiencing any specific symptoms right now?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s just the job, I think. Lots of lifting and… bein' out in the sun. No pains, no coughs, nothin’ like that. Just wanna make sure nothin’ bad’s buildin’ up, if you know what I mean. Like, are my lungs okay from all the salt air? Things like that.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you're mainly concerned about the long-term effects of your work – the lifting, the sun exposure, and the salt air. That's good to be proactive about. Let's go through a bit of your medical history, just to get a baseline. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Mostly just when somethin' really hurt. I had a bad back a few years ago, went to the clinic then. And… uh, when I got divorced, I had to go for some paperwork stuff, but that wasn’t a check-up, just signin' things. That's about it, I think. I got Medicare, though. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Medicare is excellent, and yes, it's good to know you're covered. It just helps us with billing and making sure we can get you the best possible care. Okay, so a previous back injury and some paperwork a few years ago. No other significant medical history?
PATIENT: Nope. No big stuff. I try to eat okay, mostly fish 'cause of the job. And drink water. Sometimes too much coffee, if I’m bein’ honest. Never had any… I don’t know… serious illnesses, like. No asthma or nothin’. Just the usual colds now and then. Family side… my mom had high blood pressure, I think. But that’s all I really know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no chronic illnesses, occasional colds, fish-based diet, a bit of coffee, and a mother with high blood pressure. That gives me a good starting point. And no allergies to medications that you know of?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’. I haven't really taken much medicine, to be fair. Just pain relievers for the back, and stuff like that. Nothing regular. I think I remember bein' given some kinda shot as a kid, but that was a long time ago. I don’t even remember what it was for.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, minimal medication use. Good. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your daily work routine?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I work on different boats, mostly cargo ships. It changes a lot. But usually, it’s lots of liftin’ – boxes, ropes, supplies. Cleanin’ the engine room, oilin’ things, makin’ sure everything’s runnin' smooth. Long hours, sometimes 12 or 14 at a stretch. Lots of bein’ outside in the sun, even when it’s hot. And sometimes, the salt spray gets everywhere. It’s hard work, but it pays the bills. We usually have a cook on board, so I don’t have to worry about food too much. That’s about it, I guess. Pretty simple life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Long hours, heavy lifting, sun exposure, and salt spray. That gives me a good idea of the physical demands you're under. Now, to get a better understanding, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. I don't mind. Just tell me if somethin' feels weird, or somethin'. I ain't a fan of doctors, but I trust you seemin' nice. Go ahead. Where do I need to be?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Demondre, I appreciate your trust. That’s reassuring to hear. Just have a seat on the exam table, and I'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to make sure everything sounds normal. Take a deep breath in... and out... good. Your heart sounds regular, good strong beat. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackling that I can hear right now. Blood pressure is 135 over 85. A little elevated, but not concerning given the physical nature of your work. Now, let's take a quick look at your skin… any areas that bother you, or have changed recently?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' really bothers me. I get kinda sunburned sometimes, but that’s just from bein’ outside all day. I usually put lotion on, but sometimes I forget. I got a few scars on my arms from workin’ with ropes, but they’re old. They don’t hurt or nothin’. Just… rough skin, I guess. Lots of calluses on my hands too. It's just what happens when you work with ropes all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see the calluses and the old scars. That’s very common with your line of work, Demondre. Skin looks otherwise healthy. Now, just one more thing, could you stand up for me, and I’ll just quickly check your reflexes?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Just tell me what to do. I ain't done this before, so I hope I don't mess it up.
DOCTOR: No need to worry, you're doing fine. Just relax. Okay… good reflexes. Everything seems normal so far. Based on the exam, your heart and lungs sound healthy, reflexes are good, and your skin is consistent with your work history. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that's not unexpected given the physical demands of your job. However, it’s something we should keep an eye on. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to order some routine blood work – just to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and make sure everything is within normal limits. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. If it makes sure I’m okay, I don’t mind gettin’ some blood work done. I just hope it don’t take too long. I got a boat leavin' next week. Will it take long to get the results back? And will Medicare cover it? I ain’t got a lot of extra money, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Demondre. Medicare should cover the routine blood work, especially given your age and the preventative nature of this check-up. I’ll have the nurse double-check that for you, just to be sure. As for the turnaround time, the results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. We can definitely get it done before your boat leaves next week. I’m going to order the blood work now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the sample. She’ll explain the process to you, and you can ask her any questions you have. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Nah, I think you covered everything. Just gotta get the blood work done, right? And make sure Medicare pays for it. I appreciate you checkin' me out, Doc. It's good to know I ain’t fallin’ apart just yet.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Demondre. That’s what I’m here for. And we’ll definitely make sure Medicare handles the billing. The nurse will be in shortly. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and safe travels on your next voyage.
