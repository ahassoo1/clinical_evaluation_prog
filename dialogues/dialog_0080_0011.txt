DOCTOR: Hi Armando, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, Doctor... Rosanova, is it? I need somethin' signed. Paperwork, you see. Folks want me to… get somethin' done. Cosmetic, they call it. Don’t rightly know why I need it, just that I gotta get cleared. Fast, if you don’t mind. I got work to do. Towers ain’t gonna fix themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need a medical clearance for some cosmetic work and would like to get it done as quickly as possible. Let's get some information down, just to be thorough. First, can you tell me what kind of cosmetic work are you looking to have done?
PATIENT: Look, I told ya, I don't know. Some young fella offered it. Said it’d help with… appearances. Somethin' about my face. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a tower man. I climb things, I fix things. I don't spend my time lookin' in mirrors. He had the forms, I gotta sign 'em. That's all I know. Is this gonna take long? I really don't have time for a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Armando. It's good you're getting this checked out, even if you aren't sure of the details. It is important I ask a few questions, just to make sure it's safe for you. It won't take long, I promise. Do you recall the name of the young fella or the company he works for?
PATIENT: Company? Heavens no. Young fella… skinny kid. Name was… uh… somethin’ with a ‘J’. Jeremy? Jason? I don’t rightly recall. He was pushy, that’s what I remember. Kept talkin' 'bout "boostin' my image" for the… advertisements. Somethin' about bein' on the radio. Look, I just wanna get this signed, Doctor. I got a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Okay, a young man, name starting with a 'J', working with radio advertisements. That gives me something to work with. Let's shift gears then. Have you had any medical problems at all recently?
PATIENT: Medical problems? Well… I got this ache in my back, always have. Comes with climbin’ those towers, you see. And my knees ain’t what they used to be. Beyond that… nah. I’m a strong fella. Always been. Don’t go to doctors much. Waste of time, if you ask me. Never helped none. I take some little pills for… well, I forget what they’re for. Somethin’ for the water, maybe? I drink a lot of water when I’m workin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, back and knee pain from your work, and a medication you take occasionally for… hydration. That's helpful. Do you remember what the pills look like?
PATIENT: Look, I told ya, I forget! Little white things. Or maybe blue? Round, I think. Small. I get 'em from… the general store. Old Man Hemlock's place. He just hands 'em to me when I ask. He knows I climb the towers. He probably figures I need somethin’ for the heat. I ain’t a doctor, Doctor! I fix things, I don't memorize pills! Are we gettin' anywhere with this? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, small, white or blue pills from Old Man Hemlock’s store. We’ll look into that. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Supplements? Regular? Heavens no! I eat a sandwich, sometimes. And drink water, like I said. I ain’t one for fancy things. This is a waste of my time, Doctor. I’m a practical man. I need this signed, so I can get back to work. Towers don’t fix themselves, you know. Are you gonna sign it or not? I got a schedule to keep!
DOCTOR: Alright, Armando. I understand your frustration. Before I can sign off on this clearance, I need to do a quick physical exam, just to make sure you're healthy enough for… whatever this procedure is. It won't take long. Can I listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your knees and back?
PATIENT: Hmph. Examine me? For what? I told you I climb towers! I’m strong! I don't need examinin'. This is preposterous. But… fine. Get it over with. Just be quick about it. I got work to do, Doctor. Don't waste my time. And don't tell me nothin' I don't need to hear. Just do what you gotta do and sign the paper.
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando, just relax. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Blood pressure is a little elevated – 145 over 90. Lungs are clear, but you do have a slightly labored breathing pattern. Knees show some crepitus and mild swelling, consistent with wear and tear. And your lower back… some muscle guarding and tenderness upon palpation. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your legs?
PATIENT: Numbness? Tingling? Heavens no! I climb towers, Doctor! I feel everything. If I couldn't feel my legs, I'd fall off! But yeah, it aches. Like I said. Always has. You’re pokin' around somethin' that’s been achin' for fifty years. Look, are we gettin' anywhere with this? I need that paper signed. This is gettin' ridiculous. Tell me if you're gonna do it or not. I got a schedule to keep, you know. Towers ain't gonna fix themselves!
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando. Given your elevated blood pressure, the crepitus in your knees, and the tenderness in your lower back, I’m hesitant to sign off on this clearance without some further investigation. I'm concerned that undergoing an unspecified cosmetic procedure could put undue stress on your system, potentially exacerbating these existing conditions. I recommend we get an EKG to check your heart, and some X-rays of your knees and back to assess the extent of the damage. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: EKGs? X-rays? Are you serious?! I told you I climb towers! I'm perfectly fine! This is a complete waste of my time! I don't need EKGs, and I sure as heck don't need X-rays! I just need that paper signed! Look, I'm a practical man, Doctor. I don't have time for fancy tests. This young fella said it was safe, and I trust his judgment more than I trust yours! Sign the paper, or I'm leaving! I got work to do! This is unbelievable! Towers ain't gonna fix themselves, and I'm not spendin' my time in here!
DOCTOR: Armando, I understand your frustration, and I respect your desire to get back to work. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your safety. Given your reluctance to undergo further testing, I am unable to sign this clearance form. It would be unethical of me to approve a procedure without a proper assessment of your health. However, I can provide you with a referral to a specialist who can evaluate your condition and determine if you are a suitable candidate for this procedure. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Are you… refusing to sign the paper?! After all this?! This is… this is outrageous! You’re wastin’ my time, Doctor! A complete waste! I don't need your referrals, and I sure as heck don't need your opinions! I'll find someone else who understands the value of hard work! Specialist… what a joke. Towers ain't gonna fix themselves. .
