DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It is nice to meet you too. Um, well… I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come see a doctor. It’s not a lot of blood, but… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Weichers. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is certainly something we need to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about this cough?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it started maybe two weeks ago? At first, it was just a normal cough, like a little cold. But then, a few days ago, I noticed… the red. It happens when I cough hard, usually. Not every time, but… often enough. I don't have a fever, and I don’t feel sick otherwise, just… worried about the blood.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Weichers. That’s helpful. Two weeks of a cough progressing to include blood is something we'll definitely look into. You mentioned it happens with harder coughs. Can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Um… describe it? It’s… red, of course. It’s not… bright red, like when you cut yourself. It’s more… darker. Like… mixed with the mucus. And it’s not a huge amount, just streaks, really. Not enough to fill anything up, if that makes sense. It’s… scary to talk about.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, and you’re doing the right thing by bringing this to my attention. Darker blood mixed with mucus is good information. It suggests the source might be a bit deeper in the respiratory system, but we need to investigate further to be sure. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'm going to ask you a few more questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I have been a little tired, maybe? But I also lost my husband last year, so… I thought that was just from being sad, you know? No chest pain, no trouble breathing. I haven't lost weight. And no night sweats. Just… the cough and the tiredness, I guess. And the blood, of course. Is tiredness a sign of something bad?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable that you’ve been experiencing tiredness after such a significant loss, Ms. Weichers. Grief can manifest in many ways, and fatigue is very common. However, we need to consider all possibilities. To clarify, the tiredness is relatively new, or has it been ongoing since your husband's passing?
PATIENT: It’s been… on and off since then. Some days are better than others. But it feels a little worse lately, now that I’m thinking about it. Maybe it is connected to the cough? I don’t know. Everything feels a little confusing right now. I'm sorry, I am not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Weichers. It’s perfectly normal to feel confused, and it’s good that you’re sharing all of this with me. It’s important to rule out any medical causes for your symptoms, and connecting the dots is what I’m here for. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I had the flu a few times, like everyone does. And I had my appendix taken out when I was a teenager. But nothing… serious, I don’t think. No asthma, no heart problems, no diabetes. Just the usual things. Oh! And I sometimes get a little bit of high blood pressure, but my doctor gives me a pill for it. It’s usually okay.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s good to know. And what medication are you taking for your blood pressure, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. It’s called… Amlodipine, I think? 5 milligrams. I take one every morning. And sometimes, if my knees bother me, I take ibuprofen. But not very often.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Amlodipine and occasional ibuprofen are helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. I don’t have any trouble with pollen, or dust, or anything like that. I am very lucky, I guess. I haven’t been very sick my whole life. This blood is very worrying, because it's so… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Weichers. It is unusual, and that’s why we’re taking it seriously. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, I have never smoked. My husband… he used to smoke, but he quit a long time ago. I always told him it was bad for his health. And I have never been around a lot of smoke, either. I try to stay healthy. He passed away from… something else. Not smoking.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Weichers. It’s good to know you've never smoked. Now, do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes. I like a glass of wine with dinner, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing… heavy. Just a little bit to relax. I don't drink beer, and I don't drink hard liquor. Just wine. Not much, really. I don't need to drink.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Now, finally, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And my father… he had a heart problem when he was older. But nothing… serious that I know of. No cancer, no lung problems, no tuberculosis. Just the usual things. I don't know much about my grandparents, they passed away when I was very young.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Weichers. That gives me a good overview. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and feel your lymph nodes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle? I am a little scared.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Weichers. I will be as gentle as possible. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm listening to your lungs now. I hear some mild wheezing, which could be related to your cough. Your heart sounds are normal. Your lymph nodes feel normal. Now, could you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is there anything wrong? The wheezing sounds scary. Is that the blood? I am getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks a little red, but nothing concerning at first glance. The wheezing doesn't necessarily mean there's something seriously wrong, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Now, I would like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count to get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. A chest X-ray… will it show the blood? Will it show if something is… wrong with my lungs? I just want to know what is happening. I don’t like being scared.
DOCTOR: The chest X-ray will help us visualize your lungs and heart, and it can often detect abnormalities like pneumonia, tumors, or fluid buildup. It won’t directly show the blood, but it can help us identify the cause of the bleeding. The CBC will check your red and white blood cell counts, which can give us clues about infection or anemia. We'll get the results back relatively quickly, usually within a few hours. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a cough suppressant to help alleviate your symptoms.
PATIENT: Okay. A cough suppressant sounds good. Anything to stop coughing up blood. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. What should I do if… if the bleeding gets worse before I get the results? Should I go to the hospital?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Ms. Weichers. If the bleeding gets significantly worse – meaning a larger amount of blood, or if it’s accompanied by chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or weakness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not hesitate. Otherwise, if it remains a small amount, you can wait for the X-ray results. I'll have the results faxed to me and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they are available. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds clear. A larger amount of blood, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or weakness… go to the emergency room. Okay. I think I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor Bakan. You have put my mind at ease a little. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. For now, try to get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid strenuous activity or anything that triggers your cough. And please, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Here is the prescription for the cough suppressant and the instructions for the X-ray. The radiology department will contact you to schedule the appointment. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that is everything. Thank you again, Doctor Bakan. You have been very helpful and kind. I will call if anything changes. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I wish you all the best, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. You have a good day as well. .
