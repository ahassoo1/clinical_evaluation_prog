DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, you said? I don’t really do appointments unless I need to, so… yeah, results. Let’s get right to it, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Efficient is good. Let me just pull up your lab results here… Okay, so we ran a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. Just to give you a quick overview… Are you familiar with those at all, or should I explain what those tests look for?
PATIENT: No, not really. I just… they told me what tests I needed, I showed up, they took blood. Explain it, please. I’m not good with medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No problem at all. A complete blood count – or CBC – basically gives us a picture of all the different types of cells in your blood. It can help us detect things like anemia, infection, or other blood disorders. The metabolic panel looks at different chemicals in your blood, like electrolytes, kidney and liver function. And the TSH test checks your thyroid, which controls your metabolism. Everything came back within normal limits, Ms. Kovtun. Your blood count looks good, your kidney and liver functions are normal, and your thyroid is functioning as it should. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Normal? Okay, good. That’s… actually really good. I was a bit worried, to be honest. No, I think I understand. So… everything’s fine? I don’t need to do anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, everything appears fine. The results don't indicate any immediate concerns. However – and this is important – these tests are just a snapshot in time. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – fatigue, weight changes, anything unusual – please don’t hesitate to call or come back in. You're 29, right?
PATIENT: Yep, 29. Just turned it in April. Is that… relevant? Look, I appreciate you saying everything’s okay, but I have a pretty tight schedule today, so if there’s nothing else… I’m good to go?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. Just standard information gathering. Given your age and the fact that you're uninsured, it's good to establish a baseline, even with normal results. We want to be proactive. Alright. Then, for the record, we’ve discussed the normal lab results. I recommend a follow-up appointment in one year, or sooner if you develop any new concerns. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: A year? Ugh. Okay, fine. A year. No, I think that's it. Just… glad it was nothing. Thanks, Doctor. I really do need to get going.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. We'll document everything, and the receptionist can get you scheduled for a check-up next August. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything comes up before then. Have a good day, Ms. Kovtun.
