DOCTOR: Hi Chanz, welcome. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Uh, well, it’s about getting a good night’s sleep, mostly. And, you know, feeling a bit…better. Honestly, it’s all a bit blurry what exactly I want. My wife used to handle all this sort of thing. She had a real knack for knowing what was what.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're feeling a little lost and not quite yourself, and sleep is a big part of that. That's very common when things change, and it's perfectly alright to not have all the answers right away. Let’s try to break it down a bit. When did you start noticing problems with your sleep?
PATIENT: Problems… hmm. That’s a tough one. It feels like it’s been… a while. Since… well, since she passed, I suppose. Everything kind of blurred together after that. I used to fall asleep anywhere, but now… now I toss and turn. I wouldn't say it's every night, but a lot of them. I really can't pinpoint a specific date, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all. It’s completely understandable, especially given the circumstances. “A while” is fine. It’s more important to get a sense of what’s happening now. So, these nights where you're tossing and turning… what's going through your mind when that happens?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… everything. Nothing. Just… stuff. Old memories mostly, I guess. Things I should’ve said, things I did. Regrets, I suppose. It’s not like I'm actively thinking about them, it’s more like they're… floating around. It’s annoying, honestly. And then I worry about things. Silly things, probably. Did I lock the shop? Is the roof going to leak?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a lot of racing thoughts, both memories and worries, when you’re trying to sleep. That sounds really exhausting. And it’s not silly to worry about practical things like the shop and the roof. Do these thoughts keep you awake all night, or do you eventually manage to fall asleep?
PATIENT: Eventually, yeah. I usually do. It just takes… ages. And I don’t feel rested when I wake up, even if I’ve been in bed for eight hours. It’s like… I’ve been through eight hours, not in them. Does that make sense? I get up feeling… heavy. Like I haven’t slept at all.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like the quality of your sleep is really suffering, even if the quantity seems okay. Feeling unrefreshed after a full night's sleep is a big indicator of that. Okay. And during the day, how does this lack of sleep affect you?
PATIENT: Well, I’m a bit… grumpy, I suppose. My son says I am, anyway. He's a good lad, tries to be patient. I also… lose focus easily. I’m a musical instrument repairer, you see. Requires a steady hand and a good ear. It’s harder to concentrate now. Small things get missed. I haven’t made a big mistake yet, but I worry I will. It’s… frustrating, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so irritability, difficulty concentrating, and worry about your work performance. That paints a pretty clear picture. It's understandable that you're frustrated. Now, just to get a broader sense of things, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. Not really. I eat when I feel hungry, don’t really pay much attention. Maybe I’m not as enthusiastic about cooking as I used to be. My wife was a brilliant cook. Weight… probably lost a bit. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself. Not a priority, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major changes in appetite, perhaps a slight decrease in enjoyment of cooking, and possible slight weight loss. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you tried anything already to help with your sleep?
PATIENT: Tried… well, my son suggested some herbal tea. Chamomile, I think. Didn't do much, if anything. I used to have a glass of milk before bed, but I stopped. Just… couldn’t be bothered. Honestly, I haven’t put much effort into it. What’s the point if it doesn't work?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've tried chamomile tea with no benefit, and briefly tried milk. That's good to know. You're right, it can be discouraging when things don't work right away. Alright. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else that might be contributing to your sleep problems. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Go ahead. I suppose it can't hurt. Just… try not to poke too much, alright? My back’s been a bit stiff lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be gentle. Just take some deep breaths for me. Everything sounds clear on that front. Now, let me check your reflexes… and a quick look in your ears and throat… Reflexes are normal. Ears and throat look clear. No obvious signs of infection. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. I’m just palpating your abdomen… everything feels normal there as well. And just a quick assessment of your back… some mild tenderness, as you mentioned, but no sign of anything serious. Everything seems physically okay, which is good. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing insomnia related to grief and stress. It's very common after a loss. It's not something you just "snap out of", and it’s okay to seek help. Would you be open to discussing some options for improving your sleep?
PATIENT: Insomnia… that sounds about right. Grief and stress… well, no surprises there. Look, I’m not one for… pills, if you know what I mean. I’d rather not be dependent on something. Are there other options? Maybe… something to help me relax? Something… natural?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. You're right to be cautious about medication, especially if you're concerned about dependency. We definitely don't have to go that route right away. There are several non-pharmacological approaches we can try. One of the most effective is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, or CBT-I. It’s a type of therapy that helps you identify and change the thoughts and behaviors that are keeping you awake. It also teaches you relaxation techniques and establishes a regular sleep schedule. We could also explore some simple sleep hygiene strategies: things like making sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed, and establishing a relaxing bedtime routine. Would you be interested in learning more about CBT-I, or starting with some sleep hygiene tips?
PATIENT: CBT-I… sounds a bit complicated. I’m not very good at… talking about my feelings, to be honest. Sleep hygiene… that sounds simpler. Making the room dark and quiet… I suppose I can manage that. Avoiding caffeine… I do enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, but I can try. What does that… involve, exactly? The sleep hygiene?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's start with sleep hygiene then. It’s all about creating an environment and routine that’s conducive to sleep. Here are some key things: Regular Sleep Schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time every day, even on weekends, to regulate your body’s natural sleep-wake cycle. Bedroom Environment: As you mentioned, dark, quiet, and cool. Blackout curtains can be helpful. Avoid Stimulants: No caffeine or nicotine close to bedtime. Relaxing Bedtime Routine: A warm bath, reading , gentle stretching, or listening to calming music. Limit Screen Time: Avoid phones, tablets, and computers for at least an hour before bed. The blue light can interfere with sleep. Regular Exercise: But avoid strenuous exercise close to bedtime. Avoid Large Meals Before Bed: A light snack is okay, but nothing heavy. I can give you a handout with more detailed information. Let's try implementing these changes for the next two weeks and see if they make a difference. We can follow up then and discuss whether to explore other options, like a referral to a therapist specializing in CBT-I if you're interested. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. I can try. It sounds… sensible, at least. A lot of common sense, really. My wife always said a regular routine was important. I suppose she was right, as usual. A handout would be good, yes. Something to remind me. And… thank you, Doctor. You've been… helpful. Not condescending, which is a plus.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chanz. It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed, and it takes courage to reach out for help. I’m glad I could offer some guidance, and I appreciate you being open with me. Here’s that handout. It covers everything we discussed. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, August 16th, to see how you’re doing. In the meantime, if anything concerning comes up – significant changes in your symptoms, or if you feel your sleep is getting worse – don't hesitate to call the clinic. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Amussen. I appreciate your patience. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chanz. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
