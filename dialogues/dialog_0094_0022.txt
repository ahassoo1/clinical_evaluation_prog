DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Gegan. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… My tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. It’s just… not very hungry. I don’t know when it started, really. A little while ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, “tummy feels big” and a decreased appetite. And you said it’s been going on for a little while. Can you tell me a bit more about the “big” feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… hard to say. It’s not painful, you know? Just… full. Like I ate too much, but I didn’t. Maybe like a balloon, a little bit. Not a big balloon, but… you understand? It just feels… different. I don’t usually feel like this.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Soila. It sounds uncomfortable. And you mentioned not feeling hungry – has your weight changed at all recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh dear… I don’t really know. I don’t weigh myself. I used to, when I was… younger. But not anymore. Everything is… a bit of a blur these days, you know? I just know my clothes feel a little… loose, maybe? But that could be anything. Old age, I suppose!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Soila. We can certainly get a weight for you today, if you'd like. It can be helpful. And it's good you noticed your clothes feeling a little looser – that's a good observation. Now, aside from the fullness and decreased appetite, have you noticed any other changes at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes… let me think. Oh! Sometimes I feel… tired. Very tired. But I am old, you know. Everyone gets tired when they get old! Is that what you mean? And… sometimes my tummy makes noises. Funny noises. Not loud noises, but… gurgling, maybe? Like water.
DOCTOR: Those are helpful things to know, Soila. The tiredness and the gurgling sounds. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh dear. That’s… a private question, isn’t it? Well… I go to the bathroom… when I need to. It’s… normal, I think. Not different. Maybe a little… less often than before? But I don’t really keep track. Everything feels a bit… slow, you know? Slow in general. Like my whole body is moving in slow motion.
DOCTOR: I understand, Soila. It’s perfectly alright to share as much or as little as you’re comfortable with. “Slow” is helpful information. Now, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your skin – like yellowing, or any unusual itching?
PATIENT: No, no nausea. I haven’t thrown up. And my skin… I don’t think it’s yellow. I haven't looked very closely, to be honest! It just feels… old. Wrinkly, you know? Not itchy. No. I haven’t noticed anything like that. Is something wrong, Doctor? You’re asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Soila. I am asking a lot of questions, and it's because I want to get a good understanding of what’s going on. It’s good that you haven’t had any nausea or vomiting, and your skin doesn’t seem to be changing color. Now, just a few more questions about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical conditions… let me think. That was a long time ago. I was a sociologist, you know. I studied people who were sick, not be sick! I don’t remember ever being told I had anything… serious. I had a little trouble with my blood pressure once, a long, long time ago. But that was fixed, I think. Old Dr. Petrov, he gave me pills. That was… oh, many years ago. I don't remember much else, truly. It all gets mixed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. High blood pressure in the past, treated with medication. That’s helpful. And you haven’t been diagnosed with anything else that you recall. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me see… I think… yes. When I was young, I had my appendix out. A very long time ago. And… oh, I had a cataract in one eye, fixed with an operation. That was more recent, maybe twenty years ago? But that's all I remember, I believe. Everything is so hazy. It feels like a lifetime ago, all of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. Appendix removal and cataract surgery. Now, can you tell me about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… My husband, bless his soul, passed away many years ago. We never had children. I had a sister, Anya, but she… she passed away a long time ago too. I don’t have any close family left, I’m afraid. I had some cousins, but we didn't see each other often. It's just me now. It gets lonely sometimes.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear that, Soila. It sounds like you’ve experienced a lot of loss. Now, I’m going to ask about some lifestyle questions, if you don’t mind. Have you smoked cigarettes at any time in your life?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. My mother always said smoking was terrible for you. And my husband didn’t like it. So, no. I never smoked. I drank a little vodka sometimes, with meals. Just a little. Not very much. I don't anymore. I don't really enjoy it much, these days. It doesn't taste the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. No smoking, and very limited alcohol use in the past. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but that was a long time ago. Dr. Petrov stopped it when it got better. I don’t take anything now. No pills. Nothing at all. Just… sometimes I have a little tea. For my nerves. But that's not medicine, is it?
DOCTOR: No, tea isn't medicine, Soila. Okay, no current medications. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I'd like to ask about any allergies you might have. Do you have any known allergies to foods, medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe… I get a little itchy when I touch certain flowers, but that's just a little scratchiness. Nothing serious. No. I don’t believe I have any allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I've lived a long life, Doctor. I think I would have known if I was allergic to something!
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. No known allergies. Thank you for answering all of those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your abdomen to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? I’m an old woman, you know. Everything is a bit… fragile these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I’ll be very gentle. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a nice, slow, deep breath for me. Your heart sounds regular, but a little quiet. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I notice your abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. It’s not particularly tender to the touch, but it feels a bit… full. I don't feel any obvious masses.
PATIENT: Hmm… it doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… feels strange. Like a balloon, like I said. Full of air, maybe? Not painful, just… uncomfortable. Is something wrong, Doctor? You look very serious.
DOCTOR: It’s good that it's not painful, Soila. But you're right to notice I’m being thoughtful. The fullness I’m feeling is something we need to investigate further. There are several things it could be, and it’s too early to say for sure. To help me figure out what's going on, I’d like to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health, and the CT scan will allow us to see a detailed picture of your organs and identify any potential problems. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? Blood tests…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Will it hurt? Will they poke me a lot? I don't like needles very much, Doctor. And… is it expensive? I don’t have much money, you know. I just want to feel better. I don’t want any trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. It’s natural to feel anxious about tests, especially when you're not feeling well. The blood test will involve a small prick of your finger, just a few drops of blood. We can minimize the discomfort. As for the CT scan, it doesn’t involve any needles. You’ll lie on a table, and a scanner will take pictures of your abdomen. It's painless, like having an X-ray. Regarding the cost, that’s a valid concern. Since you are uninsured, we can explore options to make it more affordable. Our financial counseling department can help you understand the costs and potentially find assistance programs. We will work with you to find a solution that fits your budget. The purpose of these tests is to help me understand what’s causing your discomfort and develop a plan to get you feeling better. It’s important to rule out any serious issues, and these tests will give us the information we need. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. That sounds… a little better, when you explain it like that. No needles for the scan, that’s good. And someone will help with the money… that's very kind. Yes, please. Tell me more about what the scan will show. What are we looking for, Doctor? What if it shows something… bad? I just want to know what's going on. I don't want to be scared.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be scared, Soila. It’s brave of you to ask these questions. The CT scan allows us to visualize your organs—your liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreas, and intestines—and look for anything unusual. We’ll be looking for things like masses, fluid collections, or blockages. It will also help us assess the size and shape of your organs. If the scan does show something unusual, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something serious. Many things can cause changes on a scan, and not all of them are life-threatening. If we find anything, we’ll discuss the results in detail and develop a plan for further evaluation or treatment. This might involve additional tests, a consultation with a specialist, or simply monitoring your condition over time. It’s important to remember that we’re taking these steps to get a clear understanding of what’s going on and ensure you receive the best possible care. We’ll be with you every step of the way, answering your questions and providing support. Do you have any specific concerns about what the scan might reveal?
PATIENT: I… I worry about cancer, I suppose. My sister, Anya… she had cancer, a long time ago. It was very… unpleasant. I don't want to be like that. Is that what you're looking for, Doctor? Tumors? And… will it hurt if it is? Will I need… operations? I'm an old woman, Doctor. I don't know if I can handle much more.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly natural to worry about cancer, especially with your sister’s experience, Soila. We will be looking for any signs of tumors, but it’s important to remember that a lot of things can cause fullness and discomfort in the abdomen, and cancer is just one possibility. We’ll only order further tests if the scan reveals something concerning. And if we do find a tumor, it doesn’t automatically mean you’ll need surgery. There are many different treatment options available, depending on the type and size of the tumor, and your overall health. These options might include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or minimally invasive procedures. We will discuss all of these options with you in detail if they become necessary, and we’ll work together to develop a plan that’s right for you. We’ll always prioritize your comfort and quality of life. Right now, let’s focus on getting the scan done and gathering more information. We’ll take things one step at a time. Would you like me to schedule the scan for you today?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. Let’s just get it done. I want to know. I want to be prepared. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. It's… comforting to talk to someone who explains things. Just… please let it not be bad. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. I’m here to help you every step of the way. I completely understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get you answers and provide the best possible care. Let me schedule the CT scan for you now. It’s best to have it done as soon as possible. I’ll also have the lab draw some blood tests. It will take a few days to get the results back. Once we have those, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. The scan will take about 30 minutes, and you’ll lie on a table while the scanner takes pictures. The technician will be able to answer any questions you have during the procedure. The blood tests will only take a few minutes. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Will they let me know when the scan is done? And… will I need to bring anything with me for the follow-up appointment? Just the results? I think… that's all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. Yes, the technician will let you know when the scan is complete. And for the follow-up appointment, just bring yourself – and we’ll have the results ready for you when you arrive. I’ll make a note in your chart to ensure everything is prepared. I’m going to have my nurse, Fatima, come in and give you some written instructions about the scan and the blood tests, and she can also answer any other questions you might have. Just remember, we’re taking things one step at a time. Try not to worry too much before we have the results. I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Fatima, could you please come in and speak with Soila?
PATIENT: Yes… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. I’ll let you and Fatima have some privacy to discuss the details. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before your appointment. I’ll see you soon, Soila.
