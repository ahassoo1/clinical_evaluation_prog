DOCTOR: Right. Well, Kahrin, please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Results, right? You said results discussion. I’m pretty busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Yes, the results. Efficient, I appreciate that. Though a bit… abrupt. Still. We ran a fairly comprehensive panel given your… lack of established care. I assume you haven't been seeing a regular physician?
PATIENT: Nope. Never really had the time, honestly. Or the money, for that matter. Insurance is… a whole thing. So, just tell me what’s what. Good news, bad news, whatever. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the good news is… most things are within normal limits. Cholesterol is slightly elevated, but nothing alarming for your age, and easily addressed with lifestyle changes. Vitamin D is a little low – common, especially if you don't get much sun. We can supplement that. The less good news… your thyroid stimulating hormone – TSH – is significantly elevated. Which suggests… hypothyroidism. Underactive thyroid. It explains some fatigue, potentially some weight gain, things like that. Though symptoms can be vague. Do you experience any of those?
PATIENT: Hypo…what now? Look, I’m not a doctor. Just…slow down. And yeah, I’m always tired. Like, bone-deep tired. And I guess I have put on a few pounds, but…who hasn't? Is that…bad? What does this mean?
DOCTOR: “Who hasn't?
PATIENT: Look, I’m just being honest. It’s been a stressful few years. Lots of moving around for work. So, yeah, a few extra pounds. But is this thyroid thing serious? Do I need…pills for the rest of my life? I really don’t have time for a lot of…maintenance.
DOCTOR: “Maintenance.” Right. Well, let's not jump to conclusions. Hypothyroidism is manageable, but it does generally require ongoing medication – levothyroxine, a synthetic thyroid hormone. It replaces what your thyroid isn't producing. Yes, it's a daily pill, and yes, you’ll need regular blood work to monitor your levels and adjust the dosage. Given your history – or lack thereof, frankly – and the degree of elevation, I want to confirm this with a repeat TSH and also check your free T4 levels. That will give us a clearer picture. We'll also look at your thyroid antibodies to see if it’s an autoimmune cause – Hashimoto's thyroiditis is common. Do you have any family history of thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Hashi…what’s Hashimoto’s? No, no family history that I know of. My mom…she was adopted, so we don’t really know anything about her side. And my dad’s family is…scattered. Mostly just remember some aunts and uncles, but nobody ever talked about health stuff. So, more blood work, huh? When can we do that? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Hashimoto’s is an autoimmune condition where your body attacks your thyroid gland. It's the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Knowing whether it's present does impact management, though the treatment is generally the same. Yes, more blood work. I'll get the lab order printed. The phlebotomist can see you right away, I’m told. It's standard. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I wouldn’t recommend making any significant changes to your diet or exercise routine – that can interfere with the testing. And try to reduce stress, if possible. I know that's easier said than done.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Stress…right. Look, just give me the order. I’ll go get it done. How will I get the results? Will someone call me? I don’t really check my messages a lot. And I’m not good with online portals or anything. Just…tell me what happens when you get them. Can we just do that? Straight to the point.
DOCTOR: Right. Straight to the point. Very well. When I get the results, I will have the nurse call you with the findings. She'll leave a message. If the results are significantly abnormal, we’ll discuss medication options. If they're borderline, we may repeat the testing in a few months. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s it. Just…thanks. I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. Very well. .
