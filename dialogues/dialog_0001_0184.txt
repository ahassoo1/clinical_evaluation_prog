DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, look here. It's about… this. It ain't what it used to be, you understand? Not strong like it was. And it's… hangin'. I want it fixed. Plain and simple. Don't need a whole lotta fuss.
DOCTOR: "Not strong," and "hangin’"... Right. Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Long enough! Years, I tell ya, years! Since… well, since my wife passed. Everything just went south after that, you see? Don't need to hear about the reasons, just fix the problem. I ain't come here for a therapy session.
DOCTOR: Years… alright. And has anything specific changed recently?
PATIENT: Recently? No! That's why I said years! It just… got worse. Slowly. Like everything else. Look, I used to be a strong man, buildin' things, workin' hard. Now… now I just look at myself in the mirror and don't recognize the person starin' back. Is that good enough for you? I want a flat stomach again, understand? Not askin' for the moon, just… proper.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. So, primarily concerned with the appearance of your abdomen… and a loss of strength. Any changes in your diet or exercise habits over those years?
PATIENT: Diet? Exercise? Look, I eat what's put in front of me. And exercise? I used to be exercise! Pile drivin' is exercise, young man! Now… now I mostly sit. What kinda question is that? You think I haven't thought about this? I want a solution, not a quiz.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get… agitated. Just trying to get a full picture. Any pain in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. A little ache. Not sharp, just… there. Mostly when I bend over. But I ain't a young man, things ache all over! It's the look of it, really. It's… unseemly. I want it gone. Like I said. No pain medication, I don’t want to be relyin’ on pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute! What kinda doctor asks a man about… that? I ain't here to discuss my… business! You're a proper doctor, aren't ya? Focus on the stomach! That's what I came for. You start askin’ questions like that and I’m walkin’ right out the door. Don't waste my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. My apologies. Just standard questions, sir. We need to rule things out. Let's get back to the stomach. Have you noticed any hernias?
PATIENT: Hernias? I don’t know nothin’ about hernias! I just know it’s… bulgin’ out. That's all I know. You tell me if it's a hernia, that's what I'm payin' you for! I ain’t a medical man. Stop askin’ me questions I can’t answer. This is gettin’ ridiculous. I just want it fixed, understand? A proper fix. Not a lecture and a bunch of questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. If you'll just lie back on the exam table… and try to relax. I need to feel your abdomen. Just lay down.
PATIENT: Lay down… like I'm a broken doll. Humph. Get it over with. And be gentle. I ain’t made of iron anymore, you know. Don’t go pokin' and proddin’ like I’m some kinda… specimen.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. Just breathe normally. I'm just feeling for any tenderness or masses… Okay, I do feel a bulge in the lower abdomen, midline. Not particularly painful to the touch… There is some laxity in the abdominal muscles… And some subcutaneous fat. Okay, and I'm noting some decreased muscle tone. It appears we are dealing with a ventral hernia, likely due to age and loss of muscle mass. It's not large, but it is present.
PATIENT: Hernia, you say? Like I thought. And what does that mean? Can it be fixed? I don't want no fancy talk, just tell me straight. Surgery? Is that what you're gonna say? 'Cause I ain’t keen on that, you know. I’m an old man. Don’t need no complications. Just tell me if you can make it flat again. Plain and simple.
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, a ventral hernia. It can be repaired surgically. It's the most effective way to restore the abdominal wall and alleviate the bulge. However, given your age and preference to avoid surgery… we could consider a supportive brace as a non-surgical option. It won’t eliminate the hernia, but it can provide support and prevent it from worsening. The brace will reduce discomfort and prevent complications. Surgery carries risks, especially at your age. A brace is the safer option, but it's not a permanent fix.
PATIENT: Brace, huh? Like a corset? I ain't wearin' no corset! I'm a man, not some… delicate flower. Look, I came here for a fix. Not a temporary bandage and a bunch of limitations. I understand the risks of surgery. I’m not a fool. If surgery is the only way to make it flat again, then that's what I want. You tell me what it involves. How long I'll be laid up. And what the chances are of it… failin'. Don't sugarcoat it. I want the truth. Now. Stop wastin’ my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. Very well. A ventral hernia repair is typically performed under general anesthesia. A small incision is made over the hernia site, the protruding tissue is repositioned, and a mesh patch is secured to reinforce the abdominal wall. The procedure usually takes between one to two hours. Recovery typically takes about six weeks, with limited lifting and strenuous activity during that time. As for the chances of failure… complications are relatively uncommon, but can include infection, bleeding, and mesh migration. The failure rate is around 10-15%, meaning there's a chance you may need a revision surgery in the future. I can refer you to a skilled general surgeon for a full consultation, and they can provide a more detailed assessment of your individual risk factors. They'll also be able to answer any further questions you may have before you make a decision. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: 10-15%… that ain't good. But… better than wearin' a brace. Alright. Refer me to your surgeon. The best one. And make sure he's… experienced. I don't want no rookies practicin’ on me. Tell him I want it done properly, the first time. And I want a clear explanation of everything before I agree to anything. I need to know exactly what I'm gettin' myself into. Now, get that referral sorted. I haven't got all day. Let's get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Very well, sir. I’m sending a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly experienced general surgeon with excellent results. Her office will contact you to schedule a consultation. I’ll also include your chart and my notes. Here you are. She’s located at St. Luke’s Hospital. I strongly advise you to ask her all your questions and fully understand the risks and benefits before proceeding with any surgery. Do you have any further questions for me before you leave?
