DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why I’m here. My wife insisted. Something about my skin… looking unwell, she said. And fatigue, apparently. It’s all rather… bothersome. I feel perfectly fine, for an old man, that is. Can we get this over with quickly? I have important matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I understand you're feeling well overall, but your wife has some concerns about your skin and fatigue. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Just to clarify, when did you first notice these changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Changes…? Goodness. I truly don’t recall. It’s been… some time, I suppose. Months, perhaps? Everything seems to blend together at my age. I work, I eat, I sleep… it’s all quite routine. I’m a reinforcing iron and rebar worker, you see. Always have been. A practical profession. Not one for… noticing skin colour. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Okay, months of changes… and you haven't specifically noticed anything different about your skin, your wife is the one who brought it to your attention?
PATIENT: Precisely. She has a rather keen eye for… imperfections, my wife does. Always fussing over something. I suppose it is a little darker than usual, now that you mention it. But I work outdoors, Doctor. Sun exposure. It’s to be expected. Honestly, I’m not one for coddling. I’ve built bridges, you know. Real, substantial things. This feels rather… frivolous.
DOCTOR: Right, outdoor work and sun exposure. That's important information. And this is a new change, or has your skin always tended to darken with the sun?
PATIENT: Always darkened, Doctor. What did you expect? I'm not porcelain. Though, admittedly, perhaps more darkened recently. But I’ve been working on a rather large project. A new… skyscraper, I believe. Lots of sun. And long hours. It's just… fatigue, I assure you. A bit of wear and tear. Is this taking long? I have a delivery to oversee this afternoon. It’s very important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more questions to get a better understanding. Aside from the fatigue and skin changes, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What sort of symptoms? I feel… old. A little stiff in the mornings. Perhaps a bit forgetful, though that’s hardly a new development. No aches, no pains… nothing of consequence. Really, Doctor, I’m a practical man. I don’t concern myself with… ailments. Is there a point to all this questioning? I don't believe I'm ill.
DOCTOR: Okay. No new aches, pains, or other symptoms. Just fatigue and skin changes, with some forgetfulness that's been ongoing. Now, do you have any family history of skin cancer or any other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Family history…? Goodness. That's a difficult question. My family… we’re from China, you see. Generations back. Records weren’t kept meticulously, I assure you. I vaguely recall an uncle… something about a cough. But whether it was serious… I honestly couldn’t say. My wife handles those sorts of details. She’s very organized. I’m afraid I’m not much help on that front. It was a long time ago, and frankly, I have more pressing concerns. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family history available. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I believe in hard work and a good diet. No pills, no potions. I take… nothing. Though my wife does occasionally try to slip something into my tea. Some sort of… herbal concoction, I believe. But I usually manage to avoid it. It tastes dreadful. Honestly, I'm quite healthy for my age. Can we move this along? I’m losing valuable time. .
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. Alright, Mr. Drahota, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to take a look at your skin and listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright?
