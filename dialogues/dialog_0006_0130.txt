DOCTOR: Uh, good morning, Mr. Schwer. Or… is it Jim?
PATIENT: Jim. Just Jim is fine. Good morning to you too, Doctor… Gorga, right? I think the lady at the front desk said that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Gorga. Craig Gorga. Right. Okay, Jim. So… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… family. My sister, she… she had some trouble. Real trouble. And my mother, before her… similar things. I’m… I just want to make sure I’m okay. You know? I don't want… surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand. Family history is important. Can you tell me a bit more about what kind of trouble your sister and mother had?
PATIENT: It was… heart stuff. Both of them. Lots of… chest pain. And then… they both had to have… things put in their chests. Tubes, I think? My sister had it a few years back, and Mom… Mom had it a long time ago, before I was even married. I don't really remember all the details. It just… scared me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. Chest pain and procedures… okay. Do you experience any chest pain, Jim?
PATIENT: No, not really. Not yet. Sometimes I get… a little uncomfortable, maybe. Like… heartburn, after a big meal. But nothing like… what they had. It’s just… I worry. It’s silly, probably. But they were both… strong women. And it happened to them.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all to be concerned, Jim. Family history is a risk factor. And it's good you're being proactive. This "uncomfortable feeling"… where exactly do you feel it?
PATIENT: Right here. Sort of… in the middle. And sometimes it goes up into my throat. Like… something’s stuck. It doesn’t last long, usually. Just a few minutes. And it goes away if I sit up. That's why I said heartburn, maybe? I eat too much sometimes. I like good food.
DOCTOR: Okay. And does anything bring on this discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm… Spicy food sometimes. And… if I lie down too soon after eating. That's when it’s worst. And stress. If I’m worried about something, it seems to get worse too. Not always, but… often. I’m retired now, so it’s not as bad as when I was working, running around trying to sell things. That was stressful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any shortness of breath, Jim?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get… a little winded sometimes, if I walk up a big hill. But I’m… not a young man anymore, you know? I always figured that was just… getting old. I don’t run marathons or anything. I walk. A lot of walking. But no trouble breathing just… sitting here. Or lying down.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No. Not that I’ve noticed. I used to, a little, when I was working. Standing all day. But not now. I keep my shoes pretty loose. And I try to put my feet up when I can. It helps. Old man tricks, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take your blood pressure, just to get a baseline. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know I'm okay. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just relax, take deep breaths. Heart sounds… regular. A little bit of… diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, but not alarming. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not critically so.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good? I don't really understand all that, but… regular is good, right? And 140… is that bad? My sister always said I worried too much. Maybe she was right.
DOCTOR: Regular is good. And 140 is… a little higher than we'd like, but it's not a crisis. It's something we can monitor. Given your family history, and the occasional discomfort you describe, I think we should do a couple of tests just to be on the safe side. An EKG… that’s a quick heart tracing… and a basic blood panel to check cholesterol and other levels. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Yes, I think that's a good idea. Better to be safe, right? An EKG and… a blood panel. I can do that. Do I need to… prepare for anything? Fast beforehand or something?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for eight to twelve hours beforehand for the blood panel – no food or drinks other than water. The EKG is simple – just some stickers on your chest. The nurse will explain everything. I’m also going to order a chest x-ray just to get a clearer picture of your lungs. It’s a routine precaution. We can get all of that scheduled for you before you leave. Sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… a lot, but alright. Fasting, EKG, and… a picture of my lungs. The nurse will tell me everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. And not… laughing at me for worrying so much.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Jim. It's my job to listen to your concerns. We'll get these tests done, and then we can discuss the results and make a plan. The nurse will get you scheduled and give you instructions for the fasting. And… don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or if your symptoms get worse before your tests. Alright?
PATIENT: Okay. I will. Thank you again, Doctor Gorga. I suppose I should go talk to the nurse now?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. She’s right outside the door. I’ll see you in a few days to go over the results. Take care, Jim. And try not to worry too much. .
