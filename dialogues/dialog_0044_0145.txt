DOCTOR: Good morning, Lonell. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here today… because I need to understand if my mother qualifies for help at home. Or, perhaps, hospice care. It is a difficult thing to consider, but she is… not doing well.
DOCTOR: I understand. That is difficult to think about, and it’s good you’re addressing it now. We can definitely explore both options – assistance at home and hospice care – to see what’s most appropriate for your mother. To start, could you tell me a bit more about what’s been going on with her?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My mother, Genevieve, is 87 years old. She has… well, she has many things wrong with her now. For the past six months, she has been getting weaker, and she falls quite often. She used to be very independent, but now she needs help with… everything, really. Dressing, bathing, eating… even just getting out of her chair. We have a woman who comes a few hours a day, but it is not enough. She also… she forgets things. Important things. Like taking her medicine, or who I am sometimes. It is very upsetting.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. So, increasing weakness and falls over the past six months, along with a significant decline in her ability to perform daily activities – dressing, bathing, eating – and some memory loss. You mentioned she sometimes doesn’t recognize you. Has the memory loss been gradual, or has it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: It has been… gradual, Doctor. At first, it was just misplacing things, or forgetting appointments. But it has gotten worse over the last three months, I would say. Now, some days she knows me perfectly, and other days… she looks at me like I am a stranger. It is very distressing for both of us. And she is often confused, even when she knows who I am. She will ask the same questions repeatedly, or not understand what I am saying. It is… difficult to explain. It is not a consistent thing, but it is happening more and more often.
DOCTOR: That does sound concerning, Lonell. The fluctuating confusion is something we’ll definitely want to investigate further. You mentioned she’s 87. Does she have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She has… had several. She was diagnosed with arthritis many years ago, and she has some problems with her heart. She had a… a mild heart attack about five years ago, and she takes medicine for it. She also has diabetes, which she has managed for a long time, but it has been harder to control lately. And, she was diagnosed with high blood pressure, years and years ago. I believe that is all. It has been a long life, with many ailments. I apologize, I am not a medical professional, I am simply her son.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Lonell. You’re doing a wonderful job just providing me with this information. It’s very helpful. Arthritis, history of a mild heart attack, diabetes, and high blood pressure – that gives me a clearer picture. And you said her diabetes has been harder to control recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Her doctor, Dr. Dubois, has been adjusting her medication, but her blood sugar levels remain… unpredictable. Sometimes very high, sometimes very low. It worries me greatly. She is not eating very well, which I believe contributes to the problem. She has very little appetite, and when she does eat, it is only small amounts. It is a vicious cycle, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fluctuating blood sugar levels despite medication adjustments, and a decreased appetite. That's important information. You mentioned Dr. Dubois. Do you have any records from her that we could access, or would you happen to know her contact information?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. I have her contact information here. <Lonell rummages in his briefcase and produces a card.> Here. And I also have a list of her medications, and a summary of her recent hospital visit. It was about a month ago, she fell and broke her hip. They repaired it, but she has not regained much strength since. It was a difficult recovery. Would those be helpful?
DOCTOR: Those would be incredibly helpful, thank you. <I scan the papers briefly.> Excellent. This is a good start. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about any allergies your mother might have, and if she's currently taking any medications, besides what’s listed here?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. To my knowledge, she does not have any allergies. She has never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. As for medications… let me see. <Lonell pauses, thinking.> She is taking… Lisinopril for her blood pressure, Metformin for her diabetes, and… a pain medication for her hip. It is… Tramadol, I believe. And she takes a daily multivitamin. She also has a cream for her arthritis, but I do not know the name of it. She applies it to her hands and knees. I apologize for not having a complete list, but she has so many doctors, and so many medications. It is difficult to keep track.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Lonell. You’re doing a fantastic job. Lisinopril, Metformin, Tramadol, a multivitamin, and a topical cream for arthritis. Okay. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask about her social history. Does she live alone, or does she have assistance at home?
PATIENT: She lives alone, Doctor. She was very independent for a long time, and she insisted on staying in her own home. But as I said, we have a woman, Marie, who comes a few hours a day to help with… things. Cooking, cleaning, bathing… But Marie is not a nurse. She is simply a companion. And, as you know, I visit as often as I can, but I have a job, and a family. It is… challenging. She has no other family nearby. Her husband passed away many years ago, and she has no children besides myself.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re balancing a lot, and it’s commendable that you're so involved in her care. So, she’s living at home with assistance from Marie, but doesn’t have 24/7 care. Now, one final question before the exam – has your mother expressed any wishes regarding her end-of-life care?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. She has never been one to discuss such things. She is a very private person. But I recall, a few years ago, she mentioned she did not want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery. She said she wanted to… to pass peacefully, in her own home, if possible. She did not have any specific instructions, or a written advance directive, as far as I know. I apologize, I have never pressed her on the matter. It was too difficult a conversation. I believe she trusts me to make the right decisions, but I… I am not a medical professional. It is a heavy responsibility.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lonell. It is a heavy responsibility, and it's admirable that you're thinking about this now. Knowing her wishes, even generally, is very helpful. Okay. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I'll listen to her heart and lungs, check her blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. It will give me a better understanding of her current condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I am ready when you are. Please, proceed. She is not always… cooperative, but I will do my best to assist.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lonell. That’s very kind of you. <I stand and gesture towards the examination table.> If you could help her get comfortable there, that would be wonderful. I'll start by listening to her heart and lungs. It may take a few minutes, so please just let me know if she becomes uncomfortable at any point.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. <Lonell helps an imagined Genevieve onto the examination table.> Mother, just relax. The doctor is going to listen to your heart. It won't hurt a bit. <He gives an imagined Genevieve a reassuring pat on the hand.> There we go. Just breathe normally. Everything is alright. <He turns back to Dr. Asami.> She is a bit anxious, as you can see. I will be right here.
DOCTOR: Okay. Her heart rate is a little elevated, around 90 beats per minute, and her rhythm is regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Her lungs sound a bit diminished in both bases, which could be from decreased use or fluid buildup. <I remove the stethoscope and write notes on the chart.> Now, I’m going to check her blood pressure. <I inflate the blood pressure cuff and take a reading.> 140/80. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given her age and history. <I gently palpate Genevieve’s pulse in her wrists and ankles.> Her pulses are a little weak, especially in her ankles. Now, I’ll just do a quick neurological assessment. I'm going to ask her to follow my finger with her eyes, and I'll check her reflexes. Can you tell me if she is able to follow along?
PATIENT: She is… hesitant, Doctor. She is looking at you, but it takes her a moment to focus. <Lonell gently guides Genevieve’s gaze towards Dr. Asami’s finger.> There you go, Mother. Just follow the doctor’s finger. Slowly now. <He observes Genevieve carefully.> Her movements are… sluggish, Doctor. It is difficult for her to track it quickly. And… she seems a little confused. She is frowning, as if she doesn't understand what you are asking her to do. I apologize, she is not at her best today.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lonell. It's helpful to know. Her movements are a bit sluggish, and she does seem a little disoriented. I'll check her reflexes now. <I gently tap Genevieve’s knees with a reflex hammer.> Her reflexes are diminished, but symmetrical. I'll also check her strength. Can you tell me if she is able to squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: She is… attempting to squeeze your hand, Doctor, but her grip is very weak. It is difficult for her to exert any force. I am assisting her now, but even with my help, it is very faint. <He gently squeezes Genevieve’s hand alongside Dr. Asami’s hand.> She is trying, but she is very weak. Her other hand is the same. <He observes Genevieve’s face, noticing her expression of frustration.> She is becoming agitated, Doctor. I believe she is tired and confused. Perhaps we should stop for now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right, Lonell. We shouldn't push her. That's enough for now. Thank you for your assistance; it's invaluable. <I step back from the examination table, writing notes on the chart.> Based on my brief exam and your observations, Genevieve is showing signs of significant weakness, diminished reflexes, some confusion, and a history of falls. Her heart murmur and diminished lung sounds are also concerning. <I look up at Lonell with a thoughtful expression.> Given her current condition, I’m concerned about several possibilities, including a possible stroke, a urinary tract infection, or simply a decline due to her age and underlying medical conditions. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few tests, including a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and a CT scan of her brain to rule out a stroke. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If it will help determine what is wrong, then yes, I am comfortable with those tests. She deserves to know what is happening. A CT scan… that sounds… serious. But if it is necessary, then we should do it. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best for her. What is the next step?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lonell. I appreciate your trust. A CT scan is serious, but it’s the best way to quickly rule out a stroke, which is something we need to address immediately if it’s happening. <I begin typing on the computer.> I'll order those tests right away. The lab can draw blood now, and we can schedule the CT scan for later today. I'll also have Marie, the companion, stay with Genevieve until you arrive, or until I can get the results back. <I pause, looking up at Lonell with a concerned expression.> In the meantime, it’s important to keep a close eye on her for any changes in her condition, such as increased confusion, weakness on one side of her body, or difficulty speaking. If you notice anything like that, please call 911 immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have covered everything. You have been very thorough. Just… please, do everything you can to help her. She is… all I have left. And thank you for being so kind and patient with us. <Lonell pauses, looking visibly worried.> I will call Marie right away and tell her to stay with her. And I will keep a very close watch on her condition. What time should I expect the results back? Is there anything else I should be doing?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lonell. I completely understand. And rest assured, I will do everything I can to help Genevieve. It sounds like you're a very devoted son, and that's the most important thing. <I check my computer.> The lab results should be back within an hour or two. The CT scan will take a little longer, probably around three to four hours to read. I'll call you as soon as I have the results. <I pause, thinking for a moment.> In the meantime, just make sure she's comfortable, hydrated, and that Marie stays with her. If she’s able to eat or drink, offer her something light. And please, don’t hesitate to call me or the clinic if you have any concerns at all, even if they seem minor. <I offer a reassuring smile.> We’ll figure this out together, Lonell. Let’s focus on getting these tests done and seeing what they tell us. Is there anything I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe I am alright. Thank you for your kindness. I will wait for your call. <Lonell manages a small, weak smile.> I suppose… I should go check on her again. And call Marie. <He stands up, looking anxious but determined.> Thank you again, Doctor Asami. I appreciate your help. <He pauses for a moment, then adds quietly:> May God bless you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lonell. And you take care too. Please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. <I watch him leave, then turn back to the computer to review the test orders and make notes on Genevieve’s chart.> .
