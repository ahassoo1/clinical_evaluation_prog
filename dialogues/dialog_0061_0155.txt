DOCTOR: Bula! And good day to you, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, good day to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this… shaking. My hands, mostly. Been happening for a bit now, I guess. Not sure how long, exactly. Time gets away from me, you know? It’s just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Hand shaking, or tremor, is what you’re experiencing. And you said it’s been happening for “a bit now.” That’s alright, we'll try to narrow it down. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Hard to say. When I’m trying to do something… like, hold a cup of coffee, it’s worse. Or writing. Used to be a pretty good hand, I had. Now… not so much. But when I'm just sitting, it's not always there. Does that make any sense? I'm sorry, I'm probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. It's very helpful, actually! Knowing it’s worse with activity is important. So, it sounds like it’s more noticeable when you're doing something, and less so at rest. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse besides holding things like your coffee cup?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger it… Now you’re asking me things. Let me think. No, not that I recall. Though… maybe when I’m stressed? I don’t get stressed much these days, but… used to. A long time ago. I worked at the water plant, you know. Lots of responsibility. But that was… oh, goodness, years and years ago. I don’t think that's it, though. It just… happens. I wish I could tell you more.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially stress in the past, but not necessarily currently. And it just seems to come on without a clear cause. Alright. Now, besides your hands, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. Well, I’ve been a bit… tired lately, I suppose. But who isn’t, at my age? And my legs… sometimes feel a little unsteady. But I chalked that up to just getting old. I fall sometimes, but nothing serious. Just a little stumble, you know? Nothing to write home about. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for sharing that. So, tiredness and some unsteadiness in your legs, along with the occasional stumble. Have you noticed any stiffness in your joints, or any pain with movement?
PATIENT: Pain… not really. A little ache sometimes, but nothing I’d complain about. Joints… stiff? Maybe a bit in the mornings, but it goes away pretty quick. I wouldn't say it's pain, exactly. More like… creaky. Like an old door, you know? I'm just an old man, Doctor. Parts are wearing out. Is there anything else I should be telling you? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Jezik. This is all very helpful. A little morning stiffness, some tiredness, and the occasional stumble. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. It’s been a long time… I had something with my… blood pressure, I think. Years ago. They gave me pills, I took them for a while. And… I think I had a touch of pneumonia once, but that was a long time ago too. I don’t remember much about it, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Is it important? Should I be digging up old records? I don't even know where they are anymore.
DOCTOR: It's alright, don't worry about digging up old records right now. We can work with what you remember. So, high blood pressure in the past, treated with medication, and pneumonia a long time ago. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, I think. That was a long time ago. And… I had a hernia operation once. That was… painful. But that was years and years ago. Nothing recent, I can assure you. I try to stay out of hospitals, if I can help it. They aren't very pleasant places.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a child and a hernia operation years ago. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My wife’s mother had… arthritis, I think. Bad arthritis in her hands. And my father… he had a weak heart, I believe. He died when he was… not very old, actually. But that was a long time ago. I don't really know much about it, to be honest. We didn’t talk about these things much when I was growing up. Is that useful? I’m trying to remember, but… it’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That is very useful, Mr. Jezik. Arthritis in your wife’s mother and heart problems in your father. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not really. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills… oh, goodness, years ago. Doctor said I didn't need them anymore. And I don't really take anything else. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's about it. I try to avoid pills, if I can. Don't like how they make me feel.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies. I eat just about anything. Though, I try to watch my salt intake, Doctor told me to. But allergies… no. I think I'd know if I had an allergy, wouldn't I? I'm pretty sure. Is that all the questions you have? I'm getting a little tired now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Mr. Jezik, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your reflexes, your balance, and just take a look at your hands to see what’s going on. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please? My bones aren't what they used to be. And… try not to take too long? I have… things to do. But go ahead. Do what you need to do. Just let me know if it's going to hurt.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 72. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Okay, let’s look at your hands. I notice a slight tremor in both hands when they are at rest. It’s more noticeable in your right hand. Your muscle strength seems good, though. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, if you could just stand up slowly for me. I notice you’re a little unsteady on your feet, and you’re widening your stance to maintain your balance. Alright, Mr. Jezik. That’s all I need for now. Everything seems relatively normal for your age, but the tremor, the unsteady gait and slightly diminished reflexes are things we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate further? Oh dear. What does that mean? Are you saying something is wrong? I just thought I was getting old, you know? A little shaky, a little tired… That’s all. What kind of investigating are we talking about? I don't like the sound of that. Is it going to be expensive? Because… well, I'm on a fixed income, you know. This is all very worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Jezik. It doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong, but it's important to understand why you’re experiencing these symptoms. The tremor, unsteadiness and diminished reflexes could be due to a number of things, and to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests and possibly a scan of your brain – an MRI or CT scan. The blood tests will help us rule out any vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or other underlying medical conditions. The scan would help us look at the structure of your brain and rule out any other neurological causes for your symptoms. I know you’re on a fixed income, and I will do my best to keep the costs as low as possible. We can discuss payment options and see if there are any assistance programs available. The most important thing is to get a diagnosis so we can create a plan to manage your symptoms. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Tests… scans… Oh dear, oh dear. It all sounds so serious. I really just wanted someone to tell me I was getting old and to maybe give me a little something for the shaking. Vitamin deficiencies? Thyroid problems? What does that even mean? And a scan of my brain? That sounds… frightening. I don't want them poking around in my brain. I… I don't know. Is it absolutely necessary? Could we maybe just try some medication first? Something to calm my nerves, perhaps? I’m not sure I can handle all of this. It's all a bit overwhelming. And expensive, you said? How much are we talking about, roughly? I need to know. This is… a lot. I think I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. Please, sit down and take a deep breath. It's alright to be overwhelmed. I understand this is a lot to take in. Let me explain a little more slowly. The tests are to help us rule out serious problems, not to confirm them. Many things can cause tremors and unsteadiness, and most of them are not life-threatening. Vitamin deficiencies and thyroid problems are relatively common and easily treatable. Regarding the scan, it's a painless procedure. You simply lie still while the machine takes pictures of your brain. It doesn’t involve any poking or cutting. As for medication, we could try something to manage the shaking, but without knowing the underlying cause, it’s difficult to choose the right medication. It's like treating a symptom without knowing the disease. A rough estimate for the blood tests would be around $100-$200, and the scan could be anywhere from $500-$1000, depending on whether we opt for an MRI or a CT scan. I will check with the billing department to see if there are any discounts available for uninsured patients. We don't have to do all of these tests right away. We can start with the blood tests and see what they reveal. If the results are unclear, then we can discuss the possibility of a scan. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: $500-$1000? Oh goodness, no. Absolutely not. That’s… that’s a month’s rent! I simply can’t afford that. I'm not insured, you see. Never could afford it. Blood tests… alright. I suppose I can manage blood tests. $100-$200… that's still a lot, but… I suppose I have to know, don’t I? But no scan. Absolutely no scan. I won’t do it. So, blood tests… and then what? Will you tell me the results right away? And what if they find something… bad? I… I don’t think I can handle bad news. Maybe I should just go home and forget about all of this. I just wanted something for the shaking. It’s not worth all of this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. It’s perfectly alright to be worried about the cost and the possibility of bad news. We can absolutely start with just the blood tests, and we won’t proceed with any further tests without your full consent. We will get the results back in about a week. I will call you as soon as they are available and we can discuss them together. If the results are concerning, we will talk through all of your options and create a plan that is right for you. I want you to know that I am here to support you every step of the way. We will take things one step at a time, and you are in control. It’s okay to be scared, and it’s okay to ask questions. Before we proceed with the blood tests, let’s talk about some things you can do at home to manage your symptoms. Have you tried any simple exercises or relaxation techniques?
PATIENT: Exercises? Relaxation techniques? Oh, goodness, no. I haven't done anything like that in… well, decades. I used to work at the water plant, you know. Very stressful job. Lots of responsibility. Didn’t have time for exercises or relaxation. Just had to get the job done. I suppose I could try… but what kind of exercises? And relaxation techniques? I don’t even know where to start. Maybe just… sit quietly? But my mind always wanders. It’s hard to relax when you're worried. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you trying to help. But I just… I don’t think I’m very good at all of this. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. And I don’t want to spend a fortune finding out. Can we just get the blood tests done? And then… then what? Will you tell me everything, even if it’s bad? I need to know. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. We can absolutely focus on getting the blood tests done. And I promise to tell you everything, even if it’s not what we want to hear. We will discuss all of your options and create a plan together. I won’t push you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. Let’s get the blood test order written up. It's just a standard panel to check for common deficiencies and thyroid function. We'll need to take a small sample of blood from your arm. It will take just a few minutes. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re very good at what they do. After the tests are completed, they will send the results directly to me, and I will call you as soon as I have them. I’ll also write down some information about some simple relaxation techniques you can try at home. It’s okay if they don’t work for you right away. It takes practice. Here is the order. Just take this to the lab, and they will take care of everything. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No… no questions, I think. Just… try to remember to call me, Doctor. Even if it’s bad news. I need to know. I really do. Thank you. For everything. I appreciate your patience. I know I’m not the easiest patient. I think… I think I’ll just go home now. And wait for the phone to ring. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. I will definitely call you as soon as I have the results. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I understand this is a stressful time, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much. .
