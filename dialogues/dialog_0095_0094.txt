DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, the lady at the front desk… she said something about… talking? I don’t really come to doctors unless something is broken. My husband, he makes the appointments. He said… education? I don't know what that means.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your husband scheduled this appointment for a general check-up, perhaps to discuss your overall health and preventative care. We can absolutely just talk about whatever’s on your mind, though. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you, or anything you’d like me to take a look at?
PATIENT: Preventative… like stopping things before they happen? Hmm. Not really. I feel… okay. I work with metal all day. It’s hard work, but it keeps me busy. Busy is good. I don't like sitting around. Are you going to poke me with something? Because I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, busy is good. And no, I won’t automatically poke you with anything. We can definitely avoid needles if we can. It sounds like you're generally feeling well, which is great. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about what you do with metal all day?
PATIENT: Uh… sheet metal. Like for roofs and… buildings. Cutting and bending and… putting it together. Lots of lifting. My husband helps now, he used to do all the hard stuff. I… I don’t know the fancy names for things. It's just… work. Is this important? Like, does knowing what kind of metal matter? I just… make things. It pays the bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, sheet metal work, lifting… that's helpful to know. It does matter, actually. Certain metals, and repetitive movements can sometimes cause problems over time. No need for fancy names, just a general idea is fine. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with the work, like in your back, shoulders, hands, or wrists?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. My back, mostly. It gets stiff after a long day. I just… take some pills. The red ones. My husband gets them for me. They help. Not forever, but enough to get through. Should I be telling you about pills? He says I worry too much. Is he going to get in trouble?
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned the pills. It’s very important you tell me everything you're taking. Your husband won’t get in trouble, I promise. We just need to know what you’re taking to make sure everything is safe. Do you know the name of the red pills?
PATIENT: The… name? I don’t think so. He just… gives them to me. Small bottle. Red. That’s all I know. He gets them from the pharmacy down the street. Old man runs it. Very nice man. I just take them when my back hurts. He says they are for… aches. Is it bad that I don't know the name? I'm not good with remembering things.
DOCTOR: It's okay, it's not bad at all. Many people don't remember medication names. It’s more important that you're telling me you’re taking them. We'll figure it out. And it's good you're being honest with me. Let’s talk about your back a little more. When did the back pain start?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time ago. When I first started working with the metal. It was heavier then, I think. We didn't have the… the machine to help lift yet. Maybe ten years ago? It comes and goes. Bad when it rains, weirdly. And after a really long job. Does that make sense? I don’t know much about bodies. I just try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Ten years ago, worse with rain and long jobs… that gives me a better idea. The rain could be related to changes in pressure. Ignoring it is understandable, but it's good we're talking about it now. Okay, aside from the back pain, have you noticed any other aches, pains, or problems anywhere else?
PATIENT: My hands get… numb sometimes. After a really long day cutting the metal. Like pins and needles. They shake a little. I just… rub them. It goes away eventually. My husband says I work too hard. He's probably right. He always is. Is that something I should worry about? The shaking? It's not all the time.
DOCTOR: Numbness and shaking in your hands after work… that's definitely something we should look into further. Do you notice this shaking with any other activities, or is it only when you're working with the metal?
PATIENT: Only with the metal. And only after a long, hard job. Like when we're rushing to finish something. It doesn’t happen when I’m… sewing, or watching TV. Just… work. It's probably just tired hands. I always tell my husband it's nothing. He worries too much, you know? He's a good man, but… very worried. Is it bad that I don’t like to complain? It makes things worse, I think.
DOCTOR: It's not bad at all to not want to complain. It sounds like it’s something that’s been gradually developing, which is why we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and strength in your hands and back. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Poke me with things? You said no needles, but… poking? I don’t like being poked. Will it hurt? And will it take long? My husband is waiting in the car, he probably wants to go home. I don't want to keep him waiting. What exactly are you looking for when you “poke”?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I promise I won’t do anything that will cause you pain. It’s not a sharp poke at all, more like gently checking how your joints move and how strong your muscles are. It won’t take long—maybe five to ten minutes. We're looking for any signs of nerve compression or muscle strain. It will help me understand what’s causing the numbness and shaking in your hands and the stiffness in your back. I can explain everything I'm doing as I go, if you like. Would you be more comfortable if your husband came inside with you?
PATIENT: My husband… he worries too much. He’ll just ask a million questions and tell you what I should be doing. But… maybe it’s better if he comes in. He remembers things better than me. He can tell you if I’m complaining more than usual. But… no poking, okay? Gentle checking only. And explain everything. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Gentle checking, and I’ll explain everything as I go. No surprises. Let’s go ahead and call your husband in. That’s a great idea to have him here. Mr. Fontanazza, could you please come in for a moment?
