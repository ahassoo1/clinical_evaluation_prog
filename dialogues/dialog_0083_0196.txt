DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Alanes, right? Yes, um… it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. It's been going on for… well, a long time now, I guess. I don't really keep track of dates anymore. It's just… draining, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Licano, Alanes is correct. I understand. “Always tired” – that’s certainly something we need to explore. When you say “a long time,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Rough estimate… hmm. It feels like… since my husband passed, maybe? That was… a few years back now. I really don't remember exactly. It just sort of crept up on me, this feeling. I just thought it was… grief, at first. But it hasn't really gone away.
DOCTOR: I see. And I am very sorry to hear about your husband. It's understandable that grief could cause fatigue, and it’s good you’re addressing this now if it’s been prolonged. When you say “tired,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not just sleepy, you know? It's… like everything is heavy. My arms, my legs… even thinking feels like work. I just want to sit. All the time. And I do sit. A lot. It's hard to… get going, even for simple things. Like making dinner. I used to love to cook. Now… it's a chore. A really big chore.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly draining, Ms. Licano. It’s good you’re able to articulate that so clearly. It sounds like more than just simple sleepiness. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Sometimes my muscles ache. Not all the time, but… yeah, aches. And I get… a little dizzy sometimes, when I stand up too fast. Nothing major, just… whoosh. And… I've been a bit forgetful lately. Worse than usual, I mean. Though, I've always been a bit…scatterbrained. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all relevant, Ms. Licano. Muscle aches, dizziness upon standing, and increased forgetfulness – those are all things we want to investigate further. Regarding the dizziness, does it happen every time you stand, or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not every time. Mostly when I get up really quickly. Like if I've been sitting for a while, and then… whoosh. Just for a second or two. I usually have to hold onto something. It’s not… scary, exactly. Just… annoying. And it makes me hesitant to move around much. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: That sounds like what we call orthostatic hypotension, Ms. Licano – a drop in blood pressure when you stand. It’s not necessarily normal, but it’s fairly common, especially as we age. It's good you’re recognizing it. Now, let’s talk about your forgetfulness a bit more. Can you give me an example of something you've been forgetting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Little things, mostly. Like… I went to the pharmacy yesterday to pick up my medication, and I completely forgot what I went there for! The nice young man at the counter had to remind me. And… sometimes I forget what I was saying mid-sentence. It’s embarrassing. It's not… major, like forgetting dates or… important things. Just… everyday stuff. It's just frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. That can be quite frustrating, Ms. Licano. Okay, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions that you're aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. The doctor always told me my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. But I was taking medication for it. I think. I’m not sure if I still am. And… I had a bad knee surgery a long time ago. Does that count? Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. I used to keep track of these things, but… after my husband… it just all went out the window. I'm on Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: It does help, Ms. Licano. Thank you for sharing that. Medicare is a good start. And it's perfectly understandable that things have been difficult to keep track of. We can review your medications and past history with the help of your records. I’m pulling up your information now. It looks like you were prescribed lisinopril for high blood pressure, but the last refill was over six months ago. And I see the knee surgery was quite a few years back. Do you currently take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I think I have some pain relievers for my knee, but I don’t use them much. And… maybe some vitamin D? My daughter keeps telling me I need vitamin D. She’s a nurse, you know. A very good nurse. She’s always reminding me to take things. I really can’t remember. It’s all so… disorganized. I mostly just try to get through the day.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano. We'll sort through this together. It's common to have trouble remembering everything, especially with multiple medications. Now, let's talk about your allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, um… Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little sniffle sometimes with pollen, but that's about it. My husband was the one with all the allergies. He couldn't eat shellfish, and he was always sneezing. I’ve always been pretty lucky, I guess. No allergies to speak of.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Licano. Okay, and finally, let's briefly touch on your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She was always tired, too. And my father had diabetes. He lost a leg because of it, poor man. And… my sister had cancer, but that was years ago. She… she’s gone now. It’s all a bit sad to think about, really. I don’t really remember the specifics. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall the specifics. It sounds like there is a history of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer in your family, which is helpful to know. Okay, Ms. Licano, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Based on what you’ve told me – the prolonged fatigue, muscle aches, dizziness, forgetfulness, and your family history – I’d like to do a brief physical exam and order some lab work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel… better. I’m tired of being tired. Just… let’s get it over with. I have some errands to run, if that’s alright. Nothing important, just… things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Licano. We'll take things at your pace. And I understand you have errands to run. If you could just have a seat on the table, we’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a quick neurological check. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Just… don’t take too long, alright? I have to… pick up some groceries. And… I promised my daughter I’d call her.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Licano. We'll be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is a little on the lower side right now, 108/68. We’ll need to monitor that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please extend your arms and squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. There. Is that… good enough? It feels like I don't have much strength.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a bit sluggish, and your grip strength is weaker than expected, Ms. Licano. That’s something we'll need to investigate further. Now, could you please stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Whoa… I'm… a little dizzy. Everything is… spinning. Please, sit me down.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Licano, please stay seated. That’s perfectly alright. This is helpful information. Based on your history and the initial exam findings – the low blood pressure, faint heart sounds, sluggish reflexes, weak grip strength, and the dizziness – I'm concerned about possible orthostatic hypotension and some degree of generalized weakness. We need to rule out several possibilities, including dehydration, anemia, vitamin deficiencies, and potentially issues with your thyroid or heart function. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin D level. I also want to check your EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Whatever you need to do. Just… please hurry. I really need to get going. I have… things to do. And my daughter will worry if I'm not home soon. Just… tell me when it's over.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano. We will be as quick as possible. The lab work will take a few minutes, and the EKG is very quick. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and perform the EKG. In the meantime, let’s just sit for a moment, and I'll explain the potential causes of your symptoms a little further. It's important to remember that these are just possibilities at this point, and we need the lab results to determine the exact cause. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Questions? Not… really. Just… will I feel better soon? That's all I want. To feel… normal again. I just want to be able to… do things without being so tired all the time. Is that going to happen?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid question, Ms. Licano, and I understand your concern. It’s difficult to say for certain at this point, but I’m hopeful that we can identify the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan to help you feel better. Many of the potential causes are treatable. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss your options and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, it’s important to stay hydrated, get plenty of rest, and avoid strenuous activity. The nurse should be in shortly to draw your blood. Are you alright to sit here and wait?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. I’ll just… sit here. Just… let me know when it’s over.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Licano. I will let you know as soon as the nurse is ready. Please don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you feel unwell or need anything at all.
