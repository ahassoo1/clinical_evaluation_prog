DOCTOR: Hi Janie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… chronic… fatigue, I think that’s what the lady on the phone said. Honestly, it’s just… being tired. Really tired. It’s been going on… a while. I don’t really keep track of these things anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, "really tired" for a while… I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “a while,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… oh dear. Months, I suppose. Maybe six? Or was it eight? It all blurs together, you know? It’s not like I’m doing much these days. Just… existing. It’s hard to remember when it started exactly.
DOCTOR: I completely understand how that can happen. Six to eight months of feeling consistently tired is definitely long enough to warrant looking into. And “just existing” sounds really draining. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms that seem to come along with it?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… Let me think. Everything feels a bit… slow, if that makes sense? Like wading through water. And my bones ache sometimes. Not all the time, just… randomly. Oh! And I get headaches. Dull ones, mostly. Not the pounding kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, slow feeling, random bone aches, and dull headaches. That gives me a little more to work with. When you say “slow feeling,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Like my brain doesn’t want to work. Focusing is difficult. I used to love reading, but now… I can read a page and not remember what it said. And I’m… clumsy, I guess. I bump into things more than I used to. It's like my body isn't keeping up with my thoughts, or maybe my thoughts aren't keeping up with my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, trouble with concentration, memory, and coordination… That’s helpful. And when you say "random bone aches," where are you feeling those aches most often?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, really. My knees, my back… sometimes my elbows. It’s never one specific spot. It just… comes and goes. It’s not like a sharp pain, it’s just… a deep ache. Like I’ve been doing too much, but I haven't!
DOCTOR: Alright, generalized aches that come and go. That's good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Honestly, I haven’t been eating much. Not because I don’t want to, just… no appetite, really. And I think I’ve lost a little weight. I haven't weighed myself in ages, but my clothes feel looser.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss. Thanks for sharing that. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… Well, my doctor… the one before… he said I had high blood pressure, but I’ve been taking pills for it for years. And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed, ages ago. That’s all I can really remember. My husband… he always handled the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure managed with medication, and a previous gallbladder removal. That’s good information. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you’re asking things my husband took care of. Let me see… the pills are white, I think. And small. I take one every morning. I really don’t pay attention to the names. I just take them with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, white pills, one daily. We can definitely figure out the exact name and dosage in a moment – I have access to your records here. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I don’t really… eat anything unusual, so I haven’t had to worry about food allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, how about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, that’s a sad story. My mother… she had something with her heart. I don’t remember what it was called. And my father… he had diabetes. That’s all I really know. I didn't keep up with it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of heart issues in your mother and diabetes in your father. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you need to do. Just… please be quick, if you wouldn’t mind. I get… anxious with doctors.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. I’ll do my best to be as efficient as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little high today, but that’s not entirely uncommon in a clinical setting. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are a little quiet, but I don’t hear anything concerning. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m just going to do a few quick neurological tests – checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Please just follow my instructions. Okay, your reflexes are a little slower than usual, and your balance is a bit unsteady. Your coordination is also a little off. Overall, it seems there may be some mild neurological deficits. I will document these findings. Now, I'm going to review your EHR to see what previous testing may have been done. One moment.
PATIENT: Alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some previous bloodwork from a couple of years ago. Your Vitamin D levels were a little low, and there were some slightly elevated inflammatory markers. But no recent comprehensive testing has been done. Given your symptoms – chronic fatigue, slow feeling, bone aches, headaches, memory and coordination issues – and the findings from the physical exam and previous bloodwork, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be related to a Vitamin D deficiency, but the more broad symptoms suggest we need to rule out other potential causes like hypothyroidism, anemia, or even early signs of neurological issues. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel , Vitamin D levels, and inflammatory markers . Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear, so many tests. Is it… serious? I just feel tired, Doctor. That’s all. But… if you think it’s necessary, then yes, I suppose. Just… try not to poke me too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Janie. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it's important to investigate these symptoms to rule out any underlying causes. It’s better to be thorough, especially given the length of time you've been feeling this way. The blood tests will give us a lot of information. And I promise, the phlebotomist is very skilled, and it will be quick. Okay, I’m going to write up the orders now. Once the lab results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and trying to eat a balanced diet. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I just… want to go home and lie down. When will I get the results? And… will someone call me? I don’t really… do computers.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. You’ve been through a lot today. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. And yes, absolutely, someone will call you directly with the results. We won’t send them to you electronically if you’re not comfortable with computers. Our office number is 555-123-4567 if you want to write it down. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Just… please call.
DOCTOR: .
