DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye too, Doctor. Well, it's this nausea, see? Been happenin' most mornings now, for… oh, maybe a couple o' weeks. It's not a terrible sickness, but it's enough to put me off my breakfast, and that's no' ideal when ye're tryin' to keep yer strength up with… well, with the heart bein' a bit dodgy, as they say.
DOCTOR: “Dodgy heart,” right. We’ll get to that. So this nausea… it’s specifically in the mornings?
PATIENT: Aye, mostly. Though it’s been a wee bit random the last couple o' days. But usually, it hits as soon as I sit up. Before I even get a mouthful o' porridge, it’s there. Like a queasy feelin', ye ken? Nothin' actually comes up, thankfully, but it’s enough to make me feel awful and lose my appetite. It’s just… unsettling, especially startin' the day like that.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. And you said it's been about two weeks now?
PATIENT: Aye, roughly. Maybe a bit longer, now that I think on it. Time does fly, doesn't it? It started gradually, just a wee bit o' discomfort, and it’s slowly gotten worse. I just figured it was somethin’ I’d eat, but it's no' gone away, so I thought it best to get it checked out. Don't want to be pushin' me luck with this heart condition, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Yes, a cautious approach is wise, given your cardiac history. Now, besides the nausea, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been a wee bit more tired than usual, maybe. But I’m 63, so that could just be age, couldn't it? I’ve also noticed my ankles are a bit swollen at the end of the day, but I always put that down to standin’ too long at the library. It’s hard to tell what's new and what's just… me, gettin’ older, ye ken? I've no' had any trouble breathin' or chest pains or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and ankle swelling. Noted. And no shortness of breath or chest pain. Good. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you know what specifically is wrong with your heart?
PATIENT: Aye, I do. Dr. MacLeod explained it to me a few years back. It’s… congestive heart failure, he called it. Said the pumpin' ain’t as strong as it used to be, so fluid builds up. That’s why I need to watch the salt and… well, that’s why I'm here now, I suppose, with the nausea and the swollen ankles. I take a couple o’ tablets every day for it, but he hasn’t changed the dose recently. I try to keep an eye on things, but it’s easy to get confused with all the pills and… well, ye know how it is.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Let’s go through those medications. Do you remember what they are called?
PATIENT: Aye, I do. There’s… Lisinopril, I think it is. A wee white tablet. And then there’s Furosemide, a yellow one. That's the water tablet, Dr. MacLeod said. And... Oh, and Digoxin, I believe. A wee pink one. I take the Lisinopril every mornin', the Furosemide every other day, and the Digoxin… usually every mornin’ as well. I've been takin' them for… oh, must be five years now, maybe a bit longer. I try to be diligent, but sometimes I get mixed up. It's a lot to keep track of for an old man like me.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, Furosemide, and Digoxin. Correct. And you said you've been on these for about five years. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Aye, no allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with any pills or foods. Dr. MacLeod asked about that when he first prescribed everything, and I've been fine ever since. I've always been pretty good with my health, truth be told. Just this heart thing, ye ken? It’s a nuisance, but I try to keep it under control. It’s just this mornin’ sickness that’s got me worried, and the ankles swellin' a bit more than usual. I'm no' wanting to end up back in the hospital, that's for certain.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your ankles and abdomen. Then we'll see if we can figure out what's causing this. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Just let me know if ye need me to do anything special. It's a bit o' a climb for an old fellow like me, but I'll manage. Best get this sorted, eh?
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s get this sorted. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please try to breathe normally. I'm hearing a bit of crackling in your lungs, Mr. Benic. And your heart sounds… irregular. And yes, your ankles are definitely swollen. There’s pitting edema present. Do you experience any shortness of breath when lying flat?
PATIENT: Aye, I do, actually. I hadn't really paid much mind to it, just put it down to gettin’ older, ye ken? But now ye mention it, it is a bit harder to breathe when I'm lyin’ flat. I usually sleep with an extra pillow or two. It's no' terrible, but it's definitely there. It feels… like there's a weight on my chest, if that makes sense? I just assumed it was the heart. Is that… bad, Doctor? Is it somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: Okay. The shortness of breath and the crackling in your lungs, along with the ankle swelling… it sounds like your congestive heart failure is likely being exacerbated. This could be due to fluid overload. We need to determine the cause. Given your symptoms and your history, I'm concerned you may need to be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. We can perform some blood tests and potentially an echocardiogram to assess your heart function. It's important we address this quickly to prevent it from worsening. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Och. Hospital, ye say? I was hopin’ to avoid that, to be honest. I'm no' a fan o' hospitals, Doctor. Been in a few times over the years, and it's no' my favourite place. But… if ye think it's necessary, then I suppose I've no' much choice, do I? I trust yer judgement, Doctor. If ye think I need to be checked over properly, then aye, let's get it done. Just… try to make me comfortable, will ye? I'm a bit o' an old softie, ye see. And maybe a nice cup o' tea if possible? It always cheers me up.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Benic. Hospitals aren't ideal. We will do everything we can to make you comfortable. And yes, we can certainly arrange a cup of tea. Okay, I’m going to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a BNP level, which helps assess heart failure. We will also get an EKG to further evaluate the irregularity of your heart beat. Then we’ll arrange for an echocardiogram as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a diuretic – Furosemide, a higher dose than you’re currently taking – to help remove some of the excess fluid. Please let the nurses know immediately if you experience any dizziness or weakness. I also recommend limiting your salt intake significantly while you wait for admission. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Aye, that's a fair bit o' information, Doctor. Salt, aye, I’ll try me best. It's hard, though, ye see. I do enjoy a wee bit o’ salted porridge in the mornin’, and a bit o’ gravy with me dinner. But I'll cut back, I promise. The Furosemide… will that make me need to… go to the toilet more often? That's always been a bit o' a bother with that one, if I recall correctly. And what about the BNP level and the echocardiogram… what exactly are ye lookin' for with them? Just tryin' to understand what's goin' on, ye ken? I like to know these things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, you have every right to know. Yes, the Furosemide will likely make you need to urinate more frequently. That’s how it removes the fluid, so please don't hesitate to call the nurses if you’re feeling uncomfortable. We can adjust the dose if it’s too much. As for the BNP level, it’s a blood test that measures a hormone released when the heart is stretched or strained. A high level indicates your heart is working harder than it should. The echocardiogram is an ultrasound of your heart. It allows us to see the size and shape of your heart, how well your heart chambers are pumping, and if your heart valves are functioning properly. We’re looking for any structural abnormalities or signs of weakened heart muscle. Essentially, these tests will help us determine the severity of your heart failure and guide our treatment plan. Do you understand what I’m saying, or would you like me to explain it differently?
PATIENT: Aye, that makes a wee bit more sense, Doctor. Stretched heart, weak muscle… right. So ye're tryin' to find out why it's workin' so hard, and what's causing it to struggle, so ye can fix it. That sounds sensible. I appreciate ye takin' the time to explain it all so clearly. It's a lot to take in, but I feel a bit better knowin' what ye're lookin' for. One more thing, if ye don't mind. Will I be able to… phone me niece? She usually checks on me when I'm not feelin' well. Just so she knows I'm alright, ye see. She worries somethin' awful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Benic. You will definitely be able to phone your niece. We encourage you to keep your loved ones informed. We’ll make sure you have a phone in your room, and you’re welcome to call her whenever you need to. Now, let's get you admitted. I’ll arrange for the nurses to come and get you shortly. They will take your blood pressure and do a quick assessment before transferring you to the cardiology unit. In the meantime, try to relax, and don’t hesitate to call the nurses if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can do for you right now, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Aye, that's grand, Doctor. Thank ye kindly. No, I think that's all for now. Just… gettin' this admission sorted, and maybe a wee bit o' peace and quiet. I appreciate ye takin' the time to explain everything so thoroughly. Ye've been very patient with an old man like me. I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurses now, then. And I’ll try to remember to phone me niece.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. We're here to help. Please don’t hesitate to let us know if you need anything at all. I’ll leave you in the nurses' capable hands. Get some rest, and we'll see you soon. .
