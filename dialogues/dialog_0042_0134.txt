DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Oh dear… what does bring me in? It’s… it’s been a bit of a bother, this feeling. Mostly just… not feeling hungry, and getting full awful quick. And then, well, the sick to my stomach sometimes. It’s been going on for a little while now, I reckon. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. My memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Kelder. It sounds quite uncomfortable. Not feeling hungry, getting full quickly, and some nausea… I understand. It’s perfectly alright that the timing isn’t precise; we’ll sort it out together. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about when this started, even if it's a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. Let me think. It feels like… after I started feeling so tired all the time. That was… maybe spring? No, before that, I think. When the weather started warming up, definitely. But the not being hungry… that crept in slower. It wasn’t all at once, you see. It’s like… I just didn’t want much to eat, and then suddenly a tiny bit of food makes me feel awful stuffed. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Kelder. It sounds like it developed gradually, which is helpful to know. So, starting around the time you noticed increased fatigue, and the appetite changes and feeling full quickly followed. And how has your energy level been aside from just feeling tired?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… hard to do things. Even little things. Used to love tending my garden, you know? But I just… don’t have the pep for it anymore. I get winded so easily. And I find myself just… sitting a lot. My animals need me, of course, so I manage to do what has to be done, but it takes a lot more effort now. It’s not like the old days. I used to be able to run around with the best of ‘em, training those critters!
DOCTOR: I see. So, a noticeable decrease in your overall energy, making even routine tasks more challenging, and requiring more effort. And that’s affecting your ability to do things you enjoy, like gardening. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside these symptoms?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. Oh! My stomach… it’s been a bit… unhappy. Not pain, exactly, but… unsettled. Bloated, sometimes. And… I’ve lost a little weight, I reckon. My clothes feel a bit looser. It’s not like I’ve been trying to lose weight, mind you. Quite the opposite, really. I try to eat something, even if it doesn’t sound good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some stomach discomfort – bloating, feeling unsettled – and unintentional weight loss. That's important to note. And have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now you’re asking things I don’t usually talk about. Let me see… hmm. It’s… not been regular, that’s for sure. Sometimes I go, sometimes I don’t. And when I do go, it’s… different. Not like it used to be. Harder, you see. Does that make any sense? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things like this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. You're doing just fine. It's common to feel uncomfortable discussing these things, and you’ve explained it very clearly. So, changes in bowel habits – irregularity, and difficulty passing stool. Now, thinking back over the past few months, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Oh my… that sounds… serious. Blood? No, I don't think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I haven’t been looking, if you know what I mean. And black… no. Everything’s been… pretty normal looking, other than the hardness. I’m pretty sure about that. It's just… hard, and doesn't come easy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Kelder. It’s good to know you haven’t noticed any blood or black, tarry stools. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… the doctor always told me my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a pill for it, years ago. I think it was a white one… or maybe a yellow one? I take it every day, I think. Mostly, I just try to forget about it. And… oh! I had a bad spell with my gallbladder a long time ago. They took it out, must be twenty years now. Other than that… not much, I don’t reckon. I've been pretty lucky, all in all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication – though you're not certain of the specific medication – and gallbladder removal about twenty years ago. And do you recall what the medication for your blood pressure is called?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I really don’t. I just take it every morning with my coffee. I get the refills automatically from the pharmacy, so I don't have to worry about it. I’ve never really paid much attention to the name. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more help. My memory just… isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. Don't worry about it at all. We can easily check your medication list through the pharmacy records. Okay, it looks like you're currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for your blood pressure. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril, that’s it! See, I knew I was taking something. And… let me think. Just a multivitamin, I think. I take one with breakfast, mostly to be polite. My daughter keeps telling me I should be taking more things, but I don’t really pay her much mind. I mostly just eat what I want, when I want, and hope for the best.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Lisinopril for blood pressure and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. Sometimes my stomach gets a little upset, but I just chalk that up to getting old. I've never been one to be careful about things like that. My mother always said a little bit of everything is good for you.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a hard one. My mother… she passed away when I was young, from something with her heart, I think. And my father, he had… well, he just got old, mostly. He wasn't very healthy, to be honest. And… oh! My aunt, on my mother’s side, she had cancer. Breast cancer, I think. That was a long time ago, though. Other than that… not much that I remember. We weren’t a family that talked much about illnesses, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Kelder. So, a family history of heart issues with your mother, and breast cancer with your aunt. And finally, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I live alone now, since my husband passed. I keep busy with my animals, mostly. I have a few cats and some chickens. I used to garden a lot more, but like I said, I don’t have the energy for that now. I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while. Mostly, I just try to take it easy and enjoy what little time I have left.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Ms. Kelder. It gives me a much better picture of your overall health. Based on what you’ve told me – your loss of appetite, early satiety, nausea, unintentional weight loss, changes in bowel habits, and fatigue – along with your family history and lifestyle, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. One thing that comes to mind is the possibility of a gastrointestinal issue, such as a problem with your stomach or intestines. To get a clearer diagnosis, I’d like to order a few tests. First, I want to do a complete blood count, or CBC, to check for any signs of anemia or infection. I also want to check your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause similar symptoms. And finally, I’d like to order a stool test to rule out any infections or bleeding. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it’ll help figure out what’s going on, then yes, that’s alright. I trust your judgment. Honestly, I just want to feel like myself again. I miss being able to enjoy things. Tests are… well, they're not my favorite, but if it means getting an answer, then I’m willing to do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. I understand. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better. I’ll have my nurse come in and draw the blood for the CBC and thyroid function test. We'll also give you a kit to collect a stool sample at home. The nurse will explain everything in detail. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything so clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and not making me feel like I’m just an old woman complaining. It means a lot. Just… when will I know the results? And will you explain them to me if they’re… not good?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It’s my job to listen and help. And absolutely, I will explain everything to you, no matter what the results are. We'll usually have the blood test results back within a few days, typically 3-5 business days. The stool test might take a little longer, perhaps a week. Once the results are in, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or bloody stools, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before I let my nurse come in?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Ms. Kelder. We’ll take good care of you. I’ll have the nurse come in right away.
