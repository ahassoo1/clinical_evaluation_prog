DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. My regular doctor – old Doctor Hansen – he retired, you see. And the new folks sent me over here after some blood work showed my cholesterol was a bit high. That’s what they said, anyway. High...something-lipidemia, I think? I don't rightly remember all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bohnett, I see. High cholesterol, or hyperlipidemia as you may have heard. That's perfectly alright, it's common as we get older. So, you were sent over for a consultation about managing this. Can you tell me a little more about why Doctor Hansen ordered the blood work in the first place?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... Old Doctor Hansen, he just does a yearly check-up, you know? Always has. Blood work, the usual poking and prodding. I hadn’t been feeling a thing, really. Just the normal aches and pains of getting on in years, but nothing that worried me. He just said, “We’re gonna check your numbers, Lindsey.” And now here we are! He didn’t say why specifically, just that it was good to keep an eye on things.
DOCTOR: Alright, so routine blood work showed the high cholesterol. And you haven’t noticed any symptoms – no chest pain, shortness of breath, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not a thing, Doctor. I’ve been feeling pretty good, all things considered. I still get out and do a bit of gardening, though it slows me down a bit these days. Walk to the store, help my granddaughter with her little ones... nothing that makes me think something's amiss. Just tired, you know? But that's just getting old, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, fatigue can be a part of getting older. Let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… Old Doctor Hansen always checked my blood pressure, and it was usually a little high, but he never put me on any medicine for it. He said to watch the salt, so I’ve been pretty good about that. No diabetes, no heart problems that I know of. Had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just what happens when you've lived as long as I have. Nothing serious, mind you. Mostly just a little stiffness in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think again. Now, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was… oh, goodness, must have been sixty years ago! And I had a cataract in my left eye removed a few years back, but that's about it. Nothing else that I can recall. Small things, really. Not big operations.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal long ago and cataract surgery. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, Doctor. It's called glucosamine, I think. My granddaughter gets it for me. Helps with the stiffness a bit, but not a miracle cure, you know? And sometimes I take a little something for heartburn, if I eat something spicy. But that’s just when I need it. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine for your knees and occasional heartburn medication. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I've ever noticed. I can eat pretty much anything. A little hay fever in the spring, but that's just a sniffle. Nothing serious. Old Doctor Hansen asked about allergies every year, and I always told him the same thing – no problems. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife, bless her soul, she was allergic to bee stings. But not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any heart problems, high cholesterol, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Well, now that’s a good question. My father, he had a bit of a ticker problem when he got older. He didn’t take care of himself, always smoked like a chimney. They said it was his heart, but I was just a boy then. And my mother, she had a bit of sugar in her blood later in life, but I don't think it was the full-blown diabetes. My wife’s family… they were pretty healthy folk, as far as I know. Nothing major that I can recall. It was a long time ago, you see. Hard to remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Alright, father with heart problems and mother with some sugar issues. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. Old Doctor Hansen used to give me a bit of a look when I told him that. He said it was a good thing! My wife, she tried it once or twice when she was young, but she didn’t care for it. She always said it smelled awful. So no, no smoking for me. Always been a clean living man, mostly. Though I do enjoy a good piece of pie now and then.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, I have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Red wine, they say it’s good for your heart. But just one glass. Nothing more. I'm not much of a drinker, never have been. My wife used to enjoy a little sherry, but I always preferred a good glass of water. Mostly with my meal, that's all. Not a big habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, one glass of red wine with dinner. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I still get out and do a bit of gardening. Mostly weeding and watering, not much heavy lifting anymore. I walk to the store when the weather is nice, about a mile each way. And I try to take a little stroll around the block every day, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I used to be a pretty active fella, you know? Worked on the farm when I was young, lots of hard labor. But those days are long gone. Mostly just taking it easy these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Been going to doctors my whole life, so I'm used to the poking and prodding. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry. Alright, abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are good and strong. No swelling in your feet or ankles. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. That's a little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your age. And finally, I'll check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Overall, everything seems pretty good for a man your age. Now, looking at your lab results, your cholesterol is indeed high - specifically your LDL cholesterol is elevated. That's the "bad" cholesterol. Your overall cholesterol is 240, LDL is 160, HDL is 40 and triglycerides are 150. We need to address this to reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke.
PATIENT: Oh my. That's a lot of numbers! I don't pretend to know what any of that means, to be honest. LDL... that's the bad one, you say? So, what does that mean for me? Is it serious? What can we do about it? I’d appreciate it if you could explain it to me in plain English, Doctor. Like you would explain it to a grandchild.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bohnett. Think of cholesterol like wax in your blood. It's important, your body needs some of it. But too much of the "bad" wax – that's the LDL cholesterol – can build up inside your arteries, like gunk in a pipe. This makes it harder for blood to flow, and eventually, it can lead to heart disease or a stroke. Your LDL is a little high, meaning there's a bit too much of that "bad" wax in your system. Your HDL is a little low, that’s the “good” wax. It helps clear the bad wax away. So, we need to try and lower the LDL and raise the HDL. It's not an emergency right now, but it's something we need to take seriously to prevent problems down the road. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a lot more sense, thank you. Like gunk in a pipe, that’s a good way to explain it. So, what can I do about this gunk? Is it something I can fix with diet, or do I need to take medicine? I'd prefer to try diet first, if that's possible. I don't like the idea of taking pills if I don't have to. What sort of things should I be eating – or avoiding?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable approach, Mr. Bohnett. Diet and exercise are always the first steps. We can certainly try that before considering medication. To lower your cholesterol, you'll want to focus on a heart-healthy diet. That means reducing your intake of saturated and trans fats, which are found in things like red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. Try to eat more foods rich in fiber, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Fish, especially fatty fish like salmon, is also good because it's rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower cholesterol. Specifically, I recommend reducing your red meat intake to no more than once a week, avoiding processed foods altogether, and limiting fried foods. Increase your fruit and vegetable intake to at least five servings a day. And try to eat a serving of fish at least twice a week. I can print out a handout with a list of heart-healthy foods for you. In addition to diet, regular exercise can also help lower cholesterol and improve your overall health. Even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a big difference. We can also discuss some lifestyle changes, like quitting smoking if you smoke, and managing stress. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds very manageable, thank you Doctor. I can definitely cut back on the red meat, I don't eat a lot of it anyway. And I'll try to eat more fish. I love salmon, so that won't be a hardship. I’m already walking a bit, so I can try to do a little more of that. The handout would be very helpful, yes, please. What about eggs? I enjoy a fried egg with my breakfast sometimes. Are those alright? And do I need to worry about butter? I use a little bit when I’m cooking. I just want to be sure I understand everything correctly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bohnett. Those are good questions. Regarding eggs, you can have eggs in moderation – up to one egg a day is generally considered safe for most people, even with high cholesterol. However, it’s best to focus on the whites of the eggs rather than the yolks, as the yolks contain most of the cholesterol. And about butter, you can use it in small amounts, but it's best to switch to healthier fats like olive oil or avocado oil whenever possible. Olive oil is particularly good, as it contains healthy fats that can actually help lower your cholesterol. Here’s the handout with more detailed information. It also includes a list of foods to avoid. I want you to try these changes for three months, and then we’ll repeat the blood tests to see how you’re doing. If your cholesterol hasn’t improved enough, we can discuss other options, such as medication. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing what I need to do. I'll follow your advice and try to make these changes. Three months, you said? I’ll mark it on my calendar. I appreciate your patience and kindness. It's reassuring to have a good doctor looking after me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. I'm glad I could help. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And I'm here for you if you have any questions or concerns along the way. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for three months from today to recheck your cholesterol levels. In the meantime, take care of yourself and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that will be all, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and help. I think I’ll be on my way now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Bohnett. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before then.
