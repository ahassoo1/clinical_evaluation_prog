DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Nahrwold. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Seil. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's my stomach. It's been… not good. I keep getting diarrhea, and it's been going on for a while now. Honestly, I can’t really remember how long. A few weeks, maybe? It just... happens. I think I mentioned it to my husband, but he just told me to drink more water.
DOCTOR: I see. A few weeks of diarrhea… that can certainly be disruptive. And it's good you mentioned it to your husband, but it sounds like it's persisting despite that. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Um… okay. It's… watery, mostly. Sometimes there’s… stuff in it, but not always. It doesn't usually hurt, just… uncomfortable. And I have to go a lot. Like, way more than normal. I’m not sure how many times a day, I honestly don't keep track. I just know it’s often. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Watery stools, sometimes with some solid matter, and frequent bowel movements. I appreciate you sharing that. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool at all?
PATIENT: Blood… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven't really looked closely, to be honest. I know it sounds bad, but I try not to. Mucus… maybe? It’s hard to tell. Sometimes it looks… slimy, I guess? But I'm not sure if that’s normal. I really don't pay much attention, if I’m being truthful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s not something everyone focuses on. Let's move on. Besides the diarrhea, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I've been really tired lately. More tired than usual. And my stomach… it feels bloated sometimes, and a bit crampy. Not always, just… off and on. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, but I haven't weighed myself recently. It's just… my clothes feel a bit looser. Oh! And I've been feeling kind of nauseous sometimes, especially in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, bloating, cramping, some weight loss, and nausea, particularly in the mornings. Thank you. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And I haven't been vomiting, thankfully. It’s just the nausea, like a queasy feeling. It doesn’t usually last long, though. And it’s not… intense, if that makes sense. Just enough to make me feel a bit off. I'm mostly just worried about… well, you know, the diarrhea. It's really disruptive, and I can't really plan anything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nahrwold. Chronic diarrhea is certainly disruptive, and it’s good you’re seeking medical attention. Let’s go through a bit more of your history to try and pinpoint the cause. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Travel… not really. We went to visit my sister in Chicago a couple of months ago, but that was just for a weekend. And we didn’t really go anywhere special while we were there. Just stayed with her and hung out. Nothing else. Oh, wait… I did eat at a new Pakistani restaurant when I was there. It was really good, but… I don't know if that's relevant. It was a while ago.
DOCTOR: That's good information to have. It could be relevant. We'll keep that in mind. Now, have you made any changes to your diet lately, besides that restaurant?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I try to eat pretty normally. My husband does most of the cooking. We eat a lot of rice and chicken, and vegetables. I sometimes have yogurt, but I haven't changed anything significantly. Oh! Except… I’ve been drinking a lot more diet soda lately. Just because it's hot, and it feels refreshing. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, but it's good to know. Some artificial sweeteners can cause digestive upset in some people. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, my doctor told me a few years ago that I might have something with my intestines. I think she said it was something like… IBD? Or maybe celiac? Something like that. She did some tests, but she didn’t really explain it properly, and I forgot most of it. And I just… haven't been back since. Honestly, I’m terrible with remembering medical stuff. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be overwhelming to remember everything. It sounds like there might have been some preliminary investigation into inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease. Do you happen to have any records from that doctor that we could access?
PATIENT: I think so… maybe. My husband keeps all the paperwork. He's really organized. Let me see… Oh! Here it is. A folder from Dr. Patel. It’s pretty thick. I haven’t looked at it since… a long time ago. Would you like me to give it to you? It’s probably a mess, honestly. I'm really sorry.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Nahrwold. This is very helpful. It appears you had some testing done for both celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease a couple of years ago. The celiac panel was negative, but there are some notes here indicating slightly elevated inflammatory markers and a partial colonoscopy was recommended, but not completed. Now, do you have any family history of gastrointestinal issues, like Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My grandmother on my mother’s side… she had some stomach problems when she was older. I think she had something with her colon? But I don't really know the details. My mother says it was just “old age.” And I think my uncle on my father’s side has Irritable Bowel Syndrome? He complains about his stomach a lot, but I don’t know if that’s the same thing. I’m not very good at keeping track of family medical stuff either. Everyone’s always sick with something.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. You’ve given me a good starting point. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the usual pain reliever, like ibuprofen, when I have a headache. And sometimes I take an antacid if my stomach is really bothering me. Nothing regularly. And… oh! My doctor prescribed me something a while back for the stomach thing, but I stopped taking it. I can't remember what it was called. It didn't seem to be doing much anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ibuprofen as needed for headaches, antacids for stomach upset, and a previous medication that wasn't effective. Thank you, Ms. Nahrwold. I appreciate you sharing all of this information with me. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. It will involve listening to your abdomen, feeling your abdomen to check for tenderness, and checking your vital signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s wrong, and hopefully get it fixed. I’m getting really tired of being sick all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 72, temperature is normal at 98.6, and respiratory rate is 16. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. That's not necessarily alarming, but it's something we need to keep in mind. Given your history of chronic diarrhea, potential incomplete investigation for IBD, family history, and this mild tenderness, I think we need to run some further tests to get a clearer picture. I’d like to order a comprehensive stool analysis to check for infection, inflammation, and parasites. I also want to repeat the blood work, including inflammatory markers like CRP and ESR, and check for celiac disease antibodies again. Finally, I recommend a colonoscopy to visualize the colon and rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Wow… that’s a lot. A colonoscopy… that sounds scary. Is it really necessary? I mean, I just want to feel better. Are there any other options? I’m just a bit nervous about… everything. I’ve never had one before. And, what if it finds something bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Nahrwold. A colonoscopy can sound daunting, and it’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. However, it’s the most accurate way to evaluate the colon and determine the cause of your chronic diarrhea. We can discuss the procedure in detail, and I’ll explain everything step-by-step. It’s usually well-tolerated, and we have sedation options to ensure your comfort. Regarding alternatives, we could start with a trial of dietary modifications and medication to manage your symptoms. However, without a clear diagnosis, we’re essentially treating the symptoms and not the underlying cause. This could delay proper treatment and potentially lead to complications. As for finding something bad, that’s a valid concern. But it's important to remember that early detection is key. If there is something concerning, identifying it early allows us to intervene and improve your prognosis. We'll discuss the results thoroughly and develop a personalized treatment plan if necessary. Would you like me to explain the colonoscopy procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be helpful. I just… I don’t know what to expect. And I’m worried about being in pain. And the… the prep. I’ve heard horror stories about that. Just tell me everything. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Then I can decide if it’s worth it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let’s talk about the colonoscopy. The procedure itself involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum and advancing it through your colon. The camera allows us to visualize the lining of the colon and identify any abnormalities like polyps, inflammation, or ulcers. You will be given sedation, usually a combination of medications, to help you relax and minimize discomfort. Most patients don’t remember the procedure at all. The entire process usually takes about 30-60 minutes. Now, you mentioned the prep, and you’re right to be concerned. It's the least pleasant part of the procedure. It involves drinking a large volume of a special liquid solution to completely empty your colon. This ensures the doctor has a clear view during the colonoscopy. There are different prep options available, some more tolerable than others. We can discuss which option is best for you. While it’s not enjoyable, it’s crucial for a successful exam. It can cause frequent bowel movements and some cramping, but it’s temporary. As for pain during the procedure, most patients experience minimal discomfort. You might feel some pressure or bloating, but it shouldn’t be severe. If you do experience any pain, you can let the doctor know immediately, and they will address it. After the procedure, you might feel some bloating and gas, but this usually subsides within a few hours. You’ll be monitored for a short period before being discharged home. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… less scary than I thought, but still not fun. What if they find polyps? Are those always bad? And what if they have to… remove something? Will that hurt? And how long would I be out of work? I'm a sales rep, so I travel sometimes. I just need to know what I'm getting into.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Nahrwold. Let’s address them one by one. Polyps are growths on the lining of the colon. They're common, and most are not cancerous. However, some can develop into cancer over time, so it’s important to remove them. If polyps are found, they are usually removed during the colonoscopy itself. This is a painless procedure. A small instrument is used to snip the polyp off, and it’s sent to a lab for analysis. You won’t feel any pain during the removal, as it’s done while you’re sedated. Regarding time off work, that depends on the findings and what, if anything, was removed. If only small polyps were removed, you can usually return to work the next day. However, if larger polyps were removed or if any other procedures were performed, you might need a few days to recover. As you are a sales rep and travel, we would need to discuss the specifics of your travel schedule and ensure you’re fully recovered before you resume any trips. We can provide a doctor's note detailing any restrictions. Now, regarding your travel schedule, do you have any upcoming trips planned in the next few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I have a conference in Atlanta next month, the 15th to the 17th. It’s pretty important, so I really don’t want to miss it. And I'm supposed to go to Chicago again the following month, to visit some clients. I'm starting to think I should just cancel everything. But that would be a disaster for my sales numbers.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a conference in Atlanta next month on the 15th-17th and a client visit in Chicago the following month. Given your schedule, it sounds like scheduling the colonoscopy as soon as possible is important. Let’s aim to have it done within the next week, if possible. That would give you ample time to recover before your Atlanta conference. If anything significant is found, we can discuss options to reschedule your trips, if necessary. We can also provide documentation for your employer explaining any medical restrictions. Now, before we proceed, are you allergic to any medications or have any underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung problems?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. And… no, I don't think so. My doctor a few years ago said my heart was fine, but… that was a while ago. I really should have all my medical records organized, but honestly, I'm a mess when it comes to that stuff. My husband usually handles all of that. So, can we schedule it? Next week would be good, if possible. I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nahrwold. It sounds like scheduling the colonoscopy next week is a good plan. Let's see what availability we have. We have an opening on Tuesday morning at 9:00 am. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 9:00 am… yes, that should be fine. Okay, let's do it. And can you remind me about the prep? And what I need to bring with me? I don’t want to forget anything. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Tuesday at 9:00 am it is. Let’s discuss the prep. You will receive detailed written instructions, but essentially, you’ll need to start a clear liquid diet the day before your procedure. This means no solid foods, just things like broth, clear juice, and water. You’ll also need to drink a special laxative solution to empty your colon. We will discuss the different options and choose the one that best suits you. As for what to bring, please bring your insurance card, a photo ID, and a list of any medications you are currently taking. You’ll also need someone to drive you home, as you won’t be able to drive yourself after the sedation. We will also need your medical history form completed before the procedure. It will be sent to you electronically. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Seil. You've really put my mind at ease. I was so worried, but you explained everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience. I just want to get this over with and hopefully start feeling better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Nahrwold. I'm glad I could help. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical procedures, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have along the way. We will see you on Tuesday at 9:00 am. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good rest of your day, and we’ll take good care of you.
