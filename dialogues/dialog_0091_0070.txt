DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Delacour, and I'm an internal medicine physician. Could you please tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor… Dela-something, yes? I… new here. Just moved. Old doctor… far away now. Medicare said come here. Social visit, they call it. Need check-up, I think. Old bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. A “social visit” for a new patient check-up is perfectly reasonable. And yes, I understand about “old bones.” We want to make sure everything is functioning as well as it should be. To start, can you tell me a bit more about why you felt you needed a check-up?
PATIENT: Hmm. Why… Not needed, exactly. Just… good to know, yes? I do makeup. For theatre. Lots of people. Important people! Need to be healthy for them. Can't have sick makeup artist. They wouldn't like that. Mostly just tired, I guess. Old. Tired. Is that enough reason?
DOCTOR: That is absolutely a good enough reason, Mr. Szmyd. Maintaining your health for yourself and your profession is very important. And feeling tired is certainly a valid concern we can investigate. When you say tired, could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Just… all the time. Not like… sick tired. More like… heavy. Like weights on my feet. And… I forget things now. Names, mostly. Sometimes where I put my brushes. Important brushes! Very expensive. That makes me tired too, worrying about them. Used to remember everything. Now… not so much. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, that’s helpful. “Heavy” and the memory issues are certainly things we want to explore. The forgetfulness, is that a recent development, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Maybe… six months? Hard to say. Time… it goes fast, yes? But getting worse, maybe. I used to do… complex designs, very quickly. Now… need to write things down. Lists. And I still forget things. The theatre people, they think I’m getting… eccentric. Not good for business, eccentric. They want serious makeup artist, not… magician.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s concerning when changes in cognitive function begin to affect your work and daily life. We will certainly get to the bottom of this. Let’s move on to other systems. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not so good. Used to eat big meals. Now… small things. Soup, mostly. And yes, weight… less, I think. But I like soup. Maybe that’s why. Not worried about weight, really. Skinny is good for looking artistic, yes? But definitely eating less. Not much energy for cooking big things. Too tired. Like I said. Everything comes back to tired.
DOCTOR: I see. Decreased appetite with unintentional weight loss, coupled with the fatigue and memory concerns. Alright. Now, have you experienced any issues with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Who sleeps? Always working. Theatre people, they have strange hours. But… when I do sleep… not good. Wake up many times. Dreams… bad dreams, sometimes. And… hard to get to sleep. My mind… it goes, goes, goes. Thinking about designs, names, brushes… everything. Old lady problems, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, with frequent awakenings and some troubling dreams. This is all valuable information, Mr. Szmyd. Now, let’s briefly touch on other areas. Have you noticed any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain… yes. Back. Old injury, long time ago. Lifting heavy things. Theatre sets, very heavy. Comes and goes. Mostly when I bend. Not constant. And… sometimes my hands ache. From holding brushes, I think. It’s alright. Old makeup artist problems, yes? I take pills sometimes. The red ones. My wife… my ex-wife… she gave them to me. I don’t know what they are.
DOCTOR: Unknown pills are something we need to address immediately, Mr. Szmyd. It’s very important we know exactly what you’re taking, even if your ex-wife provided them. Do you perhaps have any of the pill bottles with you, or can you recall the name on the prescription?
PATIENT: Bottles… no. She took them with her. Everything. Just… red pills. Small ones. Round. I take them when the back hurts. She said it was for… inflammation? Or something. I don't remember. Not good with names. Or pills. Always forget things. She was the organized one. Always. Everything was her.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Szmyd. We need to be cautious. Taking medications without knowing what they are can be dangerous. I am going to order some blood tests to check your kidney and liver function, as those are often affected by pain relievers. And I'm going to have the pharmacy try to identify the pills based on your description. Now, to move onto your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic… what? High… something? No. Never had anything serious. Always healthy. Except for the tired. And the forgetting. My ex-wife, she worried a lot. Always took me to doctors. Checked everything. Said I needed more vitamins. That's all. Never had… conditions. Just… old. And tired. Maybe that is a condition?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Szmyd. We're working to find out what's causing your fatigue. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgery… hmm. When I was young. Appendicitis. Long time ago. Very sick. Stayed in the hospital for a few days. That's it. No other surgeries. No other… hospital. Just the appendix. Very unpleasant. Bad food. But that was… a long, long time ago. Everything hurts me when I try to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy in the past. Now, Mr. Szmyd, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she… had problems with her heart, I think. Old age, mostly. My father… strong man. Lived long life. Worked hard. Never sick. My sister… she had… what you call it? The sugar sickness? Diabetes. Yes, that's it. Diabetes. Not me, though. Never had problems with sugar. I like sweet things, but… never sick. Everything else, I don’t know. Family far away. Don’t talk much.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Szmyd. That’s helpful. Now, just a few final questions before we proceed with a physical exam. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never! Bad for the skin. And… alcohol? Sometimes. Small glass of vodka. With dinner. Only sometimes. For relaxation. And… recreational drugs? What you call… fun pills? No, no. Never! I need a clear mind for my makeup. Very important. Can’t have shaky hands. So, no. None of those. Just a little vodka, sometimes. For the nerves.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Nothing serious. Sometimes itchy skin. When I use… cheap makeup. That’s all. And dust. Little bit of dust. Makes me sneeze. But not a real allergy, you know? Just… annoying. No pills. No foods. Just dust and cheap makeup.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Szmyd. That completes our initial questioning. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, examine your abdomen, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical… alright. Whatever you need. Just… don’t poke too much. Old bones, you know? And… be gentle with the hands. I need those for the makeup. Very important hands. But… alright. Do what you need. Long as it gets me back to work.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Could you please take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: Like this? Hurts my chest a little. Old lungs, you know. Used to smoke around the theatre people. Bad habit, I admit. Always coughing afterwards. Is that what you're listening for? The coughing? I don't cough much now, but... sometimes at night.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. I'm listening for any unusual sounds in your lungs. I did notice a slight decrease in breath sounds on both sides. The fact that you previously smoked is relevant. Now I'm going to listen to your heart. Just relax and breathe normally. Your heart rhythm is regular, and I don't detect any murmurs. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 78. That's a little elevated, which can be related to stress or other factors. Now, I'm going to examine your abdomen. Can you please lie back and let me know if you feel any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Abdomen… alright. Careful, though. Old problems. Used to lift heavy sets. Sometimes it aches. Press carefully. And… don’t poke too hard! Ouch! There… yes. That’s it. A little bit tender. Not constant, but… when you press. Especially there… on the left side. Feels… tight. Like a knot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some mild tenderness in the left upper quadrant of your abdomen. It doesn’t seem to be any significant acute inflammation at this time, but we should investigate this further. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological assessment. This just involves checking your reflexes and a few simple tests. Can you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Like this? It makes me dizzy. Old eyes, you know. Not so good with moving things. Sometimes I see… spots. But it’s alright. Just old eyes. Don't worry about it. I can still paint beautiful faces. Even with spots.
DOCTOR: I see. And now, can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Not so strong, I admit. Old hands. Arthritis, maybe. Used to have a very firm grip. For holding brushes, you know? Very important. But… not so strong now. Everything is getting weaker, you see? Except for the makeup skills. Those are still strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Szmyd. That completes the physical examination. Based on the examination and your history, we have several things to investigate. You're experiencing fatigue, some memory issues, sleep disturbance, mild abdominal tenderness, and some evidence of reduced grip strength and eye movement. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and there’s a history of previous smoking. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'm going to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin D level. I'm also going to order a urine analysis. I’d also like to order a CT scan of your abdomen to investigate the tenderness further. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: CT scan…? Blood tests…? So many things! I just wanted to check-up, yes? Like old doctor. Not… so complicated. What are you looking for? The tiredness? The forgetting? The knot in my stomach? Is it something bad? Will I have to stop painting faces? Very important faces, you see!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Szmyd. It does seem like a lot, and I apologize if it feels overwhelming. The tests are simply to help us understand what's causing your symptoms, so we can develop the best plan for treatment. The blood tests will help us to rule out any underlying medical conditions, like anemia, thyroid problems, or vitamin deficiencies, which can cause fatigue and memory issues. The CT scan will give us a clearer picture of what's going on in your abdomen, to investigate the tenderness further. It’s unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, but we need to rule out serious causes. And no, it's unlikely you’ll have to stop painting faces. We’re trying to improve your ability to continue doing what you love. Do you have any questions about any of the specific tests?
PATIENT: CT scan… is that… painful? And what about the blood? I don't like needles. Never been good with needles. Ex-wife always did the shots. I closed my eyes. What if it’s… something bad in the stomach? Like… a knot that won’t go away? Will it require… surgery? That’s what I’m most afraid of. Old bones, you see. Don’t heal so well anymore.
DOCTOR: The CT scan is not painful, Mr. Szmyd. You will lie on a table and a machine will take images of your abdomen. It’s like a very detailed X-ray. You may need to drink a special contrast liquid beforehand to help the images be clearer. As for the blood tests, there will be a brief pinch with the needle. It’s usually over very quickly. I understand you don't like needles, and we will do our best to make you comfortable. Regarding the knot in your stomach, it’s too early to say what it is. The CT scan will help us to identify the cause. It could be something simple, like constipation or a muscle strain. It could also be something more serious, but we need to get more information before we can make any conclusions. If it does turn out to be something that requires treatment, we will discuss all your options carefully and ensure you are comfortable with the plan. We'll start with the tests and see what they reveal. Don’t let yourself worry too much at this stage. We’ll address each step as it comes. Do you have any questions about scheduling the tests?
PATIENT: Scheduling… alright. Whatever you need. But… can someone sit with me during the tests? I get nervous. And… what if they find something bad? Will they tell me right away? Or will I have to wait? Waiting is… bad. Very bad. Makes me worry even more.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. You are absolutely allowed to have someone accompany you to the tests. In fact, I encourage it. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious, and having a friend or family member with you can provide support and comfort. Regarding the results, the radiologist will interpret the CT scan, and I will review the findings with you as soon as they are available. Usually, this takes a day or two. I will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in detail. If there are any urgent findings, we will contact you immediately. I understand your concern about waiting, and I will do my best to expedite the process. In the meantime, please try to relax and focus on the things you enjoy. Remember, we are here to support you every step of the way. Would you like me to provide you with the contact information for the imaging center, and also a referral for a friend or family member to accompany you?
PATIENT: Yes… please. The contact information for the imaging center. And… maybe a referral. My sister, perhaps. She worries a lot, so she will ask good questions. And… she’s good at holding hands. Very important, yes? Holding hands. Thank you, doctor. You’re… very patient. More patient than my ex-wife, at least.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. It's my job to be patient and to provide you with the best possible care. I’ve included the contact information for both the imaging center and my office. Feel free to call us if you have any questions or concerns. I'm also going to have my nurse call you tomorrow to schedule the blood tests. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again, doctor. You’ve made me feel… a little bit better. Less worried, maybe. Hopefully, it’s just… old bones, yes? And not anything bad. I need to paint faces. Very important faces. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I understand the importance of painting faces, and I hope we can get you back to doing what you love soon. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Szmyd.
