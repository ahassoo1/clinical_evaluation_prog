DOCTOR: Alright, Jahaad, good to meet you. So, tell me – what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor Auelua. Well, it’s… a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, and frankly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so recalling when it started is proving tricky. It’s mostly… around here, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling around your neck. That is a good place to start. And don't worry about the timing – we'll get there. It’s common to not remember exact dates with things like this. Is it painful?
PATIENT: Not… intensely, no. More of a… discomfort, really. A sort of… fullness. It doesn’t ache, precisely, but it’s noticeable, particularly when I swallow. It doesn’t interfere with eating, thankfully, but… it’s there. And it feels different than anything I’ve experienced before, though I struggle to articulate how. Is that… helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, actually. "Fullness" and a different kind of sensation are good details. And good that it’s not interfering with eating, that’s positive. Alright. Has this swelling been getting bigger, smaller, or staying about the same since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question. I believe it’s been… fluctuating, perhaps? There are days when it seems more prominent, and others when it’s barely noticeable at all. It hasn’t grown dramatically, if that makes sense. It’s not like it appeared overnight, or anything. More of a… subtle ebb and flow. I wish I could be more precise, Doctor. It's rather frustrating, this memory of mine.
DOCTOR: Don't worry about it at all, Jahaad. Fluctuating is still useful information. It sounds like it's been a gradual thing, which is good. And it’s perfectly okay to not remember everything perfectly. Would you mind if I took a quick look at your neck?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please, go right ahead. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm feeling some slight swelling on both sides of your neck, mostly in the lower cervical region. It’s not dramatically enlarged, but it's definitely present. There’s some mild tenderness when I press here, on the left side. Your thyroid feels… slightly enlarged and a little bit nodular. I don’t feel any significant firmness or anything immediately concerning, but it’s not completely smooth either. I’m also listening to your neck with my stethoscope now. Your breath sounds are clear, no unusual sounds there. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, that's where I feel it most acutely. As for other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been feeling… rather fatigued lately, more so than usual. And I suppose my appetite hasn’t been quite what it once was, though I attributed that to the warmer weather. I've also noticed a slight… dryness in my throat, occasionally. It’s not constant, but it’s there. And… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit warmer than usual, even when it isn’t particularly hot outside. It could be nothing, of course. My mind plays tricks on me these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, decreased appetite, throat dryness, and feeling warmer than usual… those are all things we should consider. It's good you're mentioning all of this, even if you think they might be unrelated. Now, have you had any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: That's… an interesting question. I haven't consciously noticed a change, no. But… I suppose my voice does feel a bit… raspy, occasionally. It’s subtle, and I often attribute it to simply speaking for extended periods, as my profession requires. But now that you mention it, perhaps it is different than usual. I wouldn't say it's a significant change, Doctor, but it's something I've noticed on occasion. It's hard to say with certainty, given my unreliable memory, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, a subtle raspiness in your voice. That's another piece of the puzzle. Now, let’s go through some of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: To the best of my knowledge, no. I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions, thankfully. I've had the usual childhood immunizations, of course, and a yearly flu shot. But no known allergies to medications or food. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. Is there anything specific I should be thinking about, Doctor? Sometimes things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: No, that’s good to know. No allergies is excellent. And it’s perfectly alright to forget things – that’s what we’re here for. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I am not. I strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle and generally avoid medication whenever possible. I take a daily multivitamin, but that’s the extent of it. No prescription medications, no over-the-counter drugs, nothing at all. I believe in the power of preventative care, Doctor, and try to address any issues through natural means whenever possible.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Okay. Now, have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils removed as a child, that’s the only surgery I’ve ever had. As for serious illnesses… I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years ago, but nothing life-threatening. Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably healthy, thankfully. I’ve always been quite resilient, I suppose. It’s a bit of a family trait, good health. My parents are both still very active and well into their seventies.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, and a bout of the flu. Good to know. And that’s wonderful to hear about your parents – genetics certainly play a role. Now, do you have any family history of thyroid problems, cancer, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My mother’s side of the family… My grandmother, on my mother’s side, suffered from… something involving her thyroid, I believe. It was many years ago, and I was quite young at the time. I recall vague mentions of illness and treatment, but the details are fuzzy. It wasn't cancer, as far as I know, but it did involve her thyroid. As for cancer or autoimmune diseases… I don’t recall any specific instances within the family, but my memory is… unreliable, as you know. I wish I could provide more definitive information, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know about your grandmother. Any family history of thyroid issues is important. Finally, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life, nor do I consume alcohol. I find both to be detrimental to one’s health. And I certainly do not partake in any recreational drugs. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, Doctor, as I previously mentioned. I prioritize regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate rest. It’s a principle I’ve always adhered to.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s all very good information. Alright, Jahaad, based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you're experiencing some swelling in your neck, accompanied by fatigue, throat dryness, and a raspy voice. The fact that your grandmother had thyroid issues is also important. Given your symptoms and the family history, I suspect there may be something going on with your thyroid gland. However, it's too early to say definitively. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, as well as a complete blood count to rule out any other potential causes for your fatigue. I’d also like to schedule an ultrasound of your neck to get a better look at your thyroid gland and identify any nodules or abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I trust your judgment implicitly. Blood tests and an ultrasound… yes, that seems like a sensible course of action. I appreciate your thoroughness. I am eager to understand what’s causing these symptoms and will gladly comply with any recommendations you may have. Thank you for taking the time to listen and address my concerns.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. I'm glad you're comfortable with that plan. I’ll have the lab order and referral for the ultrasound printed out for you now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take the blood samples right away. As for the ultrasound, you’ll need to schedule an appointment directly with the radiology department. I’ll provide you with their contact information as well. Once we have the results back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as difficulty breathing or swallowing, or significant pain – please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That's very clear, Doctor, thank you. No, I don’t believe I have any questions at this time. You’ve addressed all of my concerns thoroughly. I appreciate your attention to detail and your reassuring demeanor. I will schedule the ultrasound appointment as soon as possible and follow your instructions regarding any worsening symptoms. I feel much better equipped to manage this now. Thank you again for your time and expertise, Doctor Auelua.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any questions down the line. Get well soon, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I will. Have a pleasant day.
