DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Tkac, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Lennie Tkac. It is a pleasure to meet you, Doctor... DeCHENE, if I recall correctly? I apologize if I am slow. My memory is quite good with details, but names... sometimes they slip my mind.
DOCTOR: DeCHENE is fine. Yes. Well, let’s not dwell on pleasantries. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Because I am hoping to be approved to move into the Meadowbrook Senior Living Facility. A lovely place, from what I understand. They require a doctor’s clearance, you see. Just to be certain I am… fit for residency. I bake a good loaf of bread, if that is relevant. Though I suppose my physical health is more important than my skills with flour.
DOCTOR: Right. A senior living facility. And they sent you to me for a clearance. Very well. Let's get this over with. So, what specific concerns do you have, or what are they asking me to assess?
PATIENT: Well, I haven't any specific concerns myself. I feel quite well, for a man of my age. I still manage my bakery, though I’ve scaled back the hours a bit. Mostly just smaller orders these days. As for what they are asking… I believe a general check-up. Strength, balance, that sort of thing. Perhaps a look at my mind, to be certain I am… still with it, as they say. I do not mind at all, Doctor. Transparency is important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with a quick review of your medical history. I see here you have a record with this clinic, dating back… quite a while. Any major illnesses or surgeries I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, I have been a patient here for many years. Dr. Abernathy was a good man. As for illnesses… I had pneumonia when I was a boy, but recovered fully. And a broken arm, falling from a tree. A foolish endeavor, that was. No surgeries, though. Never needed one, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains of growing old, I suppose. Nothing serious enough to require a doctor's knife, thankfully. Is that the sort of thing you are looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Good. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I have not taken many medications in my life, thankfully. A little aspirin now and then for a headache, but nothing regular. I tend to prefer natural remedies when possible. A cup of chamomile tea often does the trick. Is that something you need a detailed list of, Doctor? I can certainly try to recall anything I might have taken as a child, though it was quite a long time ago.
DOCTOR: No, chamomile tea isn’t relevant. Let’s move on. Family history. Any significant illnesses in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Yes, family history. My mother, she lived a long life, but suffered from arthritis in her later years. My father, he was a strong man, a rancher, but he had some trouble with his heart towards the end. And my older brother, he… he passed away from a sickness when he was young. A fever, I believe. It was a long time ago, and I was just a boy myself. It was not something spoken of much. Is there something specific you are looking for, Doctor? Perhaps a particular illness that runs in families?
DOCTOR: Okay. Right. Let's just do a quick physical exam, then. I need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your strength and balance. Please follow my instructions. First, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I can stand, no problem at all. Though I may be a little slow. Years of baking, you see. It’s not the most athletic of professions. Is this alright? Do you need me to hold onto something?
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is… 148 over 82. Pulse is 78. Respiratory rate is 16. Lungs are clear, but there's a slight murmur… likely age-related. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can walk. No trouble at all. Is that sufficient, Doctor? Perhaps I should attempt a faster pace? Though I would not want to risk a fall. It would not be a good look.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's fine. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please sit back down.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My reflexes are not what they used to be, I must confess. Years of careful work with dough, you see. It requires a gentle touch. Perhaps you will find them… diminished. I do not mind at all if you need to adjust your technique. I understand these things change with age.
DOCTOR: Right. And finally, a brief cognitive assessment. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. The year is 2025. August the second, if I recall correctly. A warm day, though a bit humid. I do keep track of the date. It’s important for baking, you see. Knowing the seasons, the proper times for ingredients. Though I suppose that is not what you mean. Is there something specific about the date you are looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, that's... fine. Alright. I think I have enough information for now. I need to review these findings.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me. I understand these things take time. I will simply sit here quietly and await your assessment. Please do not hesitate to ask if you require any further information. I will do my best to provide it. Though, as I have mentioned, my memory is quite good with details, but names… they still elude me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. Based on my assessment, you are generally stable for a move to assisted living. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, your reflexes are diminished, and your gait is somewhat unsteady. I recommend regular monitoring of your blood pressure and physical therapy to improve your strength and balance. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Slightly elevated blood pressure, diminished reflexes, and an unsteady gait. I appreciate your candor. Regular monitoring of my blood pressure and physical therapy. That sounds… sensible. I have always believed in maintaining an active lifestyle, even at my age. I suppose a little extra attention to my physical well-being is not a bad thing. And this… this will allow me to move into Meadowbrook?
DOCTOR: Yes, with these recommendations, they should approve your residency. I will send a report to their facility. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your time and expertise. I am grateful for your assessment and the recommendations you have provided. Thank you again, Doctor DeCHENE. I wish you a pleasant day. And perhaps, if you ever find yourself in need of a loaf of bread… you know where to find me.
DOCTOR: Good. The nurse will see you out. .
