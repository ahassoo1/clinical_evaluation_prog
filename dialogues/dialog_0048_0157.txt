DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the nurse said. Honestly, I don't even feel that bad. It's just… my husband makes me come when they send a reminder. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Right. A reminder, yes. Well, even if you feel fine, high blood pressure is still…high blood pressure. It’s not something to ignore just because you don't have symptoms. It can cause problems later. The nurse took your blood pressure, and it was elevated. Can you tell me, in your own words, what prompted you to even have your blood pressure checked?
PATIENT: Like I said, the reminder. They send one every six months. Honestly, I think it's a waste of time and money if I feel perfectly okay. He saw it on the calendar and said I had to go. I don’t understand why they bother if everything’s usually fine. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your frustration, but preventative care is important. We are looking for potential problems before they become serious. It sounds like your husband is…concerned about your health, and that's not a bad thing. Now, about this blood pressure reading…do you know what your numbers were?
PATIENT: Numbers? No. I don’t pay attention to that stuff. They just said it was “high.” I don’t do well with…details, unless I need to remember something for work, then it sticks. Honestly, is it really that bad? I’ve been feeling alright. Mostly alright, anyway. A little tired, but who isn’t?
DOCTOR: “Mostly alright.” Okay. And when you say tired, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Just…dragged. Like I have to really make myself get up in the morning. And even after coffee, it takes a while to feel…awake. It's nothing major. My job is pretty physical, so it’s probably just that. I work out in the sun a lot. Digging, mostly. Laying pipe, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Physical labor, working outdoors… Alright. Do you ever feel short of breath with that kind of activity?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes, when it’s really hot, but that’s just the heat. Everyone gets winded in this weather. I haven’t noticed anything…different, exactly. Look, I really should be getting back. I have a deadline. Are we done?
DOCTOR: We're not quite done yet, Ms. Dudney. I need to ask a few more questions to get a complete picture. Have you had any headaches lately?
PATIENT: Headaches? Not any worse than usual. I get them sometimes, especially if I don’t drink enough water. It’s pretty dry out there, you know? But nothing that a little ibuprofen can’t fix. Is this really necessary? It feels like you’re asking about everything but what’s bothering me – which is nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your vision?
PATIENT: Vision’s fine. I wear contacts, have for years. They’re a little dry sometimes, but that’s it. They’re just…contacts. What does that even have to do with my blood pressure? I mean, I can see perfectly well. It’s not like I’m squinting or anything. Is this going to involve an eye exam? I really don’t have time for all this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, high blood pressure can affect your vision over time, that’s why I'm asking. We need to rule things out. Have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Urine? Seriously? What kind of questions are these? No, it looks…normal. I don’t examine my urine. It’s pee. I'm telling you, I feel perfectly fine. This is a complete waste of my time, and probably yours. I really need to get back to work. Can we just…write a prescription for something and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your frustration, but I am obligated to perform a reasonable assessment of your condition. It’s my professional responsibility. Before we proceed further, I need to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No! Absolutely not. My husband's mother had that, but I don’t. I eat pretty healthy, mostly. And I'm not… overweight, am I? Look at me. I work outside all day! This is getting ridiculous. I'm perfectly capable of making my own healthcare decisions, and right now, I'm deciding I need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your… reluctance to provide information, and your stated health status… I will perform a brief physical examination. It will be limited, given the circumstances. Take a deep breath…and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. It's still my professional opinion that we need to investigate your blood pressure further. But I can order a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel. Would that be acceptable?
