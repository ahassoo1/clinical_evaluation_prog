DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is... a pleasure. My Medicare, they say I need this... check-up before they pay for anything. A physical, yes? It seems like much trouble for nothing, but… one must do what one must.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Medicare does sometimes require a baseline physical exam before covering certain services. It’s quite alright; we’ll make it as efficient as possible. So, even though it's for Medicare, is there anything you specifically are concerned about, or any health issues you've been experiencing that prompted you to schedule this appointment?
PATIENT: Prompted? No. I feel... fine. Perfectly adequate. I work, I eat, I sleep. The usual things. I do not seek doctors unless absolutely necessary, you understand. It is a waste of time, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Barban. Many people feel that way. It's good to hear you're generally feeling well. Still, a check-up can sometimes identify things you might not be aware of, even if you're feeling "perfectly adequate," as you say. Let’s start with a brief review of your medical history, just to have a complete picture. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma?
PATIENT: Asthma? No. Diabetes? Goodness, no. My family… we eat properly. Rice, lamb, vegetables. Healthy things. My father lived to a very old age. I had… a problem with my stomach, some years ago. But it resolved itself. It was nothing serious, I assure you. Just… indigestion, perhaps. A bad kebab, I suspect.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about your father’s longevity. And thank you for mentioning the stomach issue. While it resolved on its own, could you tell me roughly when that happened, and did you seek any medical attention for it at the time?
PATIENT: Attention? No, never. Why pay a doctor for something that will… pass? It was perhaps five years ago. Maybe six. I just… ate less spicy food for a while. And drank more tea. It was a temporary… inconvenience. Not a matter for a medical chart, surely.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Barban. However, even seemingly minor issues can provide valuable information. It's helpful for me to have a complete picture, so I can best assess your overall health. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Absolutely not. I take excellent care of myself. Hospital? Only when I was a small boy. A broken arm, playing football. A very long time ago. They put it in a cast. It healed perfectly well. Are we nearing the end of this… inquiry?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting close to finishing up the history portion. Just a few more questions, and then we can move on to a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Lamb, rice, dates… everything. I have a strong constitution. Perhaps a slight… aversion to overly sweet things, but that is not an allergy. It is simply a matter of taste. Is this all?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. I take nothing. Why rely on artificial things when one is perfectly healthy? I drink tea. And sometimes, a small glass of fruit juice. But that is not a medicine. Really, Doctor, is there anything else? This is taking a considerable amount of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. Thank you for answering my questions so thoroughly. It sounds like you are, as you say, a very healthy individual. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, just to confirm what we've discussed and get a baseline for your records. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be quick. I have… things to attend to. And try not to touch me unnecessarily. I prefer minimal contact, if you understand. Proceed, then. But swiftly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Barban. I will be as efficient and respectful as possible. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Be gentle. It is a sensitive arm. I use it for… important work. Do not squeeze too tightly.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relaxing your arm for me, if you can. 128 over 76. That’s within the normal range. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll need you to take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling. Everything sounds good so far.
PATIENT: Good. As I said. Perfectly adequate. Must this take so long? I have important matters to consider. Is there anything… concerning you? You are listening rather intently.
DOCTOR: No, nothing concerning at all, Mr. Barban. That’s why I said everything sounds good. I’m just being thorough, as I would with any patient. Now, I’d just like to quickly look at your throat and ears. Could you please open your mouth for me and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: Get it over with quickly. This is… undignified.
DOCTOR: Everything looks clear. Your throat is normal, and your ears are clear as well. Alright, that completes the physical exam. I appreciate your cooperation, Mr. Barban. Based on our conversation and the exam, you appear to be in good health. Your blood pressure is normal, your heart and lungs sound clear, and your throat and ears look healthy. It seems your assessment of your health is accurate – you are, indeed, perfectly adequate. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I suspected as much. It was a waste of my time, but… Medicare insists. Very well. I suppose I am dismissed? And will this… procedure, be repeated annually? Because I assure you, I will not willingly subject myself to this again.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are dismissed, Mr. Barban. And regarding future visits, Medicare typically recommends a wellness checkup annually, but it is entirely your decision whether to schedule one. We will certainly respect your wishes. I’ll have the nurse provide you with a copy of your exam results for your records. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing further. Thank you... for not wasting too much of my time. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Barban. Have a good day as well. .
