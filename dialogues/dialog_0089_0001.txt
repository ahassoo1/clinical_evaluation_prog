DOCTOR: Hi Johney, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Well, it’s about the smoking, you see. I’ve been… at it for a long time, and I think it’s finally time I tried to do something about it. It's not been easy, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's great that you're taking this step, Johney. It is difficult, and acknowledging it is the biggest part. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I began when I was quite young, sixteen years old, during the war, actually. It was… commonplace then, you understand. Everyone smoked. I’ve smoked… oh, a pack a day, generally. Sometimes a bit more if I was… stressed. I mostly smoke Balkan Sobranie, when I can get them. Now, mostly just whatever’s available at the shop down the street. I’ve tried to cut down a few times, but… it never lasts.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a pack a day for… how many years would that be, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me see… from sixteen… that would be… sixty-eight years. Yes, sixty-eight years this November. A long time, Doctor. A very long time. I haven’t kept precise track, you understand. But roughly sixty-eight years, give or take a month. It’s… a habit, you see. A deep-rooted habit.
DOCTOR: Sixty-eight years – that’s a significant history, Johney. And you’re right, that makes it a deeply rooted habit. Have you experienced any health problems you think might be related to the smoking?
PATIENT: Oh, a few things. A persistent cough, naturally. Gets worse in the winter. And… shortness of breath when I exert myself. Walking up the stairs, for example. Nothing a good rest wouldn’t fix, mind you. And I get winded easily. The doctor back home—years ago—mentioned something about my lungs, but… he passed away, and the new one didn’t seem concerned. I didn't push it, to be honest. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, especially worse in the winter, and shortness of breath with exertion. I want to document that. And you said the doctor mentioned something about your lungs previously?
PATIENT: Yes, he did. Said something about… reduced capacity, I believe. And a bit of… rattling. But it was years ago, Doctor. I was younger then, or at least, less old. He suggested I quit, of course. But… well, you see where that got me. It's difficult. Very difficult. It's not a matter of wanting to, you understand. It's a matter of being able to.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Johney. It is incredibly difficult, and it’s not a matter of willpower alone. Before we talk about strategies to quit, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had a touch of arthritis in my hands, mostly. Nothing serious, just a bit of stiffness in the mornings. And my blood pressure… it sometimes runs a little high, but I don’t take any medication for it. The doctor said to watch my salt intake. Other than that… no, not really. I’ve always been… fairly resilient, I suppose. I’ve been fortunate, all things considered. Though perhaps not with this smoking habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your hands and occasional high blood pressure. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had a surgery. I’ve been lucky enough to avoid those, thankfully. A few broken bones when I was a boy, climbing trees, but nothing that required a doctor’s knife. I don't hold with cutting into a body unless it's absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My father… he smoked as well, you see. A pipe, mostly. He died of… something to do with his heart, I believe. Quite suddenly. My mother… she lived to a good age, thankfully, but she had… well, she had a touch of diabetes. And my sister… she had problems with her stomach. Not a good constitution, she didn’t. But other than that… not much. We weren’t a particularly long-lived family, mind you. I’ve outlived most of them, which… is something, I suppose. Though whether it’s a good thing… with this habit… I’m not so sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems in your father, diabetes in your mother, and stomach problems in your sister. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions about your current lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally, Doctor. A glass of sherry with dinner, perhaps. Or a small beer on a warm day. Nothing excessive, mind you. I’m not a heavy drinker. Never have been. Mostly just for enjoyment. A little relaxation. It doesn’t agree with me if I have too much. Makes me feel… unwell. It's a very moderate habit, if one can call it a habit.
DOCTOR: Alright, moderate alcohol consumption. And do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None whatsoever. I've always tried to avoid them, if possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, if it can. A bit of rest, a good diet… that’s usually enough. I take a multivitamin now and then, perhaps, but nothing prescribed by a doctor. I've always been fortunate enough to stay reasonably healthy, all things considered. Though, clearly, this smoking habit is a… an exception to that rule.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. I've been stung by a bee once, as a boy, but that didn't amount to much more than a bit of swelling. I think I'm rather resilient, all things considered. It's just this… habit. It seems to have a hold on me unlike anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Johney, thank you for all that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see how things are. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Do as you need to. I understand it’s necessary. Though I must warn you, I haven’t had a thorough examination in… well, a very long time. I hope it won't be too unpleasant. Proceed as you see fit.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out. I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds, especially at the base of your lungs, and a slightly prolonged expiration. There’s also a bit of wheezing. And your heart rate is a little elevated, but not significantly. Now I'm going to palpate your chest to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. There's some slight increased effort during breathing, but no obvious tenderness. I'm going to check your lymph nodes now. Your lymph nodes feel normal. Your blood pressure is 148/88, which is a bit elevated. I'm also going to check your pulse oximetry. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is acceptable, but could be better. Finally, I'll take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your ears and throat look normal. Everything seems to be related to your smoking history. I will document these findings.
PATIENT: I see. Not surprising, I suppose. I’ve been aware of the shortness of breath, naturally. And the wheezing… I’ve heard that myself, especially in the mornings. It doesn’t sound… promising, does it? But I thank you for the thorough examination, Doctor. It’s good to know what we’re dealing with, even if it’s not good news. Proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment. It's just… this habit has taken a toll, it seems.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound ideal, Johney, but it's good you're addressing it now. Based on your history and the exam, it's highly likely that your symptoms are related to chronic bronchitis and possible early signs of emphysema, both caused by long-term smoking. We need to do some further testing to confirm this and assess the extent of the damage. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test – that’s a breathing test. Would you be able to get those done?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… and a breathing test, you say? Yes, I believe I can manage that. Is there a facility nearby that you recommend? I haven’t had such tests done in… well, ever. I trust your judgment, Doctor, but I admit, I’m not entirely comfortable with these… modern procedures. But I understand it’s necessary. If you could provide me with a referral, and perhaps explain what will be involved… that would be most appreciated. I am ready to proceed as required, despite my… reservations.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'm going to write you a referral to the imaging center and pulmonary function testing lab across the street – it's a very reputable facility. The chest X-ray is quick and painless – you'll just stand or sit in front of a machine while a technician takes a picture of your lungs. The pulmonary function test takes a bit longer – about 30-45 minutes. You'll be asked to breathe into a mouthpiece while we measure how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can do it. It requires some effort, but it’s not painful. A technician will explain everything to you beforehand. Here’s the referral. Once you have the results, please have them sent to me. Then we can discuss a plan to help you quit smoking, and manage your breathing. Are you interested in exploring medication options like nicotine replacement therapy or other prescriptions to help with cravings?
PATIENT: Thirty to forty-five minutes… and some effort, you say? Very well. I suppose I can manage that. I am not fond of these… modern contraptions, but I understand it’s necessary. And nicotine replacement therapy… you mean patches or something of that nature? I’ve heard of such things, but I’ve always been hesitant. I’m not keen on replacing one habit with another, if you understand. But I am open to suggestions, Doctor. I am here because I want to quit, and I trust your professional opinion. Perhaps we can discuss the alternatives before I make a decision. What are the side effects of these… medications? And what success rate can I expect? I prefer to be fully informed before proceeding.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a very sensible approach, Johney. Nicotine replacement therapy comes in various forms: patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays. The patches provide a steady dose of nicotine to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. The gum, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays allow you to control the dose when you feel a craving coming on. Common side effects are mild: skin irritation with the patches, mouth soreness with the gum or lozenges, and nasal irritation with the spray. The success rate varies depending on the individual and the method used, but studies show that combining nicotine replacement therapy with counseling and support can double your chances of quitting successfully. There are also other prescription medications available, like bupropion and varenicline, which work differently to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. They have their own set of side effects, which we can discuss in detail. Before we delve into those, though, how do you feel about joining a support group?
PATIENT: A support group… you mean with other… smokers? I confess, that’s not something I’ve ever considered. I’ve always been a rather private person, Doctor. I’m not comfortable sharing my… weaknesses with strangers. But… I understand the benefits of mutual support. Perhaps it would be helpful to hear from others who are facing the same challenges. But I remain skeptical. I’m not sure I’m the type for group dynamics. Perhaps it's something to consider… after I have the results of the tests. I prefer to start with the medication options, if you don’t mind. Explain the side effects of these bupropion and varenicline… and how they differ from nicotine replacement therapy. I am a cautious man, Doctor, and I want to be fully informed before making a decision.
DOCTOR: Of course, Johney, that’s perfectly reasonable. Let’s talk about the medications. Nicotine replacement therapy, as we discussed, provides nicotine to reduce cravings without the harmful chemicals in cigarettes. Bupropion is an antidepressant that also helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Common side effects include dry mouth, insomnia, and headaches. It’s not suitable for everyone, especially those with a history of seizures or certain mental health conditions. Varenicline works by partially blocking nicotine receptors in the brain, reducing the pleasurable effects of smoking and cravings. Common side effects include nausea, vivid dreams, and headache. It’s important to be aware of a potential risk of mood changes and behavioral issues, so it’s usually not recommended for people with a history of depression or anxiety. The best option for you will depend on your overall health, your smoking history, and your personal preferences. We can weigh the pros and cons of each medication and decide together what’s right for you. What are your thoughts so far?
PATIENT: Hmm. Bupropion… and varenicline… they sound… complicated. And the potential side effects… they are concerning. I confess, I am beginning to think that nicotine replacement therapy might be the least… intrusive option, despite its limitations. I prefer to avoid anything that alters my mood or affects my mental state. I am a stable man, Doctor, and I don’t want to risk upsetting that balance. Perhaps we should start with the patches… and see how I respond. I can always consider the other medications later, if necessary. But for now… let’s focus on the least invasive approach. What dosage would you recommend? And how long would I need to wear them? I want to be fully prepared before embarking on this… journey.
DOCTOR: Alright, Johney, that sounds like a sensible plan. Starting with nicotine patches is a good way to begin. The dosage depends on how much you currently smoke. Since you smoke about a pack a day, I’d recommend starting with a 21mg patch for 24 hours a day for two weeks. Then, we can reduce the dosage to a 14mg patch for two weeks, and finally, a 7mg patch for two weeks, gradually reducing your nicotine intake. It's important to wear the patch consistently, as directed, to maintain a steady nicotine level and prevent cravings. You might experience some mild side effects like skin irritation or sleep disturbances, but those usually subside after a few days. It’s also important to drink plenty of water and avoid caffeine, as it can worsen these side effects. I'm going to write you a prescription for the 21mg nicotine patches. I'll also give you a handout with detailed instructions and information about potential side effects. Are you experiencing any other symptoms at the moment, besides the coughing and shortness of breath?
PATIENT: A gradual reduction… that sounds reasonable. Less abrupt, less… jarring. And I will be mindful of the caffeine. I confess, I enjoy a cup of coffee with my breakfast, but I can forgo it if necessary. And no, Doctor, no other symptoms at the moment. Just the persistent cough and the shortness of breath, as we discussed. No fever, no chest pain, no weight loss… just a general feeling of… weariness, perhaps. But I attribute that to my age. I am a resilient man, but even resilience has its limits. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. And I thank you for your patience. I will follow your instructions carefully and report any changes or concerns. Perhaps we should schedule a follow-up appointment… to discuss my progress and adjust the dosage as needed?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Johney. I’m glad to hear you’re feeling well overall, despite the cough and shortness of breath. It's good you’re being proactive about this. I’ll write you a prescription for the nicotine patches, and a handout with detailed instructions. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to assess your progress and adjust the dosage as needed. Here you are. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Remember, quitting smoking is a journey, and it's okay to have setbacks. The important thing is to keep trying, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Very good. I appreciate your support, Doctor. And I will keep your number handy, should any questions arise. No, I believe that is all for today. Thank you for your time and your expertise. I shall follow your instructions carefully and report back in two weeks. I wish you a good day, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Johney. I wish you all the best on your journey. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a good day, too.
