DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get straight to it. It's… well, it's this. It's just… not right. Used to be a strong man, you know? Pile drivin’ ain’t for the weak. Now… look at it. It’s soft. And hangin’. I want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Right, right. I understand you want to get to the bottom of this quickly. “Soft and hangin’,” you say. Okay. And this has come on… recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Boy, it's been comin’ on for years! But it's worse now. Much worse. I ain’t askin’ for a miracle, just… somethin’ done about it. I don't need a lecture 'bout eatin' right, neither. I worked hard my whole life. Hard work built that, and somethin’ went wrong when I stopped.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. Years, gradually getting worse… and you’re not looking for a long discussion about lifestyle changes. Fair enough. Just want to figure out what’s going on. Now, when you say “worse now,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmmph. It's… looser. And it jiggles more. Used to be firm, like steel. Now it moves when I walk. And my clothes don't fit right anymore. I gotta buy bigger sizes. It's embarrassing, see? A man shouldn't be worryin' 'bout his belly hangin’ over his belt. And it makes me tired, just lookin' at it.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser, jiggling, clothes not fitting… and it’s affecting your energy levels. I understand. Now, have you noticed any pain or discomfort associated with this?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not pain. Just… annoyance. And it gets in the way. Bendin’ over is harder. And I ain’t as quick as I used to be. But no, no actual pain. It’s just… weak. Like somethin' inside gave out.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just a feeling of weakness and getting in the way. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What kinda question is that? Look, I came here 'bout this… Not my… insides. I don't need to be talkin' 'bout that with you. Are you gonna fix it or not? I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I apologize if my questions seem unrelated. It’s just that sometimes these things are connected. But we can certainly focus on what’s bothering you most. Let’s move on then. Have you noticed any hernias or bulges in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Hernias? Boy, you talkin’ in circles now! I don’t know nothin’ 'bout hernias! I work with steel and wood, not… bulges! Look, I just want this fixed. I don't need fancy words or questions 'bout what I eat or what's bulgin’ where. Can you cut it off or… tighten it or somethin’? Is that even possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler, I understand. You want to know if something can be done surgically. It may be an option, but we need to figure out what we’re dealing with first. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll just listen to your abdomen and feel around. It will give me a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don't be pokin' and proddin' too much. I ain't made o' glass. And I expect a straight answer when you're done. No more questions 'bout my… habits. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay… I’m feeling some… increased abdominal fat, as you’ve described. No obvious hernias. Your bowel sounds are present, although a little… diminished. And there’s some tenderness when I press here, on your lower abdomen. It doesn’t seem to be acute pain, but it's definitely there. I’m also noting some skin laxity. It seems like there's been a significant loss of muscle tone. Now, I want to be frank with you, Mr. Trendler. What you’re describing… and what I’m feeling… is consistent with age-related changes, combined with potentially some loss of muscle mass.
PATIENT: Age-related changes?! You think I don't know I'm gettin' old? I came here for a solution, not a lecture on the fact that time passes! Look, I worked hard my whole life, buildin' things, movin' things. I ain't just gonna sit here and accept "age-related changes"! There's gotta be somethin' you can do. A surgery? A… somethin’! Don’t tell me there’s nothin' you can do. I ain’t travelin’ all this way for nothin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, I understand your frustration. You're right, you didn't come here for a lecture. And you're absolutely right to want to explore all options. Surgery is a possibility, but it's not always the best solution, and it comes with risks. Before we even discuss surgery, I think it's important to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your muscle loss and abdominal discomfort. And I'd also recommend an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your abdominal wall and organs. That will help us determine if there's anything else going on, and whether or not surgery is a viable option. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Blood work and ultrasounds... more waitin', more pokin'. Fine. Do what you gotta do. But I ain’t got all day. And I want a clear explanation of everything. No fancy words. And I want to know, straight up, if surgery is gonna work. Don’t waste my time with maybes and could bes. Give it to me straight. And how long is all this gonna take?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Straight up. The blood work will give us a baseline and rule out any underlying issues. The ultrasound will show us the structure of your abdominal wall. Surgery is an option for removing excess fat and tightening the abdominal wall – a panniculectomy or abdominoplasty – but it’s not a quick fix. There are risks, like any surgery, including infection, bleeding, and scarring. And the results aren't guaranteed. It depends on your overall health, your skin elasticity, and several other factors. As for timing, the blood work can be done today. The ultrasound will likely take a few days to schedule, depending on availability. I’d say within a week or so we should have all the results. Then we can discuss your options in detail. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A week… A whole week. Fine. A week it is. But I expect a phone call as soon as those results are in. Don’t leave me waitin’ around. And make sure whoever's callin' knows what they're talkin' 'bout. No nurses explainin' fancy medical terms to me. I want to talk to you. Can you promise me that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I promise you that. I will personally review the results and call you as soon as they are available to discuss them. I won’t have a nurse relay information. You’ll be speaking directly with me. Now, do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Penicillin. Bad reaction to it. Makes me itch somethin' fierce and swell up. Other than that, no. I ain’t one for takin’ pills anyway. So, that's it then? Just wait for the phone call?
DOCTOR: Yes, for now, that’s it. Just wait for my call. I’ve made a note of your penicillin allergy. We've covered a lot today, Mr. Trendler. I understand your frustration and your desire for a solution. We’ll get to the bottom of this and discuss the best course of action once we have the results of the tests. Thank you for your patience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s it. I got things to do. Just call when you said you would. Don’t waste my time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I will. Have a good day. .
