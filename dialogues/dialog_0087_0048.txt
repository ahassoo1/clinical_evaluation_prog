DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s… difficult to explain. My wife, she keeps saying I’m not myself. Says I ask the same questions over and over, and… well, I just feel off sometimes. Like I’m looking for something I can’t quite place. It’s happening more often, you see. Not constantly, but enough to worry her – and, frankly, me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds concerning when your wife notices changes, and you’re feeling this way yourself. So, this feeling of being “off” and repeating questions... how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s not been sudden, you understand. It’s crept up on us. Maybe… six months now? It started with little things – forgetting where I put my tools, misplacing the remote. Nothing major. But it’s gotten… sharper, I suppose. More frequent. And the questions... I ask my wife what we’re having for dinner, then ask again five minutes later. Things like that. It's embarrassing, really. A man shouldn't forget things like that.
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon for these things to develop gradually, Mr. Lason, and it’s perfectly alright to feel embarrassed, but it’s good you’re addressing it. Six months is a reasonable timeframe to investigate. Besides the memory concerns and repeating questions, have you noticed any other changes – perhaps with your thinking, your mood, your ability to concentrate, or even changes in your sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Well… my sleep is… fitful. I wake up a lot. Not necessarily unable to go back to sleep, but… restless. And my temper. My wife says I snap at her more easily than I used to. Small things, mind you. She’ll ask me to do something, and I just… react. I don't mean to, but… it happens. Thinking… that’s harder to say. It’s not like I can’t think, but… things take longer. Like I'm wading through mud, you understand? And I get… frustrated easily when I can’t find the right word.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Lason. Those are all important details. The sleep disturbances, the increased irritability, and the difficulty with word-finding and concentration are all things we need to consider. Now, have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, weakness on one side of your body, or difficulty with balance or coordination?
PATIENT: No, no headaches. My vision is… well, it’s not what it used to be, but that’s just age, I figure. No weakness, and my balance is fine. I still work, you know. Tile setting isn’t easy on the knees, but I manage. I wouldn't be able to do it if I was falling all over the place. Coordination… no problems there either. I still enjoy a game of baklao with the boys when I can. It requires a steady hand, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And you mentioned tile setting – is your work currently demanding more effort or causing more difficulty than it used to?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is harder. It always is with age, but… lately, it's more than that. It takes me longer to plan out the designs, you know? The calculations… they don’t come as quickly. And I have to double-check my work more often. My apprentice, he's a good boy, very patient, but… I used to be able to do it all in my head, you know? Now, I need paper and pencil. It's… humbling.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That's very helpful information. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, my wife keeps after me to get my blood pressure checked, and the doctor always says it's a little high. He wants me to take pills, but I don’t like taking pills. I try to watch my salt, that’s what I do. No diabetes, no heart problems. Always been a strong man, until recently. I had malaria when I was younger, back in Cambodia, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… no. Nothing major. I broke my arm once, fell off a roof. But that healed just fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, and a past injury to your arm. No other significant medical history. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. I take a multi-vitamin sometimes, but that’s it. My wife gives it to me. She says I need it. I try to eat healthy. Mostly. She makes a good soup. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a small glass of beer with dinner if we’re celebrating something. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. My wife tried to give me some fancy fruit once, a mango, I think, but I didn't particularly like it. Not an allergy, just didn't care for the taste. She says I’m too stubborn for my own good. But no, no allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, a few questions about your family. Are there any family members—parents, siblings, or other close relatives—who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult question. My mother… she was a bit forgetful towards the end. But that was old age, I think. She lived a long life. My father… he was a strong man, always clear-headed. I don’t recall any siblings having similar problems. We weren’t particularly close, you see. Lost touch after we left Cambodia. My wife’s side… I don’t know much about her family history. We didn’t discuss it much. It’s… not something we talk about.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not always easy to have that information. Okay. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your current living situation and your social activities?
PATIENT: Well, I live with my wife, of course. In a small house in the suburbs. We’ve been here for many years. I still work, as I mentioned, but it's not as much as before. I used to go fishing with the boys every weekend, but my knees aren't what they used to be. I enjoy a game of baklao when I can, and we sometimes have family over for dinner. Nothing fancy. Mostly quiet. My wife keeps busy with her garden. She's a good woman, very patient with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. Based on what you’ve told me—the gradual onset of memory problems, the difficulty with concentration and word-finding, the sleep disturbances, and the increased irritability—it sounds like we need to investigate this further. While it could be a number of things, including normal age-related changes, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to start with a brief neurological exam and some cognitive testing today. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Neurological exam? Cognitive testing? Hmm. Sounds… serious. What exactly does that involve? I don't like tests. Always felt foolish during tests in school. But… if it’s to find out what's going on… yes, alright. Do what you need to do. Just… try not to make me look too foolish, if you can.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Lason. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. The neurological exam is just a quick check of your reflexes, strength, sensation, and coordination. The cognitive testing involves some simple questions and tasks to assess your memory, thinking skills, and language abilities. It's not meant to be a graded test like in school, it’s simply to get a baseline understanding of your current function. It will take about 20-30 minutes. We can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Would you like me to explain a little more about what each part involves before we begin?
PATIENT: No, no. I trust you, Doctor. Just… get on with it. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better. I don't need a long explanation. I'm a practical man. Just tell me what to do. And please, try to be quick. My knees are already aching.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. As you wish. Let’s begin with the neurological exam. If you could just follow my instructions, and don’t hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. First, could you please sit comfortably back in the chair and relax your arms by your sides…
PATIENT: Alright. Get on with it then. I'm ready. Or as ready as I’ll be, I suppose. Just... don't poke me too hard.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I won’t. First, I'm going to test your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed. I'll be tapping on your tendons with this small hammer. This will check your nerve function. …Okay, good. And now the other side. … Good. Both reflexes are present and symmetrical. Now, could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that tight enough? I used to be very strong. Worked with stone, you know. Requires a good grip.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Lason. Excellent grip strength. And now, I'm going to test your sensation. Please close your eyes. I’m going to gently touch different parts of your arms and legs with this cotton ball. Tell me when you feel it. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes. I feel it. Right there. A little… ticklish, perhaps. But I feel it.
DOCTOR: …Okay, good. And now the other side. …Yes, good. Sensation is intact on both sides. Finally, I’m going to check your coordination. Could you please reach out and touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? I haven’t done this since… well, I can’t remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine, Mr. Lason. A little slow, but coordinated. Okay. That completes the neurological exam. Now we'll move on to the cognitive testing. This will involve some questions about your memory and some simple tasks. Are you ready?
PATIENT: As I’ll ever be, I suppose. Get on with it. The sooner this is over, the better. Don’t expect miracles, though. My mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’re just gathering information, Mr. Lason. No pressure at all. Alright, let's start with your short-term memory. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Can you do that?
PATIENT: Three words. Alright. Go ahead. I’ll try my best. But don’t blame me if I forget them.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me, please?
PATIENT: Apple… table… and… um… Penny! Yes. Apple, table, penny. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Mr. Lason. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your current date and location. What is today’s date, to the best of your knowledge?
PATIENT: Today… hmm. Let me think… It’s… August, isn't it? The second of August? Yes. The second of August, 20… 2024? Or is it 2025? I always get those numbers mixed up. 2025, I think. Yes. August the second, 2025.
DOCTOR: That's close enough, Mr. Lason. And do you know where you are right now?
PATIENT: Where… where am I? This is… a doctor’s office, isn’t it? Yes. A doctor’s office. In… the suburbs. Somewhere in the suburbs. I… I don’t know the exact name of the place. My wife always drives.
DOCTOR: That's alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to perform a simple calculation. Can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: One hundred… ninety-three… eighty-six… seventy-nine… Seventy-two… I… I can’t do it. It’s too hard. I’m terrible at numbers. Always have been.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Lason. It's a challenging task. Now, I'm going to ask you to recall those three words I asked you to repeat earlier – apple, table, and penny. Can you tell me what those words were?
PATIENT: Words… words… I… I had three words… Apple… yes, I remember apple. And… and… I can't remember the others. I'm sorry. They've vanished.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Lason. Don't worry about it. We've gathered enough information for now. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on the neurological exam and the cognitive testing, you are experiencing some difficulties with short-term memory, calculation, and recall. This warrants further investigation. I’d like to order some blood work and a brain MRI to help determine the cause of these difficulties. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… and a brain MRI… More tests… It sounds serious, Doctor. Very serious. Well… if it’s to find out what’s going on… yes, alright. Do what you need to do. But… please, try not to find anything too terrible. My wife… she’d be devastated.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. We’ll take things one step at a time. The MRI and blood work will help us understand what's going on and determine the best course of action. I will also refer you to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. Their expertise will be invaluable in this process. I’ll have my nurse schedule these tests for you. She'll also provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for them. Are you currently taking any medications that I should be aware of before I write the orders?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Just that multi-vitamin my wife gives me. Every morning. She says it's good for the brain. But that’s it. Nothing else. I don't like taking pills, Doctor. Always make me feel sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. I will write the orders for the blood work and MRI, and the nurse will contact you to schedule the appointments. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as headaches, weakness, vision changes, or difficulty with speech, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Just… what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it… something bad? Is it… the beginning of the end? My wife… she worries so much. I don't want to worry her.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, it’s too early to say definitively what’s going on. These symptoms can be caused by a number of things, some of which are very treatable. It could be a vitamin deficiency, a side effect of medication – although you don’t take any – or something else entirely. We need the results of the blood work and MRI to get a clearer picture. I know this is worrying for you and your wife, but we're going to investigate this thoroughly and develop a plan to address whatever the cause may be. It's important not to jump to conclusions. We’ll take it one step at a time. And remember, we’re here to support you both. Do you want me to have my nurse go over some resources for patients with memory concerns or their caregivers?
PATIENT: Resources… no, thank you. Not yet. My wife… she'd figure it out. She always does. Just… get the tests done quickly, Doctor. Please. I want to know what’s going on. And… thank you. For not dismissing me. Some doctors… they just tell you it’s old age.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lason. I assure you, we’ll get the tests scheduled as quickly as possible. My nurse will contact you today to arrange everything. And if you have any questions or concerns at all, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. We're here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s all. Thank you again. For everything. I hope… I hope it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: We’ll do everything we can to find out, Mr. Lason. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
PATIENT: .
