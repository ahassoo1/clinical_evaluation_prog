DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. You’re looking…thin. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, I suppose. And yes, I am rather lean, it’s a family thing. Look, it’s probably nothing, honestly. My mother… she had a lot of health problems. A lot. And my grandfather, same deal. I just want to make sure I'm not heading down that path, you know? Preventative stuff. It’s better to be safe than sorry, even if it is probably all in my head.
DOCTOR: “Probably all in your head,” hmm?
PATIENT: Exactly. My sister keeps saying I worry too much. She’s the practical one. Always has been. But she didn't have to watch… never mind. It's just, I'd rather know if there’s something brewing, even if it means hearing bad news. You understand, right? It's about control. Or, regaining some, at least.
DOCTOR: Control, yes. A very…western concept. Alright, let's not get philosophical. You mentioned a family history. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Okay, well… my mother had, let's see… heart problems, mostly. A lot of chest pain, shortness of breath. She ended up needing a… a procedure, a few years before she passed. And my grandfather… he had diabetes, I think? And something with his kidneys. It was all very… complicated. My aunt handled most of the medical stuff. I just remember a lot of hospital visits and hushed conversations. Honestly, I wouldn’t even know where to begin listing everything. It’s just…a lot of illness, running on both sides of the family. Is that helpful? Or am I rambling?
DOCTOR: “A lot of illness” is…not a diagnosis, Mr. Theriot. But it's a start. Chest pain and shortness of breath...was that all her symptoms?
PATIENT: No, no, there was… swelling. In her legs, mostly. And she got tired very easily. Like, couldn’t walk up a flight of stairs without needing a rest. And towards the end… she had trouble breathing even when she was sitting still. Honestly, it wasn’t pretty. She tried… different medications, I think. But nothing seemed to really help for very long. Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? I’m just trying to remember what I saw. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t really paying attention to the details back then. I was… busy. With school.
DOCTOR: Busy, yes. Understandable. Swelling in the legs is…significant. And the trouble breathing… Alright. Let's talk about you. Have you experienced any of those symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, thankfully, no. Not exactly. I get tired sometimes, of course. Who doesn’t? But it’s just… normal tiredness. I work long hours. And, honestly, I don’t get a lot of sleep. I worry. It keeps me up. But no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no swelling. I’ve noticed… I guess I’ve been a little more thirsty lately. And I seem to be going to the bathroom more often. But that could just be the water I’m drinking. I’ve been trying to drink more water. You know, stay hydrated. It’s a healthy habit. Is that even worth mentioning? I feel like I'm just grasping at straws here.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst and frequent urination… that is worth mentioning. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Well, my appetite has been… off. Not that I've got no appetite, it’s just… erratic. Some days I can eat a horse, other days I barely touch my food. And as I said before, I’m already pretty lean, so losing weight would be… concerning. I haven’t actually weighed myself recently, to be honest. I avoid scales. They just make me feel worse. But I think… yes. I think I’ve lost a little bit of weight. It’s probably nothing noticeable, but… my clothes feel a little looser, if that makes sense. And I’ve been trying to eat healthier, cutting back on sweets. Which… might explain it. Or maybe it's all just my imagination. I really don't know. Honestly, I just want to know if I’m going to end up like my mother. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: A fair question, Mr. Theriot. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Then we can talk about some blood tests to get a clearer picture. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… good. A physical exam sounds perfectly sensible. Blood tests, too. Anything to… put my mind at ease. Or at least, understand what’s going on. Please, go ahead. The sooner we get this sorted, the better. And… thank you. For listening, I mean. It’s… a relief to finally talk about it.
DOCTOR: Good. Let's begin. Please have a seat, and we'll start with your blood pressure. 120 over 80. Normal. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again…
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… and exhale. Is that alright? Am I doing it right? I always feel a little self-conscious doing this. It’s probably silly. I just want to make sure I'm not… messing it up.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds…regular. No murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear…but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Not alarming, could be due to your build. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Relax your legs for me... Patellar reflexes are present and symmetrical. Good. Any history of numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Everything feels… normal. I mean, as normal as it ever does. I do get occasional headaches, but I think those are just from stress. Long hours, staring at a computer screen… the usual. And sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but that's probably just my eyes. I really need to get a new prescription. Honestly, I'm a mess of minor ailments. It's probably nothing to worry about. I just have a tendency to overthink things.
DOCTOR: Headaches and blurry vision… noted. Let’s get those blood tests done. I’ll order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a fasting glucose level. We'll also check your kidney function and thyroid levels. Does that sound comprehensive enough?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Comprehensive enough is good. Whatever you think is necessary, really. I trust your judgment. It’s just… the waiting. That's the hard part, isn't it? Waiting for the results. I always imagine the worst-case scenario. But I suppose that’s just me. So, where do I go to get these tests done? And how long will it take to get the results back? Do I need to fast beforehand? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, fasting is required for the glucose level. Twelve hours with nothing but water. I’ll give you a requisition form for the lab at St. Luke’s. The results typically take 24-48 hours. The nurse will call you with the results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try not to worry. Though I understand that's easier said than done. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you… for listening, and for being so patient. I tend to ramble, I know. And… for not dismissing my concerns outright. Some doctors just brush you off. I appreciate your thoroughness. I’ll get those tests done as soon as possible. Hopefully, it’s nothing. But at least I’ll know, right?
DOCTOR: .
