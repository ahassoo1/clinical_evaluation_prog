DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah, hi. My nails. They… they just look funny. Not good funny. They changed. I don't really... remember when exactly, just that they're different now. It bothers me, okay?
DOCTOR: Different how, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Ugh. Hard to say. Like… the color, I guess? Not… pink anymore. More… yellowish. And kinda thick. Not like, really thick, but… not normal. I do my nails myself, usually, but I couldn't get them to look right this time. It's annoying, really. I use that polish, the sparkly one. You know, the kind with the little stars?
DOCTOR: And this change in color and thickness… has it been gradual, or did it appear suddenly?
PATIENT: Suddenly, I think. Or… maybe not super sudden. But I noticed it after I used that new bottle of sparkly polish. The old one ran out, and I got a new one at… the store. You know, the one by the bakery. It looked the same, but… maybe it wasn't? I dunno. Honestly, I don't pay attention to those things. I just like sparkly nails.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain or discomfort in your nails or the surrounding skin?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. Maybe a little… sensitive. Like, if I bump them. But not like, ouch pain. Just… a little tender. It's more the way they look, honestly. It’s just… not right. I used to have nice nails.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Hmm. Not that I know of. I get a little tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, right? And my knees ache a bit in the winter. But that's just old age, I think. I get Medicare, so I guess if I had something serious they woulda told me, right? I don't really go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes I take something for my knees when they really bother me. It’s… that orange bottle. Ibuprofen, I think? And sometimes, when I can't sleep, I take something... the little purple pills. My neighbor gave them to me. She said they were good. I don't take them every night, though. Just when I really need to.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I need you to be completely honest with me. What exactly are these "purple pills"?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… I don't remember the name. Just… purple. Small. They help me sleep. She said they were… something for anxiety. I get a little worried sometimes, you know? About things. It's been a while since I asked her what they were, though. She's a nice lady. Brings me cookies sometimes.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, are you allergic to any medications or substances?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat all kinds of things. Spicy food, everything. Never had a problem. Except… once, I used a new hand lotion, and my skin got kinda itchy. But that was just the lotion, I think. It smelled funny, too. Lavender, maybe? I threw it away. Doesn't really count as an allergy, does it? It just made me uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. I'm going to take a closer look at your nails and your hands. Could you please extend your hands, palms up?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here.
DOCTOR: Nails: Yellowish discoloration noted bilaterally. Subtle longitudinal ridging present. Nail beds appear mildly thickened. Capillary refill delayed at approximately 3 seconds. No significant tenderness to palpation. Skin surrounding nails unremarkable. I also note that there is a faint odor. There's a mild, unusual odor present. It's difficult to describe… slightly fungal, perhaps. Ms. Thut, have you noticed any changes in the texture or thickness of your skin elsewhere on your body?
PATIENT: Odor? I didn't notice any odor. I do use that hand cream sometimes, the one with the coconut smell. Maybe that's it? And texture… hmm. My skin gets kinda dry in the winter, but that’s normal, right? I use lotion. Always lotion. I don't think I've noticed anything else. Except… maybe my feet feel a little rough, sometimes. But I wear socks. And shoes. Always shoes.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I’d like to order a few tests to help determine the cause of the changes in your nails. We'll need a fungal culture of your nails to rule out a fungal infection. And I'd also like a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh. Okay. Sounds… complicated. But… yeah, sure. If it helps my nails, I guess. Will it hurt? I don't like needles. And will it cost a lot? My Medicare… it doesn’t cover everything, you know.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will involve a small needle prick, but it should be relatively quick and painless. We'll take a small sample of blood from your arm. As for the cost, I'll have the billing department verify your Medicare coverage and any potential out-of-pocket expenses. We'll make sure you're aware of the costs before proceeding. The fungal culture involves gently scraping a small sample from your nail. It doesn't hurt, either. I think these tests are important, Ms. Thut, to get a clear understanding of what’s going on and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. Would you like me to have the lab draw the blood now, or would you prefer to schedule it for another day?
PATIENT: Now? Oh. Uh… I guess now. If it has to be done. I don’t like waiting, and I’m already here. But… promise it won’t hurt too much? And can I have a cookie after? I'm kinda hungry.
DOCTOR: It will be a quick prick, Ms. Thut, and the discomfort is minimal. The phlebotomist is very experienced. And… I can't promise a cookie, unfortunately. But perhaps the nurse has a granola bar or something similar?
PATIENT: A granola bar… okay. That’s okay. Better than nothing. Just… be quick, okay? And don't poke me too much.
