DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… a check-up, I think? Something about needing clearance for… work. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. The theater called, said I needed to come in. Been doing this a long time, you see. Ushers, mostly. Lobby stuff. Ticket taking. I mostly just want to get it over with, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Krahn. A work clearance check-up. We can certainly do that. It is good to be proactive. I see here you’re 69 years old. And you mentioned working at the theater… ushering, ticket taking. Have you been feeling any particular symptoms or having any health concerns that prompted the theater to ask for this clearance, or is this just a routine thing?
PATIENT: Routine, I think. Though… my memory isn’t what it used to be. No, no particular symptoms… aches and pains, you know, for a man my age. Nothing I haven’t gotten used to. Honestly, I probably should have seen someone sooner, but… well, life gets in the way. Divorced, you see. Not insured. It’s… complicated. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. Life is complicated, and it’s very good you’re taking care of this now. And no, we'll try to keep this as efficient as possible. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about any past medical conditions you’ve had?
PATIENT: Past conditions… Oh dear. That’s a tough one. I had… something with my stomach, years ago. Ulcers, maybe? I was quite young then. And I broke my arm once, falling off a bicycle. That’s about all I can recall, truthfully. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly… not for a long, long time. Is that bad? I'm really drawing a blank here.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Krahn. Don’t worry about recalling everything perfectly. We’ll do our best to piece things together. A history of a stomach issue and a broken arm… that’s a good start. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I… don’t think so. Nothing major, at least. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, maybe? But that feels like a lifetime ago. And… oh! I had a mole removed from my back, years and years ago. A small one. Nothing serious, the doctor said at the time. Small, red, on my shoulder blade, I think. It's really… hazy. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s very common for details to become fuzzy over time. Tonsillectomy and a mole removal… we’re getting there. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he passed away when I was young. Heart problems, I think? But it was a long time ago, and I wasn't very involved with his medical affairs. My sister… she's still alive, thankfully. But we don’t talk much. I honestly couldn’t tell you if she has any health issues. We’re… estranged. It's difficult to recall. Sorry. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s helpful to know what you do recall, and it’s completely understandable that you may not have all the details. High blood pressure in your mother and potential heart problems in your father… that’s good information. Now, just to cover all bases, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not at all. I try to avoid them if I can. Just… a lot of tea, I suppose. Green tea. And… sometimes, I take a little something for my joints. An over-the-counter pain reliever, when they really bother me. But it’s infrequent. Very infrequent. Nothing regular. Mostly just trying to keep moving, you see. Keep the old bones greased, as it were.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for your joints. That’s good to know. Now, just one more quick set of questions before we move on to a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat most things. No known allergies to medications either. I’ve been lucky in that regard, I suppose. Though… I get a bit of a sniffle in the spring, with the pollen. But that's just seasonal, you see. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, seasonal allergies, no known serious allergies. That’s helpful. Now, Mr. Krahn, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a general look around. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, as they say. The quicker the better. I have… things to do, you see. Though, I can’t quite recall what they are. Just… please be quick?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. We'll be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 85. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Your heart sounds… a bit regular, though I do hear a slight murmur. Not terribly concerning, but worth noting. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for someone your age. Alright, Mr. Krahn. Everything seems generally okay, but we did find a slightly elevated blood pressure and a murmur. Do you have any history of feeling short of breath, or experiencing any chest pain?
PATIENT: Short of breath? No, no. Not recently. Chest pain… occasionally, a little discomfort. But I put that down to… old age, you see. A bit of indigestion, maybe? It comes and goes. Nothing I’ve ever bothered a doctor about. It’s just… a fleeting thing. And I try not to overexert myself, you see. Take things easy. Is that something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re aware of it, Mr. Krahn. Because you’re experiencing chest discomfort, even if it’s fleeting, and we found a murmur, I think it would be prudent to do a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’d like to order an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, and a basic blood panel to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. We should also do a chest X-ray to get a look at your lungs and heart structure. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh dear. More tests. I suppose… if you think it’s necessary. I just… don’t like being poked and prodded, you see. And I don’t have much money, if I’m honest. Can’t afford a lot of fancy tests. But if it’s important… I’ll manage. What does it cost? And how long will it take? I really need to know. This theater job… it’s not guaranteed, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. I wouldn’t recommend these tests if they weren’t important. Let me explain what each one involves. The EKG is quick and painless – just some stickers on your chest. The blood panel will require a small sample of blood, and the chest X-ray is a quick scan. Regarding cost, I realize you mentioned financial constraints. I'll write the orders and we can explore options with our billing department. They have programs to assist patients without insurance, and we can discuss payment plans. We can also prioritize the most essential tests first, the EKG and blood panel, and defer the chest X-ray if necessary. The EKG and blood panel results usually take 24-48 hours. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the next steps. Would you like me to proceed with ordering those two tests for now?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, let’s just do the two. The EKG and the blood work. That sounds… manageable. And please, talk to the billing department. I really can’t afford a big bill. This theater job… it's all I have right now. Thank you, Doctor. For being understanding. It’s… it’s difficult, being older and… alone. Just trying to keep things going, you see. When can I schedule the tests? And where do I go?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I understand completely. We’ll do everything we can to make this as easy as possible. I'll have the lab draw the blood for you right here in the clinic, so you don't have to go anywhere for that. They’re open until 5 pm today. I’ll give you a requisition form now. Then, you’ll go down the hall to the radiology department for the EKG. They'll schedule you for a time that works for you. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, come in to explain the paperwork and answer any questions you have about the tests. We'll get this all arranged for you. Let me just write these orders quickly... And we'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results, once they're available. How does next Wednesday sound?
PATIENT: Wednesday… yes, that should work. Next Wednesday. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you to… Sarah, was it? I think… I think that’s all I can manage for today. It’s been… a lot. Perhaps I’ll go home and have a cup of tea. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. Sarah will be right in to assist you. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And yes, a cup of tea sounds like a very good idea. Take care, and we'll see you next Wednesday.
