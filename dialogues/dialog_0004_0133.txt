DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s Melvenia, please. And honestly? Just need some papers signed. Some health forms… for a little thing. I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: "Papers signed," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. They sent me here… said I needed a notary, or someone official to… verify them? I don’t really understand all the paperwork these days. It’s for a program… something about getting a little help with… well, never you mind. Just need it signed, if that’s alright. Is that something you do here?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, while I am a physician, simply "signing papers" isn’t precisely what we do here. It sounds like you need documentation completed for a social services program, and I need to understand what I’m verifying before I can even consider assisting you. What program is this for, and what specifically do they require me to attest to?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I didn’t mean to put you on the spot. It’s… it’s a program for seniors, helps with some monthly expenses. It's called “Golden Years Assistance,” I think? And the forms… well, they want you to confirm I am who I say I am, and that… that I have some health concerns that qualify me. That’s all I know, honestly. They just said a doctor needed to sign. I’m sorry, I'm not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: “Golden Years Assistance.” Right. While I appreciate you clarifying, Ms. Tippens, simply stating you "have some health concerns" isn't sufficient for medical documentation. I need details. What specific health concerns are we discussing?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… my arthritis, mostly. It’s in my hands and knees, makes it awful hard to get around. And… my blood pressure’s been a bit high, they told me at the clinic down the street. Nothing serious, mind you. Just… old age, I suppose. Is that enough? I really don’t want to bother you with all this, Doctor. It’s just a formality, I thought.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and hypertension. And you said the clinic down the street diagnosed the hypertension?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Small clinic, just a quick check-up. They gave me a number and said to watch my salt intake. Honestly, I don’t even remember the exact number, it was a while ago. I just… I'm trying to get this assistance, and they need a doctor’s signature. It’s all very confusing. Do you think you can just… sign it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I cannot ethically “just sign” a medical form without a proper assessment. That would be irresponsible. I need to gather a more detailed medical history to accurately attest to your condition. Let's start with your arthritis. How long have you been experiencing arthritis symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it's been… years, dear. Probably ten years, maybe more? It started with just a little stiffness in my hands, but it's gotten worse over time. Now it aches all the time, especially in the cold. Makes it hard to even open jars. It’s just… a part of getting old, I figured. Never really did anything about it besides take some over-the-counter pain relievers.
DOCTOR: And what about your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, the blood pressure… it was just one reading, really. I went to that little clinic, and they said it was a bit high. I think the nurse said something about 140 over… something? Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. I don't remember the exact number, and I haven't been back since. I've been feeling fine, mostly. Just a little tired sometimes.
DOCTOR: "Feeling fine" isn't a diagnosis, Ms. Tippens. And a single blood pressure reading from ten years ago is insufficient to assess your current cardiovascular health. I’m going to need to take your blood pressure now. And I’ll need to ask you some questions about your medical history, medications, and any other symptoms you’re experiencing. We’re going to have to do a brief physical exam, I’m afraid. If you'll please follow me.
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I suppose that’s fair. I was hoping to just… get this paperwork signed. I didn't want to take up your time with a whole examination. But… if that's what you need. I do get cold easily, just so you know. And my knees ache when I stand for too long.
DOCTOR: Please sit. And yes, I'm aware of your reported symptoms; that’s precisely why a physical assessment is necessary. First, let's take your blood pressure. Please remain still and don't speak. 158 over 92. Hmm. That is elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply. Heart sounds are normal, but there is some mild wheezing in the lungs. Do you have a history of asthma or chronic bronchitis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Wheezing? I didn't know I was wheezing. No, dear, no asthma or bronchitis. Never been diagnosed with either one. I used to get a little cough in the winter, but that was just the cold. I do get a little short of breath sometimes, especially when I climb the stairs, but I figured that was just getting old and being out of shape. I haven’t been very active lately. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: “Just getting old” isn’t a diagnosis, Ms. Tippens. Shortness of breath and wheezing require investigation. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked, and it gave her such trouble. I always stayed far away from them. No, I haven't smoked, and I don't go around people who do either. Is something wrong? You seem… concerned.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I'm concerned because your blood pressure is significantly elevated, and you're exhibiting signs of respiratory distress. Ignoring these issues is not an option. We need to rule out more serious underlying conditions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… I think I had a little rash once after taking some… some pink pill. It was a long time ago, and I can't remember what it was for. Just a little itchy rash. It went away on its own. Nothing serious, really. I haven't taken much medication lately. Just some over-the-counter pain relievers for my arthritis. Are you saying I'm sick?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I am saying that you require further evaluation. And "further evaluation" begins with a thorough medication list. What exactly are you taking for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, mostly just ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. Sometimes naproxen if the ibuprofen doesn't work. I try not to take too much, because I've heard it's bad for your stomach. And sometimes I take some… some vitamin D, because the doctor down the street said I was low on it. But that’s about it. Just the basics. I don't like taking a lot of pills, you know? Is this going to take much longer? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I understand your concerns, but rushing this assessment is not in your best interest. Ibuprofen and naproxen can interact with other medications and exacerbate underlying conditions, particularly with uncontrolled hypertension. I need to order some blood work and a chest X-ray. This will help me determine the cause of your respiratory symptoms and assess your overall health. We also need to establish a baseline for your kidney function. Do you have a primary care physician I can contact?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work and an X-ray? This is getting to be a lot. No, dear, I don't have a regular doctor. I just go to that little clinic down the street when I need something. They don't really… keep track of things. I just wanted a signature on this form, you know? So I could get some help. This is… more complicated than I thought. I don’t know if I can afford all this, either. I’m not on Medicare, and I don't have much money.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I understand your financial concerns, and I will do my best to navigate available resources with you. However, proceeding with these tests is crucial to accurately assess your health and ensure you receive appropriate care. Ignoring these symptoms could have serious consequences. I will write the orders for the blood work and X-ray. The clinic has a social worker who can assist with financial assistance programs. I’ll have them contact you after we’re finished. As for the form… I cannot ethically sign it without a proper medical evaluation. We’re going to need to address your blood pressure and respiratory symptoms first.
PATIENT: Oh… So… you won’t sign the form? Even after all this? I really need that assistance, Doctor. I don’t know what I’m going to do if I don’t get it. I was counting on this. I just… I just want to be able to afford my medications and food. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, please don't cry. I understand your situation, and I wish I could simply sign the form and alleviate your worries. However, doing so would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. I am obligated to prioritize your health and well-being, and that requires a thorough assessment. While I cannot sign the form at this time, I can and will assist you in getting the care you need. I will personally speak with the social worker to expedite the financial assistance process. We’ll explore all available options to ensure you receive the medications and support you require. Think of these tests not as obstacles, but as steps towards a healthier future. And once we have a better understanding of your condition, we can revisit the possibility of documentation. Now, let's get those orders written, and I’ll have the social worker contact you immediately.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Tippens. The orders for the blood work and chest X-ray are sent. And I’ve made a note for the social worker to contact you this afternoon. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
