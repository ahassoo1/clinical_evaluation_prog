DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Press. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, but I have been noticing things. Little things, mostly. Things I…forget. It worries me, because my blood pressure is not good. I want to be clear, I remember what happened, but… recalling when it happened is becoming troublesome.
DOCTOR: Right. Troublesome recall, you say. And you’ve linked this to your blood pressure. Let's start with the memory issues. Could you give me a specific example of something you've forgotten recently?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It is a connection I am making, perhaps incorrectly. Hmm… let me think. Just yesterday, Mrs. Gable from the association, she visited about the garden club meeting. I know she spoke to me, I remember discussing the roses, but I cannot recall when precisely she came. Was it morning? Afternoon? Before lunch? After? It is… frustrating. I used to remember everything, Doctor. Everything.
DOCTOR: So, a difficulty with recent events, specifically pinpointing when things occurred. Not necessarily that they occurred, just the timing. And this is a change from how you usually are?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. A change. A very unsettling change. I manage many properties, you see. And the associations… keeping track of dates, meetings, who said what… it is all very important. Before, I could tell you the precise time of any conversation, any event. Now… it slips. Like sand through fingers. It is not a complete loss of memory, I assure you. I know what I did, just… not when.
DOCTOR: Right. And you mentioned this started recently?
PATIENT: Yes. Perhaps… three months ago? It began subtly, a misplaced appointment here, a forgotten time of a delivery there. I initially dismissed it as stress. But it has… escalated. It is becoming more frequent. More noticeable. It frightens me, Doctor. I am a very organized person, always have been. This… this feels like losing control.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Alvara. Losing your ability to recall things, especially when you've always been organized, is unsettling. We need to explore this further. Let’s talk about your blood pressure for a moment. How long have you been aware of having high blood pressure, and what, if anything, are you doing to manage it?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the blood pressure. It has been… approximately seven years now, since the doctor first told me. Seven years. I do not take medicine, Doctor. I try to watch my salt, eat healthy foods, and… well, I walk. I walk a great deal. But it has not improved, I fear. The numbers are always… elevated. I dislike medication, you see. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. But perhaps… perhaps it is time to reconsider.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said you walk a great deal. Approximately how much walking do you do in a typical week?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. It varies, depending on the weather and the association meetings. But… generally, I would say at least five days a week. And each walk is… perhaps one and a half hours? Two hours, on a good day. I enjoy it, you see. It helps me think. Although… lately, even that has been… difficult. I sometimes forget where I am walking to, if that makes sense. I have to concentrate very hard.
DOCTOR: So, regular exercise, but with some increasing difficulty concentrating even during the walks. Ms. Alvara, I'm going to ask a few more questions, just to get a fuller picture. Have you noticed any other changes in your memory or thinking, besides the difficulty with timing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Now that you mention it… sometimes, I struggle to find the correct word. It is on the tip of my tongue, I know what I mean to say, but the word… it eludes me. It is infrequent, but it is happening more often. And, recently, I’ve had difficulty with names. I meet people frequently, with the associations, and… I used to remember everyone's name immediately. Now, I must concentrate very hard, and sometimes… I simply cannot recall it. It is… humiliating. And frustrating. I am not a foolish woman. I pride myself on my intellect.
DOCTOR: Right. Difficulty finding words, trouble recalling names… These are all things we need to consider. Now, let’s briefly touch on other medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that have been diagnosed, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing diagnosed, thankfully. I have always been quite healthy, despite the blood pressure. I have occasional aches and pains, as one does at my age, but nothing… significant. My doctor always said my cholesterol was good, and I’ve never been tested for diabetes. I maintain a healthy weight, and I do not smoke. I did, however, lose my husband two years ago. A great shock, it was. Perhaps… perhaps the stress has affected me more than I realize.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult. Stress can certainly contribute to cognitive changes. Before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications at all – even over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. As I said, I prefer to avoid medication if possible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that is all. No herbal remedies, no pain relievers, nothing at all that is prescribed or… regular. Just the multivitamin, perhaps once a week. I always have believed in treating the body naturally, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Given your concerns about memory changes, the difficulty with word-finding and names, and your history of high blood pressure, I think it’s important we investigate this further. I’d like to conduct a brief cognitive assessment here in the office. It will involve some simple questions and tasks to evaluate your memory, attention, and language skills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it will help determine the cause, then yes, please. I am eager to understand what is happening. Although… I confess, I am a little nervous. It is frightening to think that my mind might… be failing. But if it can be fixed, then I am willing to do whatever is necessary. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Very good. It’s completely normal to feel anxious, Ms. Alvara. This assessment is simply a starting point to help us understand what’s going on. We'll start with some simple recall questions. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to remember them. Don’t repeat them back to me now, just try to hold them in your mind. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. Please, proceed. I will try my best. My mind is… perhaps a little preoccupied, but I will focus. Please tell me the words.
DOCTOR: Alright. The three words are: table, penny, orange. Remember those. Now, I’m going to ask you a few unrelated questions, then I'll ask you to recall those three words. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Table, penny, orange. I have them. Ask your questions. I will concentrate. It sounds… perfectly reasonable. I hope I do not disappoint.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Today is August 2nd, 2025. A Friday, I believe. A warm day, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very good. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: We are in your office, Doctor. At… Genna Press’s office, I believe. In the urban clinic, as I recall. A very… pleasant office, if I may say so. Comfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me what year the Titanic sank?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. Let me think… It was a long time ago. I believe… 1912? Yes, I am quite certain it was 1912. It was a terrible tragedy, as I recall from my history lessons. A very sad event. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall those three words I gave you earlier. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. Let me see… There was… a color, I think. And something… round. And… a piece of furniture, perhaps? Oh… this is most embarrassing. I seem to have… forgotten them already. Table… no. Penny… perhaps? And orange… yes, I think orange was one of them. But I cannot recall the others. I apologize, Doctor. This is… very unsettling.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Alvara. Don’t apologize. This is simply information that helps me assess what’s going on. You recalled orange correctly, and you were close with your guesses. Based on this brief assessment, and your reported difficulties with memory and concentration, I think it’s important we order some further testing. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. And given your concerns about cognitive changes, I’d also like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. Acceptable, yes, absolutely. If it will help determine the cause, then please proceed. An MRI… it sounds a little frightening, but I understand the necessity. I confess, I am very anxious to know what is happening. The uncertainty is… unbearable. Please, order the tests. I will do whatever is necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. I’m ordering those tests now. The lab results will take a few days, and scheduling the MRI will take a bit longer, perhaps a week or two, depending on availability. I’ll have my assistant schedule both for you before you leave. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a low-dose blood pressure medication to get that under control. It's a very mild medication, and we can adjust the dosage as needed. And I’m going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more in-depth cognitive evaluation. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A neurologist sounds… sensible. If you believe it is necessary, then please proceed with the referral. And the blood pressure medication… I suppose I must reconsider my stance. If it will improve my cognitive function, then yes, please prescribe it. I confess, I am… relieved you are taking this seriously. The uncertainty has been… overwhelming. Please, proceed with both the medication and the referral. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Here’s the prescription for the blood pressure medication – Lisinopril, 10mg, once daily. And here’s the referral to Dr. Anya Volkov, a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders. My assistant will schedule appointments for both before you leave. I want you to understand that these tests are just a starting point. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your cognitive changes. It could be something as simple as a Vitamin B12 deficiency, or it could be something more complex. But we’ll get to the bottom of it. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have covered everything… admirably. Lisinopril, and Dr. Volkov. My assistant will schedule the appointments. Thank you… sincerely. It is a relief to know someone is taking this seriously. The uncertainty… has been dreadful. I suppose… I just want my mind back. Thank you, Doctor Press. You have given me… a little hope.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Alvara. And you will have my full support every step of the way. We’ll get the answers we need, and we’ll develop a plan to address your concerns. My assistant, Sarah, is right outside. She’ll take care of the scheduling and answer any further questions you may have. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes to mind. Have a good day, Ms. Alvara, and try not to worry too much. We're here to help. .
