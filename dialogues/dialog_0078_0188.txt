DOCTOR: Good morning, Criston. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. I see here you’re 36 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Yes, 36. I… I come because my pee. It’s orange. Not normal color.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange-colored urine. That’s certainly something we should look into. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: How much water I drink? Is that what you want to know? I think… normal. Maybe two, three glasses a day. Not much, I know. But I don’t feel thirsty.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Criston. Two to three glasses a day is a bit lower than the recommended amount, but everyone's fluid needs are different. Okay, so let’s talk about the urine itself. Has the color been consistently orange, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly orange. Sometimes a little darker, sometimes a little lighter. But always not… normal yellow. Maybe a week now I see it like this. Before that, everything okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week of consistently orange urine, with some variation in shade. And before that, it was your usual yellow color?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Usual yellow. I don’t… I don’t know what to say. Is it bad? Should I be worried? I work with… with machines. Maybe something from work?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking, Criston. It’s definitely worth investigating. Orange urine can have several causes, and while it’s not always serious, we need to rule out anything concerning. The fact that you work with machines is good information – exposure to certain chemicals could be a factor. First, let's go through a bit more of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a fever or stomach upset?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No… how you say? Tummy problems. Everything okay. Maybe a little tired from work, but that is normal. Long hours, you know? I haven’t been sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent illness. Just tiredness from work. That's good to know. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No pain. No burning. Nothing like that. Just… the color. It’s strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in how often you’re urinating, or any difficulty starting or stopping the flow?
PATIENT: No changes, Doctor. Same as always. I go… normal times. No problem start, no problem stop. Everything regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t like to take pills if I can help it. Maybe sometimes… pain killer for my back, but not now. Not for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or recent painkiller use. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I eat everything. Never had a problem. My wife, she has… she has a little trouble with some fruits, but I am okay.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Do any of your close family members—parents, siblings—have any medical conditions, particularly kidney problems, liver problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My father… he had problems with his sugar. Diabetes, I think you say? Yes, he needed pills for that. My mother, she was okay. Healthy, very healthy. My sister, she is fine too. No problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father had diabetes, but your mother and sister are healthy. That's good to know. Finally, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I work, Doctor. Long hours. I come home, I eat with my wife. I watch some TV. Sometimes I fix things around the house. Not much… exciting.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fairly routine lifestyle. That's perfectly alright. Now, I'd like to take a quick look at you, if you don't mind. Just a basic exam, checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Then I'll order a urine test to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is okay. Whatever you need. I want to know what is wrong with my pee.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll get started. I’m going to start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not overly concerning. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your abdomen feels soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Everything seems normal there as well. Now, we will need a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup, and I’ll explain the collection process.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. No pain, everything okay. A urine sample… yes. Show me how. I want to do it right.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's a sterile cup. It’s very important to collect a “clean catch” sample. This means you'll want to start urinating into the toilet for a few seconds, then collect the midstream portion of your urine in this cup. Don’t touch the inside of the cup. Once you’ve collected enough—about two to four ounces—you can finish urinating in the toilet. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Midstream… okay. Start, then… collect in the middle. No touch the cup. Is right? I think… I understand. Two to four ounces. That is… a little bit.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly right. Start urinating into the toilet for a few seconds, collect a small amount—a couple of ounces—in the cup, and finish urinating in the toilet. It doesn't need to be a large amount, just enough to get a good sample. Take your time, and let me know if you have any trouble. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will try.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Criston. Now, I’ll send this off to the lab. The results should be back within a few hours. While we’re waiting, we can discuss what the potential causes of orange urine could be. It can be caused by dehydration, certain medications, or even certain foods, like beets. However, it can also be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a liver problem or a urinary tract infection. That's why it’s important to get it checked out. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Beets? I eat beets sometimes. My wife makes a salad. So… maybe that? That would be good. Liver… that sounds bad. I don't want liver problem. Infection… I don’t feel sick.
DOCTOR: It’s definitely possible it could be the beets, Criston. They contain a pigment that can cause urine to turn orange or reddish. It’s more common than people think. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, which is why we’re running the test. You’re right to be concerned about liver problems and infections; those are more serious causes. But let's not jump to conclusions until we have the results. We'll start with the simplest explanations first. While we wait for the lab, is there anything else you’ve noticed—any changes in your stool, any abdominal pain, any fever or chills—that you haven't mentioned yet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Everything normal. Stool… regular. No pain in tummy. No fever. Everything the same. Maybe… maybe a little more tired than usual. But I work very long hours. So… maybe that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little more tired than usual, but likely related to your work schedule. That's helpful to know. Now, while we're waiting for the results, I want to reassure you that we're taking this seriously. If the tests come back with anything concerning, we'll discuss it thoroughly and come up with a plan to address it. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids—at least eight glasses of water a day—to stay hydrated. Avoid beets for a day or two and see if that makes a difference in your urine color. We’ll review the results together and determine the next steps once they come back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Eight glasses… I will try. No beets… okay. Thank you. I hope it is just the beets. That would be easy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Criston. We're hoping for the simplest explanation as well. Okay, it looks like the results are back. The urine analysis shows a slightly elevated level of urobilinogen, and there's a trace amount of blood present. The rest of the results are within normal limits. The elevated urobilinogen could indicate a mild liver issue, or it could be related to dehydration. The trace amount of blood is small enough that it could be due to minor irritation, but we need to investigate further. Given these results, I recommend a follow-up appointment with a gastroenterologist. They can perform additional tests to rule out any liver problems and determine the cause of the blood in your urine. Would you like me to help you schedule an appointment?
PATIENT: Gastro… what? Liver problems… Additional tests…? Yes, Doctor. Please. Help me schedule the appointment. I don’t want problems with my liver.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Criston. A gastroenterologist is a doctor who specializes in the digestive system, including the liver, stomach, and intestines. They will likely order some blood tests and possibly an ultrasound or other imaging scans to get a better look at your liver. Okay, I’ve found Dr. Anya Sharma. She has excellent reviews and is accepting new patients. She has an opening on August 12th. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: August 12th… yes. That is okay. Please, schedule the appointment for me, Doctor. Thank you for helping me.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Alright, you're all set. Your appointment with Dr. Sharma is scheduled for August 12th at 2:00 PM. I’ll send the lab results to her office, and they’ll likely contact you to confirm the appointment and provide any instructions you need to follow before your visit. In the meantime, continue drinking plenty of fluids, avoid beets, and if you experience any new symptoms, such as abdominal pain, jaundice , or fever, please contact me or go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is everything. Thank you very much for your help. I feel… less worried now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Criston. I'm glad I could help. It's good that you came in to get this checked out. Remember, we’re taking a cautious approach, and we'll get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your appointment with Dr. Sharma. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
