DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… My tummy feels… big. And I don’t want much food these days. Not like before. It just doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, “big tummy” and not feeling hungry… and it just doesn’t feel right. I understand. That’s a good starting point. To help me understand a little better, could you tell me how long you've been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long? That’s… a good question. Maybe… a few weeks? Or maybe longer. Time goes so fast, you know? It feels like it’s been a little while, but I couldn’t say exactly. I just noticed it when my clothes started feeling… tighter.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be hard to keep track. A few weeks, or longer, and noticing your clothes feeling tighter. Okay. Has anything specific changed around the time you started noticing this – any changes in your diet, activity level, or anything else that comes to mind?
PATIENT: Changes…? Well, I haven’t been walking as much. My legs… they get tired easily now. And… I mostly eat soup these days. It’s easier. Not much else, I don’t think. I used to… I used to do so much, but… it’s all a bit fuzzy now. I’m sorry, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Soila. It’s very common for memory to change as we get older, and you’re doing great just telling me what you can remember. So, less walking, mostly soup… and you’ve noticed some changes in your memory. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the feeling of fullness and decreased appetite?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… sometimes I feel a little… tired. More tired than usual, I mean. And… I think I’ve been going to the bathroom more often. But… maybe that’s just old age! It’s hard to say, isn’t it? Everything feels a bit… off.
DOCTOR: You've mentioned increased tiredness and going to the bathroom more frequently. Okay. When you say "more frequently", can you tell me roughly how often you're going compared to, say, a month or two ago?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a difficult question. I used to… I used to go maybe two or three times a day. Now… now it feels like every few hours. It’s not painful, just… more often. And I have to get up in the night sometimes too. It's a bother, really. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things. I don’t want to be a nuisance.
DOCTOR: You're not a nuisance at all, Soila. It’s important to give me as much information as you can, and you're doing a wonderful job. So, increased frequency to every few hours, including waking up at night. Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…? Oh dear… I used to… I used to have trouble with my heart, I think. A long time ago. But the doctor said it was okay then. And… my knees, they ache. But everyone’s knees ache when they get old, don’t they? I don’t think… I don’t think I have anything serious. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. .
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of some heart trouble in the past, and knee pain. We'll make a note of those. And you feel, overall, you've been pretty healthy. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
