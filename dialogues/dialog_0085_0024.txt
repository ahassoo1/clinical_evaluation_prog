DOCTOR: Hello, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Lahn, it’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly, actually. It’s for… well, a trip I’m planning. It's a bit complicated, but they need official confirmation from a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A letter for fitness to fly. That’s perfectly reasonable. To write that letter accurately, I’ll need a little more information from you. First, let’s start with the basics. Do you have any current medical conditions – anything at all that a doctor should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Not really, no. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, maybe 2022, but I recovered fully. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy. I take a daily vitamin, that’s it. Oh, and… my husband passed away last year. It was… sudden. I’m still processing, but physically, I’m okay.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Kiante. That must have been incredibly difficult. It’s good to know you’re doing okay physically, though. Pneumonia in 2022 - do you recall if you needed to be hospitalized, or was it treated at home?
PATIENT: It was at home, thankfully. My doctor at the time – Dr. Enkhjargal – he came to the house. I had a pretty bad cough and a fever for a while, but I didn't need to go to the hospital. I just rested and took the antibiotics he prescribed. He’s retired now, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, pneumonia treated at home with antibiotics in 2022, fully recovered. And no other ongoing medical conditions. Just to be thorough, are you currently experiencing any symptoms at all – things like shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or any unusual fatigue?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? And… well, traveling is tiring in itself, I suppose. But no, no new or unusual symptoms. I’m feeling alright, actually. I just want to get this letter and get on with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. And just a few more questions to cover all bases. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach. I haven’t had a reaction to anything in my life, as far as I know. It’s one less thing to worry about, right?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent! Okay, and are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements – besides the daily vitamin you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just the vitamin. Nothing else. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. I figure a good diet and enough sleep are better than anything you can get in a bottle. Is this taking long? I have a bit of a schedule today.
DOCTOR: No, we’re almost finished with the questions! I just want to be sure I have all the necessary information. Okay, last few things. Do you have any family history of serious medical conditions, like heart problems, lung disease, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My father had high blood pressure, I think. And… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had diabetes. But that's about it, as far as I know. No history of heart or lung problems, no blood clots… nothing major. Everyone else was pretty healthy, actually. They all lived to a good age.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. High blood pressure in your father, diabetes in your grandmother. Now, just to be absolutely thorough, given the nature of the letter you need, I’m going to quickly listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds fine. The sooner we get this done, the better. I just… want to get this letter and move on. It's a bit of a sensitive trip, and the paperwork is the last thing I need to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go. I’m a little nervous, is that going to affect it? I’ve never really liked going to the doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Kiante. Being a little nervous can sometimes raise your blood pressure a bit, so we’ll take a couple of readings to get a good average. Okay, first reading is 135/85. Let me just wait a minute and then we’ll take it again. Okay, second reading is 130/80. That’s within a normal range, though a bit on the higher side, likely due to the nerves. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Everything sounds good. No signs of any current respiratory or cardiac issues.
PATIENT: That’s… good to hear. So, you think you can write the letter? I’m really hoping to get it today. I have to submit it by the end of the week, and I’d like some buffer time, just in case.
DOCTOR: Yes, Kiante, I can absolutely write the letter for you. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, there’s no medical reason to prevent you from flying. I will include a statement confirming your stable health and fitness for air travel. I'll also note your recent pneumonia in 2022, with full recovery, and your family history of hypertension and diabetes. Is there anything specific you would like me to include in the letter?
PATIENT: No, that sounds perfect, actually. Just… a standard confirmation of fitness to fly is all I need. Thank you so much, Dr. Lahn. I really appreciate you getting this done so quickly. How long will it take to print it out?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could help. Here you go. This is a letter confirming your medical fitness for air travel, dated today, August 2nd, 2025. It includes everything we discussed. Please review it to make sure everything is accurate. Do you have any questions about it?
PATIENT: Yes, this looks perfect. Thank you so much, Dr. Lahn. Honestly, you’ve taken a huge weight off my shoulders. I think this is everything, isn’t it? I’m ready to go whenever you are. I really appreciate your time and your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could assist you. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you a safe and pleasant trip. If you have any concerns or need anything further in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic.
