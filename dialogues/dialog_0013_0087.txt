DOCTOR: Hi Early, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… lab work, I think? The usual. Honestly, I don't really keep track of these things anymore. Medicare sent something, I suppose. I just want to get it over with, if that’s alright. Don’t really feel like sitting around all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. We can definitely get your lab work done. Just to be sure, and to get everything documented properly, can you tell me what specifically Medicare asked you to get done?
PATIENT: Ugh… specifics. See, this is what I mean. It was a paper… a form. Something about… numbers? And maybe a checkup? I really don't recall. It had a bunch of boxes ticked, I think. Honestly, I just tossed it on the counter at home and figured I'd let you folks figure it out. Is that bad? I’m Early Croonquist, by the way, if that helps.
DOCTOR: No, not bad at all, Early. We deal with this all the time. Let me pull up your records here… Ah, yes. It looks like Medicare scheduled a routine check-up and some standard blood work. We can do all of that today. Just to confirm, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, food, latex, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat… well, I eat what my neighbor brings over mostly. He’s a good cook. Never had a reaction, not that I remember. Used to be a bit sensitive to dust when I was working at the plant, but that was… a long time ago. Is that what you mean? Honestly, I've always been pretty sturdy. Don't recall ever having to go to the hospital for anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No known allergies, and a pretty clean medical history as far as hospitalizations. That’s helpful. And just to get a fuller picture, are you currently taking any medications – prescriptions, over-the-counter vitamins, supplements, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Oh! My neighbor, bless his heart, gave me some… fish oil capsules. Said it was good for the… brain? I think. I take one every now and then. Can't really remember why though. He’s always giving me something. And… I used to take something for my knees, when they bothered me. But that was ages ago. I don't even have those pills anymore. Probably thrown them out. Everything just goes, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasionally fish oil, and you used to take something for your knees. We'll make a note of that. Now, just a few questions about your general health. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for you, you know. Worked around enough fumes at the power plant, didn’t need any extra. My father smoked, terrible habit. Coughed his lungs out. No, definitely no smoking for me. Always tried to stay healthy, as much as a man can, working that job. It was dusty, like I said. Real dusty.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No smoking history. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, I might have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing fancy. Just a little red wine. My neighbor brings that over too, usually. It’s… relaxing. Not every day, mind you. Maybe once a week, if that. It helps me sleep. And it goes well with his cooking. He makes a lovely stew. Really, he's a lifesaver. I don’t go overboard or anything. I promise. Just a small glass.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional small glass of red wine. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your current health. Have you been experiencing any new or unusual symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Now that’s a good question. Everything feels a bit… slow, I suppose. Old age, probably. Knees still ache sometimes, especially when it rains. And I forget things, like we’ve established. But… is that a symptom? It just is. I don't feel sick, if that makes any sense. Just… tired, mostly. And a little bit lonely, if I'm being honest. But that’s just life, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some general fatigue, achy knees, and some forgetfulness. We'll definitely keep those in mind. And when you say “slow”, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh… it’s hard to explain. Like… everything takes a bit longer. Thinking, moving, even talking sometimes. I used to be quicker, I think. Sharper. Now… I have to really focus to remember what I was saying mid-sentence. And I get winded easily. Just walking to the mailbox is enough to get me puffing. It's not painful, just… draining. Is that making sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things. My neighbor says I ramble sometimes.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Early. You’re explaining it very well. Okay, so fatigue, slowed thinking, some forgetfulness, and getting winded easily. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight… oh dear. That’s another thing I don’t keep track of. I think… I think I might have lost a little bit? The clothes feel a bit looser, maybe. But I don't actually weigh myself. Haven’t done that in… years. I just eat what’s put in front of me. I’m not a fussy eater. My neighbor makes sure I'm well fed. He worries about me. So I don't know for sure. Probably a bit thinner, if I had to guess. But not on purpose.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible unintentional weight loss. We'll definitely check your weight today as part of the exam. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It'll just be checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a quick look at your general condition. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ugh… exams. Alright, alright. Get it over with, I suppose. The quicker the better. Just… be gentle, okay? My old bones aren’t what they used to be. And… don’t take too long, alright? I have a neighbor… he's making stew tonight. I wouldn’t want to miss that. Go ahead then. Let's get it done.
DOCTOR: Of course, Early. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, 138 over 82. Heart sounds are normal with a slight murmur, which we’ll note. Lungs sound a bit diminished on both sides, and your abdomen feels normal. Now, let's just check your reflexes. I’m going to tap lightly on your knees. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but still within normal limits. And finally, let's just take a quick look at your ears and throat. Ears and throat look good. Overall, everything seems relatively normal for your age, but we'll need to run some blood work to get a clearer picture of what's going on. We'll do a Complete Blood Count, a Basic Metabolic Panel, and a Lipid Panel, as originally scheduled. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Sounds… thorough. Blood work, fine. The more you check, the quicker I can get back to my stew, right? Complete, basic, lipid… whatever. Just get it done, alright? Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit tired just talking about all this. And… please, tell my neighbor I said thank you. For the stew, I mean. He’s a good man. Are we almost finished?
DOCTOR: Yes, we’re almost finished, Early. We’ll just need to get the lab order sent and then the phlebotomist will be in to draw your blood. It should only take a few minutes. I'm going to write a note for your neighbor, too. Now, while we wait for the phlebotomist, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. No, not really. I usually just let folks get on with it. You've checked everything, haven’t you? I guess… is everything bad? Is that what the blood work is for? To find out if I’m… well, you know. Dying? Sorry, that’s probably a rude thing to ask. I just… don't want to be a bother to anyone. If it’s bad, just tell me straight. And then… I can go back to my stew. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: It’s not rude at all to ask, Early. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned. The blood work isn't necessarily to check for anything “bad,” it’s to get a baseline of your overall health. It will help us see how your kidneys, liver, and blood cells are functioning, and check your cholesterol levels. We can then compare these results to normal values and see if anything needs further attention. It’s a preventative measure, to help us catch anything early if there is a problem. It doesn't mean there is a problem, just that we're being thorough. We'll discuss the results as soon as they come in, and we can come up with a plan together. Right now, let’s focus on getting the blood work done. The phlebotomist should be here any minute. And yes, after that, you can absolutely go back to your stew. That sounds like a very good plan.
PATIENT: Alright… preventative. That’s good. Better than… the other thing. So, just a few needles, then? And then I can go? My neighbor makes a lovely apple pie too, sometimes. Keeps me well fed, that man. Alright. Bring on the needles. Let's just get it over with. The quicker the better. .
DOCTOR: Okay, just a few needles. The phlebotomist will be with you in a moment. I'll let her know you’re ready. And it sounds like you're in good hands with your neighbor!
