DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's... well, it's this tiredness. Just dreadful tiredness. Seems to come and go, but when it is here, I can barely lift a spoon. And the young man at the lab said something about... my numbers being off? Something about my muscles. Honestly, all this talk goes right over my head. I used to be strong, you know. A commercial diver, I was. Not many women doing that back then. But now... just tired.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Oitker. It’s frustrating when you're not feeling well and the explanations are difficult to follow. It sounds like you’re experiencing significant fatigue, and the lab results are pointing to something we need to investigate. You mentioned being a commercial diver – that is quite remarkable! It certainly required a lot of strength and stamina. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m sick sick, you understand. No cough, no fever, nothing like that. Just… weak. Like all my energy has been sucked right out. It comes on suddenly, usually. I'll be doing something – even something small, like weeding the garden – and then poof. Gone. I have to sit down. My husband, he gets annoyed, says I’m being dramatic. Men! They don't understand these things. It’s been happening… oh, for a few months now, I suppose. Hard to say exactly. Time just slips away when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this fatigue is significantly impacting your daily activities, despite the absence of other illness symptoms. It’s good you’ve noticed it comes on suddenly with activity, and I appreciate you mentioning your husband's perspective – it can be difficult for others to understand what we’re going through. A few months is definitely long enough to warrant investigation. To help me narrow down the possibilities, could you describe what happens right before the tiredness sets in?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, usually I'm doing something. Just normal things. Yesterday it was hanging laundry. Before that, it was trying to make a simple sauce for dinner. Nothing strenuous! It’s just… a heaviness. In my arms mostly, and my legs. Like they're filled with lead. And then... just this overwhelming need to rest. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. It’s just… draining. And I get a little shaky, sometimes. Not a proper tremble, just… wobbly. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Oitker. The heaviness in your arms and legs, coupled with the fatigue and occasional shakiness, is helpful information. It sounds like this is impacting your ability to perform even simple tasks. Before we proceed, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long list, I suspect. When you get to be eighty-one, things start to ache and break, you know? I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And arthritis, of course. In my hands, mostly. But nothing serious. Nothing that would explain this… tiredness. My doctor back home – before we moved – he just said it was part of getting old. He wasn’t very helpful, that one. Mostly just told me to take it easy. Which is… not very good advice for someone who likes to keep busy.
DOCTOR: I understand. Arthritis is common, and it's good you've been managing it. It’s not uncommon for symptoms to overlap, making it difficult to pinpoint the cause of new issues. It sounds like your previous doctor wasn’t able to provide a satisfactory explanation for this fatigue. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think... mostly just things for the arthritis. Some ibuprofen, when my hands are really bothering me. And a little glucosamine and chondroitin, for the joints. My daughter told me to try it. She's always reading those articles online. And... oh, yes. A little vitamin D, the doctor recommended it when we had that long winter. That's about it, I think. Nothing fancy. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for arthritis, glucosamine and chondroitin, and vitamin D. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you have. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a proper allergic reaction. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle with pollen, sometimes, but nothing serious. I eat pretty much everything. My husband always complains I’ll try anything once. He’s a worrier, that one. Says I’ll poison myself. But I’ve never had any trouble with medications, either. Never had a rash or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Oitker. No known allergies is helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I'd like to briefly ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that’s a long story. My mother had… well, she had a weak heart, I think. She passed away when I was quite young. My father, he was strong as an ox, but he developed diabetes later in life. And my brother… he had trouble with his lungs. Smoked too much, that one. Lots of coughing. Honestly, there's been a bit of everything, if you ask me. It’s not a particularly healthy family, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Oitker. A family history of heart issues, diabetes, and lung problems is good information to have. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health and see if we can gather more clues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I suppose that's what you're paid for. Just be gentle, alright? My bones aren’t what they used to be. And please don't make me do any of those jumping jacks! I used to be quite nimble, you know. A diver. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Oitker. I will be very gentle. No jumping jacks, I promise! We'll just do a basic exam – check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your muscle strength. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sleeve rolling up… there we go. Honestly, this all feels a bit… much. But if you think it’s necessary. My husband is always saying I worry too much, but it’s hard not to when you're feeling so tired all the time. It's just… debilitating. Makes it hard to enjoy anything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Oitker. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you’re experiencing symptoms like this. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this time. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Alright, deep breaths... like this? I used to hold my breath for ages underwater, you know. A proper diver. But that was... a long time ago. And a lot of practice. Feels strange letting all that air in and out now.
DOCTOR: Yes, just like that. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, which is good. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength in your arms and legs. Could you please try to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, squeezing... Oh dear. This isn’t very good, is it? It feels like... there’s just no strength there. Like trying to crush something with a wet noodle. I used to be able to lift heavy equipment, you know. A proper diver. But that was... well, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. Your grip strength is indeed weaker than expected, and I noticed some mild resistance when I asked you to squeeze. Now, could you please try to lift your legs off the table, one at a time?
PATIENT: Oh, alright… this is getting embarrassing. Ugh. It feels like they’re filled with lead, honestly. Like trying to lift a couple of tree trunks. I used to swim with these legs! A proper diver. But that was… a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand this is challenging, Ms. Oitker. You’re doing very well. Based on what I’m seeing – the weakness in your arms and legs – along with your fatigue and the lab results, I’m concerned about the possibility of a condition called polymyositis. It's an inflammatory muscle disease that can cause progressive weakness. However, we need to run some additional tests to confirm this. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a creatine kinase level – that's an enzyme released when muscles are damaged. I also want to check for certain antibodies in your blood that can help us identify the cause of muscle inflammation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Polymyos…what-itis? Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. Inflammation? Is that serious? My husband is going to have a fit. He hates anything to do with hospitals. And antibodies? It all sounds so… complicated. I suppose if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. But please, try to explain things slowly. And don't use too many big words. My brain isn't what it used to be. And will these tests hurt? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Oitker. Polymyositis can be a serious condition, but it’s also very treatable, especially when diagnosed early. It means your muscles are becoming inflamed, causing the weakness you’re experiencing. The tests I’m ordering are relatively simple blood draws. They will help us determine if inflammation is present and identify the underlying cause. The blood draw itself may cause a brief pinch, but it’s usually very quick. We’ll also need to rule out other potential causes of your weakness, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I’m going to order these tests and schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results in a week. In the meantime, please try to avoid strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Rest? That’s just… not me. But I suppose if you think it’s necessary. What if… what if it is this polymyos…thing? What happens then? Will I… will I have to be in the hospital? Will I be able to… well, will I be able to do anything? I just want to be able to walk around my garden without feeling like I’m going to collapse. Is that too much to ask? And what about… swimming? I haven't been in the water for years, but… I used to love swimming. A proper diver, I was.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Oitker. It’s understandable to feel anxious about the unknown. If the tests confirm a diagnosis of polymyositis, the good news is that there are several effective treatments available. These treatments typically involve medications to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. In many cases, these medications can significantly improve muscle strength and function. Whether or not you'll need to be hospitalized depends on the severity of your condition. In most cases, treatment can be managed on an outpatient basis, meaning you can continue to live at home. As for your activities, our goal is to help you regain as much function as possible. We would work with a physical therapist to develop a personalized exercise program to strengthen your muscles and improve your endurance. Whether you can return to swimming will depend on your response to treatment, but we will certainly explore that possibility. It’s important to remember that everyone responds to treatment differently. We will closely monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Our priority is to help you improve your quality of life and regain your independence. For now, let's focus on getting the test results back and then we can develop a plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… a plan. I suppose that’s better than just… waiting. And a physical therapist… that sounds good. I need someone to tell me what I can and can’t do. My husband just tells me I’m being lazy. And swimming… oh, to feel the water around me again. That would be wonderful. A proper diver, I was. The best in the fleet, they said. But that was a long, long time ago. Alright, Doctor. Let’s get these tests done. And please… please try to explain things slowly when we talk again. My brain… it just doesn’t work like it used to.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Oitker. I will certainly take my time and explain everything as clearly as possible. We'll go through the results step-by-step. Here's the lab order. Just take this to the front desk, and they'll schedule your blood draw. The results usually take a few days to come back, and my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please try to get plenty of rest and avoid strenuous activity. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. It was nice meeting you today, Ms. Oitker. I'm confident we can get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. And please remember, you were a very accomplished diver – that’s something to be proud of! I’ll see you in a week.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I suppose I'll go and get this done. And… thank you for remembering about the diving. It feels like… a lifetime ago. .
