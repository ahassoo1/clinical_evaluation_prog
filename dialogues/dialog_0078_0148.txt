DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Solero. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having some… pain. Down there. In… well, you know. It's… difficult to explain. I don't usually talk about these things, and to be honest, I’m a little foggy on when it started exactly. It feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss these things, Noelani. You’re in a safe place, and I’m here to listen without judgment. It’s perfectly alright if you’re not sure exactly when it started. Let's try to get a better idea of what’s been going on. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. Um… let me see. It’s not… sharp, exactly. More of a… dull ache, I suppose? Sometimes it feels heavy, like a weight. And… it comes and goes. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and others… well, others it’s quite distracting. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it’s not really going away. I mostly notice it when I’m… active, you know? Like when I’m working in the shop.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that comes and goes, and is more noticeable with activity. That’s helpful. When you say “the shop,” what kind of work do you do there?
PATIENT: Oh! I… I work with wood. I’m a woodworker. I make furniture mostly. Tables, chairs, sometimes cabinets. It’s… physical work, lots of lifting and bending and… well, using my hands, of course. I've been doing it for… a long time. A very long time. Honestly, I can't remember exactly how long. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Noelani. It’s perfectly common to not remember exact timelines. Knowing it involves physical work and using your hands is very important. So, this pain… does it radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate? Oh… you mean does it spread? Hmm… let me think. Sometimes, yes. It feels like it goes down into… my groin, I think that’s the right word? And sometimes, a little bit into my lower abdomen. It’s not terrible, but I definitely feel it there occasionally. It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Okay, radiating to the groin and sometimes the lower abdomen. That's helpful information. Have you noticed any other symptoms associated with this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. I haven't had a fever, if that's what you mean. And… no, nothing else really. I… well, I have been a bit more tired lately, but I just assumed that was from working so much. I do feel a little… bloated sometimes. But honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good at noticing these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, some increased fatigue, and occasional bloating. It’s good you’re telling me about the fatigue and bloating, even if you’re unsure if they’re related. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, my… medical history. That's… a bit of a blur, to be honest. I have Medicare, so I’ve seen doctors over the years, but I don't always remember what they told me. I think… I think I had high blood pressure at one point, but it's probably under control now. And… I've had the usual things. Flu, colds, a broken wrist when I was younger. Nothing major, really. I don’t… I don’t recall any serious illnesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure, but currently managed, and some typical illnesses like flu and colds. No major illnesses reported. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think very carefully. I had my appendix out when I was a child, I think. That's… that's the only one I'm certain of. I might have had something done on my knee, years ago, but I honestly don’t remember. It’s all so long ago, and I wasn’t very involved in the decisions, if that makes sense. My mother usually handled those things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Noelani. It’s common for details to become hazy over time, especially if someone else managed the medical decisions. So, appendix removal as a child, and a possible knee surgery. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. That’s… complicated. My mother came from a very large family, and I didn’t know most of them. I know my grandfather… on my mother's side… he had something with his heart, I think. And… my uncle, maybe? He had cancer. But honestly, Doctor, I don’t remember much about it. It’s a bit of a blur. We didn't talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible heart condition in a grandfather and cancer in an uncle. That gives us something to work with. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take a little pill for my blood pressure, I believe. Lisinopril, that's the name of it, I think. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, when I’m working hard. Just over-the-counter stuff. That’s it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for aches and pains. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, and I've taken different medications over the years without any problems. I don’t think I have any allergies, but I suppose it's always possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for that information, Noelani. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, definitely not. I've never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's it. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I'm a simple woman, Doctor. I work with wood. That’s my life.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Noelani. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and then a gentle abdominal exam. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'm ready when you are. Though… …it might be a little difficult to hear my heart properly if I’m nervous.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Noelani. We'll take our time. Just relax as much as you can. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie back on the table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I do feel a bit silly, lying here like this. But… alright. Here I am. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I hope I'm not too awkward.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles detected. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. I'll be feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know immediately if anything feels painful. Alright, just tell me if you feel any pain anywhere. Does this feel tender here?
PATIENT: No, that’s… not too bad. A little pressure, but no pain. Ooh… yes. That’s a little… uncomfortable. Right there. It's not sharp pain, more like a dull ache. It’s the same area where I’ve been feeling the discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower right quadrant. And does that pain radiate anywhere when I press on it?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. It sort of… goes down into my groin, like it has been. And… a little bit into my lower back, I think. It’s not a strong pain, but I definitely feel it. It’s… unsettling, to be honest. I haven’t felt this particular ache before.
DOCTOR: Alright. No masses detected, and no significant guarding. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It’s possible this is a musculoskeletal issue – a strain or sprain of the abdominal muscles. However, given the location and radiation of the pain, we also need to rule out other causes. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a urinalysis. These tests can help us identify any signs of infection or inflammation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A complete blood count and a urinalysis… alright. Yes, please. I just want to know what’s going on. It’s… unsettling to feel this pain, and not know the cause. I suppose waiting for the results is the next step.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Noelani. Waiting for the results is the next step. The lab results should be available within a couple of days. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and then collect a urine sample. In the meantime, I recommend taking it easy and avoiding any strenuous activity. You can also take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, as needed for the discomfort. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with me. It’s… difficult to talk about these things, and I haven’t been very good at remembering details. But you’ve been very kind and understanding. Just… a couple of days, you said? To get the results? Alright. I will try to take it easy, and avoid strenuous activity. And I will take the ibuprofen if I need it. Thank you, Doctor Solero.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. I’m glad I could help. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect the urine sample. I will call you with the results as soon as they are available. Have a good day, and try to rest.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Goodbye. .
