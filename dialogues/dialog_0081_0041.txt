DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. It makes things… difficult.
DOCTOR: Weakness, alright. And you say it’s been progressing gradually. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, gradually. It started in my legs, I think. Just feeling a little tired after walking. Now… well, now it’s harder to get up from a chair sometimes. And my hands… they aren’t as strong as they used to be. I drop things more often. It worries my wife, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your wife is concerned, and it’s good you're addressing this. So, primarily legs and hands. Is the weakness the same on both sides of your body, or is one side weaker than the other?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Hmm… I think it's a little worse on my left side. Not much, but… yes, my left leg feels heavier, and my left hand… I struggle more with it when I’m trying to button my shirt, for example.
DOCTOR: Alright, some asymmetry there. And when did you first notice this weakness in your legs, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one to say exactly. Maybe… six months ago? It was very mild then. I thought I was just getting old! But it hasn’t gone away, and it’s… well, it’s gotten more noticeable, as I said.
DOCTOR: Six months. And has anything specific seemed to make it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Not really anything specific, Doctor. It doesn’t seem to be worse after exercise or anything like that. Hot weather maybe makes it a little harder, but that could just be the heat, you see? I get tired easily in the heat anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but I have always had trouble with my eyesight. And sometimes I feel… tired. Very tired, even after a good night’s sleep. But I’m an old man, Doctor, so maybe that’s just getting old too! It’s hard to say what is new and what’s just… me.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and fatigue. I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Astores. It can be difficult to pinpoint new symptoms. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for that every day. And my wife says I snore very loud! But other than that… not that I know of. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years. I try to stay healthy, you see.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, alright. And you're on medication for that. Good. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. My wife hasn’t given me anything new to take, so I haven't had any reactions. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I eat everything!
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, yes! A long time ago, when I was a young man, I had my appendix taken out. And I had a bad knee, so I had surgery on that knee too. That was… maybe twenty years ago? It doesn’t bother me much anymore.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal and knee surgery. Alright. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s another hard one. My mother had… arthritis, I think. Bad arthritis in her hands. And my father… he had a weak heart. He died when he was not very old. But other than that… not that I remember. We didn’t talk much about health, you see.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and a father with heart problems. Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor! Never. I don't smoke. My wife would kill me! And I only drink a little wine with dinner sometimes. Just a glass. And I certainly don’t use any… recreational drugs. I'm a church man, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astores. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Then we can talk about what might be causing your weakness. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just sit here on the table, we'll begin. First, let's check your blood pressure. 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes. Reflexes are slightly diminished in your legs. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m trying. It’s not as strong as it used to be, I’m afraid. My hands feel… weak.
DOCTOR: Strength is 4/5 in both arms, but 3/5 in your legs, particularly on the left side. Now, I’m going to check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s a little hard… my hand doesn’t go exactly where I want it to.
DOCTOR: Coordination is slightly impaired, particularly on the left side. Alright, Mr. Astores. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on the exam and your history, your symptoms and findings suggest possible neuropathy or a mild stroke. It's not definitive, but we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood tests and an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds a little scary, Doctor. But if that's what you think is best, then yes. I trust your judgment. What will the blood tests show? And what does the MRI… see?
DOCTOR: The blood tests will help us rule out other potential causes for your weakness, such as vitamin deficiencies or underlying infections. The MRI will give us a detailed image of your brain, allowing us to look for any signs of a stroke, tumors, or other abnormalities. It's a painless procedure, but it does require you to lie still for a while. I’ll give you detailed instructions before the test. In the meantime, I want you to avoid strenuous activity and monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any sudden changes, such as worsening weakness, difficulty speaking, or loss of vision, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. No strenuous activity. Monitor my symptoms. And go to the emergency room if anything gets worse. It sounds… serious. Is it likely to be a stroke? My wife will be very worried.
DOCTOR: It’s possible it could be a stroke, Mr. Astores, but it’s too early to say definitively. That’s why we need the tests. Many things can cause weakness, and we need to rule them all out. As for your wife… well, it's best to avoid causing unnecessary alarm. Tell her we are investigating the cause of your weakness, and we're taking the necessary steps to find out what’s going on. I’ll have the lab order ready for you. The MRI will need to be scheduled – I'll have my nurse arrange that for you. In the meantime, I’m prescribing you a mild muscle relaxant to help with any discomfort. It won’t cure the problem, but it may provide some relief. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant… alright. That sounds good, if it helps with the discomfort. No, Doctor, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… I hope it’s not too serious. And thank you for your help. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Astores. My nurse will explain the medication instructions and schedule your MRI. Please follow up with me as soon as you have the test results. And if anything changes, don't hesitate to contact the office. Now, if there’s nothing further, I have other patients waiting. I trust you'll take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you again. I will. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Good day, Mr. Astores. .
PATIENT: .
