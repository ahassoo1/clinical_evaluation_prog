DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Barban. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, hello. I am here for… the check-up. Before the insurance starts, you understand? It is… necessary, yes? I have the papers.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A welcome to Medicare check-up. That’s perfectly fine. Have a seat. Let's go over some things, and then we'll do a quick physical exam. Just to confirm, is this your first time visiting our clinic?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. First time. Everything is… new. Is this normal? This many papers for just… checking?
DOCTOR: It can seem like a lot, I agree. We just want to be thorough and have all your information accurate, especially with a new patient and new insurance. It helps us provide the best possible care. We’ll go through them together, and I’ll explain everything. Don’t hesitate to ask questions at any point. First, let’s just confirm your date of birth and preferred name, just to make sure we have everything correct in the system. And can you tell me what language you prefer to communicate in?
PATIENT: My birthdate is… August 12th, 1997. Barban is the name. Kiwane Barban. And… I speak English. Basic English, yes, but English. We are doing this quickly, I hope? I do not have all day.
DOCTOR: August 12th, 1997 – perfect. And yes, we’ll try to be as efficient as possible, Mr. Barban. I understand your time is valuable. Okay. So, aside from getting everything set up with your new insurance, is there anything specific you’ve been concerned about?
PATIENT: Concerned? No. Nothing… major. I work. Food processing. It is… physical work. Sometimes my back… aches. But it is normal, I think. For the job, yes? Is this what you ask all patients? About aches? Seems… silly.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not silly at all. Back pain is very common, especially with physically demanding jobs like yours. It’s important to understand the nature of the pain – where exactly it is, how long it’s been happening, and what makes it better or worse. So, when did the back pain start?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… difficult to say exactly. A few months, maybe? It comes and goes. When I lift heavy things, it is worse. When I rest… a little better. It is not… constant. I can still work. It is just… work. You understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand. It’s good that you’re still able to work, but we want to make sure it doesn’t become a bigger problem down the line. Does the pain radiate anywhere – down your legs, for example?
PATIENT: No. It stays in my back. Lower back, mostly. Sometimes… a little stiff in the mornings. But no pain down my legs. I can still walk and… everything. I do not want to make a big deal about nothing. Is this all you ask about back pain? It seems… excessive for something so minor.
DOCTOR: It’s important to rule out anything serious, even if it seems minor. We ask these questions to get a complete picture. So, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your back pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Hmm. Ten is… a broken bone, yes? I have never broken a bone. At its worst… maybe a four? Five, if I have been lifting a lot. It is not… debilitating. I can still function. I just… do not enjoy it. Is that sufficient? Or do you need more details about my dislike of back pain?
DOCTOR: Four or five is helpful. Okay. Let's move on to a quick review of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I am… healthy. I work hard. Food processing is… good exercise, yes? We do not sit around all day. Is that what you are asking? About sickness? I do not have any.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I have… always been careful. I do not… seek out hospitals. They are… unpleasant places. Is this necessary, all these questions about sickness and hospitals? It feels… intrusive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Barban. We ask these questions to get a complete medical history, and it helps us provide you with the best care possible. It's just a routine part of a check-up. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do either of your parents have any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My father… he had… problems with his stomach. Old age, mostly. He is gone now. And my mother… she has high blood pressure, I think. She lives in Yemen. We do not talk often. Is that enough about my family? They are… far away.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's good to know about your mother’s high blood pressure. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. None of those. I do not… partake in such things. It is… not a good lifestyle. I need to be strong for work. Is this… standard procedure? Asking about bad habits? It feels… judgmental.
DOCTOR: It’s not about judgment, Mr. Barban. It's important information for your overall health assessment. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I eat everything. I have never had a… reaction to anything. I am… resilient. Is that all? Can we move on to the… physical part now? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. Yes, that’s all the questions for now. Let’s proceed with a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief assessment of your back. It won't take long. Do you have any objections to a physical examination?
PATIENT: No. Just… be quick. And… gentle. I do not enjoy being… poked and prodded. Let us get this over with. I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. If you could just lie down on your back, please. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your lower back. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: A little. There. On the left side. It is… always a little tender there. It is the job, I tell you. Lifting heavy boxes all day. Not a sharp pain, just… discomfort. Do not press so hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m being gentle now. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. There's some muscle tightness and tenderness on the left side of your lower back, as you mentioned. No signs of any neurological deficits. Could you bend forward and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: This… is not easy. I am not very flexible. It is… tight. Is this necessary? All this bending? I feel… strained.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's enough for now. No need to push yourself. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it seems like you're experiencing muscle strain in your lower back, likely due to the physical demands of your job. We can start with some conservative treatments – over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, heat or cold packs, and gentle stretching exercises. We also want to focus on proper lifting techniques at work. I can provide you with some resources on that. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Resources? Yes, that would be… helpful. Lifting techniques. I try to be careful, but… the boxes are heavy. Ibuprofen, yes. I have used that before. Will this… go away on its own? Or will I need… something stronger? I do not want to be off work.
DOCTOR: It's likely to improve with time and these conservative measures, Mr. Barban. Most muscle strains resolve within a few weeks. We'll start with over-the-counter pain relief and proper lifting techniques. Here's a handout with information on proper lifting techniques and some stretching exercises you can do at home. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, just in case the pain is severe. It's a low dose, and you can use it as needed. However, please be aware that it can cause drowsiness, so avoid driving or operating machinery while taking it. If your pain doesn't improve within two weeks, or if it gets significantly worse, we may need to consider further investigation, such as an X-ray or an MRI. But let’s try this conservative approach first. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Reasonable, yes. Two weeks. I can manage two weeks. Muscle relaxant… drowsiness, you say? I will be careful. So, no need for… scans or anything right now? Just the pills and the… lifting paper?
DOCTOR: Exactly. No need for scans or anything right now. Just the muscle relaxant as needed, and focus on those lifting techniques. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to check on your progress. Does August 16th at 10:00 AM work for you?
PATIENT: August 16th… yes, that should be fine. 10:00 AM. I will… mark it on my calendar. So, I can go now? Is there anything else? I really must get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re all set, Mr. Barban. Just remember to take the muscle relaxant as directed and follow the lifting techniques. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Get well soon. And thank you for coming in today.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will… try to remember everything.
