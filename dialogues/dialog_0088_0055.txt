DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I’ll be frank. My husband, Harold, he suggested I come. He thinks this… this marijuana might help with my nerves. Though, frankly, I think he just wants a reason to… indulge himself. But here I am, at your request, to explore this… certification he keeps talking about.
DOCTOR: I see. So Harold is suggesting medical marijuana for your nerves, and you're here to discuss whether that’s a viable option, and to get the necessary certification if appropriate. Is that right?
PATIENT: That's… a rather clinical way of putting it, Doctor. Yes, that's essentially it. Though I must say, I’ve always been a perfectly composed woman. It's just… things have been a bit more since… well, since Beatrice passed. It's unsettling, this… shakiness. And Harold insists this isn’t some… some hippie nonsense, but a legitimate treatment. I’m just… skeptical, naturally.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Ellan. It’s good that Harold is supporting you, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be cautious. It sounds like this nervousness has developed since Beatrice’s passing. Can you tell me a bit more about this shakiness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not as though I’m trembling all the time, Doctor. It’s… an internal vibration, really. A fluttering in the chest. And sometimes, when I’m… hosting, you see, with Harold's colleagues, or even just at church… my hands will get a bit… unsteady when pouring tea. It's terribly embarrassing, you understand. One must maintain appearances. It's just… disconcerting. And it's gotten… progressively worse, I suppose. Though Harold makes much more of it than I do. He's a worrier, that man.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s more of a noticeable tremor, particularly when you're socializing or doing tasks that require a steady hand. And it's been getting worse over time. Has anything specific triggered these episodes, or does it seem to come on randomly?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm… That's a good question. I wouldn’t say specific, no. It's not tied to any one event, exactly. Though… large gatherings do tend to exacerbate it. And when Harold begins to… drone on about his work. It’s terribly dull, you see, all those numbers and spreadsheets. It’s enough to make anyone’s hands tremble, frankly. But truly, there's no discernible pattern. It simply… happens. Though Beatrice always said I worried too much, so perhaps it's just… nerves, as Harold suspects. A woman of my stature doesn't just tremble without reason, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it seems to be worse during stressful situations – social gatherings, potentially when listening to Harold discuss his work – and you feel it could be related to anxiety. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this tremor?
PATIENT: Anxiety, Doctor? Really? I assure you, my life is perfectly… settled. I'm a pillar of the community! But… well, if you must know, I do find myself… restless at night, sometimes. Not exactly unable to sleep, mind you, but I wake frequently. And I confess, my appetite hasn't been quite what it used to be. Though, that could be the cook, frankly. She insists on these… healthy options. A woman needs a good roast, Doctor, not steamed broccoli. But, yes. Restlessness and a… diminished interest in food, perhaps. Though, I wouldn’t call it anxiety. It’s more a… lack of stimulation.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some difficulty sleeping – waking frequently during the night – and a decreased appetite. And you feel that might be more related to a lack of enjoyment rather than anxiety specifically. Have you noticed any other changes – perhaps any feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities you usually enjoy, or difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: Well, sadness… naturally, I grieved Beatrice. She was a dear friend. But I don't go around weeping every five minutes, Doctor. I have a reputation to maintain! And as for loss of interest… frankly, most activities are rather tiresome these days. Harold insists we attend these charity galas, but honestly, they’re all the same. A parade of dreary faces and bland conversation. And concentrating? I’ve always had an excellent mind. It's just… sometimes it's difficult to focus when one is surrounded by… mediocrity. Though, I wouldn’t attribute that to any… medical condition. It's simply the state of the world these days, Doctor. A dreadful lack of refinement, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Well, I’ve always been a remarkably healthy woman, Doctor. Good genes, you see. My mother lived to be ninety-seven. Though, I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu in 1982, but I recovered beautifully. And I had my tonsils removed as a child, naturally. Other than that… nothing significant. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries, no allergies. I take a multivitamin, if that counts. And I assure you, I’ve never been one for… frivolous doctor’s visits. I prefer to be proactive about my health, you see. A good diet and a positive outlook are far more effective than any… pills or procedures. Though, Harold keeps urging me to get a cholesterol check… honestly, the man worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no significant medical history, tonsils removed in childhood, no known allergies, currently taking a multivitamin. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my mother, as I mentioned, lived a very long life. She passed peacefully in her sleep. My father… he was a rather… stoic man. Didn’t talk much about his health. I believe he had high blood pressure towards the end, but it was never properly diagnosed. My sister, Beatrice… she suffered from headaches, terrible migraines, but she never sought medical attention. Stubborn woman, just like me. Other than that… no major illnesses that I’m aware of. We weren't a family for… dwelling on these things, you see. A stiff upper lip and a good sherry were far more effective remedies, frankly. Is that sufficient, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. No major known illnesses in the family. So, just to clarify, Harold suggested coming in to discuss medical marijuana for your nervousness, and the shakiness you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: He did. Though, I maintain I am perfectly composed. It’s simply… unsettling, this vibration. And frankly, Doctor, it’s rather embarrassing to even discuss such things. Harold insists this… marijuana might help. Though, I must say, the very idea seems… unconventional. I’ve always relied on good manners and a strong constitution. But he's quite insistent, and I thought I should at least explore the possibility. Is this something you think… might be appropriate?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. Based on what you've told me, you’re experiencing a tremor, some sleep disturbance, and a decreased appetite, alongside feelings of restlessness. These symptoms could be related to anxiety, though you understandably feel they're more tied to adjustment and perhaps a general sense of dissatisfaction. Given your overall health, and the lack of significant medical history, exploring medical marijuana as a potential option isn't entirely unreasonable. However, before we proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to rule out any other possible causes for your tremor. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor? I assure you, I am in perfectly good health. I have no intention of being… poked and prodded. I came here to discuss a certification, not undergo a medical inspection. Honestly, Harold will be delighted. He’s always thought I should see a doctor more often. I simply wish to explore this… marijuana, and be done with it. Is that not possible, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ellan, I understand your reluctance, and I apologize if I’ve upset you. However, as your physician, it’s my responsibility to ensure there isn’t an underlying medical cause for your symptoms before recommending any treatment, even something as relatively low-risk as medical marijuana. A brief exam – checking your reflexes, coordination, and listening to your heart and lungs – will simply help me rule out things like essential tremor, thyroid issues, or medication side effects. It’s a standard procedure, and it doesn’t necessarily mean there is anything wrong. It simply allows me to provide you with the most informed recommendation. It would only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. Honestly, Harold will be insufferable. But do make it quick, Doctor. I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon. And please, no unnecessary… prodding. I assure you, everything is precisely where it should be. Just a quick examination, as you say, and then we can get on with this… certification.
DOCTOR: Very good. Thank you for your cooperation, Ellan. Please have a seat on the examination table. First, I’ll just check your reflexes. I’m going to lightly tap on your knee and ask you to keep your leg relaxed. Relax your legs… good. And now the other leg… Your reflexes seem normal on both sides. Now, can you please hold your arms out in front of you, palms up, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: There. Are we finished yet, Doctor? Honestly, this is rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, just holding them like that. I see a slight tremor in both hands, as you mentioned. Nothing too significant, but it’s present. Now, can you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient, Doctor? Honestly, I haven’t done anything like this since school.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. And lastly, could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that all, Doctor? I do hope we can get on with this… certification now.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's all for now. I heard a slight wheeze, but nothing overly concerning. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear aside from that mild wheeze. Overall, the physical exam doesn’t reveal any immediate red flags. The tremor is present, as you described, but there’s no evidence of a more serious underlying condition. Now, given your history and the exam findings, medical marijuana could be a reasonable option to explore for managing your nervousness and shakiness. However, I do want to be cautious about the slight wheeze. Do you have any history of asthma or other respiratory issues?
PATIENT: Asthma? Good heavens, no! I’ve always prided myself on my excellent health. Though… Beatrice did occasionally use an inhaler, she suffered terribly from hay fever. But I have never had any respiratory issues whatsoever. A slight wheeze… well, perhaps it’s just the air conditioning. Honestly, the temperature in here is rather brisk. So, can we proceed with this… certification now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your lack of respiratory history, and the mildness of the wheeze, we can proceed with a discussion about medical marijuana certification. However, I strongly recommend you monitor your breathing closely if you decide to use it, and discontinue use if you experience any shortness of breath, wheezing, or coughing. Now, the process involves completing a questionnaire about your medical history and symptoms, which I have here. It will help determine if you meet the criteria for certification. Are you ready to begin?
PATIENT: Very well. Let’s get this over with. Honestly, the paperwork alone is exhausting. But do hurry, Doctor. My luncheon… "Have you ever been diagnosed with…" Honestly, the questions are rather intrusive. What exactly is the purpose of all this, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The questionnaire is required by the state, Ellan, to ensure that only patients with qualifying conditions receive certification for medical marijuana. It helps determine if this is a safe and appropriate treatment option for you. It also allows me to document your medical history accurately and monitor your progress. Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions about any of the items.
PATIENT: "Do you have any history of psychosis?" Really, Doctor! It’s quite insulting. I’m a pillar of the community, not a… a madwoman! But… fine. There. Are we finished now? Honestly, this has been a rather unpleasant experience.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Ellan. Based on your responses, you do appear to meet the criteria for medical marijuana certification. I will now complete the necessary paperwork and submit it to the state registry. This typically takes 24-48 hours for approval. Once approved, you will receive a notification and can then purchase medical marijuana from a licensed dispensary. Now, I want to emphasize the importance of starting with a low dose and gradually increasing it as needed. And as we discussed, monitor your breathing closely and discontinue use if you experience any adverse effects. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: A dispensary? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds terribly… disreputable. And low dose, you say? What is considered a low dose? I wouldn't want to… overindulge, naturally. And… what about the side effects? What am I supposed to look out for, besides this… wheezing? Honestly, the entire process is rather unsettling. Do try to be more specific, Doctor. I'm not accustomed to… such ambiguity.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ellan. Dispensaries are regulated businesses, and they can provide guidance on appropriate strains and dosages. A low dose typically starts with 2.5-5 milligrams of THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana. You can start with a very small amount, such as an edible with 2.5 milligrams, and wait at least two hours before increasing the dosage. As for side effects, besides the wheezing, common ones include dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, and changes in appetite. Less common, but more serious, side effects include anxiety, paranoia, and impaired coordination. If you experience any of these, especially anxiety or paranoia, discontinue use immediately and contact your primary care physician. I will also provide you with a pamphlet outlining the potential risks and benefits of medical marijuana, as well as a list of licensed dispensaries in your area. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm. “Paranoia” and “impaired coordination” are hardly reassuring, Doctor. Honestly, this sounds far more trouble than it’s worth. But Harold will be insufferable if I don’t at least try it. Very well. I suppose I’ll give it a try. But if I experience any… unpleasant side effects, I fully expect you to be available for consultation. And I assure you, I will not hesitate to voice my displeasure. Do you have my number, Doctor? In case of… emergencies?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. I have your number on file, and you can reach me during regular office hours if you have any concerns. I’m also happy to schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to discuss your progress and address any side effects. I hope it provides some relief from your nervousness and improves your quality of life. And please, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns along the way. I wish you all the best. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Though, frankly, I doubt this will be of much benefit. But Harold is quite insistent, and a woman must maintain peace in the household, naturally. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good day to you as well, Ellan. .
