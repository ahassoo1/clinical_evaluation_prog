DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… it’s a bit hard to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a bit, I think. It’s been getting worse over the last few weeks.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids… alright. And when you say weakness, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific… let me think. It's not like a sudden thing. It's more… doing things feels like more effort than they used to. Like, climbing the stairs, or even just holding something for a while. And it seems to be worse in the evenings, if that makes sense. My arms and legs feel it most, I suppose. It’s not painful, just… tiring.
DOCTOR: Tiring… and evenings are worse. Do you notice any difficulty with swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: No, not really. Swallowing is fine, and I haven’t noticed any trouble with my speech. Though… my wife – well, ex-wife, now – she did mention my voice sounded a little… slurred sometimes, but I didn’t really pay attention to it. Honestly, things weren’t great at the time. I didn’t really notice much of anything. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Slurred speech is important. It could be a number of things, and it's good your ex-wife noticed. Let's not dismiss anything. Now, have you experienced any double vision or blurry vision at all?
PATIENT: No, my vision seems alright. No double vision, no blurriness. I wear glasses, as you can see, but my prescription hasn’t changed recently. I had my eyes checked last year, and everything was normal then. It’s just… the tiredness, and the eyelids. That’s the main thing bothering me. Is this something serious, Doctor? I'm a bit worried, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: It could be serious, Mr. Schaust, and that’s why we need to investigate. Weakness and drooping eyelids… coupled with a possible change in your speech… these things warrant careful consideration. We'll need to do a full neurological exam. I'll also want to check your reflexes and muscle strength. Now, do you have any past medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. Had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No surgeries, no serious accidents. I don’t take any regular medications either. I did have a bout of the flu last winter, but I recovered from that just fine. I'm not insured, so I'm hoping this isn't something terribly expensive to figure out. That’s… a worry too.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, no medications… fine. We'll get through this. We’ll start with the exam. Now, I'm going to need you to follow my finger with your eyes – don’t move your head. And then I'll test your strength in your arms and legs. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. If you’ll just sit up here for me.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good. I'm ready when you are, Doctor. Just let me know what to do. I hope it's not too… involved. I'm not very good with medical things.
DOCTOR: Follow my finger. Keep your head still. Good. Now, squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Don’t hold back. Your grip is…weak. Not alarmingly so, but noticeably weaker than it should be. Now, can you push against my hands like this?
PATIENT: I’m trying, Doctor. It is a bit harder than it used to be. I can feel it. Not a lot of strength there, I suppose. Does that… mean something bad? I’m starting to get a bit worried now. It's not painful, but… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does mean something needs investigating. Your reflexes are also a bit diminished. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to rule out other possibilities. Your heart sounds normal. Lungs are clear. However, based on what I’m hearing, and the exam findings, I suspect we're dealing with a possible neuromuscular issue. We need to order some blood work, including a creatine kinase level, to check for muscle damage. And I strongly recommend an MRI of your brain and spinal cord.
PATIENT: An MRI? That sounds… serious. And expensive. Is there… anything else we can do? Blood work, I understand. But an MRI… Is it absolutely necessary? And what exactly are you looking for? Muscle damage… that doesn't sound good at all. I just want to know… what are the possibilities here, Doctor? You’ve said ‘neuromuscular’ and ‘muscle damage’ but… what does that mean?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, I understand your concerns. “Neuromuscular” simply means there’s something affecting your nerves and muscles. “Muscle damage” could be caused by a number of things – an infection, inflammation, or even a more serious underlying condition. The MRI is crucial to rule out any structural problems, such as a tumor or lesion pressing on your spinal cord, or multiple sclerosis. Without it, we’re simply guessing. As for possibilities… it could be something relatively benign, like a vitamin deficiency. But we must rule out more serious conditions, such as myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, or even… ALS. I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s my job to consider all possibilities. Regarding cost… I can write a letter explaining the medical necessity of the MRI to your local hospital. Perhaps they have a financial assistance program. The blood work will be less expensive. Let’s start with that and the letter for the MRI. If you can afford the MRI, we proceed. If not… we explore alternative, though less definitive, tests. But delaying a proper diagnosis is not an option. Do you understand?
PATIENT: ALS… that’s… that's what happened to my grandfather. It’s… terrifying. I understand you need to consider everything, but that’s… a lot to take in. I don’t have much money, as I said. Not insured. I’ll need to think about the MRI. The blood work… yes, I can do the blood work. And the letter… yes, please. A letter explaining things. I need to… process this. Is there anything I should be doing now? Anything I should avoid? Or any symptoms I should watch out for? Before I get the results… anything? I'm just… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Take a deep breath. I've printed the requisition for the blood work. Please take this to the lab immediately. The letter is for the hospital radiology department – it explains the urgency and medical necessity of the MRI. In the meantime, avoid strenuous activity. And… watch for any new symptoms, particularly difficulty breathing, double vision, or any problems with swallowing. If you experience any of those, go to the emergency room immediately. Do not wait for the test results. I understand this is overwhelming. But we need to be proactive. I’ll have the lab results faxed here as soon as they’re available. And once we have those, we can discuss the next steps, including the possibility of a referral to a neurologist. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For the paperwork, and… for explaining things, as much as you could. It’s… a lot to process. I’ll get the blood work done right away. And I’ll see about the MRI. I… I suppose I should go then. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Please let my office know if you have any questions. And don’t delay getting the blood work done. Goodbye, Mr. Schaust.
