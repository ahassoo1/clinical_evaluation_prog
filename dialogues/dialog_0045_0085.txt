DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock, welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this…patch on my skin. It’s just…not right. It’s gotten darker, and it wasn’t like that before. I noticed it about a month ago, I think. It's on my left forearm.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A patch of skin, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. A patch. It’s not…a rash, exactly. More like a… discoloration. And it's not raised or anything, thankfully. I wouldn’t want one of those. Do you need me to…show you? It’s probably quite obvious, really.
DOCTOR: Yeah, let’s take a look. Please, roll up your sleeve on your left arm for me. Just sit right here on the exam table and we'll have a look. I'll need to get a good view of it. Don’t worry, we'll figure this out.
PATIENT: There. As you can see, it's quite…distinct. And it’s not itchy or painful, which is something, I suppose. Though I don't understand why it's there in the first place. I haven’t been doing anything different, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hmm. It is distinct, as you say. No raised borders, no flaking...appears fairly symmetrical, but the color is definitely different than the surrounding skin. It’s…a bit unusual. Have you noticed any changes in its size or shape since you first noticed it a month ago?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Honestly, I barely look at it, because it's quite unsightly. But I don’t believe it’s gotten any bigger. I wouldn’t have noticed if it had changed, probably, but I’m fairly certain it's about the same size. You really think it’s something to worry about? It’s probably just…age, isn’t it? Though I do take good care of my skin.
DOCTOR: Age is…unlikely, given your age, Ms. Bartock. And while good skincare is admirable, it doesn't always prevent everything. We’re going to need to get a little more information. Let me pull up your records...okay, I see you've had your regular check-ups. No history of skin cancer in the family, thankfully. Any history of unusual moles or skin growths in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. My grandmother had a few freckles, but that was it. And she lived to be ninety, so clearly, it wasn't anything serious. I always thought freckles were…charming, frankly. But this isn’t a freckle. It’s just…a blotch. Do you need to take a sample of it or something? I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: We’re not jumping to needles just yet, Ms. Bartock. Okay, no history of problematic skin issues…good. But we really need to rule some things out. I'm going to use a dermatoscope. It's a little handheld device with a magnifying glass and a special light. It doesn’t involve any needles, I promise. It allows me to get a closer look at the skin cells and see if there are any concerning features. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, if it doesn’t involve a needle… I suppose that’s alright. It sounds…rather involved, though. Is it going to take long? I have an appointment with the florist later this afternoon; I’m having a rather specific arrangement made for my sister’s birthday, and I wouldn’t want to be late. They’re very particular about timings, you see.
DOCTOR: It will be very quick, Ms. Bartock. Just a few minutes. I just need to get a good look. It doesn't hurt. Now, just relax your arm for me. I'll just glide this over the area. Hmm…okay. Interesting. There is some asymmetry in the pigment network here, and the borders are…a little irregular. This could be a benign lentigo, but it warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. "Further investigation"? What does that mean? Is it…serious? I knew I should have just left it alone. This is precisely why I avoid doctors. Everything always becomes…complicated. A benign…what was it? Is that good or bad? Honestly, you’re making me anxious now. I prefer straightforward answers, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock, let’s be clear. “Benign” means non-cancerous. A lentigo is a flat, pigmented spot – essentially a freckle, but we want to rule out anything more concerning. “Further investigation” simply means we need to confirm what this is. The best course of action, and I strongly recommend it, is a skin biopsy. It's a very small sample of the skin that will be sent to a lab for analysis. It’s a simple procedure, and we’ll send it to a pathologist to examine under a microscope. It's the only way to know for sure what we’re dealing with. Honestly, it’s better to be safe than sorry, and to address this now before it potentially becomes a more significant problem. We’re talking about a tiny, quick procedure, Ms. Bartock. Don't let anxiety over a simple test prevent you from taking care of your health.
PATIENT: A biopsy. Of course. I knew it would come to that. Honestly, the amount of fuss over a little patch of colour is rather…excessive. But, fine. If you insist. But I expect a very quick turnaround time. I have a rather busy schedule, you see, and I simply don’t have time to be waiting around for weeks. And it absolutely must not leave a scar. I have a very particular aesthetic, and scars simply wouldn’t do. Can you guarantee it won’t scar? Because if it will, I think I’d rather just…live with the patch. It’s not that noticeable, after all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, let’s be realistic. I can’t guarantee it won’t scar. No doctor can promise that. Scarring depends on your individual skin, your healing process, and a number of other factors. However, we will use a very precise technique to minimize the risk. And yes, we'll expedite the lab results as much as possible. Look, I understand your concerns about aesthetics, but this isn't about vanity. It’s about ruling out skin cancer. If you’re hesitant to proceed with the biopsy, I strongly recommend a consultation with a dermatologist. They can provide a second opinion. But frankly, I believe it’s the most responsible course of action. Do you want me to schedule the biopsy for you, or would you prefer to see a specialist?
PATIENT: Fine. Schedule the biopsy. But I'm holding you personally responsible for any unsightly mark it leaves. And it absolutely must be done quickly. I expect it to be over with by the end of the week. And no waiting around for weeks, as I said. I have things to do, you know. Now, tell me exactly what’s involved, and how long it’s going to take. And I expect a detailed aftercare plan. I don't want any complications.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. The procedure itself will take about ten to fifteen minutes. We'll numb the area with a local anesthetic, then use a small instrument to remove a tiny sample of skin. You’ll likely feel a slight pinch, then some pressure. After that, we'll apply a bandage. You’ll need to keep the area clean and dry for the next few days and apply an antibiotic ointment. We'll provide you with detailed written instructions. And yes, I've already scheduled you for Friday afternoon. Please arrive fifteen minutes early to complete some paperwork. We will send the sample to the lab immediately, but turnaround times can vary. I'll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they're available. Any further questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. As long as it’s quick and doesn’t leave a mark, I suppose it's acceptable. Though, frankly, I still believe you’re overreacting. But, fine. Friday afternoon it is. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a florist appointment to get to. And please, ensure everything is handled efficiently. I don’t have time for delays. .
