DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I am Dr. Eaddy. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. It’s about my foot. It’s… well, it’s just awful. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it’s not getting any better. I’ve had…problems with the sugar, you see. Always have. And this is what happens. It’s a sore. A nasty, painful sore.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here in your chart a history of diabetes. And you are experiencing a sore on your foot. Could you describe the sore for me, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Describe it? Well, it looks awful, that’s for certain. Red, of course. And deep. Deeper than it ought to be, if you ask me. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. And it aches. A throbbing ache, especially when I try to walk. Honestly, I’m surprised it hasn't gotten infected. I keep it covered, but… well, everything gets dirty, doesn’t it? I’ve tried putting ointment on it, but it doesn’t seem to help much. It’s just… a terrible sore.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A deep, red sore on the bottom of your foot, near the heel, with a throbbing ache. And you’ve noticed it’s not improving with ointment. Have you attempted to clean the sore regularly, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Clean it? Of course I clean it. Do you think I’m completely helpless? I wash it with soap and water, same as any other wound. Though, I admit, bending over to reach my foot isn't as easy as it used to be. My daughter helps sometimes, but she's busy, you know. Always rushing off somewhere. It's hard to find good help these days. And frankly, the water sometimes feels… too cold. Doesn’t seem to do much good anyway.
DOCTOR: Right. Soap and water. And bending over is difficult. We need to be very cautious with wounds, especially given your history of diabetes. Now, have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Like… pus? Oh, yes. A little. Not a lot, mind you, but… a yellowish sort of fluid. Sometimes there’s a bit of blood, too, especially when I accidentally bump it against something. Which happens, you know. It’s hard to get around carefully when you can’t feel everything properly. My feet…they aren't what they used to be. Honestly, it's all rather unpleasant. Is that bad? Is that a sign of infection?
DOCTOR: Yellowish fluid and occasional blood… yes, that warrants further investigation. I'm going to need to examine your foot, Ms. Cannington. Could you please remove your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Oh. Now you want to look at it. Well. Alright. But don’t expect me to be comfortable bending over. And honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing. I haven’t had a proper pedicure in… well, a very long time. There. Happy now? It's not a pretty sight, I warn you.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. And don’t worry, Ms. Cannington. We're simply assessing the situation. Hmm. There is a rather significant ulceration present on the plantar aspect of your heel. The surrounding tissue appears erythematous, and there is some mild edema. I also note a loss of protective sensation. Do you regularly check your feet for any cuts, blisters, or changes in color?
PATIENT: Ulceration? Erythematous? You doctors and your fancy words! Just tell me if it’s serious! And no, I don’t go poking around at my feet looking for… things. I can barely see my feet properly, let alone examine them like some… nursemaid. I notice when it hurts, alright? That's enough for me. It's probably just a bit of irritation. It'll heal on its own. It always does…eventually.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Ms. Cannington, given your history of diabetes and the findings on examination—the ulceration, erythema, edema, and loss of sensation—this is not something that will likely heal on its own. It appears you may be developing a foot infection, potentially osteomyelitis, which is an infection in the bone. We need to take this very seriously. I recommend we order some imaging—an X-ray, and possibly an MRI—to assess the extent of the infection. We will also need to obtain a culture of the wound to determine the appropriate antibiotics. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Imaging? X-rays? MRI? Antibiotics? Good heavens! All this fuss over a little sore? You're trying to scare me, aren't you? I’ve had scrapes and bruises all my life, and I’ve never needed an MRI. Osteo…whatever-you-said… sounds very serious. And expensive. My Medicare…will that cover all this? Honestly, it sounds like a lot of trouble for something that’s probably just a bit of irritation. And cultures? What are you trying to grow in there? I don’t like the sound of any of this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your concerns. However, a foot ulcer in a patient with diabetes can quickly become a very serious problem, leading to amputation if left untreated. It's not simply "a bit of irritation." The imaging will help us determine the extent of the infection—whether it’s affected the bone, as I mentioned. The culture will identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, so we can prescribe the most effective antibiotic. Let me check your Medicare coverage for these procedures. It should cover the necessary imaging and wound care. Yes, it appears that both X-ray and MRI are covered under your plan, with a standard copay. We will submit the pre-authorization forms for the MRI. In the meantime, I'm going to order a wound culture and prescribe a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic to start immediately. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Amputation?! Now you are trying to scare me! All this trouble over my foot. Honestly… very well. If it must be done. But I’m telling you, it’s probably nothing. As for allergies… let me think. I had a bad reaction to… penicillin, I think. A long time ago. Made me terribly sick. And itchy. Dreadfully itchy. But that was years and years ago. Maybe it wasn't penicillin. My memory… isn't what it used to be. Just put down penicillin, alright? It's probably best to be safe. And don’t expect me to be happy about all this.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve documented a penicillin allergy. We will, of course, avoid prescribing that. I’m ordering a wound culture now, and I will prescribe a course of cephalexin—a different antibiotic—to start today. It’s important to take this medication as directed, even if you start feeling better. Here is your prescription. You can pick it up at your usual pharmacy. We also need to schedule an appointment for you to have the X-ray performed as soon as possible. I’ll have my nurse schedule that for you before you leave. And finally, we need to arrange for a follow-up appointment to review the results of the X-ray and the wound culture. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Cephalexin… another fancy word. Very well. Next week… hmm. Tuesday afternoon would be best, I suppose. My daughter has bridge club on Wednesday, and I promised to watch the cat on Thursday. Honestly, it's a busy life, you know. But make it quick, alright? I don’t want to spend all day in a doctor’s office. And be sure they don't give me any of that penicillin. I still get a rash just thinking about it. And I expect you to explain all this to me again next week. Slowly, this time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. I will schedule your follow-up appointment for next Tuesday afternoon, and I assure you, I will explain everything again, slowly and carefully. My nurse will go over the wound care instructions with you before you leave, and she will also provide you with a list of warning signs to watch out for—signs of infection. We will do our best to get this resolved quickly. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I suppose not. Just… try not to make a fuss, alright? And be gentle with my foot. It's very sensitive. Honestly, I've seen better days. And tell your nurse to bring me a chair with arms, if possible. Getting up is a bit of a struggle these days. Alright. I think that’s all. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cannington. We will ensure you have a comfortable chair with arms. My nurse will be with you shortly to go over the instructions and schedule the X-ray. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
