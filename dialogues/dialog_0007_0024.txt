DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter… confirming I’m able to fly. It’s a bit of a long story, but basically, the airline needs it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A fit-to-fly letter. No problem, we can definitely look into that. To get started, can you tell me a bit more about why the airline needs the letter?
PATIENT: Well, my husband… he passed away a few months ago. We had plane tickets to go visit family in Mongolia, booked and everything. I’m trying to use the tickets now, to go on my own… but the airline is being difficult. They want a doctor's note saying I'm healthy enough to travel, you know, just in case… because of the… stress, I guess. It’s really frustrating.
DOCTOR: I completely understand why that would be frustrating, Kiante. I'm very sorry for your loss. It's perfectly reasonable for them to ask for a note in this situation, and we're happy to help. To get a good picture of your health and make sure it’s safe for you to travel, I’ll need to ask a few questions. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you need. I just want to get this sorted, if possible.
DOCTOR: Great. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. Just the usual colds and flu, like anyone. I haven’t really needed to see a doctor much over the years. I had the standard check-ups, of course, but nothing major ever came up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries at all. I'm lucky, I suppose. I broke my arm when I was a child, but it healed on its own with a cast. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And what about medications?
PATIENT: I don't take any regular medications. Not even vitamins, really. I try to eat well and get enough sleep, that’s about it. Occasionally I'll take something for a headache, but that's it. Just over-the-counter stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything – food, medicine, anything like that. I’ve eaten all sorts of things, travelled to different places… never a problem.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s talk about your family history then. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had high blood pressure when she was older, I think. And my grandfather… he had something with his heart, I remember that, but I don’t know the specifics. He lived in Mongolia, and things were… different there. We didn’t really have detailed medical records or anything. It wasn't discussed much, if that makes sense. Both of them lived to a pretty old age, though.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Kiante. It's not uncommon for family medical history to be limited, especially with relatives living abroad. Okay, and how about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I work in advertising sales, so it’s mostly office work. A lot of phone calls and emails. I try to walk when I can, but it’s not very strenuous. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I’m not a big partier or anything. Mostly, I just try to stay busy and keep my mind active.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, thinking about how you've been feeling recently, since your husband passed away, have you noticed any changes in your health?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question. Of course, I’ve been very sad, very stressed. I sleep poorly sometimes, and I haven't been eating as much as I used to. I get tired easily. Just… generally feeling run down, I guess. I wouldn't say I'm sick, exactly, but it’s definitely not normal. And sometimes I get… anxious, especially when thinking about the trip. It feels like a lot of pressure.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Kiante. Grief and stress can definitely manifest physically. It’s perfectly normal to experience those symptoms after such a loss. Are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain or shortness of breath. Not dizziness either. My heart feels… normal. Sometimes it races a little when I’m anxious, but nothing terrible. Just a bit faster than usual, I think. It’s not constant, just when I’m really worried about something.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit up here for me. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80 – that’s a little elevated, but not concerning given your stress. Ears look normal, throat is clear. I'm going to check your pulse... and that's regular as well. Everything sounds and looks good, Kiante. Your vital signs are generally within normal limits, considering the circumstances.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear. Thank you, Doctor. I was worried there might be something physically wrong, on top of everything else.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. It’s good we checked. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I don't see any medical contraindications to you flying. However, given your recent loss and the associated stress, I do have a few recommendations to ensure a safe trip. Would you like to hear them?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Anything that will help. I just want to make sure I'm doing everything right. I really want to go visit my family.
DOCTOR: Okay. Firstly, it’s important to stay hydrated during the flight. Secondly, I recommend practicing some relaxation techniques – deep breathing exercises, meditation, or whatever helps you manage your anxiety. And thirdly, don’t hesitate to let the flight attendants know if you’re feeling overwhelmed or unwell during the trip. I’m going to write a letter stating that you are medically cleared to fly, with a note recommending you prioritize rest and hydration during your travels. I’ll also suggest you consider bringing any medications you might need for anxiety or sleep, if you feel that would be helpful. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much. That really puts my mind at ease. I appreciate your kindness and understanding. It’s been very difficult, and you’ve made this process so much easier.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could help. Here you go. This should be sufficient for the airline. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns. I wish you safe travels and a peaceful visit with your family. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Hernandez. You’ve been wonderful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. Take care of yourself, and safe travels. .
