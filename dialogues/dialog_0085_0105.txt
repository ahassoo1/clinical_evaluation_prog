DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, I think it’s about getting ready for… surgery? For my weight, you know. My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don't really remember all the details, but it has something to do with… making things smaller?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. It sounds like you're referring to weight loss surgery, sometimes called bariatric surgery. Your wife scheduled an appointment with me for a pre-operative evaluation, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Pre-operative… that means before the surgery, right? I get those words mixed up sometimes. My wife does most of the remembering for things like that. Is this going to be a long visit?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright if you don't remember all the medical terms, Mr. Kochubey. That’s what I’m here for! And yes, pre-operative means before the surgery. This visit will be a bit longer than a typical check-up, as we need to make sure you’re healthy enough for the procedure and discuss what to expect. We'll go over your medical history, current health, and answer any questions you have. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. I think… maybe high blood pressure, a while back? The doctor put me on some pills for it, but I take a lot of pills, honestly. It’s all a bit blurry. I don't really feel sick, you know? My wife keeps track of all that stuff. She'll probably know better than I do. Is it okay if I try to get her to come in with me next time?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. It would be very helpful to have your wife join us for a future appointment, especially if she's the one managing your medications. That’s perfectly fine. For now, let’s see what I can find in your records. Okay, it looks like you were diagnosed with hypertension about three years ago and prescribed lisinopril. The last refill was six months ago, but there are also notes about occasional headaches. Do you still experience those headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… yeah, sometimes. Not all the time, though. They come and go. Usually, if I get enough sleep, they’re okay. I try to sleep, but… it’s hard. I toss and turn a lot. My wife says I snore really loud, too. Does that matter? I don't know if snoring has anything to do with… all this.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mr. Kochubey. Snoring can be relevant, actually. It could be a sign of sleep apnea, which is a condition where you stop breathing for short periods during sleep. Sleep apnea can affect your overall health and even increase risks during surgery. Let’s talk about your current medications. Can you tell me all the pills you’re currently taking, even if you don’t know exactly what they’re for?
PATIENT: Um… let’s see. There’s the little white one, for my blood pressure, I think. Then there’s a blue one, and a yellow one. Oh, and a red one, but I only take that sometimes when my… joints ache. And there's one for… stomach stuff, because I get heartburn a lot. Honestly, it’s a whole handful every morning. I think my wife has a list somewhere. It’s easier for her to remember. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. It sounds like you're on several medications, and it's good you have your wife helping with that. Knowing exactly what you're taking is crucial for ensuring your safety during surgery. Before we move on, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I eat strawberries, but that’s not a big deal. Nothing serious, like… trouble breathing or anything. My wife might know if I have any hidden allergies. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, no known drug allergies, just a possible mild reaction to strawberries. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospital… I think… when I was a kid, I broke my arm. But that was a long time ago. And… oh! I had my appendix out when I was younger too. But other than that, I don’t really… recall being in the hospital. It's all kind of blurry. My wife would definitely know more about that. She keeps all the old medical records. I don't pay much attention to those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, a history of a childhood arm fracture and an appendectomy. We'll try to get more details from your wife. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My father… he had some heart problems, I think. But he lived a long life. And my mother… she had diabetes, I think. But she was older when she got it. I’m not really sure. We didn’t talk about those things much. My wife probably knows more about our family history. She always asks the doctors about that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Possible heart disease in your father and diabetes in your mother. We'll try to get more specific information from your wife. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. And I don’t really drink alcohol either. Maybe a sip of wine at Christmas, but that’s it. And no… nothing like that. Just the pills, you know? My wife would be very upset if I was doing anything like that. She worries about my health a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, let's talk about your weight. You mentioned you were considering surgery for your weight. Can you tell me how long you’ve been struggling with your weight and if you've tried any other weight loss methods in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. As long as I can remember, really. I’ve tried… diets, I think. My wife always tries to get me to eat healthier, but it’s hard. I like food, you know? And then I get tired of the diets, and I go back to eating what I want. I’ve tried some exercise too, but I get… out of breath easily. It’s been a struggle for a long time. It's just… gotten harder as I've gotten older. That's why I’m here, I guess. To see if surgery is a good option.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for a long time and have tried different approaches. Many people struggle with weight loss, and it’s not always easy. That’s why surgery can be a good option for some people. Before we talk about the surgery itself, let's do a quick physical exam. I just want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just let me know if anything feels… weird. My wife always tells me to ask questions if I don’t understand something.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It’s always good to ask questions. I’ll explain everything as we go. Okay, your heart rate and rhythm are regular, but I am hearing a mild murmur. That just means there's an extra sound when your heart beats. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, but we'll want to investigate that a bit further with some tests. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 90. That’s consistent with what we discussed earlier. Your abdomen is soft and doesn't seem tender. It is a bit enlarged, as expected with your weight. So, overall, everything seems stable, but we do need to investigate the heart murmur and your blood pressure a bit further. I think the best next step would be an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and some blood work to check your overall health and kidney function. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. An EKG and blood work… okay. Will that take long? And… will it hurt? My wife will be happy to know you’re checking everything so carefully. She worries a lot, you know. She'll want to know all the details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s good your wife is involved and cares so much. The EKG is very quick and painless. We just attach a few stickers to your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It takes about five minutes. The blood work will take a little longer, but it’s also relatively painless. We just need to draw a few vials of blood from your arm. It will sting for a moment, but it's usually over quickly. I’ll order those tests for you right now. The lab is just down the hall. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything for now. You’ve explained everything really well, Doctor. My wife will probably have a lot of questions later, though. Can she call the office if she thinks of anything? She’s the one with the good memory, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. Your wife is more than welcome to call the office anytime she has questions. We’re happy to help in any way we can. Here’s a slip with the lab orders and the number to the office. I’ll see you back here once the lab results are in. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Kochubey. And thank you for coming in today. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And thank you for being so patient with me. I’ll see you soon. My wife will make sure we get those tests done right away.
