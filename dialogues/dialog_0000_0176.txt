DOCTOR: Alright, Ivette Redeye, 50 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Batara. It’s… well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it’s really getting to me.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Not just a few, you understand. Constant. It's… disruptive. I manage events, parties, things like that. Hard to talk to clients when you’re… hic …you know. It makes me sound terribly unprofessional.
DOCTOR: Two days of constant hiccups. Right. And you've tried… what exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, everything people say! Holding my breath, drinking water upside down… a spoonful of sugar, even. My neighbor told me to get scared, so her husband jumped out at me, hic… that didn’t help, and now I’m annoyed with both of them. Honestly, nothing’s worked. It's just… continuing.
DOCTOR: Holding your breath… sugar… being startled. Those are…folk remedies, Ivette. Not exactly evidence-based medicine. Have you noticed anything specifically triggering these hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. hic… Not that I can pinpoint, no. I was setting up for a birthday party on Saturday – lots of balloons, running around a bit – but I do that all the time, and I’ve never had this before. I had a normal dinner, nothing spicy or anything. Just… started after the party, I think. Or maybe during. It’s all a bit of a blur now, with all the hic… well, you know.
DOCTOR: And you haven't experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. I mean, occasional hiccups, sure. Everyone gets those. But not… this. hic This is relentless. And it’s making me so tired. I’m having to concentrate so hard on not hiccuping when I’m talking, it’s exhausting. I had a very important meeting this morning, and I was so worried I’d burst into a fit of them.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get some basic information. Do you have any other medical problems – diabetes, heart issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m usually quite healthy, to be honest. A bit overweight, maybe, hic, but I try to walk whenever I can. No diabetes, no heart problems. I don’t take any regular medication either. Just… hic… the occasional pain reliever for a headache. But that’s it. I haven’t been to the doctor in years, really.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had any. hic I’m a bit squeamish, to be honest. I avoid them if I can! Just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. Measles, mumps… that sort of thing. A long time ago now. I was vaccinated, of course. My mother insisted. hic She was very particular about those things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen to your chest and take your blood pressure. It’s unlikely to be related, but we need to rule things out. Then we'll do a quick exam. It's probably just a nerve irritation, but we’ll check. Please sit back and relax. Try to breathe normally, even with the…hiccups.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. hic Yes, alright. I'll try to relax. It’s not easy, with this going on, but I’ll do my best. hic Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Nothing alarming, but something to monitor. Chest sounds are clear. No wheezing, no crackles. Let me palpate your abdomen, just to rule out any obvious issues. Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. hic A little uncomfortable, maybe, but no pain. It’s always been a bit… soft, if you know what I mean. hic I’ve always been a bit prone to putting on weight. But definitely no pain. hic It feels normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, physically, everything seems normal. Given the duration and lack of any other symptoms, it’s probably a benign case of persistent hiccups. We can try a few things, though. I can prescribe a medication sometimes used to help with hiccups, but it has potential side effects. Or, we can simply monitor it for another 24-48 hours. If it continues beyond that, or if you develop any other symptoms – shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain – you need to come back immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hmm. A medication with side effects… hic That doesn’t sound ideal. 24-48 hours, you say? hic And if it doesn’t stop, or if something else happens… hic I understand. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? hic Apart from the sugar and the jumping, of course? I’m starting to feel a bit foolish even mentioning those things. hic
DOCTOR: Those are…unreliable, shall we say. Try sipping on ice water slowly. Small sips. And try to avoid carbonated beverages, as they can sometimes worsen hiccups. Honestly, most cases resolve on their own. I suspect this one will too. I’ll make a note of this, and we’ll see you back if things don’t improve. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. hic Sip ice water, avoid fizzy drinks… hic It sounds… manageable. hic I suppose I just wanted to make sure it wasn’t anything serious. hic Thank you, Doctor Batara. hic I appreciate your time. I’ll try the water, and I’ll be back if it continues. hic
DOCTOR: Alright. Get some rest. And try not to worry. It’s…just hiccups. Here's a summary of our visit. Come back if anything changes. Next!
