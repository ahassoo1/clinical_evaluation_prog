DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco, good to see you. Though, frankly, at your age, most people are here for something. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… well, it’s my chest. Hurts when I take a big breath. Not all the time, just… when I try to take a good, deep one. It’s… hard to explain. It's been a little while, honestly. I don't really keep track of things like that anymore.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Chest pain with deep breaths. “A little while” isn’t very specific, Mr. Ruocco. Try to think… has it been days?
PATIENT: Days… maybe a week? Or two? Everything kinda…blurs together after a while, you know? I just noticed it enough to… well, to come in. I don’t usually bother with doctors. They never really… helped much in the past. Is this going to be a long visit? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Well, we need to figure out why your chest hurts before we decide if it needs to be a long visit, Mr. Ruocco. "Things to do" is fair, but ignoring chest pain isn't usually wise. It could be a number of things. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me think… not really. Same old routine. Wake up, eat something… try to fix things around the house. My daughter visits sometimes, but that’s… not new. I did help my grandson with some… building stuff last week. He’s learning carpentry. Maybe that… strained something? I don’t know. I just feel… old, you know? Everything aches.
DOCTOR: “Everything aches” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Ruocco. And carpentry could contribute, yes, but we still need to rule out other possibilities. Let’s try to pinpoint this chest pain. Is it a sharp pain?
PATIENT: Sharp… no, not really sharp. More like… a dull ache. Like someone is sitting on my chest, a little bit. And it gets worse when I try to really fill my lungs. It doesn't really hurt when I'm just… resting. Does that make any sense? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things. I used to be stronger, could lift anything, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, worse with deep breaths… Alright. Have you had any coughing, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Coughing? Not much. A little, sometimes, in the mornings. Just a tickle in my throat. Nothing serious. Old man cough, I guess. It hasn't been… bad enough to worry about. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit years and years ago. Does that matter? I don't even think about it anymore. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: “Old man cough” and a history of smoking absolutely matters, Mr. Ruocco. It suggests possible lung issues. Alright. Let’s do a quick listen to your lungs, if you don’t mind. Just breathe normally. I need to see what's going on in there. Then we’ll go from there.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Fine. But I don’t like doctors poking around. Makes me nervous. Just… try to be quick, please? And don’t tell me everything that’s wrong. I don't want to know. It'll just upset my daughter. I just want it fixed, whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Deep breaths, if you can. Okay. Your breathing sounds… a little wheezy, and a bit diminished on the left side. Have you ever had pneumonia, or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Pneumonia… bronchitis… uh… maybe? A long time ago. When my daughter was little, I think. I was sick in bed for a week. But I don’t really remember. It was… so long ago. They just gave me something to drink and told me to rest. I don't even know what they gave me. My memory… it's just not what it used to be. This is all making me tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Given your history of smoking, your age, the wheezing I heard, and the pain with deep breaths, I’m going to order a chest X-ray. It’s just a precaution, to rule out anything serious, like pneumonia or… other lung issues. We need to see what’s going on in there, definitively. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never really had a problem with any medicine they gave me. Although... once, a long time ago, I think I got a rash. But it could have been anything. Mosquito bite, maybe. I don’t really pay attention to those things. Look, are you going to give me a shot? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: No shot right now, Mr. Ruocco. Just the X-ray. We need to get a referral order for that first. We'll have to go to the imaging center down the street. And no, I'm not going to "give you something" until we know what's wrong, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. No shots. Imaging center, you said? Is it far? My legs aren't what they used to be. And... will it cost a lot? I don't have much money, you know. My daughter helps out, but... I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: It’s a few blocks down the street, Mr. Ruocco, but it’s a fairly flat walk. And I understand your financial concerns. I’ll have the front desk staff check if there are any reduced-cost options available at the imaging center, or if we can find a charity that can assist with the cost. We'll do what we can. Here's the order for the X-ray. Take this to the imaging center, and they'll schedule an appointment for you. They'll send the results back to me, and we'll discuss them next week. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Next week… okay. I think so. The imaging center… and then you get the results… and then… talk? Will my daughter have to come with me? She’s busy, you know. I don’t like bothering her. And… what if it’s bad? I don't want to worry her needlessly. Just… try to make it quick, alright?
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I understand your concerns, but I can’t tell you definitively what the X-ray will show before we have the results. That’s why we’re doing it. Your daughter doesn’t need to come with you, but it's always good to have support. And please don't worry about "needlessly" worrying her. It's better to be informed. We'll discuss the results together next week. In the meantime, if your pain worsens, or you develop a fever or shortness of breath, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room… okay. I understand. Pain worse… fever… shortness of breath… got it. Alright. I think that’s enough for today. I just want to go home and rest now. This is all… a lot. Thank you… I guess. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Get some rest. And please, don't hesitate to seek immediate care if you need it. The front desk will assist you with scheduling a follow-up appointment for next week.
