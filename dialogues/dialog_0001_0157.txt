DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Tasmia Dudney, 26. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t even know why I’m here. My husband made me come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Right. Your husband. And the phone call…was this a new diagnosis, or have you been told before?
PATIENT: New. Completely new. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. I eat… normal. He just checked my pressure at home with one of those things and got all worked up. It was probably just because I had a little bit of salt with my eggs this morning. He makes such a big deal out of everything.
DOCTOR: "Normal." That’s… helpful. Look, I appreciate a concerned spouse, but we still need to figure out what’s going on. We can't dismiss things just because you feel alright. Let’s take a look at your chart here… Height 184, weight 104… okay. Just to be sure, have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: One-eighty-four, yes. And 104 is my weight, always has been. I’m…thin-boned, okay? My grandma was tiny too. And no, nothing. Never. I don’t get sick, I don’t need doctors. This is a waste of my time, honestly.
DOCTOR: "Thin-boned" doesn't explain elevated blood pressure. And ignoring a potential problem won’t make it disappear. Fine. Let's just get this over with. I'll need to check your blood pressure myself, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we'll talk. Sit up, please.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But don’t expect anything. It’s probably just nerves from being here. I hate hospitals. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Don't worry, this isn't a hospital. It's a clinic. And “nerves” can certainly affect your blood pressure, but we still need a baseline. Relax your arm… and try to breathe normally. 162 over 98… seriously?
PATIENT: See? It’s probably just this place. Everything’s so…clinical. My husband and his worrying. It’s messing with me. Is that all? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Don’t interrupt. I’m trying to listen to your heart. Heart sounds are… normal, but a bit fast. Lungs are clear. Okay. We need to talk about this pressure reading. 162 over 98 is not normal, regardless of your “nerves.” It requires further investigation. Have you ever had any kidney problems?
PATIENT: Kidney problems? Absolutely not. Why would I have kidney problems? I drink plenty of water. My husband probably thinks I have kidney problems now too, just to add to the list. This is ridiculous. I feel perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not trying to upset you. But ignoring high blood pressure can lead to serious complications – stroke, heart attack… things you definitely don't want. We need to rule things out. I'm ordering some blood work and a urine test to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home, twice a day, for a week.
PATIENT: Monitor it? Twice a day? That's… a lot. And what if it's still high? Will I have to come back here? Honestly, I don't even know why I agreed to this. My husband is going to be thrilled. Just get it over with, okay? The tests. Whatever.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will likely have to come back. That's the point of testing. Here. Take these to the lab down the hall. They'll draw some blood and collect a urine sample. Then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. It's right through there. And try to relax. Worrying will raise your blood pressure, you know. Next!
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. This is a complete waste of my time. And my husband will never let me live this down.
