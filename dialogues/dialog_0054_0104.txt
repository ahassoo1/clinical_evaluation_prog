DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time. My throat… it hurts. Has been hurting for a bit now. Is that enough? I need to get back to work, you see. Important things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time and your throat is sore. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. "A bit now" is a little vague though – could you tell me roughly how long it's been hurting?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? Days, I suppose. Maybe a week? It all feels the same. I don’t really keep track of these things. Work is… demanding. It’s not like I can just stop and write down when my throat started bothering me. It just… is. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me that. A week, okay. And I completely understand work being demanding; we'll definitely try to keep this brief. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It hurts. What more is there to say? It’s scratchy, I suppose. And… uncomfortable. When I swallow, it’s worse. It feels like… sandpaper. Honestly, Doctor, are you a doctor or are you trying to write a novel? Just tell me what’s wrong and how to fix it. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem tedious. I'm just trying to get a clear picture of what’s happening so I can help you best. "Sandpaper" is a helpful description, thank you. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I haven’t been looking for symptoms. I have a job to do. I feel… tired, maybe? Everyone is tired. Is that a symptom? And… no, that’s it. Just tired. Honestly, I don’t see why I need to list every little thing. It’s a sore throat, Doctor, not a complicated illness.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness. And just to clarify, no fever, no cough, no runny nose, no body aches?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. No fever, no cough, no… runny nose. Goodness. No. Just the throat. And the tiredness, which I already told you. Are you writing all this down? It feels like a waste of time. I really need to get back to work. We have quotas, you see. Very important quotas.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am taking notes. Alright, let's do a quick examination of your throat, just to get a visual. And I'll listen to your lungs as well. It shouldn't take more than a minute or two. Could you open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: There. Done. Can we be finished now? Honestly, I don’t like anyone looking in my throat. It’s… personal. I need to get back.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I see some mild redness in the back of your throat, and your tonsils are a little swollen. No obvious white spots or pus. Your lungs sound clear. Now, have you had any recent exposure to anyone who's been sick?
PATIENT: Sick? Exposure? What are you, a detective? I work with a lot of people, Doctor. Hundreds. I don’t keep track of who has a sniffle and who doesn’t. We’re a factory. People get sick. It’s… inevitable. Honestly, it’s probably just the air. Dusty, you know? Very dusty. Is this going to take much longer? I have a shift supervisor who is not known for his patience.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Given your symptoms – the sore throat, mild redness, and no fever or other signs of a more serious infection – it sounds most likely like a viral pharyngitis, commonly known as a sore throat. The dust at the factory could certainly be contributing to the irritation as well. Now, these usually resolve on their own within a week or so. I recommend plenty of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Throat lozenges or gargling with warm salt water can also help soothe the discomfort. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don't have time for allergies. I take what I need to get through the day. Honestly, I've never even thought about allergies. Just… no. No allergies. Can you just write me a note or something? So I can go back to work? My shift starts soon. And I really don't want to lose a day's pay. Is there anything else? Because I truly haven't got a moment longer.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, good to know. I can certainly write a note for your employer stating that you've been seen for a sore throat and are advised to rest as needed. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding close contact with others if possible to prevent spreading any potential virus. Do you have any underlying medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Underlying… conditions? Goodness. No. I’m… fine. Always have been. Always will be. I work hard. That's all. I don’t have time for… conditions. Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. Just give me the note and let me go. I really, really need to get back to work. I'm starting to feel very stressed, and stress is bad for my quotas. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Ottaviani. Here’s a note excusing you for a sore throat and recommending rest as needed. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain – please seek medical attention immediately. I understand you're busy, but it's important to prioritize your health. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
