DOCTOR: Hi Lacreasha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It's... my nails. They just look wrong. I don’t even know how to explain. They ain't been lookin' right for... a while now, I guess. Not sure when exactly, though. Everything feels kinda blurry these days, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not right” is a good starting point. Can you describe what's different about them?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, the color. It's not... pink, like they should be. More... yellowish. And thick. They feel real thick. And kinda... crumbly. Like old cheese, almost. Not that I eat a lot of cheese. My sister does, though. She loves cheese. But my nails… just awful. I keep tryin' to file 'em down, but it don't seem to help none.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish, thick, and crumbly… that gives me a better idea. And you’ve noticed this for a while now. Do you have any pain or discomfort in your nails or the surrounding skin?
PATIENT: Pain? Nah, not really. A little itchy sometimes, maybe. But mostly just… annoyed. It's just… unsightly. I like keepin' things neat, ya know? A lady's gotta have nice nails. It's important. But these… they just ain't it. I don’t understand why they’re doin’ this to me. I haven't done nothin' different!
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just some occasional itchiness and it's bothering you cosmetically. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your skin around your nails – redness, swelling, or any cuts or infections?
PATIENT: Oh… lemme see. Now that you mention it… the skin around one of ‘em… the big toe one… it’s kinda… puffy. Not a lot, but yeah, puffy. And a little red, I think. But I thought that was just from… shoes, maybe? I wear boots a lot. They’re comfy, but not always the prettiest. I dunno. Everything's blurry, remember? It could be anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy and slightly red skin around your big toe nail. That’s helpful. And you said you've noticed this along with the color and thickness. Now, have you had any injuries to your nails recently – like stubbing your toe or anything like that?
PATIENT: Injuries? Hmmm… Now that's a good question. I do trip a lot. Old house, ya know? Floors ain't even. But I don't remember hurtin' my toes particularly bad. Maybe a little bump here and there. But nothin' major. I always wear slippers inside, though. Gotta protect the feet, ya know? My mama always said that. But I really can’t say for sure if I bumped it or not. Everything just… fades.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major remembered injuries. And you mentioned wearing slippers. Good. Let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh goodness no! I eat pretty healthy, mostly. I like my sweets, but I don’t go crazy with ‘em. Thyroid… now that I don’t know about. Never been told I had anything wrong with my thyroid. I go to the doctor sometimes, but they never talk about… things like that. Just give me my shots and send me on my way. Medicare doesn’t cover a lot, ya know? They just want to keep me alive, not healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known diabetes or thyroid problems. And you're on Medicare, so we'll keep that in mind as we go. Do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Just… a little somethin’ for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a few years back. Little white pill. Can’t remember the name of it, though. And allergies… no, not really. I mean, I sneeze sometimes in the spring, but everyone does, right? I'm not one of those fussy people who's allergic to everything. Just normal sneezes. Not a big deal.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure, and no known allergies. That’s good to know. Alright, let’s take a look at your nails. I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Just so I can get a better look. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, go ahead. Just be gentle, alright? They’re sensitive. And try not to take too long. I got things to do, ya know? Not important things, but… things. Hurry up though, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. The discoloration is quite noticeable, and the thickness is significant, especially on this big toe. There is some thickening and crumbling, and as you mentioned, some mild puffiness and redness around the base of the nail. No discharge or odor at this time. It feels warm to the touch, but no significant pain with palpation. I don’t feel any lumps or bumps under the skin. It does appear to be localized to this one nail mostly.
PATIENT: Localized, huh? What does that mean? Is it… bad? Is it gonna fall off? My sister’s got good nails, always perfect. She gets ‘em done all the time. I just want mine to look normal again. I don't want nothin' fallin' off, alright? That'd be awful. And messy. I hate mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, "localized" just means it's mostly happening on one nail, rather than all of them. And no, it’s unlikely to fall off completely, but we need to figure out what's causing it. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, it's likely a fungal infection of the nail, also known as onychomycosis. It's pretty common, especially with changes in the nail color, thickness, and texture. But we should rule out other possibilities. To be sure, I'd like to send a small piece of your nail to a lab for testing. It's a quick and painless procedure, we just scrape off a tiny bit of the nail. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: A fungus? Oh, goodness. Like… mold? That sounds… disgusting. Like somethin' growin' on me. I don't like that at all. But… if you gotta know, I guess. So it's not just my shoes? As long as it's quick, though. I don't want to be here all day. What do they do with the piece of nail? Do they grow more fungus? I really don't want more fungus.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. It's not quite like mold growing in your house. It’s a specific type of fungus that thrives in dark, moist environments, like under nails. And no, they don’t grow more fungus in the lab! They examine it under a microscope to identify the type of fungus. It’s just to confirm the diagnosis. It's a quick and painless scraping, and it will help us determine the best treatment. We’ll just take a small sample from the affected nail, it’ll only take a minute. Then we’ll send it to the lab and get the results back in about a week or so. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A week? That seems like a long time to wait. But… alright, I guess. Just… be quick about it, alright? And don't poke me. I don't like bein' poked. And tell me exactly what you’re doin' the whole time. I wanna know everything. Don’t want any surprises. And no growin' fungus, you promise?
DOCTOR: Okay, I promise no growing fungus! I'm just going to gently file a tiny bit of the nail surface, then use a small tool to collect a sample. It might feel like a slight pressure or scraping sensation, but it shouldn’t be painful. “Okay, I’m just gently filing the surface of the nail now… just a little bit… good. And now I’m going to collect a small sample from under the nail… there we go… all done.” “All finished. Just a small bandage to protect the area. You can remove it later today. The lab will contact us with the results in about a week. In the meantime, try to keep your feet clean and dry, and avoid wearing tight shoes. I’ll also give you a paper with some instructions to take home.”
PATIENT: Alright, good. Over with. That wasn’t too bad. Still don't like the idea of a fungus though. So, what happens after you find out what kinda fungus it is? Do I gotta take pills? I don't like takin' pills. They make me feel… funny. And I'm already takin' one for my blood pressure. And what if it's really bad? Will I have to get the whole nail removed? My sister said that's awful. She said it hurts for weeks. No, I definitely don’t want the whole nail removed. Don't even mention it! I like my nails, even if they look awful right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. Let's talk about the treatment options. The treatment will depend on the type of fungus and the severity of the infection. Often, we start with topical antifungal medications, which you apply to the nail like a nail polish. Those are usually the first step and don’t have the side effects of pills. We can also prescribe oral antifungal medications, but we usually reserve those for more severe infections or when the topical medications aren’t working. We’ll discuss all the options and their potential side effects before making any decisions, okay?
PATIENT: Topical… like a polish? That sounds alright. Better than pills, for sure. And I can do that myself? I'm pretty good at paintin' my nails, if I do say so myself. Though they haven't been lookin' too good lately. But I definitely don't want anything removed. Promise me. Promise me you won't make me get the whole nail removed. My sister said it's the worst. And it's expensive, right? Everything is so expensive these days. And how long does it take to get better? A week? A month? A year? I got things to do, ya know? I don’t wanna be stuck dealin’ with a fungus forever.
DOCTOR: I promise we will try all other options before considering nail removal, okay?
PATIENT: I’m holdin’ you to that, alright? Now, tell me about this… waitin’ period. A week? A month? A year? Is it gonna be itchy? Will it spread to my other nails? I don’t want all my nails lookin’ like this! That’d be a disaster. And… will I have to change my shoes? I like my boots. They’re comfy. But… if the fungus spreads… oh, goodness. This is awful. This is a disaster.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's try to stay calm. It usually takes several months to see improvement with antifungal treatment. The fungus grows slowly, so it takes time to kill it. It can take up to a year or longer for the nail to grow out completely healthy, so it’s a process. And it can spread to other nails if left untreated, but with proper treatment, we can prevent that. We’ll talk about ways to prevent the spread, like keeping your feet clean and dry, avoiding tight shoes, and not sharing nail clippers. I’m writing you a prescription for a topical antifungal medication. Apply it to the affected nail as directed on the label, and let me know if you have any questions. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in about three months to check your progress. And if you have any concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a sheet with more detailed instructions and some helpful tips. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Three months? Oh, goodness. That's a long time. Alright. I guess I’ll try it. But if it doesn’t work… or if it gets worse… I’m comin’ straight back here, and you better have another plan! And don’t you dare mention removin’ my nail! And… thank you. I guess. It's just… this whole fungus thing is awful. Really awful. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lacreasha. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to help. Just remember to follow the instructions carefully, and we’ll see how it goes. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in three months. .
