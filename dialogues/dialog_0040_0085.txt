DOCTOR: Right. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… well, it’s my skin. It’s gotten… patchy. Not a good patchy, you understand. It’s just… discolored in places. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it’s not getting worse, exactly, but it’s certainly not better. It's rather unsightly, honestly.
DOCTOR: Patchy, you say. Right. And how long exactly is a few weeks?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… approximately three and a half weeks. I keep a very precise calendar, you see. It began the 17th of July. I was preparing for my husband’s cousin’s birthday, and I noticed it while applying sunscreen. Honestly, one really should apply sunscreen even on cloudy days, but one doesn't always, does one? It’s just… noticeable now. And I do try to maintain a certain appearance.
DOCTOR: Sunscreen. Okay. And where exactly is this…patchiness?
PATIENT: Well, it's primarily on my forearms. Both of them, thankfully symmetrical, which is… something, I suppose. And a little bit on the back of my neck, where I can't quite reach to apply anything myself. My husband offers, but he's rather clumsy, you see. He gets it everywhere. It's not a uniform discoloration, mind you. It’s… blotchy. Like someone spilled tea, but not a very good tea.
DOCTOR: Right. Blotchy. Well, let's have a look. Roll up your sleeves, please. And turn around. Honestly, people and their…skin.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. I do hope you have a comfortable chair. These examination tables are simply dreadful. And please, do try not to be too rough. My skin is quite sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. Some hypopigmentation. Likely from…sun exposure. And a little bit of dryness. Honestly, it's not that bad. Have you been using a moisturizer?
PATIENT: Hypo…what now? Honestly, I prefer plain English. And of course I’ve been using moisturizer! I use a very reputable brand, imported from France. It has shea butter and hyaluronic acid. I’m not entirely ignorant, you know. It's simply not working. That’s why I’m here. And it’s not just a little dryness, it’s… uneven. And it’s rather distracting when I’m gardening, which is my primary hobby.
DOCTOR: Right, right. French moisturizer. Look, it’s probably just a mild case of dermatitis. Try switching to a different brand. Something…less fancy. And avoid prolonged sun exposure. Honestly, people and their…complexities.
PATIENT: Oh, dermatitis? Good heavens. I’ve never been prone to… rashes or anything of the sort. I’m quite fastidious about my hygiene, you see. And "less fancy"? Are you suggesting my taste is… inferior? Honestly, that’s rather condescending. I came here for a diagnosis, not a lecture on skincare brands. And what if it isn’t just the moisturizer? What if it’s something… serious? It’s rather alarming to dismiss it so readily.
DOCTOR: Look, I've seen hundreds of cases like this. It’s usually nothing. But if you're truly concerned, I can refer you to a dermatologist. Honestly, it’ll likely be a waste of your time and money, but…fine. Here’s the referral information. I need to see other patients. Next!
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… terribly abrupt. A dermatologist. Honestly, I was hoping for a more… thorough examination. And a more reassuring explanation. But very well. Thank you, I suppose. Though I must say, your bedside manner leaves something to be desired. It’s a shame, really. I’d heard such good things about this clinic. .
