DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't really have time for a lot of chit-chat. It's… my stomach. It's been bloated. Just feels full of air, mostly. I dunno, it's annoying. Can we just figure out what's wrong and get it over with?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I understand you’re short on time, and we’ll get right to it. Bloating, you said. And it feels mostly like air?
PATIENT: Yeah, air. Like I ate a whole balloon or something. It comes and goes, but it's been worse lately. Honestly, it's been going on for… a while now. I don't keep track of that stuff. Is it something serious? Because I got work to do. Pile driving doesn't wait for a sensitive stomach, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, pile driving. That does sound physically demanding. And you're right to want to get this sorted. “A while now…” Can you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Look, I lost my wife a few years back, okay? My memory ain’t what it used to be. Months? Maybe longer. It's not like it suddenly started yesterday. It just… gradually got worse. Does that work for you? I really don’t remember dates or anything. It’s just… there. And puffy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Kristofik. I apologize for pressing you on the dates, and I understand completely. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult. It’s perfectly normal for things to feel… less clear during times of grief. So, the bloating has been gradually worsening over months. Are there any particular times of day it’s worse?
PATIENT: It's… after I eat, usually. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Steak, salad, doesn't seem to make a difference. And sometimes at night. I wake up feeling like a beach ball. It’s uncomfortable, to say the least. Look, I eat pretty simple. I need energy for work, not gourmet meals. I don’t have time for fancy foods or… stomach problems. Is it something I ate? Or is it… something else?
DOCTOR: Okay, after eating, and sometimes at night. No specific foods seem to trigger it. And it’s impacting your sleep. I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind, just to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Seriously? Look, I don't need to discuss that with a doctor. It’s… private. Is this necessary? Can’t you just give me something to, I don’t know, deflate me? I got a job to do. People are counting on me. I’m not here for a full physical, I’m here because I feel like I’m going to float away.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Kristofik. I apologize if that was too personal. It is important information, but we can absolutely skip that question for now. Let’s focus on what’s bothering you. You mentioned it’s been impacting your work. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the bloating – any pain, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Pain, sometimes. Dull ache, mostly. Lower stomach. Not terrible, but annoying. No vomiting. And no weight loss, I haven’t exactly been weighing myself. I’m a working man, I don’t have time for that stuff. Look, it’s just… uncomfortable. It makes it harder to concentrate when I'm up on the rig. It’s distracting. Is that enough for you? Just… distracting and uncomfortable. I need to be focused. People's lives depend on it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Distracting and uncomfortable, with a dull ache in the lower stomach. Okay. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just listening to your abdomen and feeling for any tenderness. It’ll only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. The quicker this is done, the better. I got a schedule to keep. Don't poke around too much, alright? I'm a tough guy, but I don't need a full-blown examination over some bloating. Just listen and poke a little and tell me what I need to do. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie down on the exam table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with this, and then I’ll gently press on different areas to check for tenderness. Let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Okay. I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds. There's a little bit of tenderness to the touch in the lower abdomen, on both sides, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. No masses that I can feel. It doesn’t sound like anything acutely dangerous, but the tenderness does suggest some inflammation.
PATIENT: Inflammation? What does that mean? Is it serious? Look, I don't need medical jargon. Just tell me what's wrong and what I need to do to fix it. I’m not a doctor, I drive a pile driver. Can you give me something for it? Something to… calm things down? I really don't have time for a complicated diagnosis.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration. "Inflammation" just means there’s some irritation in your digestive system. It's not necessarily serious, but it is causing your discomfort. Based on what you've told me – the bloating, the pain, and the fact that it doesn’t seem to be related to what you eat – it could be a few things. One possibility is Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. Another could be some mild gastritis, or inflammation of the stomach lining. We'd need to do some further testing to be certain. For now, I’m going to recommend a trial of some simple dietary changes. Try avoiding carbonated drinks, and see if reducing your intake of dairy and gluten helps. Also, I can prescribe something to help manage the bloating and discomfort. A medication called simethicone can help relieve gas. It's over the counter, but I can write you a prescription if you prefer.
PATIENT: Dietary changes? Seriously? I eat what keeps me going. And avoiding gluten… that sounds like a lot of hassle. Look, I'm a simple man. Steak and potatoes. That's what I eat. I don't have time for fancy diets. Fine. Give me the… simethicone. Whatever that is. Just get it over with. And tell me honestly… is this going to keep me off the rig? Because if it is, I'm not happy. My crew is counting on me. People need me to do this job. It's not about me. It’s about getting things done. Is it going to keep me from working? That's all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. I’ve just sent the prescription to your pharmacy. Simethicone is a gas relief medication. It’s generally very safe and shouldn’t interfere with your ability to work. It's not a cure, but it should help manage the bloating and discomfort. Based on what you've described, I don't anticipate this keeping you off the rig. However, if the symptoms worsen or if you develop a fever, severe pain, or changes in your bowel habits – like blood in your stool – then you absolutely need to see a doctor right away. I’m also going to recommend a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you're doing. If the simethicone isn't helping, we can discuss further testing – like a stool sample or possibly a referral to a gastroenterologist. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Two weeks? Fine. Whatever. Just… don't expect me to be happy about it. I got a job to do. Look, I appreciate you not telling me I need to completely change my life. I'll try the… simethicone. And I'll come back in two weeks if I have to. But honestly, I'm busy. People are counting on me. I got a rig to run. Is that it? Can I go now? I really need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kristofik, that’s it for today. Here’s a summary sheet with everything we discussed. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I wish you all the best on the rig. Be safe. .
