DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tremor, that's what the nice lady on the phone said I was here for. Honestly, I don't recall much about making the appointment...it just seemed like a good idea at the time, I suppose. It's in my hands, mostly. Shaky. It’s been…well, a while.
DOCTOR: A tremor, alright. And it’s been ongoing for “a while,” you say. Can you be a bit more specific about how long?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. That’s a tough one. Years, I reckon. Maybe five? Ten? It comes and goes, you see. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times…well, trying to hold a cup of coffee is a real adventure. I used to work with pipes, lots of little valves… made things tricky near the end. Not that I remember exactly when I stopped, mind you. Things get… foggy.
DOCTOR: Foggy, you say. Alright. And is it just your hands that are affected, or do you notice the shaking in other parts of your body as well?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… sometimes my leg will jump a bit when I'm trying to sit still. Not always, mind you, and it's not a big jump, just… a little twitch. And sometimes, rarely, my voice feels a bit shaky too, like it’s got a wobble. But it's mostly the hands, definitely. See? It's not constant, though. That’s the frustrating part.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see a slight tremor there at rest. It's subtle, as you said. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. Stress, I think. Definitely stress. And…caffeine. Used to drink a lot of coffee, back when I was working. Didn’t seem to bother me much then, but now… a little bit and I’m rattling like a tin can. Also… if I get really tired. Late at night, trying to read…that’s when it really acts up. It's mostly just annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for anything, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Not regularly, no. I had some pills for my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor took me off them. Said I was feeling better, and it was causing some… side effects, I think. Something about dizziness. I haven’t been on anything since then, though. Just some vitamins now and then, but that’s about it. I mostly try to avoid doctors and pills if I can, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t been stung by a bee since I was a little boy. Oh, wait. I think I got a bit of a rash once from some poison ivy when I was hiking… but that wasn’t an allergy, just a bit of bad luck, I suppose. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s a tough one. My parents are both gone now, and I wasn't particularly close to my siblings. I know my father had some trouble with his… joints, I think. Arthritis, maybe? And my mother… she was always a bit forgetful, now that I think about it. But beyond that… I couldn’t tell you. It was a long time ago, and I never paid much attention to those sorts of things. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, I'm divorced. Been divorced for… a long time. I used to live with my wife on a farm, but that was years ago. Now I live alone in a small apartment in town. I don't really have any close friends or family nearby. I keep to myself mostly. Used to enjoy gardening, but it’s a bit hard with the shaking, you see. Not much of a social life these days, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Jezik, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you've been experiencing a tremor for several years, which is worsened by stress, caffeine, and fatigue. I’m going to perform a brief neurological examination to assess this further. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, Doctor, I think so. My eyes aren't what they used to be, but I’ll try my best. Just let me know if I’m messing it up. And… how long will this examination take? I’ve got a bit of an appointment later, you see.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t take long. Just follow the pen with your eyes… good. Now look to your left… good. And now to your right… Excellent. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, alright… getting a bit blurry, but I’m trying. There. Is that okay? It’s a bit hard to get a good grip, you see. Not as strong as it used to be. Am I doing it right?
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to lightly tap on your knee with this small hammer. Just relax your leg. Hmm. And now the other side. Okay. Now, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright… careful now. Old bones, you know. There. Is that okay? A bit wobbly, I'm afraid. It’s hard to get moving sometimes. Should I… should I stop?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, that's enough. Please, sit back down. Okay, Mr. Jezik. Based on the examination, and what you've told me, your tremor, along with the weakness in your hands and slow gait, suggests possible Parkinson's Disease. However, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We need to rule out other potential causes. I'm going to order some blood work, including a thyroid panel and vitamin levels, and I’d also like you to have a brain MRI. This will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Brain MRI…? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And expensive, probably. Look, Doctor, I’m not really one for tests and scans and… all that. Is it really necessary? I mean, it’s just a bit of a tremor, isn’t it? I’ve lived with it for years. Perhaps a different medication? Something to calm my nerves, maybe? I really don’t want to go through all that trouble.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns. However, a brain MRI is crucial to rule out other possibilities, such as a stroke or a tumor, that could be causing your symptoms. While the tremor may seem minor to you, the weakness and slow gait are concerning and warrant further investigation. Ignoring these symptoms could lead to more serious complications down the line. As for medication, while I can prescribe something for anxiety, it won’t address the underlying cause of your symptoms. It's important to get an accurate diagnosis before starting any treatment. I understand your financial concerns, and I can connect you with resources to help with the cost of the MRI, if needed. I truly believe that getting this imaging done is the best course of action. Do you have any further questions about the MRI procedure itself?
PATIENT: Resources… you mean paperwork? I’m terrible with paperwork. And… a machine… going inside my head? It sounds… frightening. I don’t know, Doctor. I really don't. I just… I want to go home. I’m tired, and all this talk is making my tremor worse, I think. Is it absolutely necessary? Could we… could we try something else first? Maybe a referral to a neurologist… just to get a second opinion? I don't want to be stuck in a machine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. I understand your hesitation. While I still strongly recommend the MRI, I am willing to compromise. I can refer you to a neurologist for a second opinion. They will likely recommend the MRI as well, but you can discuss your concerns with them directly. However, please understand that delaying a proper diagnosis can potentially worsen your condition. The neurologist is Dr. Anya Volkov, and she’s located about an hour away. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Here is the referral information. I'm also going to prescribe a low dose medication to help with your anxiety while you await your appointment. It may not solve the underlying issue, but it can hopefully provide some temporary relief. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: An hour away… that’s a long drive. And a neurologist… more tests, probably. Alright, alright… I’ll make the appointment. But I’m not promising anything about the MRI, you understand. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… patient with me. I think that’s all I can manage for today. Hopefully, this neurologist can shed some light on things. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Jezik. Please, let my office know if you have any difficulties scheduling the appointment. And remember, if your symptoms worsen significantly before your appointment, please seek immediate medical attention. Have a safe trip, and take care of yourself. .
