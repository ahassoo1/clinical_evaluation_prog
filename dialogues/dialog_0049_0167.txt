DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my foot is… botherin’ me. It’s got a sore, a bad one. Been there a little while now. It hurts to walk, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. A sore on your foot, causing you pain with walking. Can you tell me a little more about this sore?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it started small, like a little cut. Didn't think much of it at first. But it just… didn't get better. Now it’s… red, and kinda deep. And it smells a little, if I’m honest. I try to keep it clean, but… it’s hard. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes.
DOCTOR: Red, deep, and with a bit of an odor… and located on the bottom of your foot near your toes. How long would you say it’s been there, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time gets away from an old man. Maybe… six, seven weeks now? Something like that. It’s hard to say exactly. It was small for a long time, then it got worse quicker. I didn’t come in right away because… well, I hoped it would just heal on its own. You know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. People often do. And have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? You mean… like pus? Yes, a little bit. It’s… not a lot, but it’s there. A clear… sometimes a little yellow. I wipe it up with a cloth, of course. It makes the sock dirty. It's not pleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some clear to yellowish drainage. And you said it’s been present for roughly six to seven weeks. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or swelling in your leg or foot recently?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I know of. I haven't taken my temperature. Chills, no. My leg… it feels a little warm sometimes, but I thought that was just from the heat. Swelling… maybe a little, but not much. It's hard to tell with these old legs, you know? They swell up for all sorts of reasons.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, yes. A little bit. Especially in my little toe. It feels… kinda prickly sometimes. Not all the time, but when I walk, I notice it. I thought it was just my shoes. Old shoes, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Stoegbauer, it sounds like we need to take a closer look. I'm going to perform a physical exam of your foot. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want this sore to get better. It’s keepin’ me from my garden, you see. And an old man needs his garden.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please have a seat. I’ll need you to remove your shoe and sock on that foot, if you’re able. I'll need to check the circulation and sensation, and of course, assess the wound itself.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Here we go… it’s a little tight today. Getting old, you know. There you are. Be gentle, now. It’s been botherin’ me a good while.
DOCTOR: Hmm… yes, I see. There is a significant ulceration present on the plantar aspect of your foot, near the base of your fifth toe. There’s some surrounding erythema and induration. It does appear to be draining a small amount of purulent material, as you described. And your sensation does seem diminished in the area surrounding the wound. I'm also noting some diminished peripheral pulses in your foot, which is concerning. We will need to get this cultured.
PATIENT: Cultured? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? I’m not good with all the medical words, you see. Will it hurt? I just want to know what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: A culture simply means we'll take a small sample from the sore to identify what type of bacteria is causing the infection. It's a standard procedure. It will involve a brief, mild pinch, like a tiny needle stick, but shouldn’t be excessively painful. It’s important to know what we’re dealing with so we can prescribe the correct antibiotics. Given the diminished sensation and pulses, I'm concerned about a potential underlying infection, and possibly some degree of peripheral arterial disease. We should also consider whether this could be a diabetic ulcer, even if you haven't been previously diagnosed. Do you have a history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, not that I know of. My doctor… the old one, before he retired… never said anything about that. I get a check-up every year, but he just checked my heart and blood pressure. Never mentioned sugar or anything. I do drink a little juice sometimes… and I like my sweets, I’ll admit. But diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Could this sore be from that? That doesn’t sound good.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, even without a prior diagnosis, diabetes can sometimes present with foot ulcers. It's something we need to rule out. I’m going to order a blood glucose test, along with a complete blood count and a wound culture, as I mentioned. I also want to get an Ankle-Brachial Index done, which measures the blood flow in your legs. It's a non-invasive test. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Not that I know of. I had a little trouble with penicillin when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t taken it since. Otherwise, no allergies that I’m aware of. And what about this index test? Will that hurt too? I’m gettin’ a little worried now, Doctor. This is soundin’ complicated.
DOCTOR: No, the Ankle-Brachial Index won't hurt. It just involves using a Doppler ultrasound to measure the blood pressure in your ankles and arms. It's a quick and painless procedure. Alright, so no known medication allergies. We'll proceed with the blood glucose, CBC, wound culture, and ABI. In the meantime, it's extremely important to keep pressure off of this foot as much as possible. I’m going to order you a specialized walking boot to help with that. And I'm going to have the nurse come in and show you how to properly care for the wound. Depending on the results of these tests, we may need to consult with a podiatrist or a vascular specialist. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A walking boot? Oh, goodness. That sounds… inconvenient. I like to get around, you know? But I suppose if it helps… Okay. And a podiatrist? What do they do? This is a lot to take in. Just tell me… is this serious, Doctor? Is my foot gonna be alright? I just wanna be able to walk again without pain. And get back to my garden.
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, it's good you’re asking these questions. The situation is serious, but that doesn’t mean it’s hopeless. The wound, combined with the diminished sensation and pulses, does suggest a more complex underlying issue. A podiatrist specializes in foot care; they can help with wound debridement, offloading pressure, and specialized dressings. The vascular specialist would assess the blood flow in your legs. We need to get to the root of the problem to prevent this from worsening. I’m ordering these tests to give us a clearer picture. I'll also have the nurse bring in some instructions on proper foot care and signs of infection to watch out for. I want you to understand this could take some time and may require a team approach. But we'll get this figured out. For now, let’s focus on protecting your foot and getting these tests done. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… a team approach… I can handle that. As long as somebody knows what they’re doin’. I just don’t want to lose my foot, Doctor. That’s my biggest worry. So, tests… walking boot… and a nurse comin’ in. And watch for signs of infection… what signs, exactly? I’m not good at rememberin’ things. Maybe you can write it down for me. Just help me keep my foot, Doctor. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Stoegbauer. Here's a sheet outlining the signs of infection to watch out for: increased pain, redness, swelling, pus or drainage, fever, chills, or a foul odor. Please contact us immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. We’ve ordered the tests, and I’ve put in a request for the nurse to come in and assess the wound and go over foot care instructions with you. The walking boot should be available shortly. We’ll review the test results as soon as they come in and discuss the next steps. I’m also going to put a referral in for a podiatry consultation, just to get their opinion early on. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. Signs of infection… increased pain… redness… I can remember that. I think. You've been very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. And gettin’ me help… that means a lot. Hopefully, this won’t be too bad. Now… when should I expect the nurse? And how long will the tests take? I need to plan my gardenin’ schedule, you know. Even sick, an old man worries about his tomatoes.
DOCTOR: The nurse should be in within the hour, Mr. Stoegbauer. As for the tests, the blood work will be relatively quick, results should be available tomorrow morning. The ABI will take a little longer, maybe an hour to complete. I'll have the staff let you know when everything is ready. Now, I have other patients waiting, so I'll let you get settled and wait for the nurse. Please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions. Stop.
