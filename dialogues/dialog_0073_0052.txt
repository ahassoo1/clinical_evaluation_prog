DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to ye, Doctor. Right, well, it's this nausea, see? Been happenin’ most mornings now, for, oh, maybe a couple o’ weeks. It's not terrible, but it’s… unsettling. The nurse asked if it was with my heart, and well, that’s why I'm here, I suppose. They said somethin' about heart failure... it's a bit much to take in, aye?
DOCTOR: Heart failure is… a strong term, Mr. Benic. We need to determine the cause of your nausea before we jump to conclusions. A couple of weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, a couple o’ weeks, give or take. It usually hits soon after I get up. Not every mornin’, mind ye, but enough to worry me. It's a sort o' sick feelin’ in my stomach, nothin’ actually comes up, just… the feelin'. And I feel a wee bit drained after it passes, if that makes sense. I’m usually alright after a bit o’ toast and a cup o’ tea, but it's startin’ to get to me, bein’ unsure if it'll happen each day.
DOCTOR: "A 'sick feeling' and feeling 'drained'… many things can cause that, Mr. Benic. It's rarely anything serious, but we must rule out other possibilities. Do you experience any pain alongside this nausea?
PATIENT: No, not really pain, Doctor. It’s… more of a weakness, I suppose. A sort o’ empty feelin’. And it's not like a stomach bug, not like when I was a lad. No cramps, no… nothin' like that. Just this sick, drained feelin’, like I haven’t quite got my legs under me. It's hard to explain. Does that… does that make any sense at all? I'm terrible at describin’ these things.
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate, Mr. Benic. Now, let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Aye, now that ye mention it... my appetite has been a bit off. Not that I'm not hungry, exactly, but I don’t feel the same urge for food I used to. I used to enjoy a good hearty breakfast, but now… I just pick at things. And sometimes I get full quicker than usual, even with smaller portions. It's not drastic, but definitely noticeable. Could that be part o’ it, do ye think?
DOCTOR: It’s possible. Loss of appetite is… nonspecific, Mr. Benic. We’ll need a more comprehensive picture. Do you have any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: No, not really trouble swallowin’, Doctor. Food goes down alright. It's not like it's stuck or anythin’. I can manage a good plate o’ mince and tatties, no bother. Though, I suppose… sometimes it feels like I need a bit more water with it, just to help it go down smoothly. Is that… is that what ye mean? It's a subtle thing, I haven't mentioned it to anyone before.
DOCTOR: "Subtle things" are often significant, Mr. Benic. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, aye… now that ye ask… things have been a bit… irregular. Not constipation, exactly, but… not as regular as usual, if ye ken what I mean? More frequent trips to the loo, and… well, a bit looser than normal, some days. It’s not cause me any pain, thankfully, but definitely a change. I haven't been keepin’ strict track, if that matters. Just noticed it over the last week or so. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Irregularities" are quite common, Mr. Benic. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Aye, well… I had a wee bit o’ trouble with my heart a few years back. They said somethin’ about it not pumpin’ as well as it should, and they put me on some tablets for it. I've been takin' them regular since then, as instructed. Can’t recall the name o’ them right off hand, I'm terrible with names, both medicine and people, but the nurse will have it on file, I suppose? And I had my appendix out when I was a young lad, but that was a long time ago. Nothin' else, really. Just the usual aches and pains o’ gettin’ older, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. Digoxin and Lisinopril. Very good. And no other surgeries, as you said?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ else, Doctor. Just the appendix when I was a wee lad, and the tablets for my heart, as ye know. And… I had a bad bout o' the flu a couple o' winters ago, but that wasn’t a surgery, just a terrible week in bed with blankets and hot tea. I've always been fairly healthy, to be honest, aside from this heart business. Just tryin’ to get to the bottom o’ this mornin’ sickness, aye? It's just unsettling, feelin' so unsure o' things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. Now, regarding family history… are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well… my father had a bit o’ trouble with his heart as well, later in life. They said somethin’ about it gettin’ weaker, like mine. He was on tablets for it too, I think. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, but she lived to a good age, so it didn’t bother her too much. My brother is fine, as far as I know, keeps himself to himself mostly. Nothin’ else springs to mind, really. We weren't a family for sharin’ medical secrets, ye ken? More of a stoic bunch, we were.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Aye, well, I live alone, Doctor. Always have, really. Never married, no children. I used to work in the library, helpin' folks find books and such. Retired now, a few years back. I enjoy readin’, gardenin’, and a bit o’ walkin’ when the weather's good. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to enjoy a pint or two down the pub with the lads, but I’ve cut back on that a bit these days. Just takin' it easy, ye ken? Nothin' too excitin’. Is there somethin' specific ye're lookin' for?
DOCTOR: Just establishing a complete picture, Mr. Benic. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anythin’ they’ve given me. I've had a few courses o' antibiotics over the years, but no bother. The nurse always asks, and I always say no. Never had a rash, or any difficulty breathin’ after takin’ a tablet. Not that I can recall, anyway. I'm usually alright with most things. Is that alright? I'm startin’ to feel a wee bit silly answerin’ so many questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam now, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm used to check-ups, bein’ on the tablets and all. I’ll just sit here, and ye tell me what ye’re doin’, aye? It always makes me feel a bit better knowin’ what’s happenin’. Just let me know if ye need me to do anythin’. I’m a bit o' a nervous patient, ye see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your heart. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Deep breaths again… in and out. Sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, but no wheezes or crackles auscultated. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and non-tender to palpation. Blood pressure is 140/90. Alright. Everything seems… within normal limits. However, given your history and symptoms, I'd like to order a few blood tests to rule out any underlying issues. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and thyroid levels. Also, an EKG to assess your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If ye think it's best, I'm happy to get the tests done. I just want to know what’s causin’ this feelin’, ye ken? I’m not keen on bein’ left wonderin’. The EKG… is that somethin' painful? I've heard stories. And where will I get these tests done? At this clinic? I live not too far from here, so it would be handy if I could do them nearby.
DOCTOR: No, the EKG is not painful, Mr. Benic. It involves placing a few stickers on your chest. It’s quite simple. And yes, you can have the blood work and EKG done here at the clinic. The nurse will give you the requisitions, and the lab is just down the hall. It shouldn't take too long. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It will probably be a week or so before we get everything back. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Aye, a week or so sounds fine, Doctor. As long as it's gettin' things sorted, I'm happy to wait. A wee bit o' waitin' is nothin' compared to bein' left in the dark, aye? The stickers… sounds alright. I’ll just follow what the nurse tells me. Hopefully they don’t leave a sticky residue, I hate that! And… if it's not too much trouble, could ye remind me what exactly we're lookin' for with these tests? Just so I know what to expect, ye ken? I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: We're primarily looking to rule out any electrolyte imbalances, kidney issues, or thyroid problems that could be contributing to your nausea and fatigue. We'll also assess your heart rhythm with the EKG to ensure it’s stable. It's a standard workup for your symptoms and medical history. It's unlikely to be anything serious, Mr. Benic, but it's best to be thorough. The nurse will explain the process in more detail. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. Ye’ve been very helpful, explainin’ everything so clearly. I’ll just go and speak to the nurse now, and get the tests done. Thank ye for seein’ me today. It’s a weight off my mind, just knowin' there’s somethin' bein’ done. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. I'll see you in a week. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you.
