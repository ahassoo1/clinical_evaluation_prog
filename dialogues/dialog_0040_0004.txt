DOCTOR: Right, Teah Fornes. 53 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Osga. Just for my shots, I think. Routine stuff, you know? Keepin' up with things. I got a reminder card, and figured it was time.
DOCTOR: Routine, huh?
PATIENT: Yep. I try to stay on top of it. My husband, he's always good about reminding me, too. It's easy to forget with everything going on. Do I need to fill out any papers or somethin'?
DOCTOR: No, no forms. Just… let’s see if you actually need anything. When was your last tetanus shot, approximately?
PATIENT: Ooh, goodness. That's a good question. Let me think… I want to say… maybe ten years ago? Or more? I had a little scrape when I was helpin' with a build last fall, but didn't need a booster then, I don't think. It wasn't too deep. Honestly, I really can't remember exactly. Is there a record of it somewhere?
DOCTOR: Well, that's helpful. No, there's nothing in this system before 2020. Honestly, people just don’t keep track of these things. Ten years is… quite a while. Alright. We'll just do a booster, just to be safe. Roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good to me. Safety first, right? I always appreciate you being thorough. Builds help keep me busy, but I don't want any surprises, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. This might sting a little. And don't come crying to me if you get a fever. People exaggerate everything these days. There. Done.
PATIENT: Ouch! Okay, okay, you're right, that did sting a bit. No crying, promise. Though, you're right, I probably will exaggerate if I get a fever. It’s a family trait! So, what now? Do I need to wait here for a bit, or am I good to go?
DOCTOR: Just… sit here for fifteen minutes. Just in case. And try not to move your arm too much. Honestly, people and their reactions… it’s always something. I need to document this.
PATIENT: Alright, fifteen minutes it is. I always feel a little silly just sittin' here, but I understand. Better safe than sorry. Is there anything else I should be watchin' for, besides a fever? Like, should my whole arm fall off or somethin'? Just teasin', of course!
DOCTOR: Don't be ridiculous. Redness, swelling, severe pain. But you'll be fine. It's just a shot. People make mountains out of molehills these days. I’ve got other patients waiting, so… just sit quietly.
PATIENT: Okay, okay, no worries. Redness, swelling, severe pain. Got it. I guess I'll just keep an eye on things. And try not to make a mountain out of anything. Though, you gotta admit, sometimes a little worry is okay, right? Just to be careful.
DOCTOR: Fifteen minutes. That's all. Honestly, the things I have to explain to people… .
PATIENT: Okay, I hear you. Fifteen minutes. I’ll be quiet. Just takin' it easy.
