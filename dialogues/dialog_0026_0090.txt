DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Finco. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I’m here for… a check-up before a surgery? It’s… a cosmetic procedure I’m hoping to have. To be honest, the details are a little fuzzy. My husband… he took care of most of the arrangements. It’s all been rather difficult since… well, since he passed.
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Mackenzi. That must be incredibly difficult. It's perfectly alright that the details are fuzzy; we can take things at your pace. A pre-operative check-up is always a good idea, cosmetic or otherwise. So, to clarify, you’re wanting me to ensure you’re healthy enough for an elective surgery. Do you recall what type of surgery it is, even generally?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Healthy enough… It feels important, somehow. To do this… for myself. The surgery… I think it had something to do with my… face? Perhaps my stomach? Honestly, Doctor, I truly don’t remember the specifics. He talked about… tightening things. And improving the shape of… something. It’s terribly embarrassing to admit, but my memory hasn't been the same since… everything. Is it alright if we just go through some tests? Perhaps that will jog my memory?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly alright, and it’s very common for memory to be affected by grief and stress. Don’t feel embarrassed at all. We can absolutely start with some tests and a thorough review of your medical history – that often helps things come back to you. Before we jump into testing, let's just cover some basic questions, if that’s alright. It will help me get a clearer picture. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Allergies… I don't think so. I haven't had any serious reactions to anything, as far as I recall. I used to get mild hay fever as a child, but nothing that required medication beyond… over-the-counter things. I believe it was mostly just a runny nose and itchy eyes. But a true allergy… no, I don’t believe so. Is there anything specific I should be thinking about? Sometimes things just… slip my mind.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Hay fever doesn't typically cause a problem with surgery, thankfully. And it’s perfectly normal for things to slip your mind, especially with everything you’ve been through. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, herbal supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… I used to take something for… anxiety, a few years back. A very low dose. But I stopped taking it shortly before… my husband got sick. He helped me manage things more naturally then. And… oh! I do take a multivitamin every morning. Just a basic one, from the drugstore. Nothing fancy. That’s all I can think of right now. I really do try to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a low-dose anxiety medication in the past, and a multivitamin daily. That’s helpful to know. And it’s good that you’re trying to keep things simple. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Honestly, I’ve been quite healthy for most of my life. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, chickenpox – but nothing serious. No major surgeries or hospitalizations, thankfully. I had a bout of bronchitis a couple of years ago, but it cleared up quickly with antibiotics. And… my blood pressure sometimes runs a little high, but it’s usually manageable with diet and exercise. My husband always encouraged me to stay active. He was very health-conscious. I'm afraid that's about all I can recall. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Mackenzi. That's very helpful, and it sounds like you've been generally healthy, which is wonderful. It's alright to take your time; there's no rush. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family medical conditions… My mother had… arthritis, I believe. In her hands, mostly. It bothered her a lot in her later years. And my father… he had heart problems. He passed away when I was quite young, actually. It was… sudden. I don’t know all the details, to be honest. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had diabetes. But beyond that… I’m not really sure. My family wasn’t very open about their health issues. It was… a bit of a taboo subject. Is that helpful? I feel rather inadequate recalling all of this.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mackenzi. Arthritis, heart problems, and diabetes – I appreciate you sharing that. It’s not uncommon for families to avoid discussing health issues, so don’t feel inadequate at all. It sounds like those are the most significant things to be aware of. Now, just a few more questions before we move on to a physical exam, if that's alright. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband was quite adamant about that, actually. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And recreational drugs… never. I've always believed in a healthy lifestyle. I know it sounds rather… proper, but that’s just how I was raised.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mackenzi. It's always good to hear! It sounds like you take excellent care of yourself. Okay, now, before we do a quick physical exam, is there anything you're particularly concerned about?
PATIENT: Concerned about…? Well, now that you mention it… I've been feeling rather tired lately. More tired than usual. And… my skin has been looking a little… dull, I suppose. It's probably nothing, honestly. Just the stress of everything, I'm sure. But… I suppose I'd like to make sure everything is alright. And… I've noticed a few… aches and pains, here and there. Nothing major, but enough to bother me. I just want to be sure I'm healthy enough to… go through with this surgery. If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mackenzi. Fatigue, dull skin, and aches and pains – those are all things we should investigate, especially with your upcoming surgery. It’s good you brought those up. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your abdomen and skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just want to be sure everything is… in order.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just loosen your clothing, that would be great. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Blood pressure is 135/85, which is slightly elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is 78 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly noted. Skin is warm, dry, and slightly pale. No rashes, lesions, or unusual moles noted. Everything seems within normal limits so far, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and paleness are things we should investigate further. Do you know what your typical blood pressure reading is?
PATIENT: My typical blood pressure… Honestly, I don’t usually pay much attention. My husband always took care of those things. He had a blood pressure monitor at home. He was very diligent about his health. I think it was usually around 120/80, maybe? But I’m not entirely sure. It’s been a while since I had it checked. And the paleness… I haven’t noticed that, specifically. I suppose I’ve just been feeling… unwell lately, generally. Is it something to be worried about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mackenzi. It's perfectly understandable that you haven't been keeping close track, especially with everything that’s been going on. 120/80 is a good baseline, and your current reading of 135/85 is a bit higher, but not alarmingly so. It could be related to stress, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us check your overall health, including your blood count, kidney and liver function, and thyroid levels. We can also check your vitamin D levels, as that can sometimes contribute to fatigue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work… If it will help determine what's going on, then yes, please. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just want to be sure I’m healthy enough to proceed with the surgery. And… to feel like myself again. Will it be a lot of blood? I’m not very good with needles.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t be a lot of blood at all, Mackenzi. It's just a standard blood draw – a few vials will be taken from your arm. And I understand your concern about needles – many people aren't fond of them. The phlebotomist is very skilled and gentle, and we can make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. You can look away if you prefer, and we can talk about something else to distract you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I’d also like to order a basic EKG just to rule out any heart abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG… Alright, yes, that sounds… thorough. If it will help determine if I’m healthy enough to proceed, then please do. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Will it be uncomfortable? I’m starting to feel a little overwhelmed, to be honest. All of this… it’s a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It is a lot, Mackenzi, and you’re right to feel overwhelmed. It's perfectly normal. An EKG is a very quick and painless test. It involves placing a few small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t involve any needles or electricity. It takes just a few minutes, and we'll get the results right away. We'll take things one step at a time. First, we'll get the blood work done, then the EKG. Once we have those results, we can sit down and discuss them together and make a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… manageable. One step at a time. Blood work and then the EKG. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I feel… a little better knowing that we have a plan. Could you tell me where I can go for the blood work and EKG? And… is there anything I need to do to prepare? I don’t want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. I’m glad I can help. There’s a lab right across the street, just down the hall from the pharmacy. I’ll write you a requisition form for the blood work. The EKG can be done in the same building, in the cardiology department. I'll also write a requisition for that. For the blood work, it’s best to be well-hydrated – drink plenty of water beforehand. You can eat as usual, but avoid anything too sugary. For the EKG, just wear comfortable clothing that allows easy access to your chest. You don’t need to do anything else special. Here you are. Do you have any questions about the forms or the procedures?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. These look… straightforward enough. Hydrate and wear comfortable clothing… yes, I can do that. No, I don't think I have any further questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I suppose I’ll go across the street and get this done. Thank you again for your patience and understanding, Doctor Finco. I truly appreciate it. I’ll let you know if anything comes up.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. Take your time, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. We're here to help. I'll be in touch once I have the results, usually within a few days. Please take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Have a good day.
