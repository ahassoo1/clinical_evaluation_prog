DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And, um… my head gets funny sometimes, too. It’s hard to explain, honestly. It comes and goes. My daughter, she insisted I come. Said I should get it checked out, with my family history and all. It’s just… bits and pieces, you know? I don’t remember everything clearly.
DOCTOR: "Bits and pieces" isn’t terribly helpful, Ms. Mayhugh. We need to be precise. Let’s start with the ears. When did you first notice them “acting up”?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when? That’s… a good question. It feels like a while now. Maybe… a few months? It’s not constant, thankfully. Sometimes I wake up and everything sounds muffled, like there’s water in my ears. Then it goes away. I really can’t put a date on it, I'm afraid. Everything feels… blurry. My head… it gets dizzy with it, sometimes. Not always, though. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing and dizziness… alright. Let’s try to narrow it down. You mentioned it happens when you wake up. Does anything else seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger it? Not that I’ve noticed, really. Sometimes when I’m… well, when I’m at the club, maybe? It's a little noisy there, of course. But I’ve been going there for years, and it didn’t always happen. It’s just… started recently. My daughter thinks it's my blood pressure, perhaps? She worries a lot. I don't pay much attention to it, truthfully. It all feels very… confusing.
DOCTOR: A club… alright. And your daughter suspects blood pressure. We’ll address that. Let’s get a little background. Do you have any other medical problems – anything at all that a doctor has ever told you about?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, a long time back. And… my knees bother me, you know, getting older. But nothing serious, really. Just aches and pains. And, like I said, my daughter keeps mentioning my family… she says my uncle had something with his ears, and my aunt had balance problems. That’s all I really remember, honestly. It was a long time ago. I’m sorry I’m not more help. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal, knee pain, family history of ear issues and balance problems. We'll need to document that. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
