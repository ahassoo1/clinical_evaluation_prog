DOCTOR: Hi Denis, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Hernandez. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I received a letter regarding some tests… an examination of my stomach, I believe? The results were… abnormal, and I confess, I was a bit concerned. I’m not entirely sure what it means, and I was hoping you could explain it to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. Abnormal results can definitely be unsettling. Let’s take a look at those tests together and I’ll explain everything as clearly as I can. Just to confirm, is that Denis Minatra, date of birth…?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Denis Minatra. And my date of birth is… July 14th, 1958. I do apologize if I seem a bit… precise. My late husband was a meticulous record keeper, and I suppose some of that has rubbed off on me. It’s just how I’m accustomed to things.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all! Being organized is a good thing. Okay, I see here you had some blood work and an endoscopy done on July 18th. The blood work showed some slightly elevated levels of… well, we’ll get to that. The endoscopy report indicates some inflammation in the stomach lining, and a biopsy was taken. The pathology report came back showing evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection. Have you ever been told you have an H. pylori infection before?
PATIENT: Helicobacter pylori… no, I don't believe so. That name is… unfamiliar to me. I have had some stomach troubles over the years, of course. A bit of indigestion, occasional heartburn. But I’ve always attributed it to… well, simply getting older, and perhaps eating things I shouldn’t have. I’ve never been told about an infection specifically. What is that, exactly? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's completely understandable. H. pylori is a type of bacteria that can infect the stomach lining. It’s actually pretty common – a lot of people have it without even knowing. But sometimes, like in your case, it can cause inflammation and even ulcers. It can be serious if left untreated, but thankfully, it’s usually very treatable with antibiotics. Before we get into treatment, let’s just get a little more detail about your symptoms. Besides the indigestion and heartburn, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Hmm… nausea, not particularly. Perhaps a little queasiness at times, but nothing significant. Vomiting, no, not in recent memory. Weight loss… that's a bit more difficult to say. I have noticed my clothes feeling a little looser lately, but I attributed that to the heat, honestly. It's been quite warm this summer. And, well, I haven’t been eating as much as usual. Not because I feel unwell, precisely, but… my appetite hasn't been quite the same since my husband passed away last year. It's difficult to enjoy meals without him. Would you say that counts?
DOCTOR: That absolutely counts, Denis. Grief can absolutely affect your appetite, and it’s important to take that into consideration. So, no recent vomiting, mild indigestion and heartburn, a slight loss of appetite potentially related to grief, and a possible unintended weight loss. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: No… no, I haven't. Though… now that you mention it, there was one instance, about a month ago. Just a small amount, I dismissed it as something I ate. A bit of beetroot perhaps, staining the stool. It only happened once, and I didn't think much of it at the time. It wasn’t… a large amount, and it didn't happen again. Should I have mentioned it sooner? I apologize if I should have. I truly didn't believe it was anything serious.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Denis, you shouldn’t apologize at all. It's good you're telling me now. Even a small amount of blood is something we need to consider. Okay. And just to get a complete picture, do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Just… just a daily multivitamin, Doctor. And occasionally, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Though I try to avoid it when I can. It doesn’t agree with my stomach, sometimes. I haven’t taken any ibuprofen in about two weeks, though. Nothing else, no. I was always very careful about medication. My husband was a pharmacist, you see, and he instilled in me a healthy respect – and a bit of caution – regarding pills and such. He always said, “Less is more,” unless specifically directed otherwise. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, thank you. A daily multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen – good to know. And it's excellent you were so mindful of medication with your husband's background. Alright, Denis. Given your symptoms, the endoscopy results showing inflammation, and the H. pylori infection, I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of gastritis – inflammation of the stomach lining – likely caused by the infection. The small amount of blood you noticed could be related to that inflammation. We'll want to rule out other causes, but that's the most probable explanation at this point. Now, the good news is that H. pylori is very treatable. We typically use a course of antibiotics along with a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acid. Would you be comfortable starting a course of treatment?
PATIENT: Treatment… yes, of course. If that will help, then yes, I am certainly comfortable with that. I’ve never been one to shy away from medical attention when it’s needed. I just… I suppose I was a bit anxious, not knowing what was causing it. To know there is a likely explanation, and a treatment available… that is very reassuring. What does the treatment involve, exactly? And are there any… side effects I should be aware of? I would like to be fully informed, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, you have every right to be fully informed. The standard treatment involves a 14-day course of two antibiotics – usually amoxicillin and clarithromycin – along with a medication called omeprazole, which reduces stomach acid production. You'll take two pills twice a day. As for side effects, the most common ones are nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Some people experience a metallic taste in their mouth. Rarely, there can be more serious side effects, but those are uncommon. We’ll monitor your symptoms closely during the treatment, and I’ll give you a list of warning signs to watch out for. Before we start, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It’ll only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A physical exam is perfectly acceptable. I understand the need for thoroughness. And a list of warning signs would be most appreciated. I always like to be prepared. Please, proceed when you are ready. It's quite alright with me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Denis, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with this. It might feel a little cool. Try to relax and breathe normally. Okay, breathing normally. And on this side… Everything sounds normal, no unusual noises. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Let me know if anything feels painful. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Just… just a little tenderness there, yes. Not sharp pain, exactly, but… a bit of discomfort. Like a dull ache. It’s not usually present, but I do notice it occasionally, especially after eating something heavy. It's not severe, though. I often dismissed it as indigestion, as I mentioned before. Is that… significant?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. A bit of tenderness in the upper right quadrant could be related to the inflammation, or even the stomach acid. It doesn’t sound alarming, but we’ll keep it in mind. Everything else sounds normal. So, based on everything – your symptoms, the endoscopy results, the H. pylori infection, and the physical exam – I'm confident we're on the right track with a diagnosis of gastritis caused by H. pylori. I'm going to prescribe you the antibiotics and omeprazole for 14 days. Take them as directed, even if you start to feel better before the course is finished. It’s important to complete the full treatment to eradicate the infection completely. We’ll also need to retest in about three months to confirm that the H. pylori is gone. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your clear explanation. A 14-day course of antibiotics, complete the full treatment even if I feel better, and a retest in three months… I can certainly manage that. And I will be sure to follow your instructions carefully. May I ask… is there anything I should avoid eating or drinking during the treatment? Or anything I should do to help alleviate the symptoms? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. During the treatment, it’s best to avoid spicy foods, acidic foods like citrus fruits and tomatoes, caffeine, alcohol, and fatty foods. These can irritate the stomach lining and worsen your symptoms. Smaller, more frequent meals are generally better tolerated than large ones. Staying hydrated is also important. For symptoms, you can take an antacid like Tums or Maalox if you experience heartburn or indigestion. If your symptoms are severe, you can also ask me about a stronger medication. I'm also going to provide you with a handout outlining these recommendations in more detail, as well as a list of potential side effects and warning signs to watch out for. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No spicy foods, acidic foods, caffeine, alcohol, and fatty foods… smaller, more frequent meals… and antacids if needed. That’s… quite a list. But manageable, I believe. You mentioned warning signs… could you elaborate on those, please? Just to be certain I know what to look out for. I prefer to be overly cautious, if you don’t mind. It’s better to be safe than sorry, as my husband always said.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. Better safe than sorry is a very wise approach. The warning signs to watch out for include severe abdominal pain, black or tarry stools – which indicates bleeding in the digestive tract – vomiting blood or something that looks like coffee grounds, difficulty swallowing, unexplained weight loss, and a high fever. If you experience any of these symptoms, you need to seek medical attention immediately. These symptoms are rare, but it's important to be aware of them. Do you have any questions about these warning signs?
PATIENT: Severe abdominal pain, black or tarry stools, vomiting blood or coffee grounds, difficulty swallowing, unexplained weight loss, and a high fever… Yes, I understand. Those are certainly things to be aware of. I will keep a close watch on my symptoms, and I will not hesitate to seek medical attention if I experience any of those. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very thorough and patient with my questions. I feel much more reassured now, and I am confident that we can get this under control. Would you like me to repeat anything back to you, to confirm my understanding? I don't mind at all.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you, Denis. It’s always a good idea to make sure we’re on the same page. But it’s not necessary, if you’re feeling confident. Alright, so I'm going to send the prescription to your pharmacy. It should be ready within a few hours. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in about three months to retest the H. pylori infection. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have addressed all of my concerns, and I feel much more at ease now. I appreciate your kindness and your thoroughness. Thank you for your time and your expertise. And please, accept my gratitude for your patience with my… meticulous nature. My husband would have been very pleased with your level of care. .
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Denis. I'm glad I could help. And please, don’t worry about being meticulous – it's good to be informed and proactive about your health. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
