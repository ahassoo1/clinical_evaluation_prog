DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph, good to see you, I suppose. Let's just get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor… Ruocco, is it? Yes. Well, my… uh… the young fella signed me up. For the… the team. Physical, he said. For the team. I forget what team now… something with a ball, I think. My grandson, he's a good boy. He worries I get too… still. So, here I am! A physical. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Right. A physical. Yes. Look, I have other patients waiting, so let's try and be concise. “Team” is… fine. We’ll do the basics. Have you been feeling… unwell recently?
PATIENT: Unwell? Hmm… Not really, no. I get a little… creaky, you know? In the mornings. And my knees, they talk to me sometimes. But that's just… old age, I guess. Nothing a good cup of coffee can't fix. I eat pretty good, I think. My wife, Elena, she makes sure of that. Does that… count as unwell?
DOCTOR: “Creaky” and “talking knees”… excellent. Not exactly a detailed medical history, is it?
PATIENT: Well, I ain't a doctor, am I? I just tell you how I feel. I mostly just… walk, you know? And sit. And watch the baseball games. I used to… I think I used to play a little bit, way back when. But that was a long time ago. Before Elena, even!
DOCTOR: Right. So, no significant complaints, just… general aging. Alright. Let's move on. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Elena gives me a little white pill sometimes. For my… pressure, I think she says. And something for my… water, when my knees bother me real bad. It makes me sleepy though. Little yellow one. I don't really keep track, she handles all that. She's good at remembering things. I wish I was!
DOCTOR: “Little white pill” and “little yellow one”… fantastic. Do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see… I don’t think so. I eat everything Elena puts in front of me! She makes a good paella, you know. Lots of shrimp. Never had a problem with shrimp. Or… peanuts? I like peanuts. Maybe… bees? I think I got stung once, way back when. But that was just a little owie. Not a big deal. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Right. No confirmed allergies. Okay. Let’s get a basic exam done. Just so we can say we did something. Please, step onto the scale for me. And try not to lean on anything. It throws off the reading.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Scale, you say? I used to be a little lighter, I think. Elena always says I eat too much. She worries about my… everything, that woman. Just a good wife, she is. Now, don't mind if I wobble a little bit! My balance ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: One hundred and thirty-eight pounds. Noted. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Please, extend your arm. And try to relax. Honestly, it's like pulling teeth sometimes.
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Oh dear. I don’t like these things! Makes me all… fluttery inside. Elena says I get anxious easy. She's right, you know. Just a little fluttery. And… is that cuff tight? It feels a bit… snug.
DOCTOR: One forty over ninety. Elevated, but… not catastrophic. Alright, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me. And another one. Don't stop mid-breath. It makes it difficult. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… regular. Nothing to write home about.
PATIENT: Regular, you say? That's good, isn’t it? Elena always says I have a strong heart. She says I worry too much. I used to… I think I used to run a little bit, back in the army. Long, long ago. Though I mostly just… marched. Is that still good for the heart? Marching?
DOCTOR: Marching. Right. Look, Mr. Murph, everything appears… within acceptable limits for your age. But you really need to get a handle on your medication list. And maybe… cut back on the paella. Just a suggestion. Do you have any family history of… anything significant?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My… my mother, she lived to be old. Very old. But she always complained about her… feet. And my father… he worked very hard. He didn’t get sick much, as far as I remember. But he… he tripped once. Fell down the stairs. That was… sad. Does tripping count as significant?
DOCTOR: Tripping. Of course. Look, this is… unproductive. I'm going to write "generally healthy for age, follow up with primary care for medication reconciliation and potential fall risk assessment". That's… good enough. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… Well… Elena wanted me to ask if… if you thought I could still… play a little baseball? Not a lot, just… maybe bat a few balls with my grandson? He's a good boy, very strong. He says I still got it, but… I just wanna be careful. Don't wanna pull a muscle, you know? Is that a silly question?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Murph, I'm not going to be responsible for your athletic endeavors. Play at your own risk. But listen to your body. And maybe… wear a helmet. I have other patients waiting. Here's a referral to a physical therapist if you want a proper assessment. .
PATIENT: Oh… a helmet? Alright. Thank you, Doctor Ruocco. A helmet… and listen to my body. Elena will be glad I asked. She always says I'm too stubborn. Thank you very much. And… goodbye to you too.
