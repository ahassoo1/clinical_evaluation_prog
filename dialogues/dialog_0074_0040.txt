DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. It keeps coming back. And with it, these… water infections. My daughter told me I should come see someone about it. She worries, that one.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pain in your side and recurrent water infections, as you call them – urinary tract infections, or UTIs – that’s certainly something we should investigate. To start, could you tell me a little more about this pain?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s mostly on my right side, lower down. It’s not… sharp, exactly. More of a dull ache, but it can get quite bad at times. It comes and goes, doesn't happen every day. Sometimes it feels like it goes all the way to my back, too. And when it’s really bad, well, that’s when the trouble with… going to the toilet starts. It burns, you see. A lot.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so clearly, Mr. Espinueva. A dull ache on your right side, radiating to your back, and associated with burning during urination… that gives us a good starting point. When did you first notice this pain starting?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s been a while now, Doctor. I suppose… maybe six months ago? It started off very mild, I barely noticed it. Just a little discomfort after a long day, that sort of thing. I thought it was just my age, you know? But then it started happening more often, and got worse. That’s when I started to worry. I can’t be too sure of the exact time though, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult to pinpoint the exact timing. Six months ago is helpful. And you mentioned it's been getting progressively worse. Now, regarding these “water infections” – how often would you say you're experiencing them, and have you been treated for them before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It feels like… every few months, perhaps? Maybe three or four times in the last six months. My daughter usually takes me to the doctor when it gets bad, and they give me… pills. Yellow pills. They help, thankfully, but they don’t stop them coming back. I’ve seen a couple of different doctors for it, at the local clinic mostly. I don’t really remember their names, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly three or four UTIs in the last six months, treated with antibiotics each time. It’s good that the antibiotics have been helping temporarily, but the fact that they're recurring is something we need to address. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that I should be aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… a doctor told me a while back, years ago, that my kidneys weren’t quite right. Something about lots of little… bubbles on them. He said it wasn’t anything to worry about too much, but I’d need to keep an eye on it. My daughter remembers more than me, she always makes sure I follow up with things. I think it was called… polycystic kidney disease? Is that right? It doesn't bother me usually, just the pain and these infections, really. I don't take any regular medicines for it, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know about the polycystic kidney disease. That’s important information. It sounds like you were diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease some time ago, and haven’t been actively treated for it. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of things. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. It’s good of you to be so thorough. I do feel a bit better just talking about it, to be honest. It's been weighing on my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. I do detect some tenderness when I press on your lower right side, as you described. It’s not severe, but it’s definitely present. Your abdomen is otherwise soft, and I don’t feel any masses. I also want to check your temperature and blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to order a urine analysis and a blood test. The urine analysis will help us confirm if you have an active infection, and the blood test will give us information about your kidney function and overall health. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A urine analysis and a blood test… very good. Yes, please. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get to the bottom of this pain, and stop these infections from coming back. It’s tiring, you know? And I don’t want to worry my daughter anymore than I already do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Espinueva. We’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better and ease your daughter’s concerns. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we’ll collect a urine sample before you leave. She’ll give you instructions on how to do that properly. While we’re waiting for the results, is there anything else you’d like to tell me?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's a relief to finally be getting some answers, or at least a plan to find them. My daughter will be pleased too, she's always the sensible one. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. We'll get those tests processed as quickly as possible, and I’ll review the results with you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience a fever, chills, or worsening pain, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the samples. Have a good day, and please let me know if you have any questions before you leave.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I’m sure I will see you again soon. Have a good day to you too.
