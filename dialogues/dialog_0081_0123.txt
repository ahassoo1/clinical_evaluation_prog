DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor Paulino. It's nice to meet you. Well, it's my skin, really. It’s been so itchy. Just driving me crazy, it has. It started a few weeks ago, I think, and it just won’t go away.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And it's just…itchy?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Not like a rash, not really. Just… a constant itching all over. My arms, my legs, even my back. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t look bad, which is why I waited so long to come in, honestly. I thought it would just go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Hmm. So, no visible rash, redness, bumps… just the sensation of itching. And it’s generalized, you say – all over your body?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. All over. It's worse at night, though. Keeps me up sometimes. I try lotion, but it doesn’t really help for long. It feels… dry, maybe? But even when I put a lot of lotion on, the itching comes right back. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Cassimatis. Itching is… a rather imprecise symptom. Let's try to narrow it down. Have you changed any soaps, detergents, or lotions recently?
PATIENT: Oh, good question, Doctor. Let me think… No, not really. I've been using the same lotion for years, the Aveeno one, the blue bottle. And the laundry detergent… well, my daughter usually does the laundry, and I don’t think she’s changed it. I haven’t noticed anything different, at least. It's a good thought, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any new foods in your diet?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, not really. I mostly eat the same things. Rice, beans, a little chicken… I try to eat healthy, you know? Nothing fancy. I had some mangoes last week, my neighbor gave me some, but that was about it. Could that be it? I don’t usually eat mangoes.
DOCTOR: Mangoes are… unlikely, but we must be thorough. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, um… Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control a few years ago. And my knees bother me sometimes, the arthritis, you know? But nothing major, really. I don’t take a lot of medications. Just a little something for the knees when they’re really acting up.
DOCTOR: And what is that "little something" you take for your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It’s called… naproxen, I think. The over-the-counter kind, the little red pills. I only take it when I really need to, like when I’ve been walking a lot. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. It helps with the pain, but I don't think it has anything to do with the itching.
DOCTOR: Right. Naproxen. We’ll make a note of that. Now, Ms. Cassimatis, I’m going to need to examine your skin. Please, have a seat on the examination table and we’ll take a look. I'd also like to check your blood pressure, just to be certain.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. It’s a little high, that table, isn't it? My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: It is a bit elevated. We have a step stool if you require it. And I will assist you, of course. Let’s begin with your blood pressure, then we'll move to the skin examination. Please, extend your arm.
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, thank you, Doctor. Yes, a step stool would be wonderful. It’s just getting up and down, you know? I appreciate you asking.
DOCTOR: Quite alright. Now, just relax your arm. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. Please, loosen your sweater if you would. I’ll start with your arms. I see no rash, redness, or significant lesions. Skin appears relatively normal in texture… slightly dry, as you mentioned. Any areas bother you more than others?
PATIENT: No, it’s not really one spot, Doctor. It’s just… everywhere. Maybe my back itches a little more? But it’s hard to reach, you know? I can’t really see my back. It’s just a general… discomfort. It’s more annoying than painful, if that makes sense. And it feels worse at night, like I said. It just keeps me awake.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No obvious abnormalities here either… no hives, excoriations, or significant dryness. Skin feels warm to the touch. This is… perplexing. Itching without visible signs is often indicative of… internal factors. We need to consider a few possibilities. Do you have any history of allergies, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Not really. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes during pollen season, but nothing major. I don’t take anything for it, just try to stay inside when it’s really bad. No food allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: A "cast iron stomach" is not a medical diagnosis, Ms. Cassimatis. We must proceed systematically. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the itching?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right, Doctor. I just meant I don’t get sick easily. Let me see… No, not really. No fever, no weight loss, no fatigue… I feel pretty good, actually, besides the itching. Maybe… sometimes I feel a little tired, but that’s probably just because I’m not sleeping well because of the itching! It’s a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A vicious cycle, indeed. We need to rule out some more serious possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. These tests will help us assess your overall health and identify any underlying issues that could be causing the itching. I also want to check your thyroid levels, just to be thorough. It's a simple blood draw, and we'll get the results back in a few days.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… good, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. I just want to get to the bottom of it, you know? It’s just so annoying. Blood work… okay. Where do I go for that? Is it here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, the lab is just down the hall, first door on the left. The phlebotomist, Maria, is very efficient. She’ll take care of you. I’ll have the order sent over electronically. In the meantime, I recommend an over-the-counter antihistamine, such as loratadine, to help alleviate the itching. And continue to use a fragrance-free moisturizer. If the itching becomes unbearable, or you develop any other symptoms, such as fever, rash, or swelling, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good, thank you. Loratadine… okay, I'll try that. And I’ll go to the lab right away. No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s just… nice to feel like someone is trying to figure it out. Hopefully, the blood work will tell us something.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cassimatis. We'll review the results as soon as they become available. Do not hesitate to contact us if your condition worsens. You may get dressed now. .
