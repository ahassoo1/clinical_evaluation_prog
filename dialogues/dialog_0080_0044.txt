DOCTOR: Hi Calin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I received a letter about being checked to see if I qualify for some home health services... or hospice, I believe it said? To be honest, I’m not entirely sure what it all means, but I thought it best to come in and find out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright – it is a bit confusing sometimes! It sounds like you received a notice regarding a potential benefit assessment. That assessment looks at a range of factors to see if you might qualify for services, which could include home health or, yes, hospice care if needed. It doesn’t mean you need hospice, just that the system flagged you as someone who might benefit from an evaluation. I see here your age is 28. Can you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with your health that led to this letter?
PATIENT: Yes, 28, that’s right. Hmm… what led to the letter… That’s a bit tricky. I work as a presser, you know, in textiles? It’s pretty physical work, and I’ve been having… well, a lot of pain, really. In my back and shoulders, mostly. It started a few months ago, just a little ache, but it’s gotten worse and worse. It’s making it really hard to do my job, and honestly, just to get through the day. I haven’t really seen a doctor about it until now, to be perfectly honest. I just kept hoping it would get better on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re experiencing increasing back and shoulder pain related to your work as a presser. And you’ve been dealing with this for several months now, gradually worsening. You haven’t sought medical attention previously, hoping it would resolve on its own. That’s understandable. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Yes, that sums it up pretty well. It’s… it’s a dull ache, most of the time. But when I’m working, or even just moving around too much, it can become really sharp. Like, a stabbing pain, almost. And it radiates, you know? It goes down my arms sometimes, and into my neck. It makes it hard to sleep too. I’ve been trying over-the-counter pain relievers, but they don't really seem to help much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that sharpens with activity, radiating down your arms and into your neck, and interfering with sleep. Over-the-counter pain relievers aren’t providing relief. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Not really, to be honest. Resting helps a little, but I have to rest. And it's hard to just… stop working, you know? I need to make a living. Warm baths sometimes soothe it temporarily, but the relief doesn't last long. Lying down flat doesn’t help, and honestly, nothing seems to consistently make it better for any length of time. It's just… there. Most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so resting is minimal relief, warm baths are temporary, and nothing consistently provides sustained improvement. It's a constant presence. Besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Well, I've been feeling really tired lately, more tired than usual. I just chalked it up to the pain keeping me up at night, but... maybe it's more than that. And sometimes my hands feel a little numb, especially after working for a long time. Not completely numb, just… tingly and weak. It's hard to explain. And I've been a little more irritable than usual, I think. My ex-husband says so, anyway!
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, tingling and weakness in your hands, particularly after work, and increased irritability. Has this numbness or weakness affected your ability to perform tasks at work or at home?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. At work, it's getting harder to grip the fabric properly. I've dropped things a few times because my hands just… give way. It's scary, honestly, because the machinery is quite powerful. And at home… well, simple things like opening jars or buttoning my clothes are becoming difficult. I’ve started asking my neighbor for help with some things, which I hate doing. I feel like I’m losing my independence.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's concerning. Difficulty gripping, dropping things, and challenges with fine motor skills impacting both work and daily life. And understandably, feeling a loss of independence. Alright, Calin. I'm going to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I just want to figure out what's causing all of this, and hopefully, find some way to feel better.
DOCTOR: Great. Can you tell me if this is painful?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s tender. Right there, on my lower back. And… ooh, yes, there too, a little higher up. And my shoulder… when you press there, that’s very painful. It almost feels like a burning sensation. And… when I move my arm like this… It’s really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes seem normal. And your muscle strength is a little diminished in your grip, as you mentioned. I'm noticing some decreased sensation in your fingertips, particularly on this hand. And your range of motion is limited due to the pain. It appears there's some muscle spasm in your shoulders and back. I’m going to listen to your lungs now, just to rule things out. Take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath... And again... Is everything alright? I just feel a little anxious with all of this poking and prodding, if you don't mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything sounds clear. Your lungs are clear. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious with a physical exam, especially when you're already dealing with discomfort. I apologize if anything felt invasive. Based on the exam and what you've told me, it sounds like you may have a nerve compression issue, potentially related to muscle spasm and inflammation in your back and shoulders. It's possible this is a form of radiculopathy – meaning a nerve root is being irritated or compressed. We need to rule out other causes. I’d like to order some imaging – an X-ray of your spine to start, and possibly an MRI if the X-ray doesn’t give us enough information. We’ll also do some blood tests to check for inflammation and rule out other conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay... an X-ray and blood tests. That sounds… thorough. Yes, that sounds alright. I just want to know what’s causing this, and get it fixed, if possible. Will the blood tests and X-ray tell me what kind of treatment I might need? And… what about the home health/hospice thing? Is this related to that, do you think?
DOCTOR: Yes, the imaging and blood tests will help us determine the underlying cause of your pain and guide treatment. It could be a muscle strain, a herniated disc, spinal stenosis, or another issue. Knowing the specific cause is crucial. As for the home health/hospice assessment… it’s likely the system flagged you due to the chronic pain and fatigue. However, based on what you've told me, I don’t believe you’re a candidate for hospice care at this time. Hospice is for individuals with a life-limiting illness. What you're experiencing is debilitating, but doesn't sound like a terminal condition. Home health might be beneficial, particularly if you struggle with activities of daily living. We can discuss that more after we have the results of these tests. For now, let’s focus on getting a diagnosis and starting a treatment plan. I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help with the spasm and pain. I'll also recommend some over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication. And I want you to try to avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates the pain. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Just the usual… I get a little sleepy with some medications, but nothing serious. Okay, muscle relaxant, anti-inflammatory… and avoid strenuous activity. That sounds… manageable. How long will it take to get the results of the tests? And where do I go to get them done? Will someone call me with the results, or do I need to schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: Good, no allergies, that's helpful. The lab and imaging center are just down the street, here's the address. The lab results typically come back within 2-3 business days, and the imaging results usually take a little longer, about 5-7 business days. The lab will likely call you with the results of the blood tests. However, the imaging results will need to be reviewed by a radiologist and then by me. I will call you with those results, or, if everything is normal, my nurse will call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings. We’ll go over the results together and decide on a treatment plan – which could include physical therapy, pain management injections, or other options. Do you have any questions about the tests, the medications, or the follow-up process?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. 2-3 days for the blood tests, 5-7 for the imaging… I can manage that. I’ll call if I have any questions. Thank you, Dr. Rosanova. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on, and having a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Calin. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your pain worsens significantly or you experience any new symptoms – such as numbness or weakness in your legs, or difficulty controlling your bladder or bowels – please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I’ll be in touch with the results. Have a good day, and try to take it easy.
PATIENT: Yes, I will remember that. Thank you again, Dr. Rosanova. You have a good day as well. .
