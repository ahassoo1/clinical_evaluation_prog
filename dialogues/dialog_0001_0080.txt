DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fabing, have a seat. Look, I'm Dr. Pehrson. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, really. Medicare sent me a notice saying I needed to update some things. I don't really understand all the paperwork, so figured I'd come in and get some help with it.
DOCTOR: Forms, huh?
PATIENT: Yep. It’s mostly about… well, I’m not even sure what it’s about, to be honest. It has a lot of boxes and questions about my health history and stuff. I just want to make sure everything's right with my insurance. I don't want any surprises later on.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Well, we gotta go through it anyway, standard procedure. It’s just… a lot of bureaucracy. Let’s start with the basics. Any major health problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, I’m 35, and generally pretty healthy. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years ago, working on a job site, but physical therapy helped a lot. Nothing ongoing now, thankfully. I do get tired easier than I used to, but I think that’s just… life, you know? Is that something I should be listing?
DOCTOR: Tired?
PATIENT: Yeah, just… worn out a lot. Like, at the end of the day, I’m really tired. And sometimes even during the day, I feel like I could just take a nap. It’s not like a sick-tired, just… a regular-life-is-tiring kind of tired. Does that make sense? I'm a control and valve installer, so it's pretty physical work.
DOCTOR: Physical work, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Lots of lifting, bending, crawling around in tight spaces… it's good work, pays the bills, but it’s hard on the body, you know? I try to stay in shape, but it’s tough sometimes. That's probably why I'm tired all the time, honestly. Nothing to worry about, I figure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other… complaints?
PATIENT: Not really. My knees sometimes ache a little after a long day, but again, that’s just the job. Oh! My husband keeps telling me I snore, but I don’t even know that's a complaint! He says I wake myself up sometimes, but I don't remember it. Is that something I should tell you? I don’t really think it’s a big deal.
DOCTOR: Snoring, huh?
PATIENT: Well, he says it's pretty loud. He nudges me sometimes, and then I wake up. It doesn’t bother me, but he says it keeps him up. He’s a light sleeper, poor thing. I just thought I'd mention it since you asked about complaints. It’s probably just getting older, right? It happens to everyone.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of… anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My grandma on my mom’s side had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandpa had diabetes, but he didn’t take care of himself very well. That’s about all I know, really. Nobody really talks about health stuff much in my family. It's just not something we do. Is it important to know more? I could ask my mom, maybe.
DOCTOR: It can be. Just... try to recall anything. Anything at all. And do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things, been around all sorts of plants… nothing. I’m pretty lucky that way, actually. And, thinking about it… my uncle on my dad’s side had something with his heart, a long time ago. I don’t remember exactly what, but it was serious enough that he had to have surgery. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I try to stay away from pills if I can. Just vitamins sometimes, but that's it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, nothing regular. I feel pretty good most of the time, so I haven't really needed anything. Is that… unusual? I mean, everyone seems to be on something these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s take a quick look at your vitals, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, weight... standard stuff. If you’ll just step over here…
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'm happy to get that done. Hopefully, it's all just routine. I'm not a fan of doctor's offices, to be honest. But I want to get these forms filled out so I don't have to worry about it anymore.
DOCTOR: 140/90… hmm. And pulse is 78. Weight is… 70 kilograms. A little elevated, but not alarming. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to be sure. Take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath. Is that okay? I sometimes get nervous around stethoscopes. It always feels like everyone is listening to my insides. Is everything alright so far? I'm not very good at knowing what's normal and what's not when it comes to medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Sounds… clear. Nothing obvious. Listen, Ms. Fabing, you seem generally healthy. But your blood pressure is a little high. And you mentioned being tired, and the snoring. We need to address this before it becomes a problem.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. That doesn't sound good. What… what do you think is wrong? Is it serious? I just want to get these forms done, I didn't expect all this. Maybe it's just stress? I've been working a lot lately. Do you think that could be it?
DOCTOR: It could be stress. But we can't rule out other things. I'm going to order some blood work. Just routine stuff, to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, thyroid… you know, the basics. And I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week. I'll give you a form to take to the lab.
PATIENT: Okay, blood work. And monitoring my blood pressure at home. Will the blood work take long? And… how do I even monitor my blood pressure at home? I don’t have one of those machines. Is it expensive? I’m just… a little overwhelmed, to be honest. I really just came in to fill out these forms.
DOCTOR: The lab shouldn’t take long. And you can get a blood pressure cuff at most pharmacies. They’re not terribly expensive. Here’s the lab order. And here’s a sheet explaining how to monitor your blood pressure at home. Read it carefully. And come back in a week with the results. We'll discuss them then. Look, Ms. Fabing, I'm not trying to scare you. We just need to get a baseline. Don't worry about it. Now, about those forms…
PATIENT: Okay. A week. Blood work. Monitoring. Right. Okay. Well, at least we’re getting somewhere with the forms, I guess. Where were we before all this? I’m sorry if I’m being difficult, it’s just… a lot to take in. I’m happy to get back to the forms, if you need me to.
DOCTOR: We were on allergies. You said you have none. Past surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, right, allergies. No, none. And past surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I broke my arm once when I was playing basketball, but it healed pretty well. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else. Is that important? Does knowing about my tonsils matter? I honestly don’t remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Tonsils are… irrelevant. Any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone does. And I had chickenpox when I was little. But nothing serious, nothing that required a hospital stay or anything. I’m pretty good about staying healthy, washing my hands, getting enough sleep when I can… you know, the basics. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I'm worried I'm not giving you the right information. I'm not used to talking about this stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history?
PATIENT: Oh, we were already talking about that, weren’t we? My grandma had high blood pressure, and my grandpa had diabetes… and my uncle had something with his heart. That’s about all I know. Nobody really keeps track of that kind of thing in my family. Is it important to get more details? I could ask my mom, maybe, but she doesn't remember much either. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let’s skip that for now. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh! No, never. I don't smoke, I don't drink, and definitely no drugs. I’ve always been pretty careful about that kind of stuff. My husband doesn’t either, so it’s just not something we do around the house. Is that… good? I’m hoping I’m answering your questions the right way. I just want to get this Medicare stuff sorted out.
DOCTOR: Good. And finally, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… yes. I am, with my husband. We've been married for ten years. Is that… important for the forms? I wasn’t expecting to have to answer that. I hope I’m not being rude, but it feels a little personal.
DOCTOR: Standard question. Just need to know. Alright. That’s all for now. Here's the form to take to the lab, and a printout of the instructions for monitoring your blood pressure at home. Come back in a week with the results. And we’ll finish these forms then. Next patient. .
PATIENT: .
