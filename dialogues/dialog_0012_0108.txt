DOCTOR: Hi Brad, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's my stomach. Been bleedin’ a bit. Not a good time for it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. Bleeding is definitely something we need to figure out. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: What do you mean “more”? It’s blood, comin’ out. Dark, you know? Like…coffee grounds. That’s what it looks like. And it’s been happenin’ for…a few days now, on and off. Not a lot, but enough to worry a man. Especially a man my age. It’s just…unsettlin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. Dark, coffee-ground-like stool is concerning, and you’re right to get it checked out. That suggests it's coming from higher up in your digestive system. When you say "on and off," how often would you say it's happening?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not a doctor, alright? I don't keep track. Maybe every other day? Sometimes twice in a day, sometimes not for a whole day. It's…irregular. Like my late wife, bless her soul. Never could keep a schedule, that one. Always somethin'. But that's beside the point. This bleedin' is what’s botherin’ me now.
DOCTOR: I understand, and you’re right to focus on what’s happening now. It’s okay if you don’t have exact details – we’ll work through it. So, roughly every other day, sometimes more, sometimes less, you’re noticing this dark stool. Besides the stool, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms are we talkin’ about? I feel tired, obviously. Bleedin’ takes it outta ya. And a little weak, maybe. Been eatin’ less, too. Hard to have much of an appetite when you’re worried about what’s gonna happen when you go to the bathroom. Besides that… no, nothin’ special. I ain’t fallin’ apart here. Just…discomforted.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, weakness, and a decreased appetite along with the bleeding. That’s helpful. Have you had any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nah, no throwin’ up. Thank goodness for that, at least. I had a touch of the stomach flu a few months back, that was awful. This ain’t like that. Just… the bleedin’. And the worry. Mostly the worry. You know how it is. Losing your wife… it kinda takes the wind outta ya. Makes everything feel… fragile.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brad, and I'm very sorry for your loss. It’s completely natural to feel fragile after such a significant loss. Let’s focus on the bleeding for now, and we can address the worry as well. Have you noticed any pain in your stomach, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: A little. Not sharp, nothin’ terrible. Just… a dull ache. Mostly after I eat somethin’. Anything, really. Doesn’t seem to matter what it is. And sometimes…sometimes it feels like somethin’s just… heavy down there. Like a weight. It’s hard to explain. Like an old, tired muscle achin’. You wouldn’t understand. You're too young.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re describing some discomfort and a feeling of fullness or heaviness after eating, along with the dull ache. I appreciate you trying to explain it, and I do want to understand. Okay, so dull ache, heaviness after eating, and dark stools. Now, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Look, I've had…stomach problems, alright? Every man my age has. Indigestion, heartburn, the usual. But nothin’ like this. Not bleedin’ like this. Never this dark. This feels… different. Worse. I used to smoke, years ago, before… well, before everything. Maybe it's somethin' from that? I don't know. Doctors always blame somethin'. You probably think it's my lungs, don’t you?
DOCTOR: No, Brad, I’m not jumping to any conclusions. It’s important to consider everything, but I’m not blaming anything yet. We need to gather more information. You mentioned you used to smoke – how long ago did you quit, and how much did you smoke when you were smoking?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been… a long time. Twenty years, maybe more? Lost track after… after she got sick. Used to go through a pack a day, easily. Marlboro Reds. Strong ones. Didn’t bother me then. Everything felt… simpler then. Before the worry took over. Before everything. Look, what does that even matter now? It's over and done with. I'm bleedin', doc. That's what matters. Stop askin' me about the past. It's not helpin'.
DOCTOR: You’re right, we need to focus on what’s happening now. But knowing about the smoking history helps me get a complete picture. Okay, so a pack-a-day for many years, quit over 20 years ago, and now you’re experiencing bleeding. I’m going to ask about your family history, if that's alright. Have any of your close relatives – parents, siblings – had any problems with stomach ulcers, bleeding, or stomach cancer?
PATIENT: Family history? Now you’re askin' about my family? What's that got to do with anything? My father… he had a bad heart. Died young. That's all you need to know. My mother… she worried a lot. Just like me. And that's it. We weren’t exactly a close-knit family. Didn’t talk about…stomach problems. Or anything else, for that matter. Look, I came here about the bleedin’, doc. Not a genealogy project. Are you even listenin' to me?
DOCTOR: I am listening, Brad, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I understand your frustration. I’m asking about family history because some conditions can run in families and help me understand potential causes. If you're not comfortable sharing, that’s perfectly alright. Let’s move on. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Not a one. Don't believe in pumpin' myself full of chemicals. Tried somethin' for my heartburn once, years ago. Didn't do nothin' but give me indigestion. That's it. Never took nothin' regularly. Just…suffer in silence, like a man. What else would I do?
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications at all. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your stomach, check your pulse, and do a gentle abdominal exam. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…be gentle, alright? I'm not as young as I used to be. And don't poke around too much. I don't need any more discomfort than I already have. Just get it over with. This is…unsettlin’.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brad. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll listen to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I’m feeling some tenderness in your upper abdomen, which is where we're seeing the problem. Your bowel sounds are normal. I don’t feel any masses. Your pulse is a little elevated, but that could be from the bleeding and your worry.
PATIENT: Hmph. Told you it was tender. It feels… swollen, maybe? Like somethin’s… heavy in there. And my pulse always races when I’m worried. It’s a nervous thing. My wife used to say I had the heart of a hummingbird. Always flutterin’. What does this mean, doc? Am I…serious trouble? Don’t sugarcoat it, alright? I can handle it. Just tell me what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Brad, you're right to be concerned, and I'm not going to sugarcoat anything. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, the bleeding, the tenderness in your abdomen, and your history, it’s important to investigate this further. The most likely possibilities are a stomach ulcer, gastritis , or, less commonly, something more serious like a growth. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to order some blood tests to check your blood count and iron levels, and I recommend an endoscopy. An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and take a biopsy if needed. It's important to rule out anything serious, and the endoscopy is the best way to do that. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: An…endoscopy? A tube down my throat? Are you serious? That sounds…awful. And biopsies? What if it is somethin’ serious? What if it’s…cancer? My mother… she always worried about cancer. Oh, this is just great. Just what I needed. Another thing to worry about. I… I don’t know, doc. That sounds… terrifying. Is there… another way? Can’t you just give me some pills or somethin’? I don’t want a tube down my throat. I really don’t. This is… too much. .
DOCTOR: Brad, I understand your fear. It is a scary thought, and I wouldn’t recommend it if there were a better way. Unfortunately, pills won’t give us the definitive answers we need. To properly investigate the source of the bleeding and rule out anything serious, we need to visualize your stomach lining. I want to assure you that endoscopy is a relatively safe procedure. You would be sedated, so you wouldn’t feel anything during the procedure. It’s also the most accurate way to diagnose and treat the problem. I know it’s a lot to take in. If you're really uncomfortable, we can discuss a referral to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in digestive disorders. They would be able to explain the procedure in more detail and answer any questions you have. They may have more experience and can make you feel more comfortable. Would you like me to schedule a consultation with a specialist?
