DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that's why one comes to the doctor, isn’t it? It’s… a problem. A gentleman friend, you see, and there’s… discharge. Not my discharge, of course. His. It’s… unpleasant. And frankly, a bit concerning. I've never had this happen before, with anyone, and I wanted to make sure it wasn’t… something dreadful.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it is good you're getting it checked out. It’s always best to be cautious. So, to be clear, you're concerned about a discharge from a male partner?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. A male companion. And it’s… rather copious, if you understand. Not a little trickle, Doctor. It’s… noticeable. I was hoping you could tell me what it might be, and if it’s… contagious. I've been very careful, you see. Very careful indeed. It’s just… unsettling. And I wouldn’t want to… pass anything on, heaven forbid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's been… well, it began shortly after the Fourth of July. Perhaps a week or so afterwards? It’s hard to be precise, you see. We’ve been… occupied. But it’s definitely been over a week. Perhaps ten days? I really can’t say for certain. He hasn't mentioned it, of course. Men are so… stoic. That’s why I had to come. It’s simply not something he’d volunteer.
DOCTOR: And has he experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well… he’s been a bit… quieter than usual, I suppose. And perhaps a little more fatigued. He usually has a rather robust constitution, but he has been taking naps. But he’s getting on in years, you see, so that might just be… the natural order of things. No pain, as far as I'm aware. No… burning. Nothing obvious, at least. He's not one to complain, that's certain. It’s really just the discharge that’s troubling me. And the possibility of… unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: Okay. And to confirm, you’re concerned about a potential sexually transmitted infection?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn’t put it in such… blunt terms, Doctor. But yes, that is what’s been on my mind. It’s just… irresponsible people, you know? One can’t be too careful these days. I haven’t… been with anyone recently, prior to this gentleman, and I’ve always been exceedingly cautious. It’s simply… unsettling to think of. And I'd like to know what we're dealing with, so appropriate measures can be taken. I wouldn't want this to… escalate.
DOCTOR: Right. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to need to ask a few more questions. Have you had any symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not! I’m perfectly healthy, Doctor. Perfectly. I wouldn’t be here if I was experiencing anything untoward. This is… a problem with him, not me. I pride myself on my… cleanliness, you see. I've always taken excellent care of myself. This is… an unfortunate circumstance, due to his… carelessness, I suspect. It’s simply… distressing to think about, really. I do hope it's nothing… serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to perform a quick examination. Just a standard check. And I'll need a sample from your partner. We can’t properly determine the cause of the discharge without it. I understand this might be… awkward, but it’s necessary. Do you have any objections to obtaining a sample?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That is… a rather delicate request, Doctor. Asking a lady to… procure a sample from a gentleman friend! It’s simply… not done. I do believe that is his responsibility, not mine. I wouldn’t dream of… intruding in that manner. He’d be mortified. Perhaps he could come in himself? That seems far more… appropriate. I’m not equipped for such a task, you see. And frankly, I’d find it… thoroughly unpleasant. I do hope you understand. It’s a matter of… propriety, really.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your… reluctance. However, without a sample, I cannot determine the cause of this discharge and provide appropriate treatment. It’s a medical necessity. If your partner is unwilling to come in for an examination, we are limited in what we can do. Are you willing to speak with him about the importance of getting tested?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, that puts me in a rather difficult position, doesn't it? He's a bit… set in his ways, you see. Doesn't care much for doctors, that one. Thinks a bit of brandy and a good lie-down solves most ailments. To suggest he come in for an… examination, and provide a sample… well, I fear he'd be quite offended. Honestly, I'm not sure I could convince him. He’s a proud man, you see. Terribly proud. Perhaps… perhaps we could simply treat me, preventatively? I’m sure a course of antibiotics would be sufficient. I’m generally very resilient, you see. I’ve weathered many storms in my life. It would simply be… easier. And far less… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I appreciate your… desire for a quick solution. However, treating you preventatively without knowing the cause of the discharge is not appropriate medical practice. It could lead to antibiotic resistance, and it won’t address the underlying issue. Furthermore, if your partner is infected, he could continue to spread the infection to others. I strongly recommend that he see a doctor. I can provide you with some resources to help you discuss this with him. If he refuses, I’m afraid there is very little I can do to help. Are you at least willing to consider discussing this with him?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You make it sound rather dire, Doctor. Honestly, I hadn't considered it in such… medical terms. I simply thought a bit of preventative medicine would set things right. Perhaps you’re right. Perhaps I should… attempt a conversation. Though I doubt it will be fruitful. He's a stubborn man, you see. Terribly stubborn. But… alright. I suppose I can try. But I’m making no promises. And frankly, I feel rather foolish having to discuss such… personal matters with him. It's simply… not dignified. Could you perhaps provide me with some… pamphlets? Something discreet? Something I can leave on his bedside table? And perhaps… a gentle script? Something I can say to encourage him? Without… causing offense?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here are some resources. They explain common infections in a straightforward manner, and this brochure emphasizes the importance of regular check-ups. As for a script… perhaps something like, “I recently spoke with the doctor about some health concerns, and they recommended we both get checked out, just to be safe.” Keep it simple, focus on the “we,” and emphasize it’s for peace of mind. I also want to stress that even if he refuses, I can offer you resources for your own health and well-being. It's important to prioritize your own health, regardless of his choices. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. "We," and "peace of mind." That sounds… manageable. Less accusatory, certainly. And focusing on my health as well, is… sensible. Perhaps if I frame it as my anxiety, he’d be more amenable. He does dislike seeing me upset. Alright. I’ll… attempt this conversation. Though I’m not optimistic. He’s a man of… strong opinions, you see. And doesn’t take kindly to being… lectured. But I appreciate your guidance, Doctor. And these pamphlets. They are… discreet, thankfully. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any… warning signs I should look for, should he… refuse to cooperate? Anything I can do to protect myself in the meantime?
DOCTOR: If he refuses, it’s essential to be aware of the potential risks. While preventative treatment is not ideal, we can discuss safe sex practices, should you choose to continue your relationship. Using condoms can significantly reduce the risk of transmission, even if we don’t know the specific infection. Also, be vigilant for any unusual symptoms in yourself – discharge, burning during urination, pelvic pain, or any unexplained rashes. If you experience any of these, please contact me immediately. It’s also important to remember that you deserve to be in a relationship where both partners prioritize their health and well-being. I can provide you with some resources for relationship counseling if you’d like. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Condoms… yes, I suppose that’s… sensible. Although, we haven’t… utilized those in some time. It’s a rather… delicate subject, you see. And he’s a proud man. It would likely cause offense. But I understand your… caution. And I appreciate you reminding me of my… well-being. It’s easy to get lost in… trying to please others, you see. I’ll… attempt this conversation. And if he refuses… I’ll keep a watchful eye on myself. And remember “we,” and “peace of mind.” Thank you, Doctor. I believe that’s all for now. I’ll… take these pamphlets and… brave the discussion. I truly hope it doesn’t… escalate.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. I wish you the best of luck. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns or if you’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment. We’re here to support you, regardless of your partner’s decision. Take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. And your… discretion.
