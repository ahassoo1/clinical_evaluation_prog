DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been having. It’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a little while now.” Can you tell me a bit more about that pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not, like, a sharp pain, you know? More of a dull ache, mostly. It’s in my lower back, and sometimes it feels like it goes down my leg a little. It’s worse when I’ve been standing for a long time, or if I try to lift something. Not everything, but heavier stuff, definitely.
DOCTOR: I see. A dull ache in the lower back, radiating down the leg sometimes, and aggravated by standing or lifting. That gives us a good starting point. About how long has this been going on, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… that’s a good question. Probably… maybe three or four months now? It started off pretty mild, I didn’t even think much of it. Just figured I pulled something. But it hasn’t really gone away, and it’s been getting a little worse lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months, starting mild and gradually worsening. And has anything specific seem to make it better?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. When I sit down and rest it feels a little better. And if my wife rubs it, that helps a lot too! Not a permanent fix, of course, but it gives me some relief.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – rest and your wife’s help provide some relief. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… right now? I’d say a… maybe a four? It’s not crippling or anything, but it’s definitely there. Like a constant reminder. It doesn't go away completely, you know? Just a dull ache, like I said.
DOCTOR: A four, constant and dull. Okay. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my leg feels a little…tingly. Not numb, exactly, but like it’s falling asleep a little. It happens mostly when I’ve been standing a long time, and it goes away when I sit down. I haven’t really thought much of it, to be honest. Thought it was just part of the pain.
DOCTOR: Tingling in the leg with prolonged standing – that’s helpful to know. Have you experienced any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really. I haven’t dropped anything or tripped or anything like that. I can walk just fine, and climb the stairs okay. I do feel tired after a lot of walking, but I figured that was just my age! I’m 65, you know. Things don’t work like they used to.
DOCTOR: That’s fair. It’s good to rule things out. Have you had any changes in your bowel or bladder habits lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not really. Everything’s… regular, I guess you could say. No problems there. I haven’t noticed anything different in that department. Why do you ask?
DOCTOR: It’s just a routine question, Mr. Way, to make sure we cover all possibilities. Sometimes back pain can be associated with changes in bowel or bladder function, but it's good to hear yours are normal. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but I’ve been taking medication for that for years now, and it’s pretty well controlled. Other than that… not much, really. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. No arthritis, no diabetes, nothing like that. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a couple of days when I broke my arm playing baseball, but that was… oh, gosh, over 50 years ago! Nothing since then. No major surgeries or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a broken arm many years ago. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. My wife always asks when I get a new prescription, and I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. Lucky that way, too.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yeah, I take a pill for my blood pressure, like I said. It’s called… Lisinopril, I think? And sometimes, if my joints are really aching, I take some ibuprofen. That’s about it. No fancy supplements or anything. Just the basics.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. That's helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll check your back, legs, and reflexes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Go ahead. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Way. If you could lie on your back for me, that would be great. I'm going to start by feeling along your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Just relax as much as you can. Alright, I’m feeling some tenderness right here… And there's a bit of muscle spasm on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you bend your knees and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just tell me what you need me to do. I'll try to relax as much as possible. This is a little uncomfortable, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Alright, your patellar reflexes are a little diminished, and your Achilles reflexes are normal. Now, could you try to point your toes up and down, and then try to lift your legs straight up against my resistance?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. This is… a little difficult. I feel a bit of pain when I lift my leg up.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. There’s some mild weakness with dorsiflexion and some pain with straight leg raise, particularly on the left side. Now, could you stand up slowly for me and try to walk on your heels, and then on your toes?
PATIENT: Okay. Oh… that’s… not very comfortable. It hurts a little when I walk on my toes, and I feel a little off-balance.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Way. That’s helpful. Based on the examination and your history, it sounds like you likely have lumbar radiculopathy, meaning irritation of a nerve root in your lower back. The pain radiating down your leg, the tingling, the diminished reflexes, and the weakness are all consistent with that. The straight leg raise test was positive, which further supports that diagnosis. However, to rule out other possibilities and confirm the diagnosis, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. We also might consider an MRI if the pain doesn't improve with conservative treatment. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Lumbar… what now? Radiculopathy? That sounds… serious. So, it’s a pinched nerve? Is that what you’re saying? And an X-ray? Will that show what’s wrong? I just want to know what’s going on, and what we can do about it. It’s just been bothering me for so long.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, Mr. Way. It sounds serious, but it’s often manageable. Essentially, “radiculopathy” means a nerve root is irritated or compressed. You’re right to think of it as a pinched nerve. It’s often caused by a herniated disc, bone spurs, or narrowing of the spinal canal. The X-ray will help us see the bones in your spine and rule out any fractures or significant structural problems. It won’t show the nerves themselves, which is why we might consider an MRI if needed. An MRI gives us a much more detailed picture of the soft tissues, including the discs and nerves. For now, we’ll start with conservative treatment. This includes over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, which you’re already taking, but we may want to consider a muscle relaxant. Also, physical therapy can be very helpful to strengthen your back muscles and improve your flexibility. We’ll also want to avoid activities that aggravate your pain. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, like I said, no allergies. Muscle relaxant, huh? Sounds… strong. Will that make me sleepy? And what kind of activities should I avoid? I like to garden, and I walk a little bit every day. I don’t want to just sit around doing nothing.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about the side effects, Mr. Way. Some muscle relaxants can cause drowsiness, so we’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it makes you too sleepy, we can adjust the dosage or try a different medication. As for activities, we want to avoid anything that puts a lot of stress on your lower back. That means avoiding heavy lifting, bending, twisting, and prolonged sitting or standing. Gardening is okay, but avoid digging, bending over for long periods, and lifting heavy pots. Walking is also good, but keep it gentle and avoid walking on uneven surfaces. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing with the conservative treatment. If your pain doesn’t improve, we can discuss other options, such as injections or, in rare cases, surgery. For now, I’m going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, and I’ll give you some instructions on how to take it. I'll also give you some handouts on lower back pain and exercises you can do at home. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything really well. I feel a little better just knowing what's going on, and what we can do about it. Hopefully, this muscle relaxant will help. I’ll try to take it easy, and avoid those activities you mentioned. When should I start taking it?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help. It's good you feel a little better knowing what's going on. You can start taking the muscle relaxant tonight, one tablet before bed. It’s best to take it with food to minimize any stomach upset. And remember, start with one tablet and see how you feel. If it doesn’t seem to be helping after a few days, or if you experience any side effects, please call the office. Here are those handouts and the prescription. The nurse will be in shortly to review everything with you. Do you have any work or school activities that may need to be modified?
PATIENT: No, I’m retired. Luckily, my days of heavy lifting are over! Just gardening, like I said. And walking. So, I'll try to adjust those. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. I think I’m all set for now. .
