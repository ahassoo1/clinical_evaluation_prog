DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my back. It’s been really bad. Worse than usual, I think. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? A little pain, then got bigger each day. It hurts to stand, and even to sit for long. I have... cancer, you know. And this feels… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. I understand. Back pain, and it feels different this time, especially with your history of cancer. That's good you brought that up. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. When you say "different," can you describe that specifically?
PATIENT: Different... hmm. It's not just a dull ache like before. Before it was just… there. This feels like… sharp little shocks sometimes. And it goes down my leg now, both legs even. Before it stayed in my back, mostly. And it feels… warmer, if that makes sense? Not like a fever warm, but… inside warm. And I can't find a good position to sit, not even with pillows.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp shocks radiating down both legs, a warmth sensation… and difficulty finding a comfortable position. That certainly sounds concerning, especially with the change from your previous back pain. I want to make sure we rule out anything serious. To get a better understanding, can you tell me exactly where the pain started?
PATIENT: Um... let me think. It started… right here. Right in the small of my back. Not on the sides, not high up, right there. Then it started to spread. First to my hips, then down my legs. It's mostly the backs of my legs, from my hips to my knees, but sometimes I feel it in my feet too. It’s hard to say exactly, everything hurts now!
DOCTOR: Alright, starting in the lower back and radiating down both legs… That helps. And you mentioned it's been about a week now. Has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, bending over, definitely. And lifting things, even small things! My grandson, he's a little boy, and I tried to pick him up yesterday, and oof. Big mistake. Just moving around a lot makes it worse, really. I try to stay still, but even sitting for too long doesn’t help. I tried to go to church Sunday, and it was… a bad day.
DOCTOR: Okay, bending, lifting, and even prolonged sitting aggravate it. And church on Sunday was difficult. I see. Now, let’s talk about your cancer history for a moment. I know this can be sensitive, so please feel free to share only what you’re comfortable with. What type of cancer were you diagnosed with, and what treatment have you received?
PATIENT: Oh... um. It’s… in my bones. They said it started there, then spread. I had… chemo, a long time ago. And radiation. That was… a few years back. It was good for a while, everything was okay. But the doctor said it can come back. And that’s what I’m scared of. It hasn't spread new places, just... back to the bones, maybe? I don't really remember everything. It's a lot of doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, bone cancer with previous chemotherapy and radiation treatment. And you're concerned about a possible recurrence. That's completely understandable, Ms. Meigs. It’s okay if you don't remember all the details; that's what I’m here for. Just to clarify – and please correct me if I’m wrong – the previous cancer was primarily affecting your bones, and you’re concerned this back pain might be related?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s right. Mostly my back and my hips before. And... they did some scans, a while ago, and said it was… quiet. That’s what the doctor said. Quiet. Now it doesn't feel quiet anymore. It feels... loud. And angry. I'm worried it’s spreading again, and… I don't want to go through that again. It was hard.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Meigs. It sounds like a very difficult experience, and it's natural to be concerned about a potential recurrence. Okay, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. We'll just check your back, hips, and legs, see how things are moving, and look for any areas of tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds… good. I guess. I just… I don't want anything bad. Is it going to hurt? I'm a little scared.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be scared, Ms. Meigs. We'll take it slow and gentle. It shouldn't hurt, but let me know immediately if anything does cause discomfort. We'll just be moving your legs, checking your reflexes, and feeling around a bit. If I find anything concerning, I’ll let you know right away. Would you like me to explain what I’m doing as I go?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would… help. I don’t like surprises. If it’s going to hurt, just tell me. And… is it possible it’s just… old age? I’m not getting any younger. Maybe I just pulled something?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Meigs. I’ll explain everything as I go. And yes, it’s always possible it could be something simple, like a muscle strain. But given your history, it's important to rule out anything more serious. Let’s start with the exam, and then we can talk about next steps. If you're comfortable, could you lie down on your back on the examination table when you're ready?
PATIENT: Okay. I’m ready, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. Thank you. Let’s start by checking your range of motion. I'm going to ask you to lift each leg, bending at the hip and the knee. Just lift as high as is comfortable, and let me know if you feel any pain. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Ow. That… that’s a little sore. Not terrible, but… yeah. It hurts when I lift it up too high.
DOCTOR: Okay, some discomfort with lifting your right leg. And how about bending it at the knee?
PATIENT: It's okay bending it. Not much pain there. It’s more when I lift the whole leg up, like you asked. Like pulling it straight up to the ceiling. That's when it really hurts. It feels like... a pull, in my hip.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pull in the hip when lifting the leg. I’m just feeling around now. And how about your lower back?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… tender. Right there. It feels… achy, and warm. And pressing on it makes the pain shoot down my legs a little bit. Not bad, but I feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower back, with radiation of pain down the legs when pressure is applied. I'm now going to check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knee and ankle with this little hammer, and just see how your leg responds. It shouldn’t hurt, but let me know if it feels uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. A hammer? That sounds… scary. But okay, go ahead. I'll try to relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the other side. Your reflexes appear a little diminished on both sides, but it’s difficult to say definitively without comparison to previous records. I'm going to listen to your back now, just to make sure there are no unusual sounds. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Diminished? That doesn’t sound good. Listening? Like with the… the tube thing? I don’t like the tube thing. But… okay. Do it quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just taking a listen… Everything sounds clear on both sides. No unusual sounds. Now, I want to review your medical history a little bit more in detail. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um... just my blood pressure. It gets a little high sometimes. And my diabetes, but I take pills for that. It's mostly under control, I think. The doctor says it is. I try to eat healthy, but… it’s hard. Especially when I’m worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and diabetes, both managed with medication. That’s helpful to know. And are you currently taking any other medications besides those for your blood pressure and diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! I take something for the pain. It's… a little white pill. The doctor gave it to me a few months ago. It helps a little, but not much anymore. It doesn't take the pain away, just… dulls it. I think it’s called… something-profen. I forget. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, something-profen for the pain. We can look that up to confirm exactly what it is. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway. I've taken a lot of pills over the years!
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Okay, Ms. Meigs, thank you for providing that information. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing back pain with radicular symptoms, meaning the pain is radiating down your legs. The diminished reflexes and tenderness in your lower back are also concerning, especially given your history of bone cancer. While it's possible this could be a muscle strain, we need to rule out a recurrence of your cancer or other potential causes. I’d like to order some imaging, specifically an MRI of your lumbar spine, to get a better look at what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An… MRI? What does that do? Is it going to hurt? I don't like small spaces. I get… nervous. And will my insurance cover it? I don't want a big bill.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Meigs. It's okay to be nervous. An MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your spine. It doesn't use any radiation, and it’s generally painless. You'll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel, but it's a wide tunnel, and you can have headphones to listen to music if you'd like. We can also discuss medication to help you relax if you’re feeling anxious. As for insurance, we will submit the order to your insurance company, and they will determine the coverage. Our billing department will contact you if there are any concerns about the cost. We will do everything we can to make sure you understand the financial implications beforehand. Would you like me to have someone from the billing department call you after our visit to discuss the details?
PATIENT: Okay. A tunnel… that doesn’t sound good. Music would be nice. And yes, please have someone call me about the money. I don't want any surprises. And… how long does it take to get the pictures? Will I have to wait a long time to know what's wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. We can schedule the MRI for as soon as possible, likely within the next few days. The scan itself takes about 30-60 minutes. It usually takes a few days for the radiologist to review the images and send the report to me. As soon as I have the results, I'll contact you immediately to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I can prescribe you a stronger pain medication to help manage your discomfort. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Stronger pain medicine would be good. This pain is… getting to me. And… what if it is the cancer again? What happens then? I don’t want to go through all that again. The chemo… it was awful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Meigs. It’s completely natural to be scared about the possibility of the cancer returning. If the MRI confirms a recurrence, we will discuss all available treatment options, taking into account your previous experience with chemo and your overall health. There have been significant advancements in cancer treatment in recent years, and we will explore all possibilities to ensure you receive the best possible care. We will also focus on managing your symptoms and improving your quality of life. For now, let’s focus on getting the MRI scheduled and getting you some relief from the pain. I will write you a prescription for a stronger pain medication, and I will also provide you with a referral to a pain management specialist if you would like to explore additional options. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds good. A plan. I like that. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I appreciate you listening to me. And… I guess I should call to schedule that… tunnel thing?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad I could help. And yes, please. Our scheduling department will call you shortly to arrange the MRI. They can answer any questions you have about the procedure as well. Here is a print-out of your prescription and the contact information for both the scheduling department and the pain management specialist. Before you go, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Finco. I appreciate your help. And… I'll wait for the phone call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. Take care, and please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. We’ll be in touch soon.
