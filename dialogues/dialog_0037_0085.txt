DOCTOR: Good morning, Gabbrielle. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…fine. Really. It’s just this discoloration. It’s rather unsightly, if I’m being honest. I noticed it about a week ago, I think. Though, honestly, keeping track of everything is difficult. It’s on my arm, here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you came in to have it checked out. “Unsightly” is a perfectly valid reason to seek medical attention, and we want to figure out what’s going on. So, about a week ago, you noticed this discoloration on your left forearm. Can you describe the discoloration for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not…bright. It’s not a rash, it’s not raised, it’s just…different. Like a patch of…duller skin. A sort of greyish-brown, I suppose. It's not painful or itchy, thankfully. Honestly, if it wasn’t so noticeable, I probably wouldn’t have bothered. I have a…certain aesthetic to maintain, you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand. Greyish-brown, not raised, not painful or itchy – that gives me a good starting point. And you noticed it about a week ago. Has it changed at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It might be a little bigger. Very slight, though. It's difficult to say for sure. I spend most of my time indoors, cataloging, so the lighting isn't always the best. And frankly, I don't stare at my arms all day, Doctor. I have important things to do.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fair. So, potentially slightly larger over the past week, but you haven’t noticed any other changes – no bleeding, crusting, or new symptoms?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. It’s just…there. It’s not bothering me, per se, but it’s… distracting. And I had a colleague remark on it yesterday, and she has absolutely no sense of tact. Said it looked “peculiar.” Peculiar! As if I would have something peculiar about my appearance.
DOCTOR: I understand that can be upsetting. Alright, Gabbrielle. To get a better idea of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions, then I'll do a quick physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, fine. Though, I do hope this won't take long. I have a rather precise schedule, you see. And I’m not particularly fond of being poked and prodded, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, have you noticed any similar discolorations anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. This is…isolated. I pay attention to these things. I wouldn’t have missed something else. I’m rather meticulous, you see. Everything has its place, everything is accounted for. It’s just…this one spot. And it’s quite unwelcome.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know it’s isolated. Now, have you had any recent injuries to your arm?
PATIENT: Injuries? No, of course not. I work indoors, surrounded by archival materials. The most strenuous activity I engage in is lifting a box of old documents. And I'm extremely careful with those. Absolutely no scrapes, cuts, or bumps. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing of significance. I’m generally quite healthy. I maintain a…reasonable diet, though I confess I’m not overly fond of exercise. And I’ve never had any serious illnesses, thank goodness. Just the usual colds, nothing to write home about. I do have Medicare, of course, but I rarely need to use it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve always been very careful to avoid situations that might require such things. A hospital is…a rather unpleasant environment, wouldn’t you agree? And unnecessary risks are simply…unacceptable. I’ve always taken preventative measures.
DOCTOR: I agree, hospitals aren't ideal. Alright, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Well…my mother had some…digestive issues, but nothing specific. And my father was a very stoic man, rarely complained about anything. I don't believe there's a history of anything…remarkable. Mostly just sensible, practical people. Not prone to…ailing, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat…a fairly standard diet. No shellfish, I don't particularly care for it. But no reactions to anything, not ever. I'm quite…resilient, really. I rarely suffer from anything, Doctor. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s all very helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I prefer to rely on…natural remedies when necessary. And I’m very cautious about putting anything artificial into my system. I believe in maintaining a…pure state, if that makes sense. Perhaps a little chamomile tea occasionally, but nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, would you mind if I take a quick look at the discoloration on your arm?
PATIENT: Fine. But please be gentle. And try not to linger. I have a very precise cataloging schedule to maintain, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the discoloration. It’s about this size. It doesn’t appear to be raised or painful, which is good. The skin texture seems normal. I don't see any signs of active inflammation. Have you been exposed to any new chemicals or plants recently?
PATIENT: New chemicals? Plants? Absolutely not. I haven’t been gardening, and I certainly don’t handle…unsavory substances. I spend my days surrounded by carefully preserved documents, not…industrial byproducts. Though, I suppose there are some cleaning solutions used on the older volumes...but a colleague handles those, and she always wears gloves.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your description, the lack of pain or tenderness, and no recent exposures, it could be a few things. It could be a simple bruise you don’t remember, though it's not typical to have one appear like this without a known injury. It could also be a form of hyperpigmentation, a change in skin color. Less likely, but possible, would be a fungal infection or a mild skin reaction. To be certain, I'd like to order a simple skin scraping to rule out any fungal infection. It’s a quick, painless procedure. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: A scraping? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds…unpleasant. And I fail to see the necessity. I've already explained that I haven’t been exposed to anything untoward. It’s likely just…a temporary discoloration, a quirk of the skin. I really don’t think it warrants any invasive procedures.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. While it may be a temporary discoloration, a quick scraping provides a definitive answer and eliminates any possibility of a treatable fungal infection. It’s a very low-risk procedure and doesn’t involve any significant discomfort. It's a matter of being thorough, especially given my responsibility to ensure your health. However, if you’re truly opposed to the scraping, we can observe it for the next few weeks. If it doesn’t change, or if it gets larger, more painful, or develops any other symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. But if we don't investigate, there's a small chance we could miss something. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Fine. But quickly. And I expect a full explanation of the procedure beforehand. I’m not fond of surprises, Doctor. And if it causes any…discomfort, I shall expect a thorough apology.
DOCTOR: Alright. It will be very quick. I’ll gently scrape a small sample of skin from the affected area using a sterile blade. It shouldn't be painful, perhaps a slight sensation of pressure or scraping, like a very mild exfoliation. It will take less than a minute. Then, the sample will be sent to the lab for analysis, and we should have the results in a few days. I will review them with you as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Just…be gentle, please. And explain exactly what you're doing as you go. I dislike the unknown. And I trust this won't interfere with my cataloging schedule? The Voltaire collection is quite time-sensitive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll explain everything as I go. We're simply collecting a very small sample of skin cells for analysis. This will help us rule out any potential fungal infection. It shouldn’t take long at all, and I'll be as gentle as possible. This might feel a little cool. Now, I'm going to gently scrape the surface of the skin with this blade. It’s a very superficial scrape; it won’t break the skin. It might feel a little pressure, like a light scratching sensation. Alright, that’s all done. It's a very small sample. There might be a little bit of redness for a few minutes, but it should subside quickly. Just keep it clean and dry. I've sent the sample to the lab, and we should have the results in a few days. I’ll contact you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you notice any changes – increased redness, pain, or any other symptoms – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, fine. It's…rather noticeable. Hopefully, it won't interfere with my work. I do have a certain image to maintain, you see. And please, do contact me promptly with the results. I dislike waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand. I will ensure the results are communicated to you as quickly as possible, and I apologize for any inconvenience the bandage may cause. It is a small bandage, but I appreciate your concern. We've completed the initial assessment and ordered the necessary testing. In the meantime, if you don't notice any changes, there's no need to worry. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that will be all. I trust you’ve taken all necessary precautions. And please, remember the Voltaire collection. It is of utmost importance.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I have documented all your concerns, including the importance of the Voltaire collection, in your chart. Thank you for coming in today, Gabbrielle. We will be in touch with the lab results as soon as they are available. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any changes or have any further questions. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
