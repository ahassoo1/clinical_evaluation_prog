DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Dr. Beinborn. Nice to meet you as well. Well, I been havin' some trouble with my blood pressure, that's why I'm here. It’s been a bit high lately, and I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure. I understand. And when you say “lately,” can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably about three months now. I noticed it when I started checkin’ it at home with one of those machines my niece got me. Before that, I didn’t really pay it much mind, just checked it at the doctor's office when I had a regular appointment. But it's been consistently higher than what feels normal, you know? Like, over 140 most times.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months of home readings consistently over 140. That’s good information, thank you. Do you happen to know what your readings usually were before you started checking at home—at the doctor’s office, perhaps?
PATIENT: I… honestly, I don't remember the exact numbers. I always just figured it was okay when the nurse said somethin'. Never really paid close attention, to be truthful. It was usually around normal, I guess. Not anything anyone ever worried about. That’s why I was surprised when it started being so high at home.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common not to remember specific numbers. Okay, so it's a relatively new change. Have you noticed any symptoms along with the higher readings?
PATIENT: Symptoms… not really. I mean, I get headaches sometimes, but I always get headaches. And maybe a little tired, but who isn't these days? Nothin' that made me think it was somethin' serious, just figured it was stress or somethin'. I haven’t been feelin’ particularly bad, if that makes sense. Just the high numbers on the machine worried me.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. No new or unusual symptoms, just the headaches and fatigue you usually experience. Let’s do a quick check of your vitals, and then I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your health history, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Dr. Beinborn. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to answer any questions. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to start with your blood pressure, of course, and then we'll check your pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and try to breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 152/94 today. Your pulse is 78 and regular, temperature is 98.6, and your lungs sound clear. Your heart sounds normal as well. I'll document these findings. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothin' like that. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise. I had the flu a couple of times, and a bad sprain in my ankle years ago, but nothin’ serious. No diabetes, no kidney problems, and definitely no heart disease. My mother had high blood pressure when she got older, but that’s it, as far as family goes. Mostly just the usual aches and pains that come with gettin’ older, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No major medical history for yourself, and your mother had high blood pressure later in life. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope, never been in the hospital. And no surgeries either. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. Other than that, I've been able to avoid all that. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat right, get a little exercise when I can. Nothing too strenuous, though.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a baby aspirin every other day, that's it. My doctor at home suggested it a few years back, just for prevention. And sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I've been kinda forgettin’ lately, to be honest. Not much else. I try to avoid takin' pills whenever possible, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, baby aspirin every other day and a multivitamin occasionally. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, take any medicine… never had a reaction to anything. That’s one thing I don’t have to worry about, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My mother always warned me about it, and I just never started. Always found the smell kinda unpleasant, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing too much, just to relax. I don’t really drink hard liquor or beer. Just a little wine, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of glasses of wine a few times a week. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your typical diet and exercise routine?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of fruits and vegetables, fish a couple of times a week, chicken… I love to cook, so I usually make my own meals. I try to avoid fast food and processed stuff as much as possible. As for exercise… I walk when I can, maybe three or four times a week. Nothing too strenuous, you know? Just a little stroll around the neighborhood. I used to do more, but my knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Thank you for sharing all of that. Based on what you've told me—the recent elevation in blood pressure, your family history, and your lifestyle—it sounds like we're dealing with what could be early-stage hypertension. It's not necessarily an immediate emergency, but it’s something we definitely need to address. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work—a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. I'd also recommend a 24-hour urine test to assess your kidney function and rule out other causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. If that's what you think is best, Dr. Beinborn, then yeah, let's do it. I trust your judgment. Blood work and a urine test, right? Is it gonna be a lot of pokin’ and proddin’?
DOCTOR: No, not too much. The blood work is just a standard arm stick—a few vials of blood. And the 24-hour urine test just involves collecting all your urine for a full day—we'll give you a special container and instructions. It’s a little inconvenient, but not painful. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and develop a plan—which might involve lifestyle changes, medication, or a combination of both. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. A little inconvenient, but I can manage. So, blood work and collectin’ pee for a day. And then we talk about what happens next. Yeah, that sounds good, Dr. Beinborn. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood now. They’ll also give you the instructions for the 24-hour urine collection. After that, I'll write you a prescription for the lab work and the urine collection container. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home if you can. It’ll give us a better understanding of how it fluctuates throughout the day. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything pretty well. Just keep monitorin’ my blood pressure and get these tests done. I guess… is there anything I should be lookin’ out for? Any symptoms I should be worried about before we get the results back?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. While we're waiting for the results, please be mindful of any severe headaches, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, or numbness or weakness on one side of your body. Those could indicate a more serious problem and would require immediate medical attention. But generally, if you feel okay, there's no need to be overly worried. We’re mostly being proactive at this stage. The tests will help us determine the best course of action to manage your blood pressure and keep you healthy. Now, let me call the lab technician…
PATIENT: Okay, severe headaches, vision changes… I'll keep an eye out for those. Thank you for tellin’ me, Dr. Beinborn. I appreciate it.
