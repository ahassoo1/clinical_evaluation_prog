DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. McKinnon. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. It’s… well, my muscles feel weak. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to get in the way of things. I don’t really know how to explain it other than that, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Weakness”… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not like… paralyzed or anything. Just… everything feels harder. Lifting things, even just getting up from a chair. It’s like it takes more effort than it used to. It’s mostly in my arms and legs, I think. It's hard to tell exactly. It's not painful, just… tiring. Is that making sense? I’m not good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiring…not painful. Arms and legs primarily. And you said this has been going on for “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe… three or four months now? It started slow, just feeling a bit more tired after work. I thought it was just the heat, honestly. We had a really hot spell back in June. But it hasn't really gotten better, and it seems to be getting a little worse each week. I work outside a lot, appraising cars after accidents. It's physical work, you know?
DOCTOR: Appraising cars…physical work. Okay. And has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Like I said, it just gradually got worse. It doesn’t seem to be linked to anything I’ve done. I haven’t injured myself or anything. Maybe being on my feet all day makes it a little worse while I'm doing it, but it doesn't cause it, if that makes sense. I've been trying to take more breaks, but it doesn't seem to help much. I just…feel weaker overall.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really. I’ve been a bit more tired overall, I guess, but I chalked that up to the weakness. No fever, no dizziness, no… well, nothing else really. I haven't lost any weight, and I don’t have any trouble eating. I just feel… worn out, mostly. I haven’t really been sleeping well either, but that’s probably because I’m worrying about this.
DOCTOR: Okay… no fever, dizziness, weight loss. Sleep disturbance, potentially related to worry. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing diagnosed. I’ve never really been sick, to be honest. Had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox and all that, but nothing serious. Never been hospitalized, never had any surgeries. I’ve always been pretty healthy, which is why this is so worrying. I don’t even really go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior diagnoses, no hospitalizations, no surgeries. Good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My… family? Um. My dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my mom had some arthritis in her hands when she got older. Nothing major, I don't think. My siblings are both healthy, as far as I know. We don’t really talk about health stuff much. Is that helpful? I'm not really sure what you're looking for.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don't take anything regularly. Maybe a pain reliever if I get a headache, but that's it. I try to avoid medication if I can. I really don't like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. As far as I know, anyway. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, I haven't had any trouble with food either. I'm starting to feel a bit silly explaining all this. It doesn't feel like much, but it's still worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it's good that we're ruling things out. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It'll just be some basic strength and reflex checks. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No, no objections. Go ahead. I just want to figure out what’s wrong, if that’s possible. The sooner the better, really. I’ve got a lot of work to catch up on.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just extend your arms straight out, palms up, I’ll check your strength. Then we’ll do the same with your legs. Okay, strength is… slightly diminished in both arms and legs, but not dramatically so. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are… within normal limits, although slightly sluggish. Let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds normal, lungs are clear. No murmurs or wheezing. Alright. Everything sounds… relatively normal. It’s difficult to say definitively, but it doesn’t immediately suggest anything serious.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… reassuring, I guess. So what does that mean? What could be causing this? Is it something I need to worry about? I’ve got bills to pay, you know? I can't afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. There are a number of possibilities. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, or dehydration. It could be something more, but the physical exam wasn't particularly alarming. To be thorough, I’d like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. That should give us a better idea of what’s going on. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I haven't been able to afford it for a while now. What… what would the tests cost? Is there any way to… reduce the cost? I really didn’t want to have to deal with this, honestly. It’s just one thing after another.
DOCTOR: Alright. Without insurance, the tests will be… approximately $250, maybe a little more depending on the lab. I understand that's a significant cost. There’s a community clinic nearby that offers reduced rates based on income. I can give you their information. Alternatively, we could start with just a vitamin D level, as deficiency is relatively common and can cause fatigue and muscle weakness. That’s about $80. If that comes back low, we can discuss further testing options. What do you think?
PATIENT: Eighty dollars… I could probably manage that. Let’s start with the vitamin D test, then. If that shows something, we can talk about the other tests. Thanks, Doctor. That's… a lot better than $250. I appreciate you explaining everything. What do I need to do to get the test done?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the lab order. You can take this to [Lab Name] on [Street Address]. They're open from 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. Fasting isn’t required for this test. It should take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – you can either schedule a follow-up appointment with me, or have them sent directly to me. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds pretty straightforward. I can do that. [Lab Name]… got it. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Hopefully it's just a vitamin deficiency. I should get going. I’ve got work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll look forward to seeing the results. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe weakness, difficulty breathing, or chest pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, take it easy. Have a good day, Mr. McKinnon.
