DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. I’m Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Piet. Well, it’s a bit… difficult to explain. I’ve just been feeling weaker, slowly, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they’ve started to droop. It’s not terribly noticeable all the time, but I’ve definitely noticed it when I look in the mirror. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Slowly getting weaker and noticing drooping eyelids over the past few months… I understand why that would be worrying. Can you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… it’s hard to pinpoint exactly where it started, but I think it was in my legs, maybe? I used to go for quite long walks, but I’ve been getting tired much more quickly. Now it feels like it’s… spreading, I suppose. My arms feel weaker too, especially if I try to lift anything heavy. It's not a sudden thing, like a fall or anything, just… less strength, overall. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A gradual weakening, starting in your legs and now affecting your arms as well. And you mentioned the drooping eyelids – is that worse at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It seems to be worse in the evenings. Like, if I’ve been reading or using the computer for a while, they definitely droop more. In the mornings, it's not so bad. Though, to be fair, I haven’t been doing much reading lately, with feeling so tired. Is that… is that important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful information. Drooping that worsens with activity, and improves with rest, is good to know. Have you noticed any double vision, or blurry vision at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t think so. My vision seems… normal, as far as I can tell. I wear glasses, you see, for distance, but my prescription hasn't changed recently. No blurry vision or anything like seeing double. I suppose I haven’t really looked for it, if that makes sense? I just assumed it was my glasses if anything seemed off.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No double vision or blurry vision. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes in your breathing, or any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My breathing feels… normal, I think. I haven’t had any trouble breathing, or felt short of breath, not at all. I can walk up the stairs, I haven't been avoiding activity because of my lungs, at least. It's just… the muscles feeling tired, mostly. Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no shortness of breath. Have you experienced any changes in your weight, either weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I haven’t really been weighing myself regularly. I… well, my divorce was finalized a few months ago, and I haven't been as diligent about keeping up with things like that, if you understand. But I haven’t noticed any big changes in how my clothes fit, or anything. I’d say my weight is… stable, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable weight. And just to clarify, the divorce was finalized a few months ago—has that caused a lot of stress?
PATIENT: Yes, it has been… stressful. Very stressful. It wasn't a particularly amicable separation, and… well, there was a lot of back and forth. I'm trying to get back on my feet now, but it’s been… draining, emotionally and, I suppose, physically, too. I haven’t been sleeping as well as I used to, either. Not that I’m blaming everything on the divorce, but it’s certainly not helped.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Stress and sleep disruption can certainly impact your health. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any history of medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've always been fairly healthy, I think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I haven’t been to the doctor in a few years, to be honest. Just for a check-up now and then. I don’t take any regular medication, either. I don't have any allergies that I know of. Just… generally healthy, until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, no known medical conditions, allergies or medications. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Never had any surgeries, no. Nothing like that. My parents always encouraged me to stay active and avoid unnecessary things like that, if possible. I broke my arm once as a child, but that was just a simple fracture, it healed fine. Nothing major, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family, do either of your parents or siblings have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's a good question. My mother, she… she had some problems with her heart in her later years. She passed away about five years ago. And my father, he… well, he’s still alive, but he’s quite old now, and he’s developed some memory problems. Not sure what the diagnosis is, just… forgetfulness, mostly. My sister is healthy, as far as I know, but we don’t see each other very often, so I wouldn’t necessarily know. Is that… helpful information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. History of heart problems in your mother and memory problems in your father. Alright, Gedalya. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Could you please sit up and let me listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Please, go ahead. I hope it’s not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Let me check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? I… I don’t think I’m as strong as I used to be, honestly. It feels a bit difficult. I’m trying, though. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And now, can you push against my hands like you're trying to stand up?
PATIENT: Like this? It… it's harder than it looks. It feels like I'm pushing through something. I'm trying, but it’s definitely not as easy as it used to be. I hope I'm doing it correctly?
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. And let me just take another look at your eyelids... Yes, there is noticeable ptosis in both eyelids, particularly when you look upwards for an extended period. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, I'm concerned about a possible neuromuscular condition. It could be something relatively straightforward, or something that requires further investigation. I want to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying deficiencies or autoimmune issues. And I also want to schedule you for a neurological consultation with a specialist. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Neuromuscular condition… that sounds a bit worrying, honestly. But if that’s what’s needed to figure out what’s going on, then yes, please. Blood tests and a specialist consultation… whatever you think is best, Doctor Piet. I just want to know what's happening, and hopefully, get some treatment. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Or anything I should be avoiding?
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll get those tests ordered right away and schedule you with a neurologist. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin D level. The neurologist may want to order additional testing, such as an MRI or nerve conduction studies. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest. Avoid strenuous activity that exacerbates your weakness. And if you notice any new symptoms, such as double vision, difficulty swallowing, or shortness of breath, please contact me immediately. I understand this is unsettling, and I want to assure you that we'll work together to get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers everything, for now. Thank you, Doctor Piet. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and explaining everything so clearly. It's a relief to have some sort of plan, at least. I'm a little worried, of course, but… I trust your judgment. Just let me know when the tests are ready, and when I can see the neurologist. And thank you again. Truly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gedalya. I'm glad I could help. My staff will contact you with the lab results and schedule the neurologist appointment as soon as possible. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before then. We’ll get this figured out. .
