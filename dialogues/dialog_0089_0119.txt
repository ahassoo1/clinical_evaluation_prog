DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that’s why one comes to a doctor, isn't it? It’s a… a problem. A delicate problem, with… discharge. Yes. Penile discharge. Though it’s not my penis, naturally. It’s… a relative’s. A young man. It's quite upsetting, really. He’s not taking proper care of himself, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is good you’re bringing this to my attention, even if it feels awkward. To clarify, you're seeking medical advice for a young male relative experiencing penile discharge?
PATIENT: Well, seeking might be too strong a word. I’m informing you of a situation. And yes, a young man. Though "young" is relative, isn't it? He’s… not a child, but certainly not… established. And he should be more careful. Really, the things people get up to these days… It’s quite concerning. Is this going to be a long process? I have my bingo game this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and your time constraints, Jinnie. To best advise him – and I do want to emphasize we need his consent to discuss details, even with you present – I'll need some more information. Could you tell me about when the discharge started?
PATIENT: Consent? Really. Well, he's a bit… flighty. Doesn't think things through. I'm perfectly capable of relaying the information, I assure you. As for when… oh, goodness. It's been… a week, perhaps? A little longer. He didn't say anything at first, of course. Boys. Always so secretive. It was when I noticed… a stain on his trousers. A very unpleasant color, I must say. Not a color one wants to see, at all. It's worrying, isn't it? What could it be?
DOCTOR: It’s good you noticed, Jinnie. A week or so is helpful. And you're right to be concerned. Several things could cause penile discharge, and it’s important to determine the cause. Is there any pain with urination, or any itching or burning sensation?
PATIENT: Pain? He didn't mention pain. Though he doesn't tell me much, as I said. Itching... possibly? He's been… fidgeting more than usual. And scratching. Yes, definitely some scratching. Though he claims it's a rash. A rash! Honestly, these young men and their self-diagnoses. It's probably… something dreadful, isn’t it? Something… contagious? I hope I haven’t… you know… been exposed.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned about potential exposure, Jinnie. Contagious infections are a possibility, yes. Itching and fidgeting are good information. Has he had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I haven't asked him about fevers. Really, one expects a certain level of responsibility, even from the younger generation. He did seem a bit… listless yesterday. A bit pale. But he also stayed up late playing those… video games. So it could be anything. And abdominal pain? No. He didn’t complain of any pain. He mostly complains about… lack of funds. Honestly, it’s exhausting keeping up with him. Is this something serious, Doctor? You’re not going to tell me it's something… dreadful, are you?
DOCTOR: Jinnie, it’s difficult to say without a proper examination and potentially some testing. Several things can cause these symptoms, and the severity can vary. A fever and feeling listless are things to take note of. To get a clearer picture, I really need to speak with him directly. Would you be comfortable with me asking to speak with him, even briefly, while you’re here?
PATIENT: Speak to him directly? Well… I suppose. But he’s a bit… sensitive. Don’t frighten him, Doctor. And don't ask about… details. I'll relay everything. Honestly, these doctors and their probing questions. It's quite unnecessary. He's not a child, but he's certainly not… robust. Just a quick chat, mind you. And no embarrassing questions. Do you have a waiting room? Perhaps I'll wait outside.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. I understand. I will be respectful and keep the conversation brief and general. I'll focus on getting the information needed for a proper assessment. We have a comfortable waiting room. Would you like me to call him in now?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, call him. But tell him I sent him. And… perhaps a glass of water might be helpful. He gets… flustered easily. And please, Doctor, be gentle. It's all very upsetting, you understand. This is… a delicate matter. Very delicate. Don't press him for details. Just… a general chat. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jinnie. I will be very gentle and respectful. I’ll let him know you sent him and offer him a glass of water. Please, make yourself comfortable in the waiting room. I'll call for him shortly. Could you please let [Relative’s Name] know Dr. Roseburroough is ready to see him?
