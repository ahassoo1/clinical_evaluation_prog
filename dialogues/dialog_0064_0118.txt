DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well... it's about this certification, you see. It’s… necessary for my work, naturally. Though I confess, the particulars are a bit… hazy. Something about needing a check-up for my senses, I believe? My ex-wife handled most of these administrative things, and frankly, I’ve not kept up with it.
DOCTOR: A certification check-up, alright. And it involves a review of your senses... vision, hearing, that sort of thing?
PATIENT: Precisely. Though I must say, I’ve always had rather excellent vision, myself. Perfectly adequate, I assure you. It's the details of the exam that escape me. What precisely are we checking for? Is there a standard? I wouldn’t want to be caught unprepared, you understand. It reflects poorly on one’s professionalism.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Oriley. It's good you're thinking ahead. The certification likely requires a baseline assessment, just to ensure everything is functioning as it should. We'll check your visual acuity – how well you see at different distances – and do a basic eye movement exam. We'll also assess your peripheral vision, and check the health of your eyes themselves. Is that helpful, or would you like me to go into more detail about any of those tests?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision… yes, that sounds…important. I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always found these things needlessly complicated. Are you saying there's a chance I might not pass? Because I assure you, I’ve always been quite capable. I simply require a clear explanation of the procedure. And perhaps a reasonable timeframe. I have other commitments, you understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, it's highly unlikely you won’t pass. This isn’t about failing, it’s about fulfilling the requirements of the certification. Think of it as a formality. We just need to document everything is within normal limits. The exam itself shouldn’t take long – perhaps 30 to 45 minutes. We’ll start with a quick review of your medical history, then move on to the vision tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Forty-five minutes… acceptable, I suppose. Though I do hope it doesn't interfere with my afternoon schedule. A quick review of my medical history… very well. But do try to be concise, Doctor. I’ve already explained it all to numerous… professionals over the years. And frankly, it’s rather tedious repeating myself. Are there any forms I need to fill out? I do dislike paperwork immensely.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration with repetition, Mr. Oriley. I’ll do my best to be efficient. There is a brief form, mostly just confirming your contact information and current medications. It’s mostly automated, so it shouldn’t take too long. Perhaps while you’re completing that, could you tell me if you've had any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision…? Hmm. Let me consider. Well, things haven't been crisp lately, perhaps. Not like they used to be. But that could simply be the lighting, couldn’t it? Or fatigue. I’ve been rather busy, you see. And I’ve always had a slight difficulty with reading small print. Though I’ve never considered it a significant issue. It’s… age, I presume.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Oriley. It’s common for vision to change gradually with age. We’ll certainly take a closer look at that during the exam. Do you wear glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: Glasses? No, never. Contacts are simply… barbaric. I’ve always prided myself on my natural eyesight. Perfectly adequate, I assure you. Though… now that you mention it, my ex-wife did suggest I consider them a few years ago. Something about astigmatism, I believe? But I dismissed it, naturally. A temporary inconvenience, I thought. And frankly, I dislike anything obstructing my vision.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Let me see… sometimes things appear… slightly blurred around the edges. But again, I attribute that to fatigue. Or possibly the quality of the lighting. This office, for example, is not particularly well-lit. And occasionally, I see… fleeting shadows. But I suspect that’s simply my imagination. I’ve always had a rather vivid imagination, you see. It’s a useful trait in my profession. Are we nearly finished with this… questionnaire?
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Mr. Oriley. Just a few more questions. These fleeting shadows… do they occur in one eye, or both?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a rather precise question. Let me think… I believe… both. Yes, both eyes, on occasion. They're not persistent, you understand. More like… momentary disturbances. And they don’t interfere with my work, thankfully. Though I confess, they are rather unsettling. My ex-wife always insisted I consult an ophthalmologist, but I dismissed her concerns. She tended to exaggerate, you see. Is this relevant, Doctor? I fail to see the connection to this certification.
DOCTOR: It’s good to have a complete picture, Mr. Oriley. These details help us ensure everything is functioning as it should. Now, regarding your medical history… have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Absolutely not. I maintain a strict diet, you see. And I'm quite particular about my sugar intake. High blood pressure… possibly. My ex-wife did mention it once. Something about stress, I believe. But I dismissed it, naturally. I find stress rather invigorating, actually. It sharpens the mind. I suspect she simply misread the instrument. She wasn't a medical professional, you see. There. Finished. Now, can we proceed with the… examination? I have a rather busy afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Thank you for that information. Given your report of fleeting shadows in both eyes, and your history of dismissing concerns raised by your ex-wife, I think it would be prudent to conduct a more thorough eye exam than initially planned. Just to be safe. I'd like to check your visual fields – that assesses your peripheral vision – and I’d like to dilate your pupils to get a better look at the back of your eyes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Dilate my pupils…? That sounds… inconvenient. And rather disruptive. Will that affect my vision for an extended period? I have commitments, Doctor. Important commitments. And frankly, I dislike anything interfering with my natural state. Is it absolutely necessary? Perhaps a less… invasive procedure would suffice? I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. This certification is merely a formality, you see. A bureaucratic obligation. I fail to see the need for such… drastic measures.
