DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nahrwold. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Honestly, it's... well, my stomach's been bothering me. A lot. It's been, like, really loose for a while now. I can't really remember how long, exactly. A few weeks, maybe? Longer? It's just…constant, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant digestive issues can be quite disruptive. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few weeks, I think. It’s hard to say for sure. I just keep...going to the bathroom. More than usual, definitely. It's just water, mostly. It's exhausting, honestly. And kind of embarrassing, to be talking about this. I don't really...remember the last time things were normal, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Nahrwold. It's perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable discussing these things, but it's important to get to the bottom of it. "Watery" stools for a few weeks now… Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this?
PATIENT: Blood…no, I don’t think so. Not that I’ve seen, anyway. It's just…well, you know. It's all liquid. Fever…maybe a little bit? I felt warm a couple of times, but I thought it was just the weather. I haven’t thrown up, no. And I haven't been feeling sick-sick, just…really tired and uncomfortable. I don’t know if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Nahrwold. Fatigue and discomfort are common with these kinds of issues. Let’s try to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any abdominal pain or cramping?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. It's not, like, sharp pain, but it's a really dull ache, mostly in my lower stomach. It comes and goes, but it's pretty constant when I'm…you know. When I'm having…the bathroom issues. And sometimes, even when I'm not. It feels…bloated too, a lot of the time. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating and a dull ache in your lower abdomen, along with the watery stools and fatigue. That gives us a bit more to work with. Now, have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Not really... I mean, my husband does most of the cooking. We eat pretty much the same stuff we always do, I think. Rice, chicken, vegetables… sometimes curry. Nothing new, definitely. I honestly can't remember if I've eaten anything different recently. My memory's been a bit…fuzzy lately. Is that weird?
DOCTOR: It’s not weird at all, Ms. Nahrwold. Stress can definitely affect your memory. Let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Um…just my regular birth control pill. And sometimes, I take something for headaches… ibuprofen, I think? But I don’t take it very often. Oh! And the doctor put me on something a while ago, for… for my stomach. Something to help with… well, I think it was for inflammation. I can't remember the name of it. It’s a small white pill, I think. I've been taking that on and off for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, birth control pills, ibuprofen occasionally, and a white pill for inflammation… That's helpful. Do you happen to know when you started taking the white pill?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is frustrating. Honestly, I have no idea. A while ago. Maybe…a year? Or two? It was after I saw a different doctor, because my stomach was bothering me then too. He said something about…I think he said something about my intestines being a bit angry? He did some tests. I don't remember what they were for, or what the results were. He just gave me the pills and told me to take them when my stomach hurt. I've been taking them on and off since then. I'm really bad with remembering these things, I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Nahrwold. Don't apologize; it's perfectly common to forget details. We can try to access those records. Do you recall which clinic you saw that doctor at?
PATIENT: Um… I think… it was a big clinic? Not this one. It was… downtown, maybe? I went with my mother. It was…brightly lit. And crowded. Oh! I think the doctor had a funny accent. Not like Doctor Giganti's accent, a different one. I really wish I could remember the name! It was a while ago now. I think… they sent me a bill in the mail, maybe? That might have the name on it?
DOCTOR: Okay, downtown clinic with a doctor who had a noticeable accent. We'll see if we can track down those records. In the meantime, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, aside from the stomach issues we've discussed?
PATIENT: Um… I think I had asthma when I was a kid? But I haven’t had any problems with it in years. And… oh! I had my appendix out when I was younger, too. That was… a long time ago. Other than that… not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. Well, except for my stomach, obviously. My husband says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood asthma, appendectomy. And you mentioned you’ve been feeling stressed recently. Would you mind telling me a little bit more about what's been causing that stress?
PATIENT: It's…work, mostly. I’m a sales rep. It's…a lot of pressure, trying to meet targets. And my boss… he's not very understanding. He expects a lot. Also… my mother's been a bit unwell lately. Just little things, but it worries me. She doesn't like to complain, so I try to visit her as often as I can. It's just… a lot. And it's been hard to sleep, because I'm always worrying about something.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds like a very stressful situation, Ms. Nahrwold. Both your work and your mother’s health are valid stressors. Let's move on to a quick review of your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my grandmother, on my father’s side, she had… I think it was diabetes? And my aunt, my mother’s sister, she had… something with her heart? I don't really know much about it. My mother doesn't like to talk about it. Oh! And I think my cousin has… something with her stomach? Like… it flares up and causes a lot of pain? But I’m not sure what it is, exactly. It's kind of embarrassing, I don’t really talk about health stuff with my family much.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Nahrwold. Many families don’t discuss these things openly. Okay, diabetes, heart issues, and possible stomach problems in the family. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications. I’m pretty lucky, I think. I'm starting to feel a bit silly, talking about all of this. I feel like I'm not being very helpful. I keep forgetting things!
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Ms. Nahrwold. It takes courage to discuss these things, and it's perfectly normal to have trouble remembering details. Now, before I do a quick physical exam, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no! Definitely not. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions – and I've never touched drugs. My husband doesn’t drink either, so we don’t really have any alcohol in the house. We’re pretty healthy people, as far as that goes. Except for my stomach, of course!
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. I’m going to see if we can access those records from your previous doctor, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m just…glad someone is finally taking this seriously. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Nahrwold, and we will do our best to figure out what’s going on. Okay, it looks like we have some notes from Dr. Al-Amin, from City General Hospital, about a year and a half ago. He noted some abdominal pain and changes in your bowel habits, and he ordered some blood tests and a stool sample. The results… He noted some mild inflammation, and a possible sensitivity to certain foods. He started you on mesalamine, an anti-inflammatory medication, for a suspected case of ulcerative colitis, but he didn’t follow up extensively. It appears you were self-managing the medication. Now, let's do a quick exam, if you’re comfortable. We’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’ll gently palpate it to feel for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. It just…makes me a little anxious, to be poked and prodded. But I understand it’s necessary. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nahrwold. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just try to relax and breathe normally. Okay… bowel sounds are present, but slightly hyperactive. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ow! Yeah, a little bit. It’s…sort of a dull ache, but it’s definitely more sensitive there. It feels…tight. Like everything is clenched up. Sorry. Am I making it harder?
DOCTOR: No, you're not making it harder at all. It's important for me to know what causes you discomfort. Okay, there's some mild guarding in your lower abdomen, and some tenderness along the sigmoid colon. No rebound tenderness or masses detected. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, it seems likely you are experiencing a flare-up of some sort of inflammatory bowel condition, possibly ulcerative colitis as Dr. Al-Amin initially suspected. The mesalamine may have been helping initially, but it seems the symptoms have returned. We need to run some further tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a stool culture and ova and parasite exam, and a fecal calprotectin test. The fecal calprotectin test is particularly important; it's a non-invasive test that can help determine the level of inflammation in your bowel. Would you be comfortable providing a stool sample today?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds good. A stool sample… yes, I can do that. It’s not…pleasant, but if it helps, then definitely. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to feel better. It’s just been so exhausting, not knowing what’s wrong. So, what happens now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nahrwold. The nurse will provide you with the necessary collection supplies, and instructions for obtaining the stool sample. We'll send those tests to the lab right away. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to prescribe a short course of loperamide, an anti-diarrheal medication, to help manage your symptoms. It’s important to stay hydrated, so I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, and eating easily digestible foods. I'm also going to write you a referral to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Ramirez. He’s an excellent specialist who can perform a colonoscopy to get a definitive diagnosis and discuss long-term treatment options. It’s important to follow up with him as soon as possible. Here are the referral form and prescription. The nurse will also provide you with some patient education materials about inflammatory bowel disease. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… that sounds…scary. But I understand it’s probably necessary. And okay, loperamide, I can try that. Um… what kind of foods should I be eating? You said easily digestible, but… what does that even mean? And… how long do I have to wait for the test results? A few days? A week? It just feels like so much. And… is it serious? Is this something I’ll have to deal with forever?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Ms. Nahrwold, and I’m glad you asked them. A colonoscopy does sound daunting, but it’s a very safe procedure, and it’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on in your colon. We'll make sure you're properly prepared, and you’ll be sedated, so you won't feel any discomfort. As for diet, easily digestible means avoiding foods that are high in fiber, fat, or sugar. Think bland foods like rice, toast, bananas, applesauce, and clear broths. Avoid dairy products, greasy foods, spicy foods, and caffeine. We have a handout with a more detailed list. The test results usually take about 5-7 business days to come back. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. As for whether this is something you’ll have to deal with forever… it’s hard to say definitively at this point. Many people with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease are able to manage their symptoms effectively with medication and lifestyle changes. It’s a chronic condition, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have to suffer. Dr. Ramirez will be able to give you a more accurate prognosis based on your test results. I understand this is a lot to take in. We’re going to work together to get to the bottom of this, and help you feel better. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Um… okay. That makes a little more sense, I think. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. One more thing… will this affect my work? I mean, I can’t really afford to take a lot of time off. And what about… traveling? My husband and I were planning a trip next year…
DOCTOR: Those are very practical concerns, Ms. Nahrwold. It's good you're thinking ahead. The impact on your work will depend on the severity of your symptoms and how well you respond to treatment. If you're able to manage your symptoms effectively, you should be able to continue working without any major disruptions. We can provide a note for your employer if necessary. As for traveling, it's also possible, but it requires some planning. You'll need to make sure you have access to a bathroom frequently, and you should pack your medications with you. It's also a good idea to avoid traveling to areas with limited access to healthcare facilities. We can discuss these things in more detail once we have a better understanding of your condition. For now, let's focus on getting those tests done and seeing Dr. Ramirez. I'm confident we can get you back on your feet. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
