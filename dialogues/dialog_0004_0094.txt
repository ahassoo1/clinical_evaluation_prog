DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um… hello. I… the paper said something about learning? Like, they want me to know things? I work with metal, you know. Not… papers and learning. It’s… for a check-up, I think? My husband made the appointment. He says I need to be… informed.
DOCTOR: Right. A check-up. Well, even working with metal doesn’t exempt you from basic health maintenance, Ms. Fontanazza. It's good your husband is being proactive. Let’s try to be… systematic about this. “Learning” is just another word for understanding your body and any potential issues. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why he scheduled this appointment?
PATIENT: Ugh. He says… I forget things. A lot. Like, where I put my tools. Or… what he asked me to get from the store. It’s not… serious. Just… old age, I guess? I’m not that old. Thirty-three! But he worries. He always worries. And he said something about… not being ready for anything bad? I don't know. Men and their fussing.
DOCTOR: "Old age," you say. Thirty-three is… certainly not old age, Ms. Fontanazza. However, memory concerns are worth investigating, regardless of age. It's good he's attentive, even if it is fussing. So, these memory lapses… can you describe them a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Hmm… okay. Like… yesterday, I was making… a box? Yes, a metal box. And I swear I put the… the bendy thing… you know, the tool that bends the metal?… right there. But it wasn't. I looked everywhere. My husband helped, eventually. And… sometimes I start a job and… forget why I started it? Just… standing there with metal in my hands. It’s… frustrating. I’m usually very good with my hands.
DOCTOR: So, misplacing tools and a sense of… losing your train of thought mid-task. How often would you say this happens?
PATIENT: Oh… a lot. Um… maybe… three times a week? Sometimes more if it’s… busy at work. And I’m tired. Work is hard, you know. Lifting metal all day. It’s not like sitting in an office. Sometimes I think it’s just… stress. But my husband says it’s… something else. He reads too many things on the internet.
DOCTOR: "Stress" is a convenient explanation, Ms. Fontanazza, but we need to rule out other possibilities. It’s important to have a complete picture. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Significant? Um… no, not really. I had the chicken pox when I was little. And I broke my arm once, when I was climbing a tree. But… that was ages ago. I don’t… go to the doctor much. I’m usually healthy. I eat rice. And… sometimes noodles. My husband says I need more vegetables. He’s always saying something. Do I have to tell you everything? It’s… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand it can feel intrusive, Ms. Fontanazza, but knowing your medical background is crucial for providing appropriate care. Breaking your arm is relevant, but I'm more interested in any ongoing conditions or illnesses. Have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, or weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: Weakness? No. And I don’t get headaches much. Maybe… if I don’t drink enough water? And… my vision is okay, I guess. I can see the metal, can’t I? It’s… hard to explain. Sometimes it’s… blurry when I wake up, but I just rub my eyes. It’s probably just… getting old. Honestly, I don't understand why you're asking all these questions. It feels like… an interrogation. I just came here to learn, like the paper said. Not… to be a medical mystery.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I assure you, I am not attempting an interrogation. These questions help me understand your overall health and determine the cause of your memory concerns. Dismissing them as “getting old” is not sufficient. Let’s move on. Have you ever had any problems with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Um… sometimes. My husband snores. Really loud. And sometimes I worry… about work. Or… money. It keeps me awake. I usually just… try to ignore it. And then I’m tired the next day. It’s a vicious cycle. Is this important? Because I really think it’s just… life. Everyone worries. Everyone is tired. What are we even talking about? I thought this was about learning.
DOCTOR: Yes, sleep is relevant, Ms. Fontanazza. Poor sleep can contribute to cognitive difficulties. Your husband's snoring suggests the possibility of sleep apnea, which can significantly impact your oxygen levels and brain function. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Do any of your relatives have a history of memory problems, dementia, or stroke?
PATIENT: Stroke? Dementia? Oh goodness… no. Not that I know of. My grandmother… she was very old. She… forgot things too, when she was very old. But that was just… old age, wasn't it? My mother… she’s fine. Very bossy, but fine. And my father… he died a long time ago. He worked very hard. We didn’t… talk much about… health things. Honestly, this is all very stressful. I just want to go home. I have metal to bend. Is there anything I need to do? Like, a test? Or a paper to sign? I don't want to waste anymore time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your reported memory lapses, difficulty concentrating, and potential sleep disturbances, I would like to conduct a brief neurological examination and order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. We’ll also need to assess your cognitive function with a short questionnaire. This will help us determine if further investigation, such as an MRI, is necessary. It’s important to be thorough. First, let's start with the neurological exam. Can you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Okay, fine. But hurry. This is… uncomfortable. Is this… all I have to do? It feels… pointless. And what if it's something bad? My husband will be so… I don't even want to think about it. Just… get it over with. I need to go back to work. Metal doesn’t bend itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms and legs. Reflexes are… 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and orientation. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Ugh. Date? Today is… August… the second… I think? 2025. Yes, 2025. I think. Is that right? My husband always remembers the dates. I’m terrible with those things. I’m good with metal, not… calendars. It's… a Tuesday, isn't it? Or maybe Wednesday. I’m really not sure. Just… ask me about metal. I’m good at metal.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will proceed with the blood work and cognitive questionnaire. It appears there may be some cognitive impairment. It's important to identify the underlying cause. I'm going to have the nurse draw some blood and then administer a brief memory test. It’s called the Mini-Cog. It involves remembering three words and drawing a clock. I will step out while the nurse prepares the blood draw. She will return shortly to administer the questionnaire. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Three words? A clock? I… I don’t think I can do this. This is… overwhelming. Are you sure it’s not just stress? Maybe I just need a vacation. Or… a nap. I really think I just need a nap. And what if I fail? Will you… send me away? To a… a place? I just want to go home. I don’t want to draw clocks. I want to bend metal. Is there anything else I can do?
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, this is not about "failing". It’s about gathering information to understand what’s going on and ensuring you receive appropriate care. I assure you, this is not about sending you "away". It’s about ruling out potential medical causes. The blood work will check for vitamin deficiencies and thyroid problems, which can affect cognitive function. The Mini-Cog is a simple screening tool to assess your memory and attention. I will be honest with you. Your reported symptoms are concerning, and it is irresponsible to dismiss them without further investigation. The nurse will be in shortly. Please cooperate with her. I will return shortly to discuss the results. .
