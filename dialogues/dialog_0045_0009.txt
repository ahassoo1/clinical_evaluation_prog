DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Billman, it’s… my vision. It’s not what it used to be, naturally. One expects a bit of decline at my age, but this feels… accelerated. I find myself squinting more, and things just aren’t as sharp as they once were. It’s quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Accelerated, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. It’s been… oh, perhaps six months now? But it feels like it’s worsening weekly. I used to be able to read the fine print on… well, on just about anything. Now? Forget it. And driving at night… that’s become rather precarious. I’m not one to complain, mind you, but it’s starting to interfere with… things. Things a man needs to do.
DOCTOR: Right. So, six months of progressive blurry vision, especially with reading and night driving. And you haven’t had any… trauma to the eye?
PATIENT: Trauma? No, Doctor. Nothing of the sort. I haven't been in any accidents, no foreign objects… I assure you, my eyes have remained perfectly intact, physically speaking. It’s just… fading, I suppose. A slow dimming, like an old lantern. Though, I’ve always prided myself on being quite careful, so I can’t imagine how this could be happening.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… well, sometimes my eyes feel a little… strained, especially after reading for any length of time. And occasionally, I get a bit of a headache behind them, but I attribute that to… well, to life, generally. I wouldn’t say it’s debilitating. Though, I must confess, I haven't been sleeping as soundly lately either. But who does these days? I wouldn't necessarily connect that to my vision, though. It's likely just… stress. A man has his burdens, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of vision problems?
PATIENT: That's a difficult question, Doctor. My mother... she had some trouble with her eyesight in her later years, cataracts I believe. Though, she wasn't one for doctors, so the specifics were never really discussed. My father… well, he wasn’t around much, and I don’t recall anything about his vision. Frankly, my family wasn’t one for sharing much of anything. It was… a practical sort of upbringing. We didn’t dwell on ailments. It was just expected you’d… manage. So, a definitive answer? I’m afraid not. A vague recollection of cataracts, perhaps, but nothing concrete.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I’ve always been a rather… robust individual, health-wise. I watch my diet, I get plenty of fresh air… well, as much as one can these days. No, Doctor, I've never been diagnosed with anything of the sort. Though, my cholesterol was a bit high at my last physical, but nothing the doctor didn't deem concerning enough to medicate. I prefer a more… natural approach to wellness, if you understand. Pills always seem to come with… complications.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at your eyes. I'm going to check your visual acuity, your peripheral vision, and examine the back of your eyes. It'll just take a few minutes. Could you read the letters on this chart for me, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, I do hope this won't be a lengthy process. I have… commitments this afternoon. And frankly, I’ve always had excellent eyesight, so I suspect this will be rather… uneventful. Let's see… is that an 'E'? Yes, I believe so. A very clear 'E', actually. Though, the lighting in here isn’t optimal, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course it isn't. Okay, keep going. Next line. And try not to anticipate the letters, just read what you see. Okay…and now the next line.
PATIENT: Right. Hmm… that’s… difficult. Is that a 'P'? No, wait… a 'Q'? It’s rather blurry, Doctor. I’m honestly not certain. And the next line… I can barely make out anything on this line, Doctor. It’s all… a rather indistinct haze. This is most peculiar. I assure you, my vision is usually much sharper than this. Perhaps the chart itself is faulty?
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it seems we've established a significant decrease in your visual acuity. I'm going to check your intraocular pressure, just to rule out anything serious. It involves a quick puff of air into each eye. It doesn't hurt, but it can be a little startling. Look straight ahead, please.
PATIENT: A "significant decrease," you say? That’s rather… alarming phrasing, Doctor. I prefer to think of it as a temporary… reduction in clarity. And a puff of air? Really? I must say, this entire examination is proving rather… unsettling. But very well. Proceed. Though, please be gentle. I have a rather sensitive constitution. And do let me know when it's over.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's done. Your pressure is… elevated. Not drastically, but enough to warrant further investigation. Given your symptoms, your family history – vague as it is – and these findings, I suspect you may be developing glaucoma. It's a condition where the pressure inside the eye damages the optic nerve, leading to vision loss. We need to confirm this with a visual field test and an OCT scan. I'll write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, the ophthalmologist down the street. He's the best in the area.
PATIENT: Glaucoma? Good heavens. That sounds… serious. Vision loss? I… I hadn’t anticipated this. I thought it was merely a matter of needing new spectacles, perhaps. A bit of strain, nothing more. And an OCT scan? A visual field test? It sounds… rather involved. Is it… painful? And Dr. Ramirez, you say? Will he… will he want to prescribe medication? I must confess, I’m rather averse to pharmaceuticals. It’s just… I’ve always prided myself on being a healthy individual, and the thought of relying on pills… It’s unsettling. Very unsettling. Perhaps… perhaps a second opinion would be prudent?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your concerns, but we need to take this seriously. Glaucoma can lead to blindness if left untreated. The tests aren't painful, just a bit… tedious. They're necessary to determine the extent of the damage and guide treatment. As for medication…that's something you would discuss with Dr. Ramirez. He'll explain the risks and benefits. I'm happy to provide a referral for a second opinion, but delaying diagnosis won’t help anything. It's better to know what you're dealing with and start treatment if it's necessary. Here’s the information for Dr. Ramirez. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And frankly, given your insurance situation, I strongly recommend you inquire about financial assistance programs at his office. Those tests aren’t cheap. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Financial assistance programs? Oh. Right. Yes. Well. That’s… considerate of you to mention. Though I do find it rather… demeaning to have to discuss such matters. I've always been a self-sufficient man. But… yes. I suppose I’ll have to inquire. Very well. I’ll schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez. Though I must say, this entire experience has been… most unpleasant. And the thought of discussing financial assistance… It's rather mortifying. I do hope Dr. Ramirez is a more… empathetic physician. And less inclined to dwell on… monetary concerns. Glaucoma… financial assistance… honestly. It’s simply dreadful. .
DOCTOR: Next patient. .
