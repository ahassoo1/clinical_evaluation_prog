DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it’s about my foot. It’s been bothering me something awful. A sore, really. A nasty one. And frankly, I expected better care from a clinic in the city.
DOCTOR: I understand. A sore on your foot that’s been bothering you… and you're right to expect good care, and I want to provide that for you. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… it’s hard to explain to someone who hasn’t seen it. It's on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. Red, and… and it won't heal. I've been putting ointment on it, that stuff my daughter got me at the drugstore, but it just seems to get worse. Honestly, I don't know what she thinks she's doing, sending me with that stuff. And I have the sugar, you know. The doctor back home warned me about that. It makes everything harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, a red sore on the bottom of your foot, near your heel, that hasn't been healing despite using an ointment your daughter provided. And you mentioned you have diabetes, which can definitely make healing more difficult. To get a better understanding, could you tell me how long you’ve had the sore?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s… it's been weeks now. Maybe a month? It’s hard to keep track, you know, when you’re getting on in years. It started small, just a little irritation. I thought it was a blister from my shoes, but then it just… stayed. And got bigger. And smellier, frankly. It’s quite unpleasant. I used to be so particular about my feet.
DOCTOR: A month, starting small and gradually getting larger and more unpleasant. I understand. And it's good you've noticed it getting smellier; that can be a sign of infection. Have you noticed any pain with it?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh, yes. Plenty of pain. Especially when I walk. It feels like a… a hot coal pressed against my foot. And sometimes, even when I’m just sitting it throbs. It keeps me up at night, it does. I have to take a little something to get to sleep. Not that I sleep very well anyway. Old age, you know. Everything aches. But this… this is different. It's a sharp ache, not just the usual wear and tear.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sharp ache that’s worse with walking and throbbing even at rest, keeping you up at night. That definitely sounds concerning. Besides the pain and the sore itself, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my leg has been a little swollen, on the same side as the foot. Not terribly, mind you. But enough to notice. And it feels… warm to the touch. Not feverish, exactly. Just… warmer than usual. My daughter said something about circulation, but she's not a doctor, is she? And I always thought she worried too much. Still, it is a little puffy. And sometimes I feel a little… shaky. Not like a tremble, but… weak, you know? Like I could faint if I stand up too quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, leg swelling and warmth on the same side as the foot, and feeling weak. That's important information. And it’s good you're telling me everything. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you had diabetes for a long time?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Decades, dear. Diagnosed shortly after my daughter was born, nearly sixty years ago. I've managed it, mostly. Pills, diet… trying to avoid sweets, though it’s not easy, I assure you. I try to watch what I eat, but a little treat now and then doesn't hurt, does it? My doctor back home used to keep a close eye on it. But he retired, and then… well, things changed. I haven't been as diligent since. It's hard to keep up with everything when you get older, you know. And frankly, the new doctor didn't seem nearly as concerned. Kept telling me to just "monitor my blood sugar." Like I haven't been doing that for sixty years!
DOCTOR: Sixty years of managing diabetes… that’s a long time, and it sounds frustrating that you felt your concerns weren’t being adequately addressed by your previous doctor. Do you take any other medications besides the pills for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me see… there's the water pill, for the swelling. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. But I don't take it every day. It makes me feel… foggy, you know? And then, oh, there's the little pink one for my heart. Just a small dose, but I've been on that for ages too. And sometimes, just a little something to help me sleep. But that's just when I really can't get to sleep, you understand. It's hard to keep track of everything, dear. My daughter tries to keep a list, but it’s always outdated. And frankly, I don't always tell her everything. It's my business, after all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a water pill for swelling, something for arthritis as needed, a pink pill for your heart, and something to help you sleep when you can't sleep. And it sounds like your daughter tries to help with keeping track of your medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness no. I've never had any allergies. I ate everything as a child, all sorts of things. And I've taken all sorts of medications over the years. Never had a reaction. I'm a sturdy woman, dear. Not one of those delicate types who breaks out in hives over everything. Though my daughter is always warning me about shellfish. Says it can interact with the heart medicine. But I haven't eaten shellfish in years, so it's not a concern. Really, I’m quite healthy for my age. It’s just this foot. And it's causing me a great deal of trouble. Really, a great deal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and no reaction to medications in the past. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to take a look at your foot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But don't poke too hard, dear. It's quite tender. And be careful with the smell. It’s… unpleasant, I admit. Honestly, I don’t know what’s taken me so long to come in. It’s just… I’ve always been so independent. I didn't want to bother anyone. But it’s gotten so bad. Really, so very bad. You'll see. It’s quite a mess.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see the sore here, near your heel. It is red, and there’s some swelling. And as you mentioned, there’s a noticeable odor. When I gently touch it… …it is quite tender. I’m also noting some warmth to the touch, and a bit of discoloration around the edges. There's also some hardness I feel deep within the tissue. I also notice some swelling in your lower leg, on the same side as the foot. I’m going to check your pulses now, to assess the circulation in your leg and foot. Your pulses are present, but they are somewhat diminished. I'm concerned about the possibility of an infection. It looks like there’s some breakdown of the tissue, and the diminished pulses are also a concern. We need to rule out a deeper infection, potentially involving the bone.
PATIENT: Bone infection?! Oh, dear. That sounds… dreadful. Really dreadful. My daughter warned me about infections, you know. She's always reading things online. But bone infection… is that serious? Will I have to have my leg… removed? I knew I should have taken better care of it. But I didn't want to bother anyone. And now… now it’s come to this. This is all my fault. Honestly, this is just dreadful. Really, really dreadful. I’m getting too old for this. Really, too old. What are you going to do? Tell me. I need to know. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Now, now, let's not jump to conclusions. We haven't confirmed a bone infection yet. It's a possibility we need to investigate, but it doesn’t mean that’s definitely what’s happening. We'll need to do some tests to determine the extent of the infection, if any. The first thing I want to do is order some blood work to check for signs of infection in your body. I also want to get an X-ray of your foot to see if there’s any involvement of the bone. And I'm going to send a sample of the fluid from the sore to the lab to see what kind of bacteria, if any, is causing the infection. These tests will help us determine the best course of treatment. Depending on the results, we may need to start you on antibiotics. In some cases, more advanced treatment, like surgery, may be necessary, but we’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… that sounds… reasonable. But surgery? Oh, dear. Really? I don't want surgery. I’m too old for surgery. My heart isn’t what it used to be. And I bruise so easily. I’m a mess, dear. Really, a mess. Will the tests be painful? Will they take long? I have an appointment with my hairdresser on Friday. I can't miss that. She's the only one who knows how to do my hair properly. And what about the lab? I don’t like needles. I faint, you know. Really, I do. And how long until I get the results? I need to know. Quickly. I'm worried sick. Really, sick. Is there anything… anything at all… I can do in the meantime? To help? Some ointment, perhaps? Or a bandage? Anything?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s address your concerns one by one. The blood work will involve a small needle prick, just like when you get your sugar checked. It shouldn't take long, just a few minutes. And the X-ray is painless, you just need to stand still for a moment while the machine takes the picture. The lab sample might be a little uncomfortable, but I will be gentle. And if you’re worried about fainting, please tell the technician beforehand. They are very experienced and can take precautions to make you comfortable. We can have you lie down during the procedure, if you prefer. As for the results, the lab typically takes 24-48 hours to get the results back. I will call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, to help with comfort, I will clean the sore and apply a sterile bandage. I will also prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment to help prevent further infection. However, this is just a temporary measure. We need to find out exactly what bacteria, if any, is causing the infection to prescribe the correct antibiotics. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. That… that sounds alright. A bandage and ointment… that's something. And 24-48 hours… I suppose I can wait. Though it will be a very long two days. And please, please tell the technician about the fainting. I don't want to end up on the floor. It's quite embarrassing, you know. Really. And you’ll call me personally with the results? Not a nurse? I want to talk to you. You seem… knowledgeable. Really, very knowledgeable. And I don't want to have to explain everything all over again to someone else. Promise me you’ll call. Quickly. As soon as you know. I’m worried sick. Really, sick. And I don't want to spend another night in pain. It’s… unbearable. Really, unbearable.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I promise I will call you personally with the results as soon as I have them. I will make a note in your chart to ensure I’m the one who calls. I understand your concerns, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable and well-informed every step of the way. I'm going to go ahead and clean the sore and apply the bandage now. And I’ll write the prescription for the topical antibiotic ointment. I’ll also give you some written instructions on how to care for the wound at home. While I’m doing this, do you have any questions at all?
PATIENT: Just… be gentle, dear. It's very tender. And try not to poke too much. Honestly, I don't know what I've done to deserve this. Really. I've always been a good person. And what about my shoes? Do you think I should get new ones? The ones I’m wearing now are quite old. But they're so comfortable. And I don't want to have to break them in. It's such a hassle. Really, a hassle. And will I be able to walk on it? Or will I have to stay in bed? I have a book club meeting next week. I can't miss that. Tell me everything. Quickly. I need to know. Really, need to know.
DOCTOR: I’m being very careful, Louine. I’ll continue to be gentle. As for your shoes, it's a good idea to avoid wearing shoes that put pressure on the sore. Wearing comfortable, supportive shoes is important. If your current shoes are putting pressure on the wound, it would be best to switch to something else, even if it’s just temporarily. We can discuss proper footwear options at your follow-up appointment. As for walking on it, it depends on the severity of the infection. I recommend avoiding putting too much weight on the foot until we get the results back. But you shouldn’t have to stay in bed. You can still be mobile, just try to limit the amount of walking and pressure on the foot. We’ll discuss this in more detail once we get the lab results back. I’m going to write a note for a limited weight-bearing restriction until we have the results back. Here are the written instructions. Please follow them carefully, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll also write the prescription for the ointment. I’ll call you with the results as soon as I have them. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Limited weight-bearing… what does that mean exactly? Can I still go to the grocery store? Or to book club? I need to know. Really, need to know. And what if the infection is bad? Will I have to go to the hospital? I hate hospitals. They're so… sterile. And the food is terrible. Really, terrible. Promise me you’ll do everything you can to help me. Really, everything. I don't want to lose my foot. Or end up in the hospital. I just want to be able to walk again. And go to book club. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Limited weight-bearing means you should try to avoid putting a lot of weight on your foot as much as possible. You can still go to the grocery store, but try to take your time, walk slowly, and avoid standing for long periods. You can still attend book club, but consider shortening the amount of time you stay, and if possible, bring a chair so you can sit down frequently. As for the infection, it's too early to say whether you’ll need to go to the hospital. We need to wait for the lab results before we can determine the best course of treatment. If the infection is severe and doesn’t respond to antibiotics, hospitalization might be necessary, but we’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. I promise you I will do everything I can to help you, Louine. That's my job, and I take it very seriously. We’ll work together to get you back on your feet and back to doing the things you enjoy. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. You’ve been very… thorough. Really, very thorough. And reassuring. Just… please call me quickly with the results. I’m worried sick. Really, sick. And I need to know what I’m up against. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. I think I'll go home and lie down now. And please… please call me quickly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Louine. I will call you as soon as I have the results. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then.
