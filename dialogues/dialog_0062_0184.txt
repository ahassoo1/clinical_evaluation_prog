DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Trendler, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Decosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about me look, Doctor. Not a happy look, I tell ya. Been… feelin’ kinda loose, ya understand? Like things ain’t where they used to be. Not askin’ for a miracle, just… want it tighter. Don’t have all day for this chat, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're feeling a bit… loose, and you'd like to figure out what's going on. “Not where they used to be,” that’s a good way to put it. And I appreciate you letting me know you're concerned about time, we'll get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. When you say "loose," could you tell me a little more specifically what you mean?
PATIENT: Specifically? Hmph. Look at me, Doctor. Look at me! My belly, it’s hangin’ down too far. And my arms… they wobble. Used to be strong, could drive a pile all day. Now? Like jelly. It ain't dignified, ya see? And the skin… all wrinkled and saggy. I ain't askin' to be a young man again, just… less of this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. You’re noticing changes in your body – specifically around your abdomen and arms – with some loss of muscle tone and changes in your skin. It sounds like this is really bothering you, and you’re right to want to address it. Okay. It sounds like you’re describing some loss of skin elasticity and muscle mass. Has this been happening gradually, or did you notice it starting around a certain time?
PATIENT: Gradually, mostly. But it got worse after… after my wife passed. Didn’t have the appetite, you know? Just… wasn't eatin’ right. Didn’t care much for anything, really. Used to be a big man, always strong. She liked that. Now… well. It’s been a few years, though. Don't know exactly when it started, just… happened.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Trendler. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s very common for changes in appetite and overall health to occur during times of grief and loss. It sounds like this has been a significant change for you. So, to clarify, you’ve noticed this gradual change in your body over the past few years, and it seemed to worsen after your wife passed. Aside from the changes in your abdomen and arms, have you noticed any other changes – like unintentional weight loss, fatigue, or any difficulty with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Weight loss, yes. Not a lot, but enough to notice the clothes are looser. Fatigue… sometimes. Mostly just… tired of things, you know? Less energy for the garden, less energy for… well, anything, really. Daily activities? I still walk, still manage, but not like before. Take more naps, that’s for sure. Ain't climbin’ no ladders anymore, that’s certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some unintentional weight loss, fatigue, and a decrease in your energy levels, along with difficulty with more strenuous activities like climbing ladders. That gives me a better picture. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re currently being treated for, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmph. Had a bit of high blood pressure years ago, but the doctor put me on pills. Been takin' 'em ever since, keeps it under control. Other than that… nothin' much. Always been a strong man, good constitution. Had the usual bumps and bruises from the pile drivin', but nothin' serious. Private insurance, mind you. Good plan.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication. And generally good health otherwise, despite some typical work-related bumps and bruises. That's good to know. And thank you for mentioning your insurance, that's helpful. Do you take any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my joints, sometimes. When they're achin' bad. Over-the-counter stuff, ibuprofen mostly. And a multivitamin, keeps the doctor happy. That’s it. Don’t like takin’ too many pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed for joint pain, and a multivitamin. That's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmph. Had my appendix out when I was a boy. That’s it. And a few stitches here and there from the job. But no major surgery, no. Strong as an ox, I always was. Didn’t need much fixin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, just an appendectomy as a child, and some stitches from work-related injuries. Good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My mother lived to be 95, strong woman. Father died young, heart trouble. Had a brother, passed away a few years back, nothin' special. No history of… I don’t know… fancy diseases. Just regular folk stuff. They weren't all weaklings, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother lived to a good age, your father died of heart trouble, and your brother passed away a few years ago. No known family history of serious illnesses. Now, just a few more questions, then I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. Waste of money, and bad for ya. Always been careful what I put in my body. Pile drivin' is enough strain on a man, don't need to add to it.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And do you drink alcohol, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: A little rum, sometimes. On special occasions, ya understand? Not every day. Never been a big drinker. One or two, maybe. Relaxin’ helps the joints, that’s all. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional rum, one or two drinks at a time. Alright, Mr. Trendler, thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a brief physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Get it over with. Don't have all day, ya know. Just… be gentle with the belly. Old injuries, ya see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. I'll make sure to be careful around your abdomen. Alright, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is a little soft, and I do note some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants, likely from previous injuries. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength seems good. Your weight is 122 pounds. I will note that’s a BMI of 19.1, which is on the lower side of normal. Now, I'd like to ask you to stand up, if you're able, so I can check your gait and balance.
PATIENT: Hmph. 122 pounds? Felt lighter than that. Always been lean. And my gait? I walk just fine, thank ya very much. Just don’t go expectin’ no fancy walkin’ show. I ain't a dancer.
DOCTOR: Your gait is steady, although a little slower than it used to be, which is expected at your age. No noticeable unsteadiness or limitations. Okay, Mr. Trendler, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed during the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some natural age-related changes – loss of muscle mass, changes in body composition, and some fatigue. The weight loss and loss of appetite after your wife passed likely contributed to this. The tenderness in your abdomen is likely from old injuries. The joint pain is also common with age. However, to rule out any other potential causes for your weight loss and fatigue, I'd like to order some routine blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Blood work. More pokin' and proddin'. Fine. Just… get it over with. If it’ll make ya happy. I just want to feel… better. Not lookin' for fancy answers, just somethin' to help me feel stronger. And hurry it up, I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. I'll make sure to get the order in right away, and we'll schedule the blood work as soon as possible. It shouldn't take long. Here you go. This is the requisition form for the blood work. You can take this to the lab at [Lab Name and Address]. They're open [Lab Hours]. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan to help you feel stronger. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on a balanced diet rich in protein to help rebuild muscle mass, and continuing with gentle exercise as tolerated. We can also discuss some strategies to manage your fatigue and joint pain. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmph. Questions? Not really. Just get the results quick. And no fancy talk, ya hear? Just tell me what's wrong, and what can be done about it. And I ain’t lookin' for a miracle, just… somethin'. That's all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Trendler. I promise to keep it simple and straightforward. We’ll focus on what’s practical and achievable. I'll personally review the results as soon as they come in and give you a call to discuss them. We'll aim to get this sorted as quickly as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like unexplained fever, severe weight loss, or significant changes in your bowel habits, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Here's a copy of the lab requisition form, and the contact information for the office. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. That's all. Just… get it done. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Thank you for coming in today. I look forward to speaking with you soon. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
