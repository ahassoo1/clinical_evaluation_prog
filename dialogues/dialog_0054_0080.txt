DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Just need to get some forms filled out, really. Medicare sent me over, said I needed to update some things. Nothing major, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. We can definitely get those forms updated for you. While you're filling those out, perhaps you could tell me a little bit about why Medicare requested the update?
PATIENT: Hmm, I don’t really remember exactly. Something about… changes to the system, I think? The lady on the phone just said I needed to come in and verify some info. I don’t usually keep track of those details, to be honest. My husband usually handles all that paperwork.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. Paperwork can be a bit overwhelming. No worries at all, we can go through everything together. Just to be thorough, and while we’re at it, could you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any new or unusual symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I feel pretty good, all things considered. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s just from work, I guess. I’m on my feet a lot, fixing valves and stuff. Nothing I haven't dealt with before.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. It’s always good to rule things out. Fixing valves sounds physically demanding – what kind of work do you do, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Well, I work for the reservation, mostly taking care of the water systems. Valves, pipes, pumps… making sure everyone has clean water. Sometimes it’s out in the field, sometimes it’s in the pump houses. It's important work, you know? Keeps everything running. It can be cold out there in the winter, though.
DOCTOR: It certainly is important work, Ms. Fabing. We appreciate those who keep essential services running. And yes, Montana winters can be quite harsh! Just to get a better overall picture, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels besides the usual tiredness from work?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Not really… I guess I’ve been sleeping a little more than usual, now that I think about it. But I figured that was just because it’s been so hot lately. Hard to get a good night’s rest when it’s sweltering. Nothing that’s really worried me, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Sleeping more could be related to the heat, certainly. Do you have any other symptoms – anything at all – that you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: No, not that I can think of. My joints ache a little sometimes, but that’s just getting older, I suppose. And I have my moments of forgetfulness, but who doesn’t, right? I’m not here because I’m sick, Doctor. Just getting these forms done.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right about the forgetfulness – we all have those moments! And it's good to hear you're not feeling particularly unwell. Just to be thorough, and as you're here, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well… let’s see. I had pneumonia when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. And I broke my arm a few years back, but it healed up fine. Nothing major, really. My mom had high blood pressure, if that matters. And my dad… he had some heart trouble later in life. That’s about it, I think. I don’t usually go to the doctor unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Pneumonia as a child, a broken arm, and a family history of high blood pressure and heart trouble. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I can eat pretty much anything. And I haven't had any bad reactions to medicine that I know of. I really appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. It's good to know you're asking all these questions.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No known allergies is very good to hear. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen sometimes, when my joints are really aching. And I take a multivitamin every now and then, but I forget half the time. That’s about it. Nothing regular. I really try to avoid taking a lot of pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for joint pain and occasional multivitamins. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. That’s fine. Just let me know what you’re going to do, okay? I get a little nervous with needles, so if there’s any chance of that, please warn me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will certainly warn you before any procedures involving needles. We won't be doing any blood draws today, Ms. Fabing, so no need to worry about that. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Just let me get up here. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me, please… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Blood pressure is 130/80. Now, let me just take a quick look in your ears and throat…
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. That’s not too bad. Just let me know if you see anything unusual.
DOCTOR: Ears: Tympanic membranes are normal in appearance bilaterally, no cerumen impaction or signs of inflammation. Throat: Oropharynx is clear, no erythema or exudates. Tonsils are not enlarged. Everything looks good so far, Ms. Fabing. Now, just one more thing, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to hear. Lifestyle… well, I work a lot, as I said. Mostly outdoors. I try to eat healthy, but it’s hard when I’m on the go. I don’t smoke, and I only drink occasionally, at family gatherings. I don’t really have time for a lot of hobbies, to be honest. Mostly just relaxing at home with my husband when I can. We used to go fishing a lot, but haven’t had time lately.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're staying active with your work, and that you don't smoke. So, to summarise, you're experiencing some increased fatigue and sleepiness, a family history of high blood pressure and heart trouble, and occasional joint pain. You’re currently taking ibuprofen as needed and multivitamins occasionally. Everything in the physical exam appears normal. Given your fatigue and the family history, it might be worth running a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying issues, such as anemia or thyroid problems. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. If it’ll give me some peace of mind, then yes, I’m comfortable with that. I just don't want anything serious going on. What kind of tests are we talking about? And will Medicare cover them?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. We'll order a Complete Blood Count to check for anemia and other blood disorders, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test to assess your thyroid function. These are relatively standard tests and should give us a good starting point. As for Medicare coverage, both of these tests should be covered, but it’s always best to double-check with them directly to be certain. Our billing department can assist you with that after the tests are completed. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll need a small blood sample. It’ll only take a few minutes. Do you know if you have any trouble with your veins?
PATIENT: No, I don't usually have trouble. They always find a vein eventually. I'm not scared of needles, just don't like them, you know? Okay, let's get it over with. Just let me know when I need to go.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Ms. Fabing, I’ll have the lab technician come in to draw your blood. They'll explain the process to you. Once the results are back—usually within a few days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe fatigue, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before I call the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Fabing. It’s my pleasure. I’ll let the lab technician know you’re ready. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up.
PATIENT: .
