DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Doctor, is it? Trestrail? Seems…foreign. Anyway. I’m here because…well, honestly, I don’t rightly know why I’m here. My daughter insisted. Said I needed a check-up. Honestly, I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Don't bother me with all this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your daughter is concerned, and it's good of her to bring you in. Even feeling "perfectly fine," a routine check-up can identify potential issues before they become… troublesome. We’ll try to make it as quick and painless as possible. But to start, and humor me, please. Can you tell me anything at all that’s been bothering you, even just a little?
PATIENT: Troublesome? Honestly, young lady, at my age, everything is troublesome! But…let me think. My feet, I suppose. They ache, sometimes. Not all the time. Just…when I’ve been on them too long. And they’ve gotten…wider, I think. Shoes don't fit like they used to. But that’s just age, isn't it? I used to have beautiful feet, you know. Could wear anything.
DOCTOR: Aching feet, especially with prolonged standing, and changes in shoe size. Alright. And is this aching constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, it’s not constant. That would be awful, wouldn't it? No, it comes and goes. Mostly when I'm…doing things. Standing. Walking. Like if I go to the market. It’s not… debilitating or anything. I can still get around. Honestly, I just think it's old age catching up with me. I’m eighty-three, you know! Things are supposed to ache.
DOCTOR: Right. So, market trips bring it on. Any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Pain? Heavens, where do I begin? My back aches sometimes, if I bend over for too long. My knees creak. My shoulders get stiff. Honestly, dear, I’m old! Everything hurts a little. You'll be complaining about the same things when you get to my age, you wait and see. You young people think you're invincible.
DOCTOR: With all due respect, Ms. Gunasekara, simply stating "everything hurts" doesn’t help me determine if there’s an underlying cause for your discomfort that we can address. Are you able to clarify which of these pains is the most bothersome?
PATIENT: Oh, now look here. Don’t you get condescending with me, young lady. I didn’t come here for a lecture. I told you my feet ache! That’s why my daughter dragged me in here, I suspect. She says I need to have them "looked at." Honestly, I haven't got time for a whole lot of poking and prodding. Just tell me if something’s terribly wrong with them.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. Let’s focus on your feet then. Besides the aching and the change in size, have you noticed any redness, swelling, or any numbness or tingling in your feet?
PATIENT: Redness? No, I don't think so. Swelling… sometimes, maybe? A little, if I’ve been standing all day. It goes down, though. Numbness? No, no numbness. I can feel everything just fine. Though, sometimes my toes feel a little…stiff, especially in the morning. Honestly, I just chalk it up to being old. Everything’s a little stiff in the morning when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the morning, mild swelling with prolonged standing. Okay. Now, do you have any difficulty walking?
PATIENT: Difficulty? No. I get around just fine! I go to church every Sunday. I go to the market, like I said. I walk around my house. I'm not bedridden, young lady. Though, sometimes I have to stop and rest a little. It’s not difficulty, it’s just…taking my time. A person slows down when they get older, you know. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Reports intermittent rest needed during ambulation. Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Heavens, no! I eat a perfectly normal diet. A little bit of everything, mind you, but nothing fancy. My mother lived to be ninety-two and she ate whatever she wanted. No, I’ve never had diabetes. Don’t you think I'd know if I had diabetes? My daughter asks me about it sometimes, but I just tell her I feel fine. Is that what she sent you to ask about? Honestly, that girl worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had any problems with your circulation, like cold feet or slow-healing sores?
PATIENT: Cold feet? Sometimes, yes. It gets cold in this house, you know. Old houses are drafty. But I wear socks! And slow-healing sores… well, I get little cuts and scrapes sometimes, like anyone does. But they heal. They take a little longer maybe, but they always heal. Nothing to write home about. Honestly, you’re asking a lot of questions about things that are just part of getting older. I swear, my daughter sends me here for the smallest things.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, I understand your frustration. However, these questions are important. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. I take a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I take some ibuprofen. And…oh, yes! A multivitamin, just to keep things ticking over. That’s about it. Nothing fancy. Honestly, I try to avoid taking too many pills. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take all sorts of things, but I just tell her I’m fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, dear. I haven't got any allergies. Never have. I used to play in the garden all the time as a child, surrounded by flowers and everything. Never a problem. A little bit of pollen sometimes bothers my sinuses, but that's hardly an allergy. Honestly, I’m a pretty robust person, all things considered. It’s good genes, you know. Both sides of the family lived to a ripe old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Gunasekara. I'm going to need to do a brief physical exam now. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulses, and take a look at your feet. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod. Well, alright, I suppose. Just don’t take too long. And be gentle, dear. My skin is rather delicate at my age. Honestly, I don’t understand what all the fuss is about. I feel perfectly fine. Get it over with, then. Just don't tell me I've got anything terrible wrong with me. I've lived a long life, you know. I don't need any bad news now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Taking your blood pressure now… 148 over 82. A little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly faint. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your feet. Pulses are present, but diminished in both feet. Skin is dry and slightly thin. Capillary refill is a little slow—about 3 seconds. Sensation appears intact, but…there's some mild swelling on the tops of your feet. And your shoes…yes, they're definitely too narrow. I'm noting some findings consistent with peripheral artery disease and mild edema. It's not severe at this point, but it needs to be addressed.
PATIENT: Peripheral…what? Edema? What are you talking about, dear? Are you saying something is terribly wrong with my feet? Honestly, I told you I felt fine! My feet ache a little, yes, but that’s just age. I just want to know what this all means. And don't use all those big words, I won't understand. Is this going to require surgery? My daughter will be so upset if I need surgery!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Gunasekara. Let me explain in simpler terms. "Peripheral artery disease" means the blood vessels in your feet aren’t getting as much blood flow as they should. It’s common as people get older. “Edema” just means some swelling. It's likely contributing to the aching you’re experiencing, and the shoes not fitting correctly. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything terrible. Surgery is not likely needed at this point. We can manage this with conservative measures—things like proper footwear, regular exercise if you're able, and potentially medication to improve blood flow. I want to get some bloodwork done to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, just to get a clearer picture. And I’d like you to see a podiatrist for a professional shoe fitting and to discuss foot care. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? More poking and prodding? Honestly, dear, this is all too much. Shoe fitting I suppose is alright. I do need new shoes. But bloodwork… Will it hurt? And what if something is wrong with my blood? I don’t want to worry my daughter. She worries enough as it is. Can't we just get me some new shoes and be done with it? Honestly, I think I just need more comfortable shoes. That's all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, I understand your concerns, and I assure you, the bloodwork is a simple procedure. It's just a small sample of blood taken from your arm, and it gives us important information. It won’t hurt much—a quick pinch, and then it’s done. It's not about finding something wrong, it's about making sure we have all the information to take the best care of you. Think of it this way: getting the right shoes and knowing what’s going on with your health will help you stay active and independent for longer, and that's a good thing, isn't it?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. If you say so. But don't keep me here all day. And be gentle with the needle. Honestly, I hate needles. And promise me you'll tell me everything is alright, even if it’s not. I can’t handle bad news right now. And new shoes…yes, that sounds good. Make sure they're comfortable. That's all I ask. Comfortable shoes. What do I need to do first? The bloodwork, you said? Just get it over with, then. I’m trusting you, dear. Don't let me down.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. I understand. We'll get the bloodwork done right away. I'll have my nurse, Maria, come in to draw the sample. She’s very gentle. It will just take a few minutes. Once that's done, I’ll write you a prescription for a podiatry consultation, and Maria can schedule that appointment for you as well. I'll also print out some information on proper foot care and exercises you can do at home. We'll take it one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything along the way. And I promise to be honest with you every step of the way. Maria will be in shortly. Is there anything else I can get for you right now?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that's everything. Just… hurry up with the bloodwork, please. Honestly, the thought of that needle is making me nervous. And thank you… for being patient with me. I’m not very good with all this medical stuff. It makes me anxious. Just get it over with, then. Let’s get it done. Maria, you said? I hope she's gentle.
DOCTOR: “Maria! Could you come in here for a moment, please?
