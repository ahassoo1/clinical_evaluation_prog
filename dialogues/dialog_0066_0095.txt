DOCTOR: Hi Stephane, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day for this. It's my ear. I woke up this morning and I can't hear out of one side. And my face… well, it feels sort of droopy on that same side. It's quite alarming, really. I expect you to figure it out quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're concerned and want this sorted out quickly. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are definitely things we need to take seriously. It’s good you came in right away. Just to confirm, your name is Stephane Nissenbaum, and you're 59 years old?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. Though I fail to see why you need to confirm my name. I just told you. Are you new to this? It's Nissenbaum, with two 's's. And frankly, I haven't got time for pleasantries or repeating myself.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, and I apologize for the repetition. It’s just standard procedure to double-check everything, even information we just received, to ensure accuracy, especially with medical records. It’s Nissenbaum with two ‘s’s, noted. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me exactly when you first noticed the hearing loss and facial drooping?
PATIENT: This morning. I woke up, went to get my coffee, and realized I couldn't hear the news. Then, when I looked in the mirror… well, it was quite obvious. Everything’s just…lopsided. It wasn't gradual, it just was. Honestly, it's rather unsettling. I don’t understand why this is happening to me. I don't recall any injury or anything that would cause this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it was sudden onset this morning, upon waking. And you haven’t experienced any trauma to your head or ear recently?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I lead a very…ordered life. No falls, no bumps, no loud noises. I certainly haven’t been boxing. I take very good care of myself. I simply woke up like this. And I expect a reasonable explanation, not a lecture about boxing.
DOCTOR: I understand. No head trauma, and the onset was very sudden. And you haven’t noticed any pain, dizziness, ringing in your ears, or any other symptoms at all besides the hearing loss and facial drooping?
PATIENT: No. Just…this. The silence is dreadful, and my face feels…weak. It's not painful, exactly, just…strange. It feels like half of it doesn't work properly. Honestly, it's incredibly inconvenient. I have a luncheon next week, and I can't possibly attend looking like this. It's…unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Okay. No pain, dizziness, or ringing. Just the sudden hearing loss and facial weakness. It sounds like we need to rule out a few things quickly. I'm going to take a quick look in your ear, and then I'll do a quick hearing test. Then I'll assess your facial nerve function. This will give us a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. But do hurry. As I said, I have a very busy schedule. And please, be gentle. I do not wish to exacerbate the situation. Honestly, the thought of someone poking around in my ear is rather…unappealing.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, your ear canals look clear, no obvious signs of infection or blockage. Now, I'm just going to do a quick hearing test with this tuning fork. Okay, the results of the hearing test are concerning. It indicates hearing loss in your left ear. Now, let's check your facial nerve function. Could you please try to smile, raise your eyebrows, and close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It's quite obvious my left side isn't working as well. I told you! It feels…sluggish. Are you going to tell me what’s wrong, or are we going to continue with these pointless tests all day? Honestly, the suspense is rather unnerving. I need to know what is happening to me.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out. There is noticeable weakness on the left side of your face. Based on the sudden onset of hearing loss and the facial weakness, I'm concerned about something called Bell’s Palsy. It's a condition caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, often after a viral infection. However, it’s crucially important to rule out other, more serious causes first, like a stroke. To do that, I need to get a CT scan of your head. It's the best way to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. Would you be able to go to the hospital for a CT scan?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Honestly. A viral infection? I haven’t been sick in years. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I suppose if you insist, but I expect this to be done quickly. I have commitments, you know. And frankly, the thought of radiation is rather concerning. Is it absolutely necessary? You had better have a very good explanation. And who is going to drive me? I certainly won't be taking a taxi in this condition. Honestly, this is becoming quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns. You're right to ask. While Bell’s Palsy is the most likely diagnosis given your symptoms, we need to rule out a stroke, which requires immediate treatment. The CT scan is the fastest and most accurate way to do that. The amount of radiation from a single CT scan is very low, and the benefits of ruling out a stroke far outweigh the risks. As for transportation, do you have someone who can drive you to the hospital?
PATIENT: My housekeeper, Esmeralda, usually drives me. But she has a prior engagement. Honestly, this is simply dreadful. I suppose I could call my nephew, Reginald. He's rather unreliable, but… I suppose it's my only option. Very well. Tell me which hospital, and I'll attempt to contact Reginald. But I expect you to have the results promptly. And I fully expect a thorough explanation of this…Bell's Palsy, as you call it. Honestly, the name sounds rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll have the receptionist page Esmeralda and see if her schedule can be adjusted. If not, then Reginald will do. The closest hospital with a CT scanner is City General Hospital. I'll write down the address and phone number for you. In the meantime, let me explain Bell’s Palsy in more detail. It’s caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, which controls the muscles in your face. This inflammation can be triggered by a viral infection, but often the cause is unknown. Symptoms typically develop suddenly and can include weakness or paralysis on one side of the face, difficulty closing your eye, and altered taste sensation. Most cases resolve on their own within a few weeks or months with treatment, but it is important to start treatment as soon as possible to maximize your chances of recovery. We'll begin with a course of oral steroids to reduce the inflammation, and I may also prescribe an antiviral medication. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Steroids? Antivirals? Honestly, I hardly think I need medication. I have a very strong immune system. And I certainly don't want any side effects. I suppose I'll trust your judgment…reluctantly. But if I start feeling worse, I expect you to reverse this treatment immediately. I don't believe in unnecessary medication. Do I need to fast for this CT scan? Honestly, I had a rather light breakfast, but…I had a croissant. Will that affect the results? And I hope this won't ruin my luncheon. Honestly, it’s a very important event.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about medication, and we can discuss the potential side effects in more detail. However, starting treatment early is crucial to maximizing your chances of a full recovery. As for the CT scan, you do not need to fast. The croissant won't affect the results. Regarding your luncheon, let’s focus on getting a diagnosis and starting treatment first. We can then assess how you’re feeling and determine if you’ll be able to attend. For now, please try to rest and avoid straining your facial muscles. We'll do everything we can to get you back on your feet as quickly as possible. The receptionist will arrange for the CT scan immediately. Once the results are in, we'll discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Very well. Just…ensure this doesn’t take all day. And I expect a detailed report after the scan. Honestly, I need to understand what’s happening to me. And…tell Esmeralda to bring my shawl. It gets rather chilly in these hospitals. Honestly, this whole ordeal is most inconvenient. I suppose there's nothing more to discuss. I’ll await the results. And I fully expect a prompt and satisfactory explanation.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll do everything we can to make this as smooth and comfortable as possible. I’ve already spoken with the receptionist, and she’s arranging everything for you. Esmeralda will be notified about the shawl. And I’ll be here to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns in the meantime. .
