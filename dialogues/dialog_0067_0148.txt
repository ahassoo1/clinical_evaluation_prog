DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having some… pain. Down there. In… well, in the… testicular area. I’m not quite sure why I’m having it, and it’s… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani, thank you for being open with me. It’s perfectly alright to feel a little embarrassed, but it's important to discuss these things. Just to clarify, you mentioned pain in the testicular area. As a woman, you don’t have testicles. Could you describe the location of the pain more precisely?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear. You are absolutely right. That… that is terribly silly of me. I… I don’t know why I said that. My apologies. It’s just… a sharp pain, low down, on my… on my right side. Near my… groin, I suppose. It comes and goes, but it’s quite uncomfortable when it does. I've been a bit muddled lately, if you don't mind my saying. Perhaps that's why I misspoke.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. It happens. We all have moments of confusion. It’s much better to bring it up so we can figure out what’s going on. Okay, sharp pain low down on your right side, near your groin. And it comes and goes. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well… it's not a constant ache, you see. It feels more like… a sudden stab. A quick, sharp feeling, and then it fades. Sometimes it’s just a dull pressure, and other times… it’s quite intense. It doesn't seem to be related to anything specific. I haven’t injured myself, not that I recall. And it’s not… a pain that radiates, if that makes sense? It stays… localized. It’s just… perplexing.
DOCTOR: Okay, localized, sharp, stabbing pain that comes and goes, and sometimes feels like dull pressure. No specific injury that you're aware of. And it doesn't radiate. That gives us a starting point. Now, can you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I've been feeling rather tired lately, more so than usual. And… a little bit of bloating, I suppose. But I often get bloating, to be honest. It’s difficult to say if it’s related. No fever, no nausea… nothing like that. Oh! And… my bowel movements have been a little irregular. Not… not diarrhea, exactly. Just… not as regular as they should be. Does that sound… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, Noelani, that’s helpful information. Fatigue, bloating, and irregular bowel movements. All potentially relevant. To get a more complete picture, let's go through some of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear, my medical history… That’s… a bit of a blur, to be honest. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course, but I don’t always remember the details. I believe I had… some issues with my gallbladder a few years ago, but it was treated. And… high blood pressure, perhaps? I take medication for that. But beyond that… it’s all rather hazy. I'm so sorry. I really wish I could be more precise. I do have Medicare, if that helps with records?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Noelani. It's common to forget details over time, and Medicare will be very helpful – we can access your records through their system. I'm glad you mentioned the high blood pressure – that's important. And we’ll confirm the gallbladder issue. Let's start with the blood pressure medication. What is the name and dosage of the medication you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Um… let me see… Here it is. Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once daily. I’ve been taking it for… several years now, I believe. I try to be very good about taking it, but sometimes… well, sometimes I forget. I apologize. It's the muddled thinking, you see. It's quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Noelani. Lisinopril 20mg daily. And you mentioned occasional forgetfulness, which is good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm… I don't think so. I haven't had any serious reactions to anything that I recall. Perhaps a slight… sensitivity to shellfish, years ago, but nothing dramatic. Just a little bit of itching, I believe. Nothing that required medical attention. I wouldn't say I have any true allergies, no. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known true allergies, possible slight sensitivity to shellfish. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… that’s another thing I struggle to recall. I believe I had my tonsils removed when I was a child. That's… a very long time ago, of course. And… perhaps a gallbladder surgery, sometime in the last few years? But I honestly can’t be certain. It’s all a bit of a blur. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I wish I could provide more accurate information. I really do.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Noelani. We can verify these details with your medical records. Tonsillectomy as a child and possible gallbladder surgery – that's helpful. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… That’s… a complicated question. My mother had… some issues with her heart, I believe. And my father had diabetes, yes. And… several aunts and uncles had cancer, unfortunately. It seemed to be quite common on that side of the family. It’s a bit of a worrying history, to be honest. I always try to stay as healthy as possible, but… you can’t always control these things, can you?
DOCTOR: No, you can’t, Noelani. It's good to be aware of your family history, though, and it helps us understand your overall risk. Now, regarding your social history - do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never have, never will. I don’t care for any of those things. I find them… unhealthy and disruptive. I prefer a quiet life, you see. A bit of gardening, reading… simple pleasures. I don’t need anything like that. I’ve always been a very… sensible person, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Noelani. Sensible and a quiet life. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I'm ready whenever you are. Just… please be gentle. It’s a bit of a sensitive area, you see. And… if I flinch, please don’t be alarmed. It’s just… a bit of anxiety, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Noelani. We will take things slowly and gently. I will explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I’m noting mild tenderness in the lower right quadrant, no rebound tenderness. Now, I will need to do a pelvic exam to get a better idea of what might be causing your pain. I will explain each step before I do it. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a pelvic exam. Well… I suppose so. If it’s necessary. But… please be very careful, Doctor. It's a bit embarrassing, as you can imagine. And… if it’s too uncomfortable, please stop. I’m not very… flexible, you see. I just… I hope it doesn’t take too long. And… explain each step, as you promised?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Noelani. We will take it very slowly and I will explain each step as we go. You can tell me to stop at any time. First, I'm going to visually examine the external genitalia. I'm noting no visible lesions or abnormalities. I'm going to gently insert the speculum now. You may feel some pressure. This allows me to visualize the cervix and vagina. Cervix appears normal in color and texture. No signs of inflammation or lesions noted. Now, I’m going to perform a bimanual exam. I’m gently inserting two fingers into the vagina while palpating your abdomen with my other hand. This allows me to feel your uterus and ovaries. Uterus is normal size and position. Left ovary is normal. Right ovary is slightly tender to palpation. No palpable masses noted. Okay, we’re finished with the exam now. Everything went well, and you did a great job. I did note some tenderness on the right ovary. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing the pain without further testing, but it could be a few things, such as a cyst or inflammation.
PATIENT: Oh… a cyst, you say? Is that… serious? Will I need surgery? I haven’t had any pain like this before. And I’m not very good with… medical procedures, you see. They make me quite anxious. What sort of tests do you recommend? And… will they be painful? I really appreciate you being so gentle, Doctor. It’s a bit of a relief to have some idea of what’s going on, even if it’s just a possibility.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking these questions, Noelani. A cyst on the ovary is quite common, and most are benign, meaning they aren’t cancerous. Many even resolve on their own. However, to get a clearer picture, I recommend a pelvic ultrasound. This is a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to visualize your ovaries and uterus. It won't involve any needles or radiation, and it shouldn’t be painful at all – you’ll just lie on a table and a technician will move a probe over your abdomen. We can schedule that for tomorrow at the clinic, if you'd like. The results will help us determine the size and nature of the cyst, and whether any further action is needed. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound sounds… much better than surgery, thankfully. Tomorrow would be fine. Yes, that’s perfectly acceptable. And no needles, you say? That’s… a great relief. And the emergency room, if the pain gets worse… I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and… understanding. It’s difficult to explain how anxious I get with these things. So, an ultrasound tomorrow. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any particular foods I should avoid, or anything? I really do appreciate your help, Doctor Pfennig.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. I understand your anxiety, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. For now, there’s no need to change your diet or activity level. Just continue to monitor your symptoms. If you notice any significant changes – increased pain, bleeding, fever, or any other concerning symptoms – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I’ll have the nurse schedule your ultrasound appointment before you leave. I’ll also give you a written summary of our conversation and the instructions for monitoring your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor Pfennig. And I truly appreciate your kindness and patience. It’s… comforting to know that I’m in good hands. Thank you again for everything. I’ll see you tomorrow for the ultrasound.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. I’m glad I could help. And remember, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your ultrasound. Have a good rest of your day, and I’ll see you tomorrow.
