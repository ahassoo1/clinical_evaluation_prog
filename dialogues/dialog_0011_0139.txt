DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, yes. I… need check for referee. For fitness. I want to be sure I’m okay to do it. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. A pre-participation physical, or fitness-for-duty exam, is a very good idea. To ensure I have a complete understanding of your needs, could you tell me a little more about the refereeing you plan to do?
PATIENT: What kind of… information you need? I… referee basketball. High school. Not… professional. Just local games. I been doing it… a long time. But now… they want check everyone. For… heart, I think. And running.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, thank you. High school basketball refereeing involves a fair amount of physical activity. To begin, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I… had the flu, maybe three years ago? Nothing… serious. And… I broke my wrist, a long time ago. When I was young. Playing… not basketball. Long time ago. No problems now. Doctor fixed it good. Is that… enough? I don’t remember much else.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. And the wrist, is it still causing you any pain or limitation in your range of motion?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Sometimes… a little stiff when it’s cold. But nothing I can’t… work around. I can grip, can lift… everything okay. I use it for… everything.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. I… think I’m healthy. Wife… she always say I need to eat more vegetables. But… she is gone now. So… I eat what I want. Sorry. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Shanor. It’s perfectly alright to share that with me. And yes, diet is a factor in overall health, but we can address that later if needed. For now, let’s focus on your family medical history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… family… my father… he had… problems with his heart. Old age. I think. He… got sick very fast. And… my mother, she… she had diabetes. She needed… shots. That’s all I remember. They lived in China. I don’t… see them much. They… are gone now too. Sorry. I… not good with remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Shanor. It's understandable that remembering details from a distance can be difficult. Knowing about your father's heart condition and your mother’s diabetes is helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat… everything. Except maybe… too much sugar. Wife say that too. But no… problems with medicine. I take… sometimes, for headache. But not… often. Just… when it’s bad. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what medication do you take for headaches, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Just… ibuprofen. The… white pills. Over the counter. I buy it at… the store. When I need it. Not… every day. Maybe once a month. Sometimes… not at all. Is that… okay? I don’t… like taking pills.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Mr. Shanor. Ibuprofen is a common and generally safe medication. Now, let’s talk about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No smoking. No… drugs. Sometimes… I drink beer. With friends. But not… a lot. Maybe one or two. On… weekends. Not every weekend. I… need to be healthy for refereeing. It’s… important job. I take it… seriously.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Shanor. A moderate amount of alcohol consumption is generally not a concern. To complete the history, could you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. I… I think I am… one seventy-four centimeters. And… one thirty-four kilograms. Maybe. I haven’t… checked in a long time. Wife… she used to do that. Sorry. I… don’t want to be a problem.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Shanor. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. This will include listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick assessment of your joints and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Whatever you need. Just… make it quick, please? I… have games to think about. And… paperwork. Refereeing is… a lot of work. But… yes. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. I’ll be as efficient as possible. If you could please have a seat here, we’ll get started. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Joints appear normal, full range of motion without any pain or limitation. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Gait is steady. Everything appears to be within normal limits based on this initial exam, but given your slightly elevated blood pressure and family history, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel and a lipid profile. This will give us a more comprehensive picture of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Blood work… fine. Whatever you think is… best. Just… tell me when. I need to… schedule games. And… make sure I can run. I don’t want to… fall down on the court. Is that… possible? If my blood is… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s very unlikely your blood work will prevent you from refereeing, Mr. Shanor. It's simply a precautionary measure to get a baseline and ensure everything is functioning optimally. If anything were to be concerning, we would discuss it thoroughly and determine the best course of action. I'll have the lab technician draw some blood before you leave today. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated, maintaining a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. I… think that’s all. Just… get the blood work done. And… tell me if I can’t referee. That’s… important. Thank you, Doctor. You… are very kind. Sorry about… talking too much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Shanor. It’s my job to listen and provide the best possible care. And please, don’t apologize for talking – it helps me understand your needs. I’ll have the lab technician come in shortly. You’ll receive instructions on where to go for your follow-up appointment. If anything changes or you experience any new symptoms before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Mr. Shanor.
