DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's… this going to the bathroom thing. Seems like all I do is go now. It’s a nuisance, really. Not a big deal, I suppose, but my wife keeps nagging me about it. She says it’s… what was it? “Disrupting our life,” that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. Let’s try to figure out what's going on. When did you first start noticing this increase in how often you need to go?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Honestly, Doctor, my memory ain't what it used to be. Seems like… a while now. Maybe a few months? It came on gradually, not all at once. I just kept noticing I was going more and more often. I didn’t pay much attention at first, to be honest. Old age, I figured.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of gradual onset. And is it just more often, or are you also experiencing any urgency – a sudden, strong need to go right now?
PATIENT: Urgency… well, sometimes. Not always a sudden thing, you know? Most of the time it just… builds up. But there are times, yes, times when I have to go, and fast. Especially if I drink something. Coffee, mostly. Can’t seem to live without my coffee, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Coffee can definitely contribute to that. Do you notice any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not a bit. Just… frequent. And like I said, the wife is on my case about it. She worries too much, that woman. Always has. No burning, though. It just… goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No pain or burning is a positive. And are you experiencing any difficulty starting the stream of urine, or is it a strong, steady flow when you go?
PATIENT: No trouble starting, no. It flows alright. Not like a firehose, maybe, but steady enough. I don't have any… blockages, if that's what you mean? I can empty myself alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color and smell… hmm. I haven't been paying attention to the smell, Doctor. Truthfully, I don’t go sniffing my… well, you know. The color… sometimes it's a bit darker, maybe? If I don't drink enough water, I suppose. But nothing terribly unusual. I try to drink water, but the coffee… it gets the better of me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I get up at night sometimes. More than I used to, to go to the bathroom. That bothers my wife, especially. She says I'm tossing and turning and keeping her awake. Other than that… no. I sleep alright, eat alright. Old man stuff, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, getting up at night to urinate – that’s called nocturia – is definitely relevant. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Prostate problems… now there’s a thought. The doctor, a long time ago, said something about my prostate being a bit… enlarged. But that was years ago, Doctor. Years! I don’t even remember his name. High blood pressure, maybe? I take a pill, a little white one, every morning. For something, anyway. Diabetes… I don’t think so. My wife would have said something if I had that, wouldn't she? She's good at keeping track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of an enlarged prostate and a medication for high blood pressure. Do you happen to know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Name of the medication… oh dear. Now you’re asking things I really can’t remember. It’s a little white pill. I take it with my coffee. That’s about all I know. My wife handles the refills, you see. I just take what she gives me. She says it’s for my… what was it… my “numbers.” She says my numbers were too high.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little white pill for high blood pressure, managing your "numbers". That’s alright, we can look that up. Before we do, let’s talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had problems with their kidneys or bladder?
PATIENT: Kidneys or bladder… hmm. My father… he had some kind of trouble when he got old, I think. Something with his… waterworks. But I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk much about health things. My mother… she was healthy as a horse, that woman. Never had a day’s illness in her life. No, I don't recall anyone specifically with kidney or bladder problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I have a little glass of vodka sometimes. With dinner. Just a little one. For my digestion, you see. My wife lets me have it. Keeps me happy, she says. Nothing more than a shot glass full. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. Alright, it looks like you are on hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension, and we've confirmed you have a history of an enlarged prostate. Given your symptoms of frequent urination, especially at night, and the history of an enlarged prostate, it sounds like Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia – BPH – is the most likely cause. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, like a urinary tract infection. I’d like to do a quick urine test right here in the office. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A urine test? Well, alright, I suppose. If you think it's necessary. Just try to be quick about it, Doctor. I have things to do, you know. The garden needs weeding, and my wife… well, she has a list.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I'll get you set up. It will just be a small sample, and it shouldn’t take long. The nurse will show you where to go. I'll be right here when you're done.
PATIENT: .
