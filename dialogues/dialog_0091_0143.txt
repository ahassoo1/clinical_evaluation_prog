DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 66 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 66… feels like yesterday I was younger, you know? Um… well, my… my daughter, she’s thinking about having a baby. And she said I should… come here? For… before that happens? She said it’s important. I forget things easy, so I’m not really sure why exactly, but here I am. Is that right? Pre-… pre-what was it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. Your daughter is very thoughtful. It sounds like she’s concerned about your overall health before she starts a family, which is quite responsible. We call it pre-conception counseling for the father – making sure you’re in the best possible shape for a healthy pregnancy and a healthy grandchild. It’s excellent you came in, and don't worry about forgetting things; we’ll take our time and I’ll document everything. To start, could you tell me a little about your current health?
PATIENT: Oh, “pre-conception.” Yes, that sounds right. A grandchild… that would be nice. My health… hmm. Well, I work, you know? Sales… engineers. Lots of travel sometimes. Not as much now, getting older. I… I think I’m okay. I get a little tired, but everyone gets tired. No big illnesses, not that I remember. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, honestly. I just… take some pills for my… waterworks, if that makes sense? And sometimes something for my… tummy. But nothing serious, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, thank you. "Waterworks" and "tummy" are perfectly fine descriptions to start with. To be more precise for the medical record, could you tell me what those pills are for specifically?
PATIENT: Oh… uh… the waterworks one… it's for when I have to… go a lot. Especially at night. My daughter says it's my… prostate? Something like that. It's just… uncomfortable, that's all. And the tummy one… sometimes I get… indigestion? Heartburn? It burns, you know, after I eat. Just normal old-man stuff, I guess. I don't even know the names of the pills. I just… take them when I need to. She gets them for me. My daughter, I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, so we're talking about frequent urination, particularly at night, and occasional heartburn or indigestion. It sounds like the medication for your frequent urination is likely related to your prostate, as your daughter mentioned. And the other medication is for digestive issues. Do you recall how often you're taking each of these medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… the waterworks one… every night, I think. Sometimes twice, if I drink a lot of tea. And the tummy one… not every day. Only when I eat something… spicy, or too much. Maybe three or four times a week, sometimes less. It really depends. I don't really keep track, to be honest. It’s just as needed. Do I need to? I’m sorry, I'm not very good at this… remembering things, you know.
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing perfectly fine, Mr. Verrall. It’s not about being “good” at it; it’s about gathering information. It's very common to not keep exact track of medication dosages, especially when they're taken as needed. Knowing approximately how often you take them is helpful. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh… chronic… that sounds serious. Let me think… High… blood pressure… the doctor did mention something about that, a few years back. He said I needed to watch my salt. But I don’t remember ever taking pills for it. Just… told to eat less salt. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. My daughter would have said something. And heart… no, never anything with my heart. I used to be pretty active, you know? Hiking, walking… not so much now, but… no heart problems. I’m pretty sure. Is that what you need to know? About serious things?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I need to know. It sounds like you were advised to monitor your blood pressure, but haven’t been formally diagnosed or treated for hypertension. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… Oh! Yes. Years ago. When I was… younger. I broke my leg. Playing football. Badly. They put… pins in it, I think. And… oh. I had my appendix out. That was a long time ago too. And… I think that’s it. Just the leg and the appendix. Nothing else. It was all a long time ago, though. Before my daughter was born, even. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts, Mr. Verrall. So, a fracture repair of your leg and an appendectomy. Thank you for remembering those details. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s… difficult. My parents… they’re both gone now, a long time ago. My mother… she had… something with her stomach, I think. Cancer, maybe? I don't really remember. And my father… he had a bad heart, I think. He died young. But that’s… all I really know. I wasn’t very close to my family, to be honest. I moved away when I was young. And I haven’t seen my brother in… years. Does that help? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at remembering family things. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s common to not have complete family medical histories. Knowing what you do remember is helpful. So, a history of stomach problems in your mother and heart disease in your father. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh no, never. Never liked it. My father used to smoke, a lot. Horrible habit. I always told him to stop, but… he never did. I’ve always stayed away from it. My daughter doesn’t smoke either, thank goodness. Always very careful about her health, she is. No, never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t drink much either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not very often. That’s all.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Verrall. So, no history of smoking and very limited alcohol consumption. Now, regarding your work - do you have any occupational exposures to chemicals or toxins?
PATIENT: Occupational… exposures? Hmm. That's… a good question. I'm a sales engineer, you know? I sell… things. Big machines, mostly. I used to go to factories a lot, when I was younger. Lots of noise, dust… sometimes smells. Chemicals… I don’t know. They built the machines, I just sold them. I never worked with the chemicals, if that makes sense. Mostly just… paperwork, and talking to people. I don’t think I was ever exposed to anything dangerous. But it was a long time ago, so I can’t be sure. Is that what you need to know? About bad things at work?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I need to know. It sounds like your exposure to potential occupational hazards was minimal, which is good. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think… I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Sometimes a little bit of… hay fever, in the spring. But that’s not really an allergy, is it? And… I don’t think I’m allergic to any food. I eat… most things. My daughter always makes sure I’m eating healthy, you know. She’s very careful. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Do you need to know about anything else? I’m starting to feel a bit tired. All this remembering… it's hard work.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Verrall, that’s perfectly alright. You’ve given me a great deal of information. It’s understandable to feel tired recalling so much detail. Thank you for your patience. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s okay. It will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. We'll start with your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. Then I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Yes, okay. That sounds… fine. I haven’t had one in… a long time. I hope it won’t take too long. And… is it going to hurt? I’m not very good with… needles, you know. Or… poking and prodding. But… if you think it's important, I'll do it. Just… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verrall. We’ll take it slowly and I’ll explain everything as we go. We won't be doing any blood draws today, so no needles involved. Just a routine check of your vital signs and a quick listen to your heart and lungs. I will also palpate your abdomen. It won’t hurt; I’ll just be feeling for anything unusual. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Okay… here we go. I hope it's not too high. I do get a bit stressed at the doctor, you know. And then… you'll listen to my tummy? Oh dear. I hope there's nothing… unusual. My daughter would be worried. Just be gentle, please. And tell me if you see anything, okay? I like to know what’s going on, even if it’s bad news. It’s better to know, right?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. I will explain everything as we go and you can ask questions at any time. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll need to monitor that over time. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… Good. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Is this tender at all?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… cold. And… a little bit weird. But okay, I'm breathing. 148… is that bad? My daughter always tells me to watch my salt, so… maybe it's the salt. Ooh… that's a little bit tender… there. On the… right side. Not a lot, but… yes. A little bit uncomfortable. I get indigestion sometimes, you know? Maybe that’s it. But yes… there. It’s… not a sharp pain, just… a bit sore. Is that bad? Should I worry?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It’s helpful to pinpoint the area of tenderness. It doesn’t seem to be anything acutely concerning, but given your history of indigestion, we’ll want to investigate this further. The rest of your abdomen feels soft and non-tender. Based on what we’ve discussed and the preliminary physical exam, I would like to order some blood work. It will help us assess your overall health, check your kidney and liver function, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. We’ll also need to do a urine test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: More tests? Oh dear. I’m not very good with tests, you know. But… okay. If you think it’s important. Blood work and… urine? I suppose so. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. And… will it hurt? Is there anything I need to do before the tests? Like… not eat anything? My daughter always tells me to eat healthy, so I don't want to mess it up. I just want to make sure everything is okay for… the baby. For my grandchild.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Mr. Verrall. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, but these tests are routine and will give us a clearer picture of your health. For the blood work, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – that means no food or sugary drinks. You can still drink water. The urine test is a simple sample you can provide when you’re ready. We’ll give you a collection cup and instructions. I'm also going to order a PSA test, which is a blood test that screens for prostate issues. It’s a simple draw along with the other blood work. Given your symptoms, it's best to be thorough. Do you have any questions about any of the tests?
PATIENT: PSA… that sounds serious. Is that about my… prostate? The one my daughter mentioned? I thought we were just talking about indigestion. Oh dear. Does that mean something is wrong? I feel a bit scared now. I just want to be healthy for my grandchild. What if something is wrong? Will I need… surgery? Or… something worse? I just want to know… what does that test mean? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to worry my daughter. She's already very concerned.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you hear about a new test, especially one you haven't encountered before. Let me assure you, ordering the PSA test doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong. It’s a screening test, meaning it helps us identify any potential problems early on. Many men have elevated PSA levels that don’t indicate anything serious. The PSA test measures the amount of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. Elevated levels can be a sign of prostate enlargement, infection, or, in some cases, prostate cancer. However, many other factors can also cause elevated levels, and further investigation is often needed to determine the cause. If the PSA level is elevated, we would likely order additional tests, such as a digital rectal exam or a prostate biopsy, to get a more accurate diagnosis. But we won’t jump to any conclusions until we have all the necessary information. The results should be available within 5-7 business days. I will personally review them with you and discuss the next steps. We will take things one step at a time. And I will be here to answer any questions you have along the way. We’ll focus on getting you healthy for your grandchild, and we will do everything we can to achieve that goal. Do you have any other concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. That’s… good. I like that. 5-7 days… I can wait. And… you’ll explain everything? I just don’t want to be… surprised. Or scared. I think… I think I’m okay for now. Just… try not to scare me, please? And… thank you. For explaining everything. And for not… rushing. My daughter will be relieved to hear that you’re being… careful. So… blood work and urine. And then we wait. And… you’ll tell me everything? That’s… all I ask. It’s just… a grandchild. It’s a big thing, you know? I want to be there for them.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verrall. I promise to be thorough and honest with you, and I will explain everything in a clear and understandable way. There will be no surprises. We’ll take this one step at a time, and I’ll be here to support you throughout the process. Here are the instructions for the blood work and urine tests. Please remember to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood work. You can drink water. And please let the lab technician know you are also having a PSA test done. I’m also going to provide you with a referral to a urologist. It's always good to have a specialist involved, especially given your symptoms. However, we don't need to rush into anything. We'll review the blood work results first, and then we can discuss whether or not a visit to the urologist is necessary. Do you have any questions about the referral?
PATIENT: A urologist… that sounds… serious. Is that… like a specialist for my… plumbing? My daughter always says I talk about my health too much. She gets embarrassed. I don't know… I don’t want to bother a specialist if it’s nothing serious. Can’t we just… wait for the blood work? I just want to know what the blood work says first. And then… we can decide. I don’t want to cause a fuss. My daughter always says I worry too much. And I don’t want to scare her. Can we just wait for the blood work? Please? And then… we'll see. That’s… all I ask.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verrall. We can certainly wait for the blood work results before making any decisions about a referral to a urologist. I completely understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we will take things at your pace. There’s no need to rush into anything. We’ll focus on getting those blood work results back, and then we’ll discuss them thoroughly. If the results indicate the need for further investigation, we can discuss a referral to a urologist at that time. But for now, let’s just focus on taking things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… the blood work. And then… we wait. And you’ll tell me everything? You promise? Thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. And for not… rushing. It’s just… a big thing. A grandchild. I want to be healthy. That’s all. I think… I think I’m ready to go now. If that’s okay? Just… get the blood work done. And then… we wait. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. I promise to be thorough and honest with you, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. Just schedule the blood work at your convenience, and we’ll review the results as soon as they become available. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. Wishing you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon.
