DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, recently things have not been… sticking in my mind as they should. It is concerning, you understand. I have high blood pressure, and I worry this is… connected. I want to understand what is happening, quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Memory concerns are certainly worth investigating, especially with your history of high blood pressure. It's good you're being proactive about this. "Not sticking in your mind as they should" – can you elaborate a little on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Yes. It is… difficult to explain precisely. Small things. I will make tea, and then… forget why I made tea. Or I will speak with a neighbor, and the name… it escapes me just moments later. Important things, appointments… I write them down, of course, but even reading what I wrote… sometimes it does not feel… familiar. It is frustrating. And frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly frustrating, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be frightened. So, it's not a complete loss of memories, more like…difficulty recalling recent events and information, even things you’ve actively noted down. Is this a sudden change, or has it been developing gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, Doctor. Very gradually. Perhaps… six months? It was so slight at first, I dismissed it as… being busy. A lot on my mind with the community association, you understand. But it has… increased. Steadily. Now it is… noticeable. And worrying. I do not like to feel… unreliable.
DOCTOR: Six months of a gradual change is helpful to know. And you’re right to pay attention to it. It's good you recognize the change and are addressing it. Let's try to get a clearer picture. Aside from the forgetting, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… let me think. My husband… he passed away two years ago. Grief… it does things to a person. I sometimes feel… a little lost, if that makes sense. But that is… understandable, I think. No… physically, I do not think so. Perhaps… a little more tired than usual. But I attribute that to… everything. The association, the house, worrying about this memory issue. Is this… common?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, Ms. Alvara, and it’s understandable to feel tired and lost after such a significant loss. And yes, fatigue is very common, especially given everything you're managing. It's good you're able to differentiate between what might be grief-related and what feels new. To help me understand what might be going on with your memory, could you tell me a little more about your typical day?
PATIENT: Typical day… well. I wake early, around six. Tea, of course. I check my emails, respond to association members. There are always problems, you understand. Leaky roofs, disagreements about landscaping… Then I prepare for meetings, usually in the afternoon. I often have to review documents, contracts… which is becoming… difficult. Evenings are quiet. I read, or watch television. Sometimes a neighbor will visit. I try to keep busy, but… it is becoming harder to focus. And remember what I have read, or who visited. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that gives me a good sense of your routine. It sounds like you're very active and involved. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the blood pressure. It has been… well-managed for many years. I take my medication faithfully. The doctor… Dr. Volkov, he always said I was a good patient. I do not smoke. I drink… a small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. I try to eat healthy, but… sometimes it is difficult. So much to do, so little time. I have no allergies, to my knowledge. Just… the blood pressure. And now… this.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Well-managed blood pressure is positive. And it sounds like you maintain a generally healthy lifestyle. Now, have you ever had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing significant. A broken arm when I was a child, perhaps. A tonsillectomy. Nothing that would… matter now. I have always been… healthy. Until recently. This memory… it worries me greatly. I am a very organized person, you understand. I like things to be… in order. This is… disrupting that. It is more than just forgetting names, Doctor. It is… a feeling of… disconnect.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Alvara. It sounds like this is causing you significant distress, and that feeling of disconnect is definitely something we need to explore. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there a family history of memory problems, dementia, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My mother… she did become… confused, towards the end of her life. But she was very old. It was dismissed as… old age. My father… he was a very stoic man. He never spoke of his family, or his health. I… do not know. I have a cousin, perhaps. But we have not spoken in many years. I am afraid I do not have much information. We were… not a close family. Is that… helpful? It feels as though I am not being very useful.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Ms. Alvara. It’s completely understandable that you don’t have a lot of information about your family history. It’s common. We’ll work with what we have. Now, just to clarify, when you say your mother became confused, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: She… she would repeat herself, often. Ask the same question several times in a short period. She would… misplace things. Not important things, just… her glasses, a book. She would sometimes… not recognize family members, for brief moments. But it was attributed to her age, as I said. She was… very old. And she had a difficult life. It was… not unexpected. It is difficult to explain precisely. It was a gradual… fading.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful. A gradual fading with repetition and misplacement... alright. Now, one final area to cover, and please don’t hesitate to tell me if you don’t know the answer. Are you currently taking any medications besides your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Only the blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I believe it is called. Dr. Volkov prescribed it. I take it every morning, as directed. I do take… a vitamin D supplement. The doctor… a friend recommended it. But it is just a vitamin. Not a… prescription medication. I do not take anything else. I assure you. I am very careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That’s very thorough. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. This will just involve checking your vital signs, a basic neurological assessment, and listening to your heart and lungs. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any other potential causes for your memory concerns. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. I understand. The sooner we understand what is happening, the better. I trust your judgment. Please… proceed. I do hope it will not take too long. I have several appointments this afternoon with the association. But I will make time. I must understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: Of course. It shouldn't take too long. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit up and rest your arm on the table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I hope it is not too high. I do become anxious at the doctor's office, you understand. It rarely stays stable when I am being examined.
DOCTOR: That’s very common, Ms. Alvara. We’ll take a few readings to get a good average. 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your anxiety. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I try to remain calm. It is… difficult. The association members… they are very demanding. Always a problem, always a crisis. It stresses me greatly. Is my heartbeat… irregular? I sometimes feel… palpitations. Especially when I am worried.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, which is good. Your heartbeat is a little fast, but regular. Palpitations are something we should keep an eye on, but it’s not unusual when you’re feeling stressed or anxious. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and some basic neurological functions. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am trying to be very precise. I do not want to… complicate matters. It is already difficult enough, as it is. I sometimes feel… clumsy. I used to be so graceful. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Very good. And can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am squeezing as hard as I can. I used to have such strong hands. Working in the garden, you see. Now… they ache. Especially when it is cold. Is there anything… unusual? I do not want to… waste your time. But I worry. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is slightly diminished, but that could be due to a number of factors. Now, could you please stand up for me and try to balance on both feet for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is… difficult. I feel… unsteady. I have always been rather clumsy, if I am honest. But this feels… different. I worry about falling. I live alone, you see. It would be… problematic.
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed a little bit of instability. Now, one final check. Can you please close your eyes and tell me what finger I am holding up?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Hmm… I believe… two fingers? Is that correct? It is… difficult to be certain with my eyes closed. Everything feels… fuzzy. Is this… concerning? I do hope it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me and the findings of the examination – the elevated blood pressure, the slight instability, the diminished grip strength, and the difficulty identifying the fingers with your eyes closed – there are a few possibilities we need to explore. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but the findings are concerning enough to warrant further investigation. I’m going to recommend some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also think it would be helpful to get a brain scan – either a CT scan or an MRI – to get a better look at your brain structure. And finally, I’d like you to see a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Blood work… a brain scan… a neurologist… That sounds… serious, Doctor. Very serious. Is it… is it Alzheimer's? I have heard… terrible stories. I do not want to lose my mind. I want to remain… myself. But… if that is what is necessary, then I suppose I must do it. I want to understand what is happening, as quickly as possible. I trust your judgment. Please… proceed. But… can you explain what each test entails? And what you are looking for? I need to understand, Doctor. I need to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Alvara. It’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious. Let’s break it down. I want to be very clear: we are not making a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s at this point. These tests are simply to help us rule out other potential causes for your symptoms and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The blood work will check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, infections, and other medical conditions that can sometimes cause memory problems. It's a fairly routine procedure, just a few vials of blood taken from your arm. The brain scan – either a CT scan or an MRI – will allow us to look at the structure of your brain. It can help us identify any signs of stroke, tumors, or other abnormalities. An MRI is more detailed than a CT scan, but it also takes longer and can be a little more uncomfortable if you’re claustrophobic. We can discuss which one is best for you. Finally, seeing a neurologist is important because they are specialists in the brain and nervous system. They can perform a more detailed neurological exam and interpret the results of the tests. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that makes sense. Blood work to rule out other issues. A scan to look at the brain. And a specialist to… interpret everything. It is… a lot to take in. Claustrophobic… hmm. I do not think so. But the thought of being enclosed… it is unsettling. Perhaps the CT scan would be better? Less… confining? And… what if something is found? What if it is something serious? What are the treatment options? I understand you cannot give me a definitive answer yet, but… I need to be prepared. I am a practical person, you see. I like to know what to expect. Even if it is… difficult.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, Ms. Alvara. The CT scan is a good option if you're concerned about claustrophobia; it's quicker and less enclosed than an MRI. Regarding treatment, it depends entirely on the cause. If it's a vitamin deficiency, we can simply supplement. If it's a thyroid problem, we can treat that with medication. If it is something more serious, like early stages of dementia, there are medications that can help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression. There are also therapies and support groups that can be incredibly helpful. We will take things one step at a time. First, let's get the blood work done. I'll write you a requisition form, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. Then we'll schedule the brain scan. Once we have those results, we'll discuss them in detail and decide on the best course of action. I'm going to write a referral for you to see Dr. Ramirez, a wonderful neurologist. He's highly respected in the community, and I trust his judgment implicitly. Do you have any questions about any of that before we proceed?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramirez… good. I will write that down. One step at a time… yes, that sounds… sensible. The blood work… I can do that tomorrow, I think. I must arrange for someone to drive me, of course. It is difficult to get around these days. And the scan… how long does that take? And is there anything I need to do to prepare? I do not think I have any other questions… at the moment. But I am sure… more will arise. I worry about burdening you with my anxieties, Doctor. But I am… frightened. And I appreciate your patience. You have been very… kind.
DOCTOR: You are not a burden, Ms. Alvara. It's my job to address your anxieties and help you navigate this. The CT scan usually takes about 15-20 minutes, and you don't need to do much to prepare. Just let the technician know if you have any metal implants or allergies. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, give you a detailed information sheet with everything you need to know about the blood work and the scan, including contact numbers and directions. She'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results once they're available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I’m going to write these requisitions now. And again, remember, we’re taking things one step at a time. We’ll get to the bottom of this, together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Sarah… I will remember that name. One step at a time… yes. It is… comforting to hear. I appreciate your… thoroughness. And your kindness. I believe… that is all for now. Unless you have any further questions for me?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Alvara, I think we’ve covered everything for now. Just focus on getting the blood work done and scheduling the scan. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes to mind. I'll have Sarah come in with the information sheets, and we'll get you all set up. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. And you as well. I will… follow your instructions. .
