DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It's just... well, I don't usually bother doctors for much. But my daughter, she says I should come get a little note. A "get well" card, she called it. For... encouragement. Honestly, it sounds silly. But she worries so.
DOCTOR: A note, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! That's right. She thinks... well, she thinks a little something from a real doctor would cheer me up. Not just her fussing, you understand. It’s not that I’m sick sick. Just… a bit low in spirits, I suppose. And she’s convinced a card is the answer. Honestly, the things these young people come up with. Do you really write these things?
DOCTOR: While I don’t typically provide “encouragement cards,” Ms. Micucci, I am happy to document any concerns you have so your daughter feels more at ease. Perhaps we can discuss what’s been making you feel “low in spirits” and ensure there isn’t an underlying medical reason for your symptoms. It's important to rule things out, even if you feel it's "just" low spirits. Where would you like to start?
PATIENT: Oh, symptoms already? See? This is exactly what I mean. I just want a little note! But… fine. If you insist. It’s mostly just… everything, I suppose. My grandson started that new schooling, very far away. And my husband, he's been... quieter lately. Not ill, mind you, just… preoccupied. It’s just a lot. But I don’t need medicine for a bit of sadness, do I?
DOCTOR: Of course not, Ms. Micucci. We aren’t rushing to medication. But changes in mood, especially when coupled with life events, can sometimes indicate an underlying issue. We simply need to gather some information. Let’s start with your husband. You said he’s been quieter. Has this change been sudden, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It started… maybe a month or so ago? He used to love his garden, always out there, talking to the tomatoes like they were people. Now he mostly just sits. He says he’s tired, but he doesn’t look tired. He just… stares. It’s a little unsettling, to be honest. He’s a practical man, always has been. Not one for… feelings. So him being quiet is much more worrying than if I was a little down. He doesn’t complain of pain, though. Not a single ache.
DOCTOR: And has this change in his behavior affected his daily routines?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Everything is different. He used to wake up with the sun, first one up, making tea for everyone. Now I have to practically drag him out of bed. He doesn’t bother with the garden anymore, just leaves it to me. He used to help me with the cooking, now he just sits and watches television. It’s… it’s like he’s not really there anymore, you understand? Just… going through the motions. It's all very strange. I keep asking him if he’s alright, but he just says he’s fine. Men! They never tell you what’s really bothering them.
DOCTOR: Right. And you mentioned your grandson starting schooling. Is that a new school far from home?
PATIENT: Yes, very far. It’s a good school, of course, very prestigious. My daughter insisted. But he was always so close, you see? We used to see him every weekend, have dinner together. Now it’s just… phone calls. And he sounds so busy, always rushing off to something. It’s lovely that he’s doing well, truly. But it feels… empty without him. He was such a cheerful boy, always telling me stories. Now the house is just quieter. Everything is just… quieter. It’s probably just me being an old woman, missing her family. But it's a lot all at once, you see?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, while it's understandable to attribute these feelings to missing your family, changes in both your husband's and your grandson’s routines, combined with your own feelings, warrant further investigation. I’d like to ask a few more questions to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any changes in your husband’s appetite or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re asking about details. Honestly, you’re making me feel like I need to be a detective, not a patient! Well… his appetite is a little less than usual, I suppose. He doesn’t refuse food, but he doesn't enjoy it like he used to. He just… picks at it. And his sleep… yes, he seems to be sleeping more. He used to wake up early, full of energy. Now he’ll sleep late into the morning. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and he’s already awake, just… staring at the ceiling. It’s unsettling, I tell you. It’s like he’s not really present even when he's awake. Honestly, it's all very strange. Are you trying to tell me he’s ill? Because he's a proud man, he would never admit it.
DOCTOR: I am not suggesting he is ill, Ms. Micucci. However, these changes you describe are concerning and warrant a more thorough evaluation. Let’s move on to you. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, me? No, not really. I eat alright, perhaps a little less than usual, but nothing to worry about. I sleep… well, I sleep like an old woman. Lots of waking up in the night, needing to use the bathroom. But that’s just age, isn’t it? I don’t complain. I’ve always been a strong woman, never needed much fussing over. It’s my husband I’m worried about. He's not one to show his feelings, you see? And I know him. Something is not right. Honestly, I just want him to be himself again. Is there a test you can do? To see if something is wrong with his… his brain, perhaps?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re observant, Ms. Micucci. These changes in your husband's behaviour, coupled with your own concerns, do warrant investigation. A physical exam is a good place to start, and we can discuss potential blood work. Given his symptoms, a neurological assessment might also be helpful. We can also rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to his changes. Let’s begin with a simple physical exam. May I ask you to step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale! Now you're just being thorough. Very well. But honestly, I don't see what weighing me will do. It’s him who needs checking over, not me. Still… if you insist. But don’t be surprised if it’s a little higher than usual. I've been enjoying my daughter’s cooking a bit too much lately. There. Now what?
DOCTOR: 55 kilograms. And your height is 176 centimeters, if I recall correctly from the chart?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Always been quite tall, you know. My mother said I got it from my grandfather. But really, Doctor, are numbers going to tell you anything about what's wrong with my husband? He's the one who's changed. He's the one who needs your attention. Honestly, you're making me feel like I'm the patient here!
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, while your husband is the primary concern, gathering information about your own health is important. It provides a broader context. Now, let’s move on to a brief neurological assessment. I’d like to check his reflexes and assess his cognitive function. It’s a simple procedure, and it will help us determine if further testing is needed. Would you be willing to let me examine your husband?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to examine him? After all this fussing about my weight and numbers? Fine. Yes, of course. But don't expect him to be cooperative. He's a stubborn man, you know. And he hates doctors. Honestly, he'll probably just tell you everything is fine and wave you away. But… alright. Let's get it over with. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could have him sit here, that would be perfect. We'll start with a simple balance test. I’ll just ask him to stand with his feet together and close his eyes for a few seconds. Nothing to worry about, it just helps us assess his stability. And please, reassure him it’s a quick and painless procedure.
PATIENT: Oh, reassure him. As if that's possible! Alright, alright. I'll try. But don't blame me if he gives you a hard time. He's not one for being poked and prodded. Husband! The doctor wants to… check something. Come along now, don’t be difficult.
