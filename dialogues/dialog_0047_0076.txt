DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my legs, see? These little bumps... red ones, on my shins. They’re kinda sore, especially when I’m walking around. Been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not getting any better, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, around a month. It started with just one, I think, and then more and more popped up. Not all at once, you know? Slowly. It’s… annoying, mostly. Makes wearing shorts uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: And are these bumps… itchy, painful, or just uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Mostly painful, Doctor. Not really itchy, thankfully. It’s like… a bruise, but raised. And when I press on them, it kinda hurts. Especially after a long day at work, you know? Lifting and moving stuff all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what is your work, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Oh, I move freight. Mostly boxes and things at the warehouse. Been doing it… well, a long time now. It’s hard work, but it pays the bills. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be, but I manage.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with these bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think. Not really, Doctor. No fever, no feeling sick. Just the bumps. Maybe my legs feel a little tired at the end of the day, but that’s normal with the work I do, right? I haven’t noticed anything else different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at these bumps, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Go ahead. They’re right here, see? Mostly on this one leg, but a few on the other too.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. They are rather… prominent. Erythematous papules, mostly located on the anterior aspect of both tibias. No ulceration, no drainage. Do you have any history of varicose veins or other leg problems?
PATIENT: Varicose veins…? Uh… I don’t think so, Doctor. My wife sometimes talks about hers, but I don’t think I’ve ever had any trouble with my legs before this. I mean, they get tired, like I said. But no… no veins popping out or anything. What are those things, Doctor? They just showed up one day, you know?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say definitively without some further investigation, Mr. Aluia. They could be stasis dermatitis, given your work and the location, but without a history of venous insufficiency, it's less likely. It’s also possible it’s a form of contact dermatitis, though I’d expect more itching with that. We’ll need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a lower extremity arterial Doppler ultrasound to assess your circulation and rule out any underlying vascular issues. I also want a complete blood count to look for any signs of infection.
PATIENT: Wow… a lot of tests. Is it… something serious, Doctor? My circulation? I haven’t felt anything different, but… you know, I’m not a young man anymore. What does the ultrasound and blood test tell you? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, I understand your concern, but it’s best not to jump to conclusions. These tests are simply precautionary to get a clearer picture. The ultrasound will assess blood flow in your legs. The blood test will check for infection or inflammation. It’s routine. As for timing, the lab typically returns results within 2-3 business days. I’ll have the nurse schedule those for you now. In the meantime, elevate your legs when possible, and avoid prolonged standing if you can. We'll discuss the results when they are available. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Uh… I don’t think so. Never had any tests with dye before. My wife has some allergies, but I don’t… no, I don’t think so. I’m usually okay with medicines. But, what if it is something bad, Doctor? Like… something with my heart or something? My grandfather had some heart trouble…
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, I assure you, we are taking all necessary precautions. The tests are not indicative of anything serious, but we must rule out all possibilities. Your grandfather’s history is noted, and we will certainly keep that in mind. The nurse will provide you with detailed instructions regarding the tests. Let’s focus on getting these tests done first, and then we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or should I have the nurse go over everything with you?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm okay. Just get the tests done, I guess. It's a lot to take in, Doctor. The nurse can explain everything. I trust you, Doctor. Just want to get this figured out, you know? And maybe get back to work without these bumps hurting.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse come in and schedule those tests for you. In the meantime, try not to worry. We're taking the appropriate steps. She'll also provide you with a work excuse if needed, although given your description of your job, I suspect a few days of reduced activity will be sufficient. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate it. .
