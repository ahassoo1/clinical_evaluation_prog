DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I'm Dr. Yackey. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It's… well, it's somethin' down there. A little… leakin', I guess you could say. Not good. It's been goin' on… a little while now, I think. Hard to say how long, exactly. Old lady problems, I reckon.
DOCTOR: “Old lady problems” is… not a particularly helpful clinical descriptor, Ms. Genard. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Well, excuse me. I'm tellin' you what it feels like. It's… stuff comin' out. From… you know. Down there. It's not normal, is it? I ain't stupid. And it smells funny, too. Not like flowers, that's for sure. What kinda doctor are you anyway?
DOCTOR: I specialize in Family Medicine, Ms. Genard. And while I appreciate your… candor, a precise description of the discharge—color, consistency, odor—is rather vital. Has this been associated with any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. A little. Not like a broken bone, mind you. Just… uncomfortable. And itchy, yeah, a bit. Mostly it just… bothers me. It's disgusting, is what it is. I don’t do details. I just know it’s not right. And it's comin' outta there! You askin' me to describe… well, it's just rude. I ain't a scientist. I'm an artist. I paint pretty pictures, not… that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on then. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – frequency, urgency, or difficulty?
PATIENT: Urination… hmm. I go when I gotta go, I guess. Ain’t changed much. Maybe… maybe a little more often lately? Hard to say. I drink a lot of water, you know. Good for the skin. And no, no burnin’ or anything like that. Just… normal. Mostly. Except for the… the leakin’ part. Is this gonna take long? I got a gallery show next month, you know. Important people comin’.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's try this. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No fever. I feel warm sometimes, but that's the weather. It's August, you know! And no chills. And my belly… sometimes it aches. Old age, probably. Everything aches when you get old. Don't tell me nothin' I don't already know. Are you gonna look at it or just ask questions all day? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: A physical examination is necessary, Ms. Genard. It’s standard procedure. However, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Chamorro women are strong. And medications… no. I don't like pills. Mess with your system, they do. I take a little vitamin C sometimes, for the skin, but that's it. You really need to look at down there? It's embarrassing, you know. But… if you have to. Just be quick about it. And don't judge.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please disrobe from the waist down and lie on the table. I’ll need to perform a pelvic exam. I'll minimize the discomfort as much as possible, but please inform me if you experience any pain.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But you better be gentle. And quick! This is mortifyin', you know. Absolutely mortifyin'. I never thought I'd be doin' somethin' like this. Young people these days… always askin' about things you don't wanna talk about. And lookin' at things you don't wanna show… Just hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve noted some mild erythema and discharge. The discharge appears to be thin, yellowish-grey, and has a distinct odor. No obvious lesions or masses were palpated. I suspect a possible bacterial vaginosis, although further testing is required to confirm. I'll order a wet mount and a pH test. We'll have the results back within 24 hours.
PATIENT: Bacterial… what-now? And testing? You’re gonna poke around even more? I knew it. I just knew it. All this trouble for a little leakin’. This is ridiculous. So, what now? Do I just… go home and wait? And what if it's somethin' bad? Don’t tell me I got somethin’ terrible. I got a show next month, remember? Important people! This is a disaster. A complete disaster.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, let's not jump to conclusions. Bacterial vaginosis is a common infection, easily treatable with antibiotics. However, until we have the lab results, I recommend avoiding sexual intercourse and douching. I’ll prescribe a temporary medication to control the odor until we confirm the diagnosis. Here's a prescription for a topical antiseptic wash. Use it twice daily. I'll call you with the results tomorrow. If you experience severe pain, fever, or worsening symptoms, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Topical… antiseptic? Sounds… harsh. And no… fun? This is awful. Fine. No fun. No nothing. Just… this awful smell and this… poke-around business. And I gotta call you? Really? What if I forget? I forget things, you know. Old lady problems. Just… write down the number, alright? And what if it doesn't work? What if I can't go to my show? Just tell me when I need to call and I'll try to remember. It's not a promise, though.
DOCTOR: Here. Call my office tomorrow afternoon for the results. If you don’t hear from us, call by 4 PM. And if, as you say, you forget, the front desk staff can assist you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Genard?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s enough poking and prodding for one day. Just… try not to scare me too much with the results, alright? I’m an artist, not a doctor. I don’t need all this… scientific talk. And if it gets worse… well, I don’t even want to think about it. Just… let me go home. A disaster, I tell you. A complete disaster. And tell your front desk staff to be patient. I’m a little forgetful, you know. .
