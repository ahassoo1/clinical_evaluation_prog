DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ambris. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have all day. It’s my breath. It smells. People have…commented. It’s embarrassing, okay? Is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ambris, that’s perfectly sufficient to start. It sounds quite distressing, and I assure you, we’ll get to the bottom of it. It’s good you’re addressing this. When you say it “smells,” can you describe the odor?
PATIENT: Like…bad breath. What do you want me to say? Rotten? Foul? I’m not a chemist. It just smells awful. And it's not like I want to sniff my own breath all the time, you know? It just…is. Look, I brush, sometimes. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand it's unpleasant to think about, Ms. Ambris, and certainly not something you'd want to focus on. No need to apologize. "Bad breath" is a perfectly good description, and I appreciate your honesty. When you say "sometimes" brush, could you tell me a bit more about your typical oral hygiene routine?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Look, it's not like I have a schedule. I brush when I remember, okay? And sometimes I floss, if I can find the floss. It’s not exactly high on my priority list. I work on the highway, alright? It's hot, I'm tired, things happen. Don't judge.
DOCTOR: I’m not judging at all, Ms. Ambris. It sounds like you have a very demanding job, and I can certainly understand how it would be difficult to maintain a strict routine under those circumstances. Working on the highway is physically taxing. Do you notice the bad breath all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Pretty much all the time. Maybe worse after I eat? I don't know. Like I said, I don't sit around analyzing my breath all day. It's just…there. Constant. It’s annoying, okay? And my ex-husband definitely made enough comments about it before…well, you don’t need to know that. But yeah, always.
DOCTOR: I understand it's frustrating and unpleasant. And you are right, details about your previous relationship aren’t necessary. Thank you for sharing what you’re comfortable with. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the bad breath?
PATIENT: Like what? I don’t have a fever or anything. Just…the smell. And maybe my mouth feels a little dry sometimes? But that's just from being out in the sun all day. It's August, alright? Everyone's mouth is dry. I don't know. Is there a list of symptoms I’m supposed to be checking off? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, not a checklist, Ms. Ambris. Just trying to get a complete picture. Dry mouth is definitely relevant, and common in the heat. It can contribute to bad breath. Now, have you noticed any changes in your sense of taste recently?
PATIENT: Look, I eat roadhouse burgers all day. My sense of taste is probably already ruined. What do you expect? Everything tastes like grease and onions. No, I haven’t noticed anything. Can we just…get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ambris. We’ll get through this as quickly as possible. Just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick examination. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m pretty tough. I work on the highway, remember? Dust, exhaust, weird stuff people throw out of their cars... I’ve built up an immunity to everything. Seriously, I don't have any allergies. Next question.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t really…do that sort of thing. I don’t like taking pills. And vitamins are a waste of money. Look, can we please just figure out how to make this smell go away? This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ambris. That’s our goal. To get to the cause of this and find a solution. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your mouth and throat, if that’s alright with you. It will just take a few moments. I’ll need you to open wide and say “ah.”
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ambris. I’m looking now… I do notice some mild redness of the gums, and your tongue appears slightly coated. There's no obvious sign of any lesions or significant inflammation. Your tonsils appear normal in size. I also note a moderate amount of plaque buildup on your teeth. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your neck to check for any swollen lymph nodes. I don’t feel any significant swelling in your lymph nodes. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs quickly, just to rule out any other potential causes. Your lungs sound clear. Everything sounds normal so far.
PATIENT: So? What does it mean? Is it something serious? Just tell me what I need to do to make it stop smelling. I don’t have time for a medical lecture.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Ambris. It doesn’t appear to be anything serious. Based on the examination, the most likely cause of your bad breath is poor oral hygiene and possibly some mild gum inflammation, coupled with the dry mouth you mentioned. The plaque buildup is contributing to the odor. The good news is, this is very treatable. It’s not a sign of anything more serious. We can improve this with a few changes to your routine. First, I recommend brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, and flossing daily. I know you mentioned it’s difficult, but it makes a significant difference. Second, I’d like you to focus on staying hydrated – drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Third, considering your dry mouth, I recommend using a fluoride mouthwash and sugar-free gum to stimulate saliva production. I also recommend scheduling a cleaning with a dentist. They can remove the plaque buildup and provide personalized advice on oral hygiene. Do you have a dentist you see regularly?
PATIENT: A dentist? No. I haven't been to the dentist in…years. Probably not since before the divorce, honestly. Look, I work on the highway, okay? I don't have time for appointments and expensive cleanings. Is there a pill I can take? Or a spray? Something easy. I'm not changing my whole life for this. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I just wanted something quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Ambris. It sounds like your schedule is very demanding, and finding time for dental appointments can be challenging. While there are sprays and mouthwashes that can temporarily mask the odor, they won’t address the underlying cause. And there isn't a pill to fix this, unfortunately. I strongly recommend prioritizing a dental cleaning. Even a single cleaning can make a huge difference. I can provide you with a list of low-cost dental clinics in the area, if you'd like. We can also discuss some strategies for improving your oral hygiene routine without requiring significant time commitment. In the meantime, I'd like you to start using a fluoride mouthwash twice a day and make a conscious effort to drink more water. Sugar-free gum can also help stimulate saliva production. Would you be open to receiving that list of dental clinics?
PATIENT: Fine. Send me the list. But I’m not promising anything, okay? I still think this is a waste of time. And if it doesn’t work, I’m not coming back. Do we have to fill out a bunch of paperwork for this list? Because if we do, just forget it. I'm already late for my shift. Just…send it. Email is fine. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not. No paperwork. I’ll email you the list of low-cost dental clinics right away. I just need your email address. And I understand your concerns, Ms. Ambris. I truly believe that addressing the underlying cause will make a significant difference. So, to summarize, we’ve discussed the likely cause of your bad breath – poor oral hygiene and dry mouth – and agreed on a plan of action: improving your oral hygiene routine, staying hydrated, and considering a dental cleaning. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just send the email. And I need to go. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m sending that email now. Thank you for coming in, Ms. Ambris. I wish you the best of luck, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care.
