DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, I've just been… weak. Muscles feel like they’re not doing what I tell them to, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now and I figured I should get it checked out. I'd like to get this over with quickly if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. When you say “a little while,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started... maybe six weeks ago? Around the second week of June, I think. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little tiredness after work, but it’s definitely gotten worse since then. I remember because the heat wave started around then too, and I figured it was just that at first. But it hasn't gotten any better with the cooler weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks… and it hasn’t improved with the change in weather. That's helpful to know. And you mentioned tiredness after work – is this weakness present at other times of the day, or is it primarily after exertion?
PATIENT: It’s mostly after work, yeah. I drive a lot for my job – appraising car damage – so I’m in and out of the vehicle all day. Sitting for long periods doesn’t help, and walking around looking at cars... it makes it worse. But even in the evenings, when I’m just relaxing, I feel it a bit. Not as bad, but it's there. Like... trying to lift something light, or even just standing up sometimes. It’s a little embarrassing, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked out, and it’s not uncommon to experience these kinds of symptoms. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. Is the weakness all over, or is it more pronounced in certain areas of your body?
PATIENT: It's… mostly in my legs, I think. And my arms, but not as bad. My legs feel heavy, like they’re filled with cement. And sometimes they tremble a little when I try to stand for too long. My hands feel a bit clumsy too, like I might drop things, but that's not constant. It's definitely worse in my legs, though. That's where I notice it the most.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily in your legs, with some involvement in your arms and hands. And you’ve described a heavy feeling and some trembling. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… Actually, yeah. I’ve been getting headaches, on and off, for a few weeks now. Not terrible, just a dull ache. And I’ve been feeling more thirsty than usual. I figured it was just the weather, but now that I’m thinking about it, maybe it’s connected? I haven’t really told anyone else about the headaches, to be honest. They come and go, so I didn’t think much of it.
DOCTOR: Headaches and increased thirst… those are good things to mention. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – either in how often you’re going, or the color of it?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, actually. I have been going to the bathroom more often. Especially at night, which is annoying. And… the color is lighter, I think. I don't usually pay much attention to that sort of thing, but now that you ask, I think it's paler than usual. It’s definitely not dark, if that makes sense. It's almost clear sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency of urination and paler urine. Thank you for sharing that. Now, to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, thankfully. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football, but that healed up fine. I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone does. No serious illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I haven't been to the doctor in… oh, gosh, probably five years? Just for a check-up, everything was normal then. I try to stay healthy, I really do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history, and a break in medical care for the last five years. That’s good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My dad had high blood pressure, and my mom… she had some problems with her joints when she got older, arthritis, I think. Nothing major on either side, really. No heart disease, no diabetes, nothing like that that I know of. They're both… well, they're both gone now, unfortunately. But I don't recall any major inherited conditions on either side of the family.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your parents. That's helpful information regarding your family history. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone, I work long hours, mostly driving around. I try to eat okay, but it's hard when you're on the road all day. I get fast food sometimes, I'm not gonna lie. I don't drink alcohol, and I don't smoke. I try to walk when I can, but my job doesn’t leave me much time for exercise. I get enough sleep, usually around seven or eight hours a night. That’s about it, really. It's pretty simple, to be honest. I wish I had more time to take care of myself, but work keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That gives me a good overall picture. I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a quick neurological exam to assess your strength, reflexes, and balance. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds alright. Just… please be quick, if you don’t mind? I have a couple of appointments scheduled for this afternoon and I’m already running a bit behind. But yeah, go ahead. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. McKinnon. I'll be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Lungs sound clear. Reflexes are normal, though a little diminished. Strength is slightly reduced in both legs and arms, but not dramatically so. Your gait is a little unsteady.
PATIENT: Okay. Elevated blood pressure… that’s not good. I've been stressed lately, with work and everything. Diminished reflexes and unsteady gait… is that bad? I just want to know what’s going on, honestly. Is this something serious? I really don't have time for anything major right now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. McKinnon. It’s good you’re asking these questions. The reduced reflexes and unsteady gait, combined with the weakness you've described, could indicate a few different things. It's not necessarily something major, but it does warrant further investigation to rule out potential underlying causes. Given your symptoms—the weakness, headaches, increased thirst, paler urine, elevated blood pressure, and the findings from the exam—I think it would be prudent to order some blood tests. I’d like to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. We'll also check your vitamin D levels, as deficiency can sometimes cause similar symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds alright. Blood tests are fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on and get back to work. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back in again? I really don’t have a lot of flexibility in my schedule, so the fewer appointments the better.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand the need for efficiency. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have the nurse contact you with the results as soon as they're available. Depending on the results, we may need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them further. However, I'll try to minimize the need for additional visits if possible. If the results are concerning, we may need to consider a referral to a specialist—a neurologist or an endocrinologist, potentially—but let’s wait and see what the blood tests show first. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated and trying to manage your stress levels as much as possible. Is there anything you do to relax or de-stress?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. Work is pretty much my life. I sometimes watch TV, but it doesn’t really help. I guess I could try to get more sleep, but it's hard when I'm worried about things. I'll try to drink more water though, that's easy enough. And I’ll wait for the results. So… do I need to do anything special before the blood tests? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: That's alright, many people find it difficult to prioritize relaxation. Staying hydrated is a great first step. Yes, for the most accurate results, you'll need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks, just water. You can drink water as needed. We’ll schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning, first thing, so you can have breakfast afterward. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, tomorrow morning works fine. First thing. No food, just water. Got it. I'll try to get a good night's sleep tonight, then. Is there anything else I need to know or do before tomorrow? I really appreciate you getting this sorted out so quickly, Doctor. It eases my mind a bit just knowing what we’re looking at, even if it’s just tests for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. No, there's nothing else you need to do at this time. Just remember to fast for eight hours before the blood draw tomorrow morning. The nurse will give you specific instructions when she calls to confirm your appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—severe headache, dizziness, weakness in one side of your body, or difficulty speaking—please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we'll see what the blood tests reveal tomorrow. Do you have any further questions for me before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Finco. I’ll see you tomorrow. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I’ll see you tomorrow. Have a good evening, and try to get some rest.
