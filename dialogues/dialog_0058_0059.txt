DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. I’m Dr. Todoroovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my speech. It hasn’t been… quite right lately. It’s a bit hard to explain, truthfully. I’m… not entirely sure when it started, exactly. Just that it’s been… slurred, I suppose. My wife noticed it first.
DOCTOR: Slurred speech… okay. And how long has your wife noticed this slurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. A few weeks, maybe? Possibly longer? Time… it gets away from me sometimes. It wasn’t sudden, it just… gradually became more noticeable, she said. I wouldn't be able to say precisely when. Sorry about that.
DOCTOR: It's alright, we'll work with what we have. “Gradually becoming more noticeable” is helpful. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… mostly constant, now. But… I wouldn’t swear to it. There might be times when it’s… less noticeable, when I'm… not as tired, perhaps. But it's there, almost always. It feels… strange to try and pinpoint it. It's just… always a little bit off. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I do. And is this slurring accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well… I’ve been feeling a little… off balance, sometimes. Not falling over or anything, just a bit wobbly. And… my vision’s been a little blurry lately, but I thought that was just because I need new glasses. It's hard to say what's connected, you see. I don't feel particularly unwell, just… these little things.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and feeling off-balance. Any headaches, weakness, numbness, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No headaches, no. And no weakness or numbness, thankfully. Swallowing… I haven’t noticed any difficulty with that. Everything goes down alright, as far as I can tell. Honestly, I mostly just notice the speech and the… wobbly feeling. It's unsettling, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any history of medical conditions – anything at all that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well… I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I had high blood pressure for a bit, a few years ago, but it's been… managed with medication, I believe. And… oh. My wife mentioned something about a small stroke a long time ago, maybe ten years back? It was very minor, I didn't really pay much attention to it, honestly. It didn't leave any lasting effects, as far as I know. Is that important? It feels like a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. A history of stroke, even a minor one, is significant. And you said you’re currently taking medication for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I… believe it’s Lisinopril? A small white pill. I take one every morning, I think. I'm not the best at remembering those sorts of details, honestly. My wife usually makes sure I have it. She's very good at keeping me organised. It's all a bit… hazy, if I’m being truthful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not that I'm aware of, no. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. We… I mean, my wife and I, we don’t really have any allergies. She’s the same. We both eat pretty much anything, to be honest. Nothing springs to mind. I’m sorry if that's not very helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. We're going to do a brief neurological exam, just to assess your reflexes and coordination. It won’t take long. Can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. Just tell me when to look. Is this to see about the wobbliness? It doesn’t feel like much, but it’s… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Yes, it will help us assess the wobbliness, as you say. And also to see how your eyes are tracking. Keep following my finger. Okay, now look at my nose. Good. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Alright, I'm looking. And now at your nose… There. Is that alright? It feels… a bit uneven, perhaps. It's hard to say. It's just… difficult to control, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now stick your tongue out as far as you can. And try to push against my palm with your hands. Both at the same time. Don’t worry, it’s just to check your strength.
PATIENT: Like this? I’m trying, but it feels… a bit weak, honestly. Is it okay if I rest for a moment? My arms are starting to feel tired. It's probably just because I’ve been doing a lot of work lately, lifting things on the construction site.
DOCTOR: Alright. You can rest. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and also check your blood pressure. And after that, I think we should get some blood work done, just to rule out anything else that could be causing these symptoms.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work, you say? Alright. I’m not particularly fond of needles, but… I understand it’s necessary. Do you think… could this be something serious? My wife will be worried, you see. She worries about everything.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively, Adyn. The symptoms you’re describing, combined with your history of stroke, warrant a thorough investigation. The blood work will give us more information. And it's good your wife is attentive; we'll discuss the results with her as well. Let's start with the blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then we'll get the lab order sorted for you. It's best to be cautious, understand?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Cautious is good. Best to know, even if it's not what we want to hear. My wife always says that as well. Go ahead, Doctor. Blood pressure first, you say? I hope it's not too high. All the worrying probably doesn't help.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, we’ll see what it is. Just try to relax your arm. Try not to tense up. Your blood pressure is elevated, 160 over 95. Not dangerously high, but it's something we need to address. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Alright. Elevated, you say? That doesn’t surprise me, with all the stress. And the lifting, of course. My wife keeps telling me I should slow down. Just let me know if anything sounds… strange. I don’t understand much about all this, but I know when things don’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear, no wheezing or crackles. Heart rate is regular. Okay, Adyn. I’m going to order some blood work. It will check your cholesterol, kidney function, blood sugar, and rule out any signs of infection. I also want to get a CT scan of your brain. It's to rule out any new strokes or other structural issues. It's a lot, I know, but it’s best to be thorough. We need to understand what’s causing these symptoms.
PATIENT: A CT scan… Is that… is that serious? Will it show something bad? I… I’m not good with scans. The last time I had one… it wasn't pleasant. It's just… a lot to take in. My wife… she'll be worried sick. Can we at least talk to her before you order it? Just to explain everything?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, and absolutely. We will talk to your wife before proceeding with the CT scan. It’s standard practice to involve family in these decisions, and it’s important she feels informed. The CT scan will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on in your brain. It’s not necessarily indicative of anything bad, but it’s a vital step in the diagnostic process. It helps us rule out possibilities and pinpoint the cause of your symptoms. I’ll page your wife now. And then we can discuss everything together. In the meantime, I'll print out the lab order for you, so you can see exactly what tests we're running.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that makes me feel a bit better. Knowing she’ll be involved… it’s good. It's just… all this talk of strokes and scans… it brings back memories. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It’s… reassuring, to know you’re being thorough. My wife… she’ll have questions, I’m sure. She always does. But… yes. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Adyn. It’s my job to explain things clearly and address your concerns. Your wife’s questions are good questions. It's important we cover everything. I'll let her know you’re ready, and she can come in whenever she's available. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re taking all the necessary steps to get to the bottom of this. And please, let me know if anything changes or if you have any other concerns before your wife arrives.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I will. I suppose… I'll just sit here and wait for my wife, then. Try not to think too much… that's always easier said than done. .
