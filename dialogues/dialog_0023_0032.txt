DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s a rather… delicate matter. I’m not accustomed to discussing such things, you understand. My wife, bless her heart, insisted I come. There’s… a bit of discharge. It’s… unpleasant. I wouldn't expect you to understand the discomfort, but it’s been going on for… some time now, I believe. Though, truthfully, time does seem to slip away these days.
DOCTOR: A discharge, you say. And you’ve noticed this for some time now… can you be more specific about how long?
PATIENT: Specific… yes, well, that’s the trouble, isn’t it? It’s… difficult to recall precisely. Perhaps… a month? Maybe two? It all blurs together after a while, you see. It's not as if I’m keeping a calendar of such… occurrences. It just is. And it’s bothersome, naturally. Though, I suspect it’s nothing serious. Old age, probably. Things simply… wear out, don’t they?
DOCTOR: While things can change with age, Mr. Krok, it’s important to investigate any new or unusual symptoms. “Wearing out,” as you put it, doesn’t always explain these things. Now, can you describe the discharge to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Good heavens. It’s… well, it’s liquid, of course. And… not entirely clear. A bit… yellowish, I suppose. Though I’m hardly an expert on such matters. And there’s a… slight odour. Not terrible, mind you, but noticeable. Honestly, Doctor, I find the whole thing rather undignified. One doesn't expect these sorts of problems at my age. It's… embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Yellowish discharge with a slight odour. Is it accompanied by any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: No, no pain, thankfully. Not burning, either. And… I don’t believe so, no itching. Though, my skin does get a bit dry these days, so it’s difficult to say with certainty. It’s… more of a general discomfort, really. A sort of… unclean feeling. And, truthfully, the worry is perhaps the worst of it. My wife is quite insistent on these things, you see. She’s a good woman, but… she does tend to fuss. I’m quite sure it’s nothing of consequence.
DOCTOR: I understand your wife is concerned. However, even without pain, a discharge warrants investigation. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmmm. Let me see. Well, my appetite hasn't been what it once was, but that’s hardly new. And I’ve been… a bit more tired lately. But again, age, you see. Everything slows down eventually. Oh… and I suppose I’ve been visiting the lavatory a bit more frequently. But that could be the tea, I suspect. I do enjoy a good cup of tea. No, I can’t think of anything else significant. Honestly, Doctor, I doubt this is anything serious. A minor irritation, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed systematically. Now, let's discuss your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Past medical history… well, now that’s a question. I’ve lived a long life, you see. I’ve had the usual… colds, flu, a bit of arthritis in my knees. Nothing major, thankfully. Oh, and the doctor removed my appendix when I was a young man, stationed in… somewhere. I don’t recall the details precisely. My wife would know more about that, I suspect. She keeps all the records. No, I can’t recall any serious illnesses or diagnoses. I've always been a rather robust fellow, until recently, of course. This… discharge is most perplexing.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries besides the appendectomy?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. There was… a small procedure on my prostate, many years ago. It was quite common, I believe, for men of my generation. Something about… enlargement. Yes, that was it. But it was a simple affair, nothing to worry about. I don't recall the year, truthfully. My wife handles all those details. No, I can’t think of any other surgeries. Really, Doctor, I’ve been quite fortunate in my health, all things considered. This recent… matter is rather unsettling, as it’s something entirely new.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… a complicated matter. My father… he lived to a good age, I believe. But I don’t recall any specific illnesses. He was a farmer, you see, a strong, silent man. My mother… she passed away when I was young. I don’t recall much about her health, truthfully. We didn’t discuss such things openly in those days. And my siblings… well, they’ve all passed on now. I’m the last one left, you see. No, I can’t really offer you much in the way of family history, Doctor. It’s all rather… hazy, I’m afraid. Though, there was an uncle, I think, who had something… a heart ailment, perhaps? But that was many years ago, and I don't recall the details precisely. It’s all rather irrelevant, don’t you think? This is about me, after all.
DOCTOR: While it may seem irrelevant, family history can sometimes provide valuable clues. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… yes, let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. I believe my wife calls it… Lisinopril, perhaps? And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it for my bones. And… yes, I occasionally take an antacid for indigestion. After a particularly rich meal, you see. No, that’s all I can think of, Doctor. Nothing major, I assure you. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. They always seem to have unpleasant side effects, you see. And, truthfully, I sometimes forget to take them altogether. My wife reminds me, of course. She’s very good about these things. It’s just… this whole situation is rather unsettling. A discharge at my age? It’s most peculiar.
DOCTOR: And finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve always been a rather robust fellow. I eat almost anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medications. I’ve occasionally been bitten by a mosquito, of course, but that’s hardly an allergy. And I’ve never had any problems with pollen or dust. No, I’m not allergic to anything, Doctor. Honestly, I find all this questioning rather… excessive. I came to you about a discharge, not a complete medical history. It’s a minor irritation, I assure you. My wife simply worries too much. It’s all rather… unnecessary. Perhaps a simple cream would suffice?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, dismissing your concerns or attributing them solely to your wife’s worry is not a responsible approach to your health. A discharge, coupled with changes in your appetite and bowel habits, requires a thorough examination. I need to perform a physical exam to assess the situation properly. This is not optional. Now, if you'll please, I'd like you to lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Examination? Good heavens, Doctor. At my age? Really, I find that rather… intrusive. And unnecessary, I assure you. I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve never needed a thorough examination for something as trivial as a discharge. I came here seeking reassurance, not a… a physical inspection. And frankly, I’m not comfortable with the idea. Perhaps a second opinion would be in order? I'm quite sure it's nothing serious, and this whole process is causing me undue stress. I'd prefer to simply be given a cream, and be on my way. It's all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I understand your discomfort, but I am obligated to provide you with the best possible care, and that requires a physical assessment. Refusing a necessary examination is not in your best interest, and it hinders my ability to determine the cause of your symptoms. I am not suggesting anything is serious, but we cannot make assumptions without proper investigation. Now, I will be frank. Based on what you've told me—the changes in appetite, bowel habits, and the discharge—there are several possibilities that need to be ruled out, including, but not limited to, a urinary tract infection, prostate issues, or even more concerning conditions. A simple cream will not address the underlying cause and could potentially mask a serious problem. I am a physician, and my role is to assess, diagnose, and treat. I will proceed with a focused examination, with a chaperone present if you wish. If you remain unwilling, I must respectfully decline to provide further treatment. It is your decision, but I strongly urge you to reconsider. Now, will you allow me to proceed with the examination?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But I must insist… a chaperone. My wife would have come with me, but she had a bridge appointment. It’s… most unsettling, you understand. And please, be gentle. I'm a rather… delicate man, despite my age. And do explain everything as you go along, I don't want any surprises. Honestly, Doctor, I find this whole ordeal rather… undignified. But if it's absolutely necessary… proceed. But gently, please. Very gently.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns, and I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. I will explain each step of the examination as I proceed. I’ll also have the nurse come in as a chaperone. Please lie down on the examination table, and we’ll begin. Nurse, could you please come in here for a moment?
