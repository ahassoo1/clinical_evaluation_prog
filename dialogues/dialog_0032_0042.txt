DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Kammann is fine, please. Well, I’m getting on in years, you see. Figured it was time to… well, make sure everything’s still ticking like it should. My daughter, bless her heart, kept on me about a “men’s health optimization visit.” She does a lot of research online. Thought I oughta get checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, preventative care is always a good idea, Mr. Kammann. Though I prefer to call it a comprehensive health assessment. Your daughter sounds… conscientious. Let's start with a bit of your history, shall we?
PATIENT: Conscientious is a nice way to put it. She worries. Always has. History, you say? Alright. I was born right here in Oklahoma, back in '56. Cherokee Nation, on my mama’s side. Lived here most of my life, except for a few years when I was in the service. Didn't see much fighting, mostly did paperwork, thankfully. Worked as an etcher and engraver all my life. Steady work, good with my hands. Lost my wife, Martha, five years back. Cancer. That was… rough.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m sorry for your loss, Mr. Kammann. That must have been very difficult. Let's focus on your medical background, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Mostly just the usual childhood stuff – measles, chickenpox, things like that. Had my appendix out when I was a boy, that’s about it. Never broken a bone, thank the Lord. I had a bout of pneumonia about ten years back, but bounced back pretty quick. Nothing major, nothing that required a long stay in the hospital. And I get regular checkups with my dentist, of course. Always have.
DOCTOR: Very good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mama lived to be 92. She was a strong woman, worked hard her whole life. She had some trouble with her joints in her later years, arthritis mostly. My daddy… he passed away when I was young, heart trouble, they said. Didn’t live to see fifty. I’ve got a daughter, like I mentioned. Healthy as a horse, thankfully. And a grandson, little Timmy. He’s eight. He keeps me young, that boy.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Mr. Kammann?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything the doctors gave me. Sometimes a little bit of itching with penicillin, but nothing serious. And I’m not allergic to any foods, not that I've discovered. I eat just about anything, though I try to go easy on the sweets these days. Martha used to bake the best pies, and I’ve still got a bit of a sweet tooth.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees. They ache a bit, especially when the weather gets cold. It's called… hmm. Let me think. It's a glucosamine and chondroitin supplement, that's it. And sometimes I’ll take a little ibuprofen when they’re really bothering me. Nothing else, Doc. Promise. I try to avoid pills whenever I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, let me ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My daddy smoked, and it didn't do him any good. Always figured it was a bad habit. And I don’t drink much either. Maybe a beer or two with dinner on a special occasion, that's it. Mostly, I just like to keep busy. I spend a lot of time in my workshop, working on my etchings. Keeps my hands and my mind occupied.
DOCTOR: And finally, have there been any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Not really. I've always been about this size, give or take a few pounds. Maybe put on a little during the winter months when I'm not as active, but it usually comes off in the spring. I try to eat healthy, like my daughter always tells me, but I do enjoy a good meal now and then. I think I’m holding steady at around 175, maybe 180. It’s hard to say exactly. I don’t weigh myself every day.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds as though you’ve lived a reasonably healthy life, Mr. Kammann. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. We’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. If you could just roll up your sleeve…
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doc. Perfectly alright. A little cold, maybe? Always get a shiver when the cuff goes on.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not concerning at this stage. Heart rate is 76, regular rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your ears, nose, and throat.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Always did trust Doc Pipkorn's ears. Anything lookin' amiss? I sometimes get a little wax buildup, that's all. Otherwise, I feel pretty sturdy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Mild cerumen impaction bilaterally, but no signs of infection or inflammation. Nasal mucosa slightly congested, but no significant lesions or polyps. Throat is clear, no tonsillar enlargement or exudates. Everything appears normal so far, Mr. Kammann. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart again, and then I’ll need to check your prostate. I’ll explain the procedure before we begin, and you can let me know if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Prostate, huh? Always did think those exams were a bit… personal. But alright, Doc. If you think it’s necessary. Explain it to me again, if you would. Don't mind my askin', just want to know what to expect. It’s been a while since I’ve had one of those.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammann. A digital rectal exam – DRE – allows me to assess the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate gland. It’s a routine part of a men’s health assessment, and it can help detect any abnormalities, such as enlargement or tenderness. You’ll be asked to lean forward on the examination table, and I’ll gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to palpate the prostate. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. It only takes a few seconds. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A few seconds, you say? Alright. Sounds… straightforward enough, I suppose. I always did hate doctors stickin’ fingers where they don’t belong, but if it’s important… No, I don’t think I have any questions. Let’s just… get it over with, then. The quicker the better, I reckon.
DOCTOR: The prostate is enlarged, but smooth and symmetrical. No nodules or areas of tenderness were palpated. Now, I’d like to order a few lab tests to get a more complete picture of your health. Specifically, I’d like to check your complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, lipid panel, and PSA level. The PSA test will help us assess your prostate health further. We’ll also perform a urinalysis to check for any signs of infection or other abnormalities. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Sounds thorough. PSA... that’s the prostate one, right? My wife, Martha, she... she had a lot of tests. No, I don't think so, Doc. Just tell me what I need to do. Where do I go, what do I need to bring? I’ll get it done. Just want to know the practical stuff.
DOCTOR: Certainly. You’ll need to schedule an appointment with the lab at Central Hospital. You don’t need to fast for the complete blood count or lipid panel, but you do need to fast for at least eight hours before the lipid panel. The urinalysis is a simple collection; they’ll provide you with a cup and instructions. You’ll need to bring your insurance card and a photo ID. I’ll fax the lab order directly to them. Do you have any difficulty with transportation?
PATIENT: No, no trouble with gettin’ there. My daughter, she usually helps me out with things like that. She likes to fuss over me, make sure I'm taken care of. Insurance card and ID… got those tucked away safe and sound. Fast for eight hours, you said? Alright, I can manage that. Maybe I’ll just have a light supper tonight. Anything else, Doc? Or are we just about done here?
DOCTOR: We’re almost finished, Mr. Kammann. Based on the preliminary results of our examination and the lab tests I’ve ordered, I’m not overly concerned at this time. However, it's essential to monitor your prostate health, given its mild enlargement. I’ll review the lab results as soon as they become available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any changes in your urinary habits, such as difficulty urinating, frequent urination, or blood in your urine, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Monitor it, watch for changes... got it. My daughter will probably make a list. She's good at that sort of thing. You’ve been real thorough, Doc Pipkorn. I appreciate you takin' your time. It’s good to know someone's lookin' after things. Alright, then. I reckon I’ll be headin’ home. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Kammann. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and drive safely.
