DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. My husband... he made me come. Something about... learning? I don't really remember what he said. Something about... being healthy? It's all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's...certainly a reason to be here. So, let's put your husband aside for a moment. You are here now. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Not really. I mean, my back aches sometimes... from work, you know? Sheet metal isn’t easy. But everyone aches. It’s normal. I just… take some pills. The red ones. Or maybe the white ones. I forget which ones help more.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Some pills, red or white.” That's… not ideal, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s important to know exactly what you're taking. Do you happen to have a list of your medications with you?
PATIENT: Medications... list? No. I don’t write things down. My husband usually handles all that. He keeps everything… somewhere. I just take what he gives me when I need it. It's easier that way. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, since your husband manages your medications, it makes things…difficult. We really need to identify those pills to ensure you're taking the correct dosage and avoiding any potential interactions. Let’s try this: can you describe when you take these pills?
PATIENT: When? Uh… when it hurts. Mostly when I’ve been bending a lot at work. Or lifting heavy things. Sometimes before bed if my back is really bad. I just… take enough to get by. It works, okay? I'm still able to do my job.
DOCTOR: "Enough to get by" isn’t a dosage, Ms. Fontanazza. And relying on pain to dictate your medication is... concerning. Alright, let's move on. Besides the back pain and whatever pills your husband gives you, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No, not really. I get tired, of course. Everyone gets tired working all day. And my hands sometimes feel… numb. But that's just from the metal, right? All that bending and twisting. It can't be anything else. I just need to push through it. I don't have time for…problems.
DOCTOR: “Pushing through it” can lead to more serious issues, Ms. Fontanazza. Numbness in your hands, coupled with fatigue and pain, warrants a more thorough investigation. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Exam? I don’t really like doctors poking around. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? And how long will this take? My husband is expecting me… soon. I told him I wouldn't be gone long. I don’t want him to be angry.
DOCTOR: It won't be anything extensive, Ms. Fontanazza. Just a basic assessment of your back, hands, and reflexes. It’s necessary to rule out anything serious. And frankly, your husband shouldn’t be dictating your healthcare decisions. Now, if you’ll please…have a seat on the examination table. We'll start with your back.
PATIENT: Fine. But if it gets too uncomfortable, I’m stopping. And don't expect me to remember anything you say. My memory isn’t what it used to be. And please, be quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. I'm going to listen to your back, then I’ll need you to bend forward and touch your toes. Can you tell me where exactly the pain is located?
PATIENT: The pain…it’s everywhere, really. But mostly…down here. And it goes down my leg sometimes. Not all the time, just when I’ve been working really hard. And bending? That always makes it worse. Don't press too hard, okay? I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm noting some tenderness in the lumbar region, particularly on the left side. And yes, I see some guarding when I apply pressure. Range of motion is limited in both flexion and extension. And I'm detecting some decreased reflexes in your lower extremities. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. Can you open and close your hands for me?
PATIENT: It hurts…a little. Especially when I squeeze. I do a lot of gripping at work, you know? Bending metal, holding tools… it's hard on the hands. They just… ache all the time. They used to be stronger.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noting some mild swelling and tenderness in your finger joints, along with a slight decrease in grip strength. This, combined with your back pain and numbness, is…concerning. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed…? Hmm. Not that I remember. My husband handles all the doctor stuff. He tells me what I need to know. I think… maybe something with my blood pressure a long time ago? But he said it was nothing serious. He gave me some pills for it. Red ones, I think. Or white? I can never remember. It was years ago. A long, long time ago. I don't really keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, this is incredibly frustrating. We need to get a clear picture of your medical history, and relying on your husband’s memory isn't sufficient. Do you have any idea when you last had a blood pressure check?
PATIENT: Um… I really don't know. A while ago, I guess. Maybe… last year? Or the year before? My husband usually takes me when he thinks I need to go. He’s very good at knowing these things. He worries a lot. I just… trust him to take care of it. It’s easier that way. I don't like doctors, and he knows that.
