DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's… family history, mostly. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… well, a lot of things. And my mother is starting to… forget things, you know? It's probably nothing, but I’d just like to be sure I’m okay. I teach engineering, and I need to be on top of things. Can't be… distracted.
DOCTOR: “A lot of things,” you say. Well, that’s… vague. We’ll get to your concerns about you shortly. But let’s start with your grandmother. Can you be more specific about what she was diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Look, my mother wasn’t… the most organized person. And my grandmother… well, she didn’t exactly go to doctors unless she absolutely had to. There was… something with her memory, obviously. And something with her heart. And… arthritis, I think? She was old. Old people get things. It was just… a lot of appointments toward the end. Honestly, I’m not a doctor. I just know it was enough to worry my mother, and now she’s… starting to misplace things. It’s probably just age, but I don't want to end up like that.
DOCTOR: Right. “Something with her memory.” That’s… not particularly helpful, Mr. Theriot. Was it diagnosed as dementia?
PATIENT: Dementia? I… I don’t know. Honestly, my mother would have said “getting old.” She wasn’t one for labels. I really doubt anyone ever actually said dementia. It was just… she’d repeat herself, forget where she put things, that sort of thing. It was more… annoying than anything, to be perfectly frank. Look, I’m a logical person. I deal with facts and figures. This is… feelings and vague memories. It's frustrating. Can we just… check me over? I need to know if I’m going to have problems.
DOCTOR: While I understand your frustration, Mr. Theriot, a thorough medical evaluation requires more than just your desire to be “checked over.” Family history is crucially important, and your lack of specific information makes it difficult to assess your risk accurately. However, fine. We can proceed with a basic exam, but I’ll need you to answer my questions as precisely as possible. First, let's talk about you. Any history of headaches, dizziness, or changes in vision?
PATIENT: Headaches? No, not really. I get them occasionally, like anyone does, if I'm stressed. But nothing… consistent. Dizziness… maybe a little when I stand up too fast, but that’s just… low blood pressure, I think. My mother has that too. Vision… no. I wear glasses, but my prescription hasn’t changed in years. I need to be able to see to do my job, you know? I can't be messing around with blurry schematics. Is this getting somewhere, or are we just going in circles?
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant headaches, occasional dizziness upon standing, stable vision with corrective lenses. Good. Let’s move on to neurological symptoms. Have you experienced any weakness, numbness, tingling, or difficulty with coordination?
PATIENT: Difficulty with coordination? No! Absolutely not. I build things. Precise things. I need a steady hand. I’m an engineer, remember? Weakness… no. Numbness… maybe sometimes my fingers get a little cold, but that’s just the air conditioning in the lab. It’s always freezing in there. Look, I’m perfectly capable. I’m not… falling apart. This is starting to feel… insulting. Are you looking for something specific? Because I’m telling you, I’m fine.
DOCTOR: Insulting?
PATIENT: It just… it feels like you’re expecting something to be wrong. I came here because of my family, not because I think I’m suddenly going to collapse. I’m perfectly healthy. I eat well, I exercise, I have a demanding job that keeps my mind sharp. I’m just being… proactive. Isn't that what people do? Look, I’m sorry if I seem… impatient. It’s just… my time is valuable. I have lectures to prepare, and students who need my attention. Can we just get this over with? A quick check-up and a reassurance that I'm not going to end up like my grandmother, and I'll be on my way.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Theriot. I understand your concerns and your time constraints. However, dismissing potential issues based on your subjective feeling of well-being is not sound medical practice. Since you insist, we'll proceed with a brief neurological exam. I'll assess your reflexes, balance, and cognitive function. But I need you to cooperate and answer my questions truthfully. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Yes, fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. And please, no complicated tests. I have things to do. I’ll answer your questions. But I’m telling you now, everything is perfectly normal. Just… prove it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your reflexes. Please sit comfortably and relax your legs. I’m going to test your knee-jerk reflex. Just let your leg fall when I tap it.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. This is a little… undignified.
DOCTOR: Right leg… good response. Now, left leg. Good response there as well. Symmetrical and within normal limits. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes. I’m following it. Is this… necessary? It feels like a… distraction test.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I want you to close your eyes. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: 2025. Obviously. Is this really going to take long? I have a graduate student waiting for me. A very important one.
DOCTOR: Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards.
PATIENT: D… L… R… O… W. Is that correct? Look, I’m an engineer, not a… a spelling bee champion. I deal with algorithms and structural integrity, not… backwards spelling.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, can you repeat these three words after me: apple, table, penny. Apple. Table. Penny.
PATIENT: Apple. Table. Penny. Look, this is… pointless. Can we just get to the… conclusion? I’m perfectly fine, and I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. Based on this brief exam, your neurological function appears grossly intact. However, your responses were… somewhat hesitant, and you exhibit a clear aversion to the testing process. Given your family history and your expressed concerns, I recommend a more comprehensive evaluation to rule out any subtle cognitive decline. I'm referring you to a neurologist for a full cognitive assessment and potential MRI of the brain. Would you like me to schedule that for you?
PATIENT: An MRI? Really? Look, I’m telling you, this is a waste of time and money. My grandmother was old. This is… overreacting. No. Absolutely not. I do not need to see a neurologist. I came here for reassurance, not for a battery of unnecessary tests. I think I’ll just… manage my own expectations, thank you very much. I'm perfectly capable of monitoring myself. I think I’m done here. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Theriot. However, I must document your refusal of recommended medical advice. Please be aware that delaying diagnosis can have significant consequences. I strongly urge you to reconsider. If you experience any changes in your cognitive function, memory, or coordination, please seek immediate medical attention. Here is a summary of our visit for your records. .
