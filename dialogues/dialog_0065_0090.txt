DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe it’s a clearance appointment? To make sure I’m healthy enough, that is. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so forgive me if I’m not very clear.
DOCTOR: A surgery clearance appointment. Right. Well, let’s start with what surgery are you scheduled for, if you recall. And who is the surgeon?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the surgeon’s name… it’s slipping my mind. I think it was Dr. Ramirez? But I’m not entirely certain. It’s… a facial procedure. Something to do with… lifting, I believe? My husband… he arranged it all. It was his idea, really. He… passed away last year, so I don’t have all the details readily available. I apologize. It's terribly frustrating not to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see if we can find the details in your records. "Facial lifting procedure… scheduled with Dr. Ramirez, plastic surgery… confirmed appointment August 15th." That confirms it. Now, Ms. Brightful, beyond the surgery itself, what specifically made you decide to pursue this now?
PATIENT: Well… my husband, bless his heart, he always said I deserved to feel beautiful. He noticed I… wasn’t myself after… everything. He said it would lift my spirits as much as my face. And, truthfully, I… I do want that. I want to feel like me again. It’s been a difficult year, and… perhaps this will help. I’m not sure, but I’m willing to try.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s commendable that you’re taking steps to focus on your well-being. Before we proceed with the clearance, I need to gather some information about your overall health. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure. My husband handled most of the doctor’s appointments. I think I was always fairly healthy. Perhaps a little bit of high blood pressure at one point, but it wasn’t anything serious. He had me on… a small pill, I believe. But beyond that… I don’t recall anything significant. I apologize again for my lack of precision. Is there a way to find this information in your records?
DOCTOR: Let’s see… Yes, here we are. History of essential hypertension, diagnosed approximately five years ago, currently managed with Lisinopril 10mg daily. Last blood pressure check was… December of last year, 138/82. Not ideal, but not alarming. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that rings a bell. My husband always made sure I took it. Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. No food allergies, no reactions to penicillin or anything like that. But… you know, it’s possible. It's hard to be certain. Perhaps it’s best to be cautious?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known drug allergies. Good. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the Lisinopril, I believe. Oh! Wait. My friend, Elena, she gave me some… something for my sleep. It’s… a natural remedy, she said. Something with chamomile and lavender, I think? I only take it when I’m having trouble sleeping, which has been… often lately. It's not a regular thing, but… yes, that's it. Just the Lisinopril and the sleep aid, occasionally.
DOCTOR: A sleep aid with chamomile and lavender. And you only take it as needed. Alright. Now, let's briefly go over your surgical history. Have you had any surgeries or procedures in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, I remember that vividly. And… oh! I had a small mole removed from my back a few years ago. It was nothing major, just a routine procedure. Aside from that… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing significant, anyway. My husband would have mentioned it, surely.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child and mole removal. Noted. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question. My mother… she passed away when I was young, from… I believe it was heart problems. And my father… he had diabetes, I think? But he also smoked heavily, so it's hard to say what was the cause. On my husband’s side… his mother had some sort of cancer, but I don't recall what kind. I'm afraid my memory isn’t very helpful. I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: That's alright. We'll work with what we have. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. Never. My husband… he didn’t approve of any of that. And truthfully, neither do I. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions – and I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I pride myself on living a clean and healthy lifestyle, as much as I can, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, I'd like to get a better understanding of your current state of health. Are you experiencing any pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, or any other unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… I have been rather tired lately, I must admit. More tired than usual. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little bit short of breath, especially when I’m walking uphill. But I just assumed it was due to… the stress, I suppose. And… honestly, just getting older. I wouldn’t say it’s pain, exactly, but… I feel generally unwell, if that makes sense. A bit run down. Is that concerning?
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me. Fatigue and shortness of breath are always worth investigating. Okay, Ms. Brightful, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, lungs, and a general assessment. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed at your own pace. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 142/88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Heart rate is 78, regular rhythm, a faint murmur noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but with slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Pulses are regular and present. Overall, you appear mildly fatigued. I'm going to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of your health. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. We also need an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An EKG… and more blood work? Oh dear. That sounds… thorough. Yes, Doctor, if you think it’s necessary, please proceed. I want to be as prepared as possible for this surgery. A little worried about the murmur, though… is that serious? I suppose my husband would want me to get everything checked out. Yes, please do all the tests. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: The murmur is something we need to investigate further, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem. The EKG and blood work will help us determine the cause. As for preparation, please fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. You can drink water, but no food. For the EKG, just wear comfortable clothing. The technician will place some electrodes on your chest to monitor your heart’s activity. It's a painless procedure. I will also order a chest x-ray to get a clearer view of your lungs. I'll have the lab requisition and imaging orders sent to the front desk. They will schedule the appointments for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan for your surgery clearance. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Eight to twelve hours… That’s quite a long fast. And a chest x-ray… it seems like a lot, Doctor. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. No, I don't think so, not at the moment. Just… when do you think I’ll have the results? I’m anxious to get this all sorted out so I can move forward. Thank you for being so thorough, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The lab typically takes 24-48 hours to process the blood work, and the imaging reports usually come back within a few days. We should have everything back by the end of the week. I will review the results and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant fatigue, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I understand. Chest pain, shortness of breath… I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you. I think… I think that’s all for now. I appreciate your time and patience. It’s all a little… overwhelming, but I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Brightful, I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. The front desk will assist you with scheduling any necessary follow-up appointments. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day. And please try not to worry too much. We're just being thorough to ensure you are in the best possible condition for your surgery. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Duplichan. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll try to remain calm. And yes, I will contact the office if anything changes. Have a good day to you as well. .
