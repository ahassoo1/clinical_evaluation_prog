DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… well, my husband suggested I come. He’s been reading about these… documents. About what happens if one is… unable to speak for oneself. Something about making sure my wishes are known. He thinks I should have one of these forms filled out. I confess, I hadn't given it much thought, but he’s quite insistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your husband is referring to advance directives – things like a living will or durable power of attorney for healthcare. It's very responsible of him to think ahead, and it's good you're here to discuss it. Before we dive into that, though, let's just do a quick check-in on your overall health. Are you experiencing any health problems at the moment?
PATIENT: Health problems? No, not problems, exactly. I get a bit tired, naturally. I am a woman of a certain age, and I teach, which is… draining. And my back sometimes aches after standing for too long grading papers. But nothing that requires a doctor, if you understand me. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy for my years. It's simply… preventative, this visit.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's always good to be proactive. Fatigue and back pain are common, especially with a demanding job like teaching. We should still document those, though, just to have a complete picture. When you say tired, is it a general feeling of being run down, or more like you’re struggling to stay awake during the day?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor, must we go into such detail? It's tiredness. One gets tired. It's not a complex medical mystery. I am not collapsing in the street, if that's what you are implying. My husband worries too much, you see. He reads things on the internet and then assumes the worst. It’s a waste of both our time to catalogue every minor discomfort. I came about the form, not a thorough examination of my… energy levels.
DOCTOR: You're right, of course. My apologies. I just want to be thorough. Let's focus on the advance directives then. Have you ever discussed these types of documents with anyone before, or is this a completely new topic for you?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. My husband brought it up a week ago. Said we needed to “get our affairs in order.” He’s always been a bit… dramatic. Honestly, I barely know what it means to have an advance directive. He said something about naming someone to make decisions for me if I… well, if I couldn't. Is that correct? It sounds rather morbid, doesn’t it? I prefer to not dwell on such unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: It’s not morbid at all, Marija, it’s empowering. It’s about you having control, even when you’re unable to speak for yourself. Your husband is right – it involves naming someone you trust to make healthcare decisions if you become incapacitated. We call that person a healthcare proxy. It also might involve writing down what kinds of treatments you would or wouldn’t want. Do you have any particular concerns about this process?
PATIENT: Concerns? Yes, several. Firstly, I don't want to think about being unable to speak. It’s a depressing thought. Secondly, I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions, thank you very much. And thirdly… frankly, I find the whole idea rather intrusive. Asking someone to decide what happens to me… it seems a bit much, doesn't it? It implies I won’t be able to articulate my wishes, which I find… insulting. My husband is trying to control everything, even my potential medical care.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Marija. It sounds like you feel strongly about maintaining your independence and control, and that your husband may be overstepping a bit. It's perfectly valid to feel that way. These documents aren’t about taking away your ability to make decisions; they’re about ensuring your wishes are honored if you are ever in a situation where you can’t express them yourself. Perhaps we can talk about what it would take for you to feel comfortable with this process. Maybe starting small, with just naming a healthcare proxy, and postponing the details of what treatments you'd want or not want, would be less overwhelming?
PATIENT: Naming someone… that’s a bit easier, I suppose. It’s still unpleasant, but… less so. My sister, Fatima, is very sensible. She’s a retired accountant, quite organized. She would ask the right questions, I imagine, and not let the doctors… rush me into anything. Yes, I suppose I could name her. But I want to be very clear: this is solely for the sake of avoiding further… arguments with my husband. I am not making any grand pronouncements about my future health. It’s a practical matter, nothing more.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Marija. It sounds like Fatima would be a good choice. And it's good that you're approaching this as a practical matter. We'll document that this is your decision, made to alleviate concerns and avoid disagreements. Now, just to be thorough, and to ensure Fatima knows what she’s agreeing to, we’ll need her contact information. Do you have that readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. She lives in Casablanca, but she has a mobile number. Let me see… It’s 212… 661… 874… 3291. And her email address is fatima.benmoussa@… well, it’s a very long address, I don’t recall it exactly. She prefers telephone calls, anyway. She’s not very… modern.
DOCTOR: Okay, I have her number. We'll send her a brief form outlining her responsibilities as your healthcare proxy. She’ll need to sign it and return it to us. It's a fairly simple document, mostly confirming she understands she's authorized to make decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to. Before we finish, just one quick question: Do you have any allergies to medications or any medical conditions we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, nothing significant. I occasionally get a mild rash from certain perfumes, but that’s hardly a medical condition. And as I said before, I am generally healthy. No chronic illnesses, no heart problems, nothing of the sort. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like you are trying to find something wrong with me. I came for the form, not a full medical examination. Perhaps we should just focus on that?
DOCTOR: You’re right to call me out on that, Marija. I apologize. I got caught up in being thorough and perhaps overstepped a bit. You came for the advance directive, and that’s what we should focus on. We have Fatima’s number, and we'll send her the form. Once she returns it, this process will be complete. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… satisfactory. As long as my husband is finally satisfied, I am willing to go along with it. Though I still maintain it's all rather unnecessary. Now, is there anything else? I have a faculty meeting this afternoon, and I really must be going.
DOCTOR: No, that’s all, Marija. I'll have the form sent to Fatima today. Thank you for coming in, and I apologize again for pushing a bit too hard. If any questions arise on either side, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good afternoon, and a productive faculty meeting.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. And yes, a productive meeting would be most welcome. Perhaps I won’t need to return.
