DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Pavlovic, is it?
PATIENT: Pavlovec, actually. Yes, that’s me. Though… folks call me Brodie. It's been a long time since anyone asked my full name, to be honest. What was that now? Something about a cough? My chest… feels a bit tight sometimes. It’s been going on… well, a while. I don’t rightly remember when it started.
DOCTOR: Pavlovec. Right. Well, Brodie, a “while” isn’t terribly helpful when I’m trying to understand what’s going on. Let's try to narrow it down. Has this tightness been getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. I suppose… maybe a little? It’s hard to say. Days are all sort of blending together these days. I mostly stay inside, you see. Not much… activity. But yes, I think it takes a bit more effort to breathe sometimes. Especially when I try to do… anything. Even just walking to the kitchen. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: “A bit more effort” is… vague. Do you find yourself short of breath?
PATIENT: Short of breath… Sometimes. Not all the time. It’s more like… a dryness. A tickle. Makes me cough, and then I’m a little winded. But it doesn’t happen with every cough, you understand. It’s… frustrating. It just is. I don't know if that makes any sense. It feels like something's stuck, but there's nothing to stick. Old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long have you been experiencing this… "dryness" and cough?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a tricky one. I… I lost my wife, Mai, a few years back now. Before that, things were… busier. I was still working in the shop, fixing cars. I think it started around then, maybe? Or maybe a little before. It was after she got sick, definitely. Before… before the funeral. It’s hard to keep track. Everything feels… blurry. I don't mean to be difficult, doctor. It’s just… time slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: So, several years. And has anything specifically made it worse?
PATIENT: Not that I can recall. Dust, maybe? Working with cars… there was always dust. But I’ve been retired a long time now. I mostly just sit. Watch TV. Try not to bother anyone. The cold air sometimes makes it worse, I suppose. Winter’s hard on my chest. But then again, winter’s hard on everyone, isn’t it? It's just… always there, a little bit. I've just lived with it, I suppose. Never thought much of it. Until… well, until now. What do you think it is, doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Well, Brodie, several years of a chronic cough… that’s not ideal. And “not thinking much of it” isn’t a treatment plan. I need to listen to your lungs. And I'll need your medical history. Do you have any records I could see?
PATIENT: Medical records… Mai kept everything, she did. But… after she passed, things got… disorganized. I honestly don't know where they are. Probably packed away somewhere. In the attic, maybe? Or the basement? It’s a bit of a mess down there. I haven't been down there in… a long time. No, I don’t think I have any records, doctor. I just… tried to get by. Never had much luck with doctors anyway. They always poked and prodded. And I didn’t like feeling like a problem. Just listen to my chest, I suppose. If you think it’s serious. Is it something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with a listen. If you don’t have a history, we’ll have to rely on what you tell me and what I find. Please, sit up there for me. And try to relax. Though, I can't promise you a pleasant experience. It's my job to assess the situation, and that unfortunately requires some poking and prodding.
PATIENT: Alright, doctor. Do what you need to do. Just… be gentle, if you wouldn’t mind. Old bones, you know. And… don’t expect much. I’m not a very good patient. Mai always said I was stubborn as a mule. Maybe that’s why I ignored it for so long.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Again. Hmm. There’s some… wheezing. And diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. Do you have any history of asthma?
PATIENT: Asthma? No, not that I know of. Never been diagnosed with anything like that. I worked in the shop my whole life. Lots of fumes, lots of dust. Sometimes my chest would get tight, but I always figured it was just… the work. Mai used to make me drink herbal tea when I got a bad cough. Said it would clear my lungs. She knew everything, that woman. No asthma, doctor. Just an old mechanic trying to get by. Is something wrong? It is something wrong, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Well, “wrong” is a strong word, Brodie. But diminished breath sounds and wheezing after a long history of coughing… that’s concerning. It could be a number of things. Chronic bronchitis is a possibility, given your work history. It could also be early signs of something more serious. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Mai wouldn't allow it. She said it was a terrible habit. And she was right, as always. I used to smell it on the customers' clothes, though. Horrible smell. No, never smoked a day in my life. I drank a lot of coffee, though. Does that count? Mai used to say I was addicted to caffeine. She was probably right about that, too. Just coffee, doctor. Not cigarettes. Is that… good? Does that make it better?
DOCTOR: No smoking is good, yes. But coffee isn’t relevant here. Given your age, your history of chronic coughing, and the diminished breath sounds… I need to order a chest X-ray. And I'd like to check your oxygen saturation levels. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to your lungs.
PATIENT: An X-ray… alright. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I don’t really understand all the medical stuff, you see. Just tell me what I need to do. Oxygen… is that like… a mask? Mai needed oxygen sometimes, towards the end. It helped her breathe. I just… want to know what’s wrong. And if it’s… serious. Don't want to cause any trouble, you understand. Just an old man, trying to get through the days. Do what you need to do, doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright. The X-ray technician is just down the hall, in room three. They'll explain the procedure to you. It's quick and painless. Afterwards, we'll check your oxygen saturation right here in the office. I’m ordering the X-ray now. We'll get the results back as soon as possible. And I understand you're not comfortable with medical jargon. I'll do my best to explain everything in plain language. Just try to relax, Brodie. And let's get this over with. It's best to know what we're dealing with.
PATIENT: Alright, doctor. Room three, you said? I… I hope it doesn’t take too long. My legs aren’t what they used to be. And… thank you. For explaining things. It… it helps. Mai always said I was a worrywart. I guess some things never change.
