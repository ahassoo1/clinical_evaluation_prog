DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you. I am having trouble… finding the right words, sometimes. It is very frustrating. I do not… remember when it started, exactly. It feels like it has been… a while now, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds frustrating to be having trouble with your words. “A while now” is helpful, but can you try to give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… a timeframe. That is… difficult. Perhaps… six months? Or maybe… a year? It is all a bit… fuzzy. I apologize. My wife… she used to help me with dates. It has been… hard since she passed.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Gyamfi. Losing your wife must be incredibly difficult. It’s perfectly alright that remembering exact dates is challenging right now. Six months to a year gives us a starting point. So, this difficulty finding words… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Mostly… when I am tired, I think. Or… when I am trying to explain something complicated. Like… at work. I do compensation and benefits… and job analysis. Lots of… details. It is harder then. Sometimes… the words are just… not there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be exacerbated by fatigue or complex tasks. And when you say the words aren’t “there,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to explain? It is like… a blank space. I know what I want to say, Doctor. I can see the idea in my head. But when I open my mouth… nothing comes out. Or… I say the wrong word. A similar word, but… not quite right. It is… very unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very frustrating – knowing what you want to say but having trouble expressing it. It’s good you’re able to describe it like that. Besides the trouble with finding words, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Let me think. My wife… she said I was repeating myself sometimes. Before… she passed. I do not… remember if that is still happening. And… I have been more… forgetful, generally. Not just dates. Names, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potential repetition and increased forgetfulness, especially with names. Have you noticed any difficulty understanding what others are saying?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I can hear perfectly well, and I understand what people say. It is… saying things that is the problem, not hearing. Though… sometimes… in a noisy room, it is harder to focus. But that is just… old age, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. And you mentioned this started around six months to a year ago. Have you had any head injuries or illnesses around that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… illnesses. I had a… bad cold last winter. A very bad one. But that was… months ago. Head injuries… no. Not that I remember. I did… fall once, a few years back, but it was just a… minor stumble. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… Medicare covers my blood pressure. A small pill, every morning. And… sometimes, for my arthritis, a pain reliever. But only when it is… very bad. Just the normal things, I think. Nothing… special.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a medication for blood pressure and pain reliever as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. My wife… she always took care of that. I never… needed much. Just… the normal things. I do not believe I am allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, coordination, and do a brief neurological assessment. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly fine. I trust your judgment. Please… do what you need to do. I want to… understand this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Please sit comfortably. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Those seem normal. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes – don't move your head. Good. Now, I'm going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am squeezing as hard as I can. It is… not a problem. I used to… work with my hands a lot, in the garden.
DOCTOR: Good strength. Your sensation seems normal as well. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. It could be a number of things, but given your age and symptoms, we should rule out some more serious possibilities. Would you be willing to get an MRI of your brain?
PATIENT: An MRI…? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is something… wrong? My wife… she had tests, sometimes. It was never… a good sign.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s natural to be worried when we talk about tests like MRIs. An MRI will give us a detailed picture of your brain and help us rule out any underlying issues. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong, but it's the best way to get answers. We could also consider a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in brain and nerve disorders. They would be able to perform more detailed cognitive testing. Would you be comfortable with either of those options, or both?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. If it will… help. I want to know… what is happening. It is… unsettling, not knowing. I trust your judgment. Please… do what you think is best. I just want… my mind back.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gyamfi. I appreciate your trust. We'll schedule both an MRI of your brain and a referral to a neurologist. I’ll have my assistant prepare the orders for both. In the meantime, I’m going to order some blood work to check for any vitamin deficiencies or underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I'll also give you a handout with some simple exercises you can do at home to help with cognitive function – things like puzzles, reading, and staying socially active. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. A plan is… reassuring. Thank you. Please… let me know when the tests are scheduled. And… thank you for listening to me. It is… a relief to talk about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m glad you felt comfortable enough to share your concerns with me. My assistant will be in shortly to schedule those appointments and provide you with the handout. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new concerns – such as weakness, vision changes, or severe headaches – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is everything. You have been… very helpful. I trust your… plan. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gyamfi. I'll let my assistant know you're ready, and she'll come in shortly. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes.
