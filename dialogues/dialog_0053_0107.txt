DOCTOR: Right. Philipp Puder, 35 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: My heart... it feels funny sometimes. Like it's racing, then slow. Not all the time, but... yeah. It worries my wife.
DOCTOR: "Funny," is a rather vague description, wouldn't you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, I know. It's hard to say. Fast, like... when you run, maybe? But I'm just sitting. Then it goes normal. Sometimes it feels like it skips a beat. Just for a second. It's hard to explain. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "skipping" is concerning. And the racing… how often would you say this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe once a week? Sometimes not for a whole week, then two times in one day. It's not... regular. It's just when it happens, my wife gets scared. She says I look pale. I don’t always feel bad, just... weird.
DOCTOR: “Weird” is also… not particularly helpful, Mr. Puder. Do you experience any other symptoms with this “weird” feeling?
PATIENT: Sometimes… I get a little short of breath, maybe? Not bad, like I can’t breathe, just… like I need to take a bigger breath. And… sometimes my chest feels tight. Not pain, just… squeezed. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Right. Tightness and shortness of breath… are you experiencing any dizziness or lightheadedness when this happens?
PATIENT: No, not really. No falling over or anything. Just… the heart thing, and the tight chest. And the wife worrying. She’s a good woman. She makes me come here, you know? I don’t like doctors much. But she says it’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any previous medical evaluations for this?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never. This just started a few months ago. Before that, I was always healthy. I work with… machines, you know? Chemical stuff. Not dangerous, but… always moving, always checking things. I thought maybe it was from work, but it happens when I’m home too.
DOCTOR: Chemicals, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. I check the levels, make sure everything is mixing right. Not in the chemicals, just… around them. The machines do the mixing. I just watch them. It’s not a bad job, but it can be stressful sometimes, if something goes wrong. But it’s not like I’m breathing fumes or anything. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Right. Stress is a factor, certainly. Now, let’s get a bit more detailed. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never. I… I don’t even know my blood pressure. My wife usually handles all that. She tells me what I need to eat, what I need to do. I just… work. I don’t usually go to the doctor. Like I said. She brought me today because she was really worried. She said it was important to check my heart.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it's good she's proactive. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Then we'll see if any further testing is needed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, sir. Not that I know of. My wife says I can eat anything. She’s very careful about that too. Okay… you want to listen to my heart? That’s… okay. I guess. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. I have work later.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I'll start with your blood pressure. And just relax, Mr. Puder. We'll get this sorted out.
PATIENT: Okay… Relax… right. Easy for you to say. Everything feels a little weird when I lie down. Like my heart is… louder. But I’ll try. Just… hurry, okay? I don't like being at the doctor.
DOCTOR: 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not alarming. Breathe normally. Take a deep breath… and exhale. 88 and regular. Your heart sounds a little… rapid, but no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear. Pulse is normal. Now, can you tell me, is this racing feeling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, sir. It’s not always there. Sometimes I feel fine all day. Then, suddenly, bam. It starts. And then it goes away after a few minutes, maybe an hour. It’s… unpredictable. Like a surprise. Not a good surprise. Like when you drop something important. That’s what it feels like. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Right. Unpredictable… okay. Given your symptoms and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to order an EKG, just to get a better look at your heart’s electrical activity. And a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying issues. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Puder. It'll give us more information.
PATIENT: EKG… and blood? Like needles? I don’t like needles. My wife always has to hold my hand when I get blood drawn. Is it… is it going to hurt a lot? And how long will this take? I really need to get back to work…
DOCTOR: Yes, it involves a small needle. But it’s a very quick prick, Mr. Puder. And we have nurses who are very good at it. It shouldn’t be painful, just a momentary discomfort. The EKG is completely painless – just some stickers on your chest. The blood draw and EKG will take about 30 minutes total. And then we'll review the results and discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Thirty minutes… okay. And the stickers don’t hurt? Really? Is there anything… anything I can do now? To make it stop? Before I go back to work? Like… take a deep breath? Drink some water? My wife always says water helps.
DOCTOR: Water is a good start. Staying hydrated is always beneficial. And yes, deep, slow breaths can help calm your nervous system. But honestly, Mr. Puder, without knowing the underlying cause, there’s not much we can do to stop it. That’s why the EKG and blood work are important. Let's get those tests ordered, and then we can talk about a more long-term plan. Nurse Ramirez will be in shortly to take your blood. Do you want me to have her call your wife?
PATIENT: Nurse… Ramirez? Okay. I think… I think she should come with me. My wife, I mean. She… she’s better at this than me. She can ask all the questions. And hold my hand. Yes, please. Call my wife. Her name is… Fatima Puder. She’s probably already worried sick. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll have Nurse Ramirez contact her. In the meantime, try to relax. We'll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Puder. .
