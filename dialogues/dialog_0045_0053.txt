DOCTOR: Alright, Kandy Yadao, 66 years old. Good. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. It's… well, it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having trouble going to the bathroom. It just… takes a long time, and sometimes it doesn’t come out all the way, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” alright. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, properly, maybe three months ago? It was just a little slow at first, but it’s gotten worse over the last month, I’d say. Definitely more noticeable now. I remember because my grandson, Tomas, came to visit at the end of May, and I didn’t have any trouble then. He helped me with the garden.
DOCTOR: Three months… and it's progressively worsened. Okay. And when you say it “doesn’t come out all the way,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… it feels like there’s still some left in there, you know? Like I’ve emptied as much as I can, but not all of it. It’s a bit uncomfortable, honestly. And I have to… strain a little to get it going sometimes. Not always, but more often than I used to. It’s not painful, just… effortful. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Alright, a feeling of incomplete emptying, and some straining. Not painful, just effortful. Have you noticed any changes in how your stream is?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. It's not as strong as it used to be. It used to be… well, a good, steady flow. Now it's more… weak. And it sort of starts and stops, you know? Not a continuous stream like it was. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but that’s what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent stream, decreased force. Okay. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven’t felt any pain, thankfully. No fever or chills. I’ve been sleeping alright, maybe a little more often than usual, but that could just be my age. I haven’t noticed any blood in my waterworks, if that's what you were going to ask. I drink plenty of water, always have. Perhaps… I’ve been a bit more thirsty lately, now that you mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay. No pain, no fever, no blood. Increased thirst. Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. Well, I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but that was no trouble. And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it doesn’t bother me too much. I take some over-the-counter pain relief for it now and then. Otherwise… not much. I’ve been pretty healthy for my age, I think. No diabetes or high blood pressure, if that's what you’re wondering. The doctor always used to say I had a strong heart.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, arthritis. No diabetes, no hypertension. Good. Any family history of similar problems?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My father… he had trouble with his waterworks when he got older, yes. He had to go to the hospital a couple of times for it. I don't remember exactly what was wrong, but it involved a tube, I think. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had a similar problem. She needed an operation, eventually. I don’t know any specifics, I’m afraid. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of similar issues in the family. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, besides the over-the-counter pain relief for your knees?
PATIENT: No, just the over-the-counter stuff for my knees. Ibuprofen, I think it is. I don’t take it every day, only when they are really bothering me. And sometimes a little something for my sleep, but only if I can’t get to sleep. It’s a very mild one, the doctor gave it to me years ago. I don’t even remember the name. It’s in my medicine cabinet, if you need to know. A small blue pill, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed, and a mild sleep aid. We’ll get the name later. Okay, Kandy, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam now. Just a standard check of your abdomen and a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just tell me what I need to do. I’m not afraid. I’ve had plenty of doctors in my life.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the table, please. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just relax, and breathe normally. Now, does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. A little… sensitive, maybe, right here, just above my bladder, but not painful. It’s just… aware of being touched, if that makes sense. It’s always a bit tender there, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t bother me. It feels… normal. A little hollow, perhaps? Like a drum, if you tap it. Is that what you’re checking for? I always thought my belly felt a bit… empty. I don’t eat as much as I used to. Is everything alright? You seem… serious.
DOCTOR: Everything’s alright. Just being thorough. Reflexes are normal. Sensation is intact. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and this initial exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH – although, as a woman, it’s a bit unusual. It’s often seen in older men. However, you're experiencing similar symptoms and, given your family history… We'll need to run some tests to rule out other possibilities. I want to order a urine analysis, a complete blood count, and a PSA test to check your prostate-specific antigen levels. We’ll also do a bladder scan to see how much urine remains after you void. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That sounds very complicated! A PSA test? Is something wrong with my… prostate? I didn’t even know women had a prostate. And what does all that mean? I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again. Is it serious, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Women have a periurethral gland, which produces fluid similar to the prostate in men, and it can sometimes cause similar issues. The PSA test is just to get a baseline, and to rule out other potential causes. It doesn’t automatically mean there’s something serious wrong. As for the other tests, it's just standard procedure to get a complete picture of what’s going on. Worrying won’t help. Let's get the tests done, and then we can discuss the results and figure out a plan. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and then we’ll do the bladder scan. It’s a non-invasive ultrasound. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. A bit… overwhelmed, but I understand. Blood test, bladder scan. And then we talk about the results. Okay. Will the nurse tell me how to prepare for the blood test? Do I need to fast, or anything like that? And… is the bladder scan uncomfortable? I always worry about these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will explain everything. You’ll need to fast for eight hours beforehand for the blood test. No food or drinks, except water. And no, the bladder scan is completely painless. It’s just like an ultrasound, a gel on your abdomen and a probe. Here. Take this to the nurse, and she’ll take care of everything. The nurse’s station is just out there. I’ll see you after the tests are done.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I’ll go find the nurse now. .
