DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tippens, welcome. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. I just need some papers signed and… verified, I guess? It’s for some health forms. I'm hoping it won't take too long, to be honest. I have a bit of a schedule today.
DOCTOR: Papers, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, they came in the mail. Something about needing a notary and… proof that I actually am an anesthesiologist. Seems silly, doesn’t it? I've been one for… a long time. But they said I needed it for… some benefits application. Do you know anything about that?
DOCTOR: Anesthesiologist, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. For… oh, goodness, almost fifty years now. Though I’m retired, of course. But I still need to show proof, apparently. It's these forms… they're very particular. Here they are. It’s a mess, sorry. I keep everything.
DOCTOR: Right. And you’re here… to have me verify this?
PATIENT: Well, yes. That’s what the lady on the phone told me. She said you could do the notary part, and… confirm that I am who I say I am, professionally. Is that not… possible? I really don’t understand why it’s so complicated.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, with all due respect… I'm a family medicine doctor. I treat colds, flu, diabetes... I don't verify the credentials of other specialists. I wouldn’t even know where to begin. It seems you've been… misinformed.
PATIENT: Oh. Oh dear. Well, that’s… that’s a problem. They specifically told me to come here. To you. Rural clinic, Dr. Donate… That was all the information I had. Do you… know anyone around here who could do this? I really need these forms completed.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you’re frustrated. But you need to contact the organization requiring these forms and explain the situation. Perhaps the county clerk’s office?
PATIENT: The county clerk? I suppose… I hadn’t thought of that. Honestly, all this paperwork is just… overwhelming. Do you have a number for them handy? I don't have my cell phone with me. I left it in the car.
DOCTOR: There's a list of local resources there. County clerk, legal aid... things like that. I really can’t help you with verifying credentials, Ms. Tippens. It's outside my scope of practice. I’m a family doctor, not a licensing board.
PATIENT: Right, of course. Thank you. I appreciate you telling me, even if it’s not what I wanted to hear. I just wish someone had explained it better on the phone. I feel… rather foolish now. I'll give them a call.
