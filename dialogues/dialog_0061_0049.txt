DOCTOR: Good morning, Betty. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Kimm, is it? Lovely name. Well, it's my ears, you see. They just… aren’t what they used to be. Things are getting a bit muffled, like talking through a pillow, maybe? I don't rightly know how to explain it. It's just harder to hear folks.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some hearing loss. "Muffled" is a good way to describe it. And it's been gradual, is that right?
PATIENT: Gradual… yes, I think so. It didn’t happen overnight, no. It’s just… slowly, slowly getting worse. I can’t say when it started exactly. A long time ago, I reckon. Longer than I care to remember, truth be told. I used to work in a shoe factory, a noisy place it was. Maybe that had something to do with it? I don’t know. It was years and years ago, though.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Betty. Working in a noisy environment like a shoe factory could definitely contribute to hearing loss. We'll want to explore that a bit further. So, is the muffling in both ears, or is it worse in one than the other?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… I think it’s… both ears, yes. But maybe the left one is a bit worse? It’s hard to say for certain. Sometimes I have to ask folks to repeat themselves, and I think it's more often when they're talking on that side. Though, honestly, sometimes I just… don’t hear things at all. It’s all a bit of a jumble, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Betty. That's perfectly alright. It's helpful to know it's both ears, with possibly more trouble on the left. Do you notice any ringing or buzzing in your ears at all?
PATIENT: Ringing… Hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes, yes. A faint ringing. Not all the time, mind you. It comes and goes. It's not terribly loud, more like… a little cricket chirping in the distance, maybe? I hadn’t really thought much about it, to be honest. It’s just… there, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that ringing – we call that tinnitus – is good to know. Does anything make the ringing worse, or better?
PATIENT: Tinnitus, you say? Fancy name for a little cricket, isn't it? Well, let me think… I don’t think anything makes it worse, not that I’ve noticed. And nothing seems to make it better either. It just… is. It doesn't bother me too much, mostly. It’s more the not hearing what folks say that's the problem. It gets… frustrating, you know? Especially when I’m trying to enjoy a good chat.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Betty. It's frustrating when it interferes with conversations. Okay, let's talk about your overall health a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I've got a bit of arthritis in my hands, that's why they’re a bit gnarled. And my knees aren't what they used to be, either. The doctor gave me some pills for it, years ago. Can't remember the name of 'em now, though. And I have a touch of… what do they call it? High blood pressure, that’s it. But I take pills for that too. Medicare pays for 'em, thank goodness. Other than that… I think that’s about it. I'm 83, you know, things are bound to start creaking a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and high blood pressure, both managed with medication, that’s good to know. Do you know the names of the medications you're taking for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you're asking something! No, I'm afraid not. I just take the little pills the doctor gives me. My daughter usually refills 'em. She handles all that. I can't keep track of names, you know. Too many things floating around in my head these days. They’re little white ones, I think, for the blood pressure. And little pink ones for the arthritis. But names? No, I'm afraid not. I wouldn't want to give you the wrong information.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright, Betty. We can look those up in your records. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Now that's a good question. Let me see… I don't think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. I used to be able to eat anything, mind you. But now, my stomach isn’t what it used to be. I have to be careful with spicy foods, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… gets a bit rumbly, that's all. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, no. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned you used to work in a shoe factory. How long ago was that, and what kind of work did you do there?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, a long time ago. Must be… 50 years ago, maybe more? It feels like a lifetime. I worked on the machines, you see. Sewing the soles onto the shoes. Loud, noisy work it was. All the clatter and banging. I used to wear earplugs sometimes, but they weren't very comfortable. And you get used to the noise, don't you? Or, I thought I did. It was a good job, though. Paid the bills. But looking back, I reckon that noise probably wasn’t good for my ears.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information. Now, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears with an otoscope. It won’t hurt, but let me know if you feel any discomfort, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Sounds sensible. I trust your judgement. Just tell me what you see, if you don't mind. I’m a bit of a worrier, you know. Not a lot of pain, though, I hope? Just a quick look, you say? Go ahead, then.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty. Just relax. Hmm. Okay, and now the right ear. Alright, Betty. I’m seeing some wax buildup in both ears, which is pretty common. And I also see a little bit of redness, which could be due to irritation. There doesn't seem to be any sign of infection. It looks like the ear canals are a bit narrow as well. This, combined with the wax buildup, could be contributing to your hearing loss. It's not surprising given your history of working in a noisy environment.
PATIENT: Oh, wax, you say? Well, I suppose that's to be expected. I don't do much cleaning in there myself, to be honest. Too fiddly. Narrow canals… that doesn't sound good, does it? And the noise… So, you think the noise and the wax are the main culprits? Is it something we can fix? I just want to be able to hear my grandchildren properly, you see. It's awful missing out on what they're saying.
DOCTOR: Yes, Betty, that's what I suspect. The noise likely contributed to some hearing loss over time, and the wax buildup is certainly making it worse. The good news is, this is something we can address! I recommend we start with a simple wax removal procedure. We can either gently irrigate your ears with water, or use a special tool to carefully remove the wax. After that, we can reassess your hearing to see how much improvement we get. If the hearing loss is still significant after wax removal, we can discuss the possibility of a hearing test and potential hearing aids. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds wonderful, dear! Wax removal… that sounds much more sensible than fiddling around in there myself. And a hearing test… well, I suppose I should face facts, shouldn’t I? Getting a proper test done. I trust your judgement, you seem to know what you’re doing. And hearing aids… well, that’s for down the line, isn’t it? Let’s get the wax out first, then see what happens. Yes, let’s start with the wax removal. Thank you, dear. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty. Excellent. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. We can go ahead and do the wax removal today. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes for both ears. I will explain the procedure to you step-by-step. I'll use body-temperature water, and it might feel a little bit strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, dear. Body temperature water... good thinking. I trust you. And strange is better than painful, any day! Fifteen to twenty minutes... I can manage that. Just tell me if anything feels… well, wrong, alright? I might be a bit jumpy, just because I don't like things in my ears. But I’m trusting you, you seem very competent. Go ahead, then. Let's get this wax out.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty. You're in good hands. I’m going to gently warm the water, and then I'll use a syringe to gently flush your ear canal. You might feel a little bit of pressure, or a slight whooshing sound. If at any point it feels uncomfortable, just let me know, and I'll stop immediately. Okay, I’m seeing some wax coming out now. That’s a good sign. And it looks like the ear canal is starting to clear up. Alright, Betty, that's the left ear done. I've removed a significant amount of wax from both ears. It looks much better in there now. Your ear canals are considerably clearer. Now, let’s see how your hearing sounds.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It feels… different, certainly. Not so blocked up. Is that what clear feels like? Yes… I can hear that! That little rubbing sound… I couldn't hear that before, could I? A bit faint, mind you, but I can hear it. That’s good, isn’t it? A little bit better, already. It's a relief, honestly. It's been so quiet lately. Just a little bit better… that's a good start. What happens now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Betty, that is good! It shows the wax removal has already made a difference. Now, to get a more accurate assessment of your hearing, I’d like to refer you to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing test. They have specialized equipment that can measure your hearing levels across a range of frequencies. This will give us a clearer picture of the extent of your hearing loss, and help us determine if hearing aids are necessary. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An audiologist, you say? Specialized equipment… sounds a bit fancy. Is that… expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you see. And a comprehensive test… will that take long? I don't want to be a bother. I'm happy it's a bit better, but I don't want to go overboard if it's going to cost a fortune. Is it something I need to do, or just… a good idea?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Betty. Let me address those questions. A comprehensive hearing test is covered by Medicare, so there shouldn't be any out-of-pocket cost for that. It typically takes about an hour to complete. And I wouldn’t recommend it if it wasn't beneficial. The results of the test will give us a clear picture of your hearing levels and help us determine the best course of action. If hearing aids are recommended, we can discuss affordable options and financing plans. It’s about improving your quality of life and being able to hear your grandchildren properly. Would you like me to provide you with a referral and the contact information for a reputable audiologist in the area?
PATIENT: Oh, Medicare covers it, you say? That’s a relief, that is. And just an hour… I can manage an hour. Improving my quality of life… and hearing my grandchildren… yes, that’s a good point. Yes, please. A referral would be wonderful. And the contact information. I trust your judgement, dear. You’ve been very patient and reassuring. Let’s do it. Let’s get this test done. Thank you. I feel much better now, knowing it won't cost me a fortune.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty. Excellent. Here you are. This has the contact information for Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly recommended audiologist in town. Her office is very close to the clinic. They will schedule an appointment for you at your convenience. Please let me know if you have any trouble getting an appointment. And after you've had the test, schedule a follow-up appointment with me, so we can discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
