DOCTOR: Right. Terasa MayHugh, 59. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um... it's my hearing, mostly. It keeps... going. And I get so dizzy sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It just… happens. And my daughter, bless her, she said I should come, because her father’s side… they had trouble with their ears too. I don’t remember much about it, though. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: “Going?
PATIENT: Well, like... fading out. Then rushing back. Not all at once, you know? Sometimes it's just in one ear, sometimes both. It doesn’t last long, usually. A few minutes, maybe an hour. It’s just… unsettling. And then the spinning. Oh, the spinning is awful. Makes me want to lie right down. I haven’t fallen yet, thankfully. Do you… understand? It's hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: Right. Fading and rushing…and dizziness. Okay. And this has been happening for… how long now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. It comes and goes, you see. I’d say… a few months, maybe? It started… after I lost Edward. Everything feels a bit blurry, if I’m honest. It’s not constant, thankfully. Just… pops up now and then. I really don't keep track of these things. It’s just… annoying, mostly. And worrying, because of Edward's family.
DOCTOR: “Annoying”. Right. Well, we need to figure out why it’s annoying. Edward’s side, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, his mother and his brother… they both had terrible trouble with their ears. Always ringing, and spinning. They went to doctors, of course. Back then, it was all… different. Not like now, with all the fancy tests. I remember them talking about balance, and something about the fluid in the ear? But I was young, and… well, it was a long time ago. I don't recall the specifics. I just remember they weren't very happy.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, family history of…inner ear issues, potentially. Do you experience any ringing in your ears currently, or is it just the fading and dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes there is a ringing. Yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine, mostly. But it’s not always there. It comes and goes, just like everything else. It’s hard to tell what’s causing what, you know? Is it the fading? Is it the dizziness? Or is it something else entirely? I get so confused. It's mostly just... background noise, if that makes sense. Nothing terrible. Just… there.
DOCTOR: “Background noise.” Hmm. And are you experiencing any hearing loss, Terasa?
PATIENT: Well… yes, I suppose I am. Things aren’t as clear as they used to be. Especially when people mumble. My daughter says I ask her to repeat herself a lot. And the television… I have to turn it up louder now. But I just thought it was… old age, you know? I’m not as young as I used to be. I didn't think it was something I needed to bother a doctor about, really. It's just… a little bit quieter, that’s all.
DOCTOR: “A little bit quieter.” Alright. Let’s just run a quick hearing test, to get a baseline. And then we’ll take a look in your ears, just to rule anything obvious out. It’s a simple procedure, nothing to worry about. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A test, yes. Alright. If you think it's necessary. I just… I hope it doesn't take too long. I have a bit of a lunch date with my friend, Elsie. We were going to… well, never mind. Yes, a test is fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And it won't make me more dizzy, will it?
DOCTOR: No, it won't make you more dizzy. It’s just a quick check. Follow me. The audiologist is just down the hall. It'll only take a few minutes. Don’t worry, it's quite straightforward.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… straightforward is good. Straightforward is very good. Lead the way, dear. I suppose I should have told my daughter, but she worries so much. Elsie would have told me to come, but she’s away on holiday.
DOCTOR: Right this way. Let's get this over with, then. The sooner we get the test done, the sooner you can enjoy your lunch with Elsie.
PATIENT: Yes, quite right. Elsie makes a lovely lemon cake. I hope it doesn't take too long. And... is there anything I should do before the test? Like... avoid loud noises, or something? I wouldn't want to ruin it. .
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just…try to relax. And try not to anticipate the results too much. It's just a baseline, remember?
