DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's about having a baby. And I don't want any… problems. I'm not getting any younger, you know. I want to do this right the first time. I've heard horror stories.
DOCTOR: Right, right. A bit of pre-conception planning… sensible. So, you’re thinking about becoming pregnant. Have you been trying already, or are you just starting to consider it?
PATIENT: Consider it? Really, Doctor? At my age, you don't just consider these things. It's more… a calculated decision. And no, I haven't been "trying" yet. I wanted to get a professional opinion before I wasted my time. It seems obvious, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, sensible again. I understand. A bit of foresight. Alright, well, let's gather some information. Just to be thorough, could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly. What do you need to know? I’m perfectly healthy. I mean, I’m a bicycle repairer, not a… a couch potato. I’m strong, I eat reasonably well, I don't smoke, and I rarely drink. Divorced, of course, but that's hardly a medical condition. Medicare is what I have, if that’s relevant. Is that enough, or do you need a detailed account of every childhood sniffle?
DOCTOR: No, no, not every sniffle! Just a general overview. Any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Nothing significant. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps, rubella, all properly vaccinated, of course. No major surgeries. I broke my wrist once falling off a bicycle - ironic, I know - but it healed perfectly. Really, Doctor, I'm a very healthy woman. I just… want to make sure everything is perfectly alright before I start. Don’t you have tests for this sort of thing?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, we do. Routine tests are very important. And the wrist… good to know it healed cleanly. Family history, then?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That's… complicated. My mother had some sort of… heart trouble, I think. And my grandmother… well, she didn’t live very long. Not a particularly strong line, truthfully. A lot of… complaining. Is that relevant? Honestly, I never paid much attention to all that. It's not as if knowing they weren’t robust will suddenly make me robust, is it?
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, Ms. Shteynberg. Knowing the family history gives us a little more context. Heart trouble… do you recall if it was a specific condition?
PATIENT: Specific condition? Doctor, I was a child! She just… wasn’t well. Lots of resting, complaining about palpitations… I vaguely remember something about high blood pressure, but honestly, it was decades ago. It's not as if I'm going to suddenly sprout a heart condition because my mother wasn't very strong, is it? Look, are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just cataloging my ancestors’ shortcomings? I have a bicycle shop to run.
DOCTOR: You're right to be pragmatic, Ms. Shteynberg. We can move on. Let’s talk about your current health. Are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no! I take vitamins, if that counts. A multivitamin, mostly. And sometimes I take something for my joints, because bending over bicycles all day isn’t exactly a spa treatment. But no prescribed medications, thank you very much. I prefer to keep my body as natural as possible. Chemicals are dreadful, you know.
DOCTOR: Vitamins and something for your joints… good to know. Any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not really. I get a bit sniffly with pollen in the spring, but that's hardly an allergy. And I can't tolerate shellfish – makes me terribly sick. But other than that, no. I’m quite resilient, actually. I’ve built up a good resistance to most things over the years. I doubt a little pollen would derail my plans.
DOCTOR: Alright, shellfish allergy and seasonal pollen sensitivity… helpful. Now, just to be thorough, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? What precisely do you mean? I run a bicycle shop. I work long hours. I'm physically active, obviously. I eat reasonably well - I make my own sandwiches for lunch. I don’t sit around all day watching television. Is that what you want to know? It's a perfectly sensible, productive life. I don't have time for… frivolous pursuits.
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a good idea. Now, before we proceed, I would like to do a brief physical exam. Just a standard check-up, to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, really? Now you want to touch me? Honestly. I suppose it's unavoidable. Just get it over with quickly, please. I have customers waiting, you know. And try not to be too… clinical. It’s rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. I’ll be as quick and discreet as possible. If you could just step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Honestly, the indignity of it all… There. Done. Now can we move on? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: 86 kilograms. And your height is… 186 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Perfectly correct. I am a tall woman. Always have been. Now, are we finished cataloging my physical attributes? I thought we were here to discuss having a baby, not my dimensions.
DOCTOR: Just a few more quick checks, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Now another one. Sounds clear. Blood pressure, please. 130 over 80. Not bad. Pulse is 72, regular. All within normal limits.
PATIENT: "Within normal limits"? Well, that’s hardly surprising, is it? I told you I’m perfectly healthy. Are we finally going to discuss what I need to do to have this baby, or are we going to continue this pointless examination? I'm starting to suspect this is just a waste of my time. Perhaps I should have gone to someone else.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s important to have a complete picture before we proceed, even if you feel perfectly healthy. Now, given your age and health history – or lack thereof – I would like to order some routine blood tests. These will check your hormone levels, assess your overall organ function, and screen for any potential deficiencies. It’s a standard pre-conception work-up. It's important to have all the information available before we consider other steps. Does that sound acceptable?
