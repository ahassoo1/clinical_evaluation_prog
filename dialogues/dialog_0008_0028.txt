DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. I'm Dr. Cumper. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it doesn’t feel right when I get to coughing. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, I think. Maybe longer. It’s hard to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough for a couple of weeks, and you’re noticing some heart palpitations when you cough. I understand it can be hard to keep track of time. Can you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly dry, I’d say. Not much phlegm comes up, and when it does, it’s clear. It’s worse at night, usually. Keeps me up some. And when I lie flat, it feels like there’s something… pressing on my chest. Does that make sense? I used to sleep with a couple of pillows, but even that doesn’t help much now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. So, a dry cough, worse at night, and a feeling of pressure in your chest when lying down. You've been using pillows to try and help, but it's not providing much relief. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My ankles do swell up some by the end of the day, but that’s been happening for a while now, too. And I get tired… really tired, even if I don’t do much. Just… worn out. Oh! And I get short of breath if I try to walk too far. Like, just getting from the kitchen to the living room… sometimes I need to stop and catch my breath.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ankles swelling, fatigue, and shortness of breath with minimal exertion. That's helpful information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, Dr. Ramirez – good doctor, he retired last year – he told me years ago I have something wrong with my heart. Congestive heart failure, he called it. I take some pills for it, every day. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia a couple of years back, but I got over it. Other than that… not much, really. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, congestive heart failure, managed with medication, and a history of pneumonia. Do you remember what medications you’re currently taking for your heart?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have… Lisinopril, I think that's right. And… Furosemide. Yes, definitely Furosemide. And Digoxin. A little white pill. That’s what Dr. Ramirez prescribed, and I’ve been taking them ever since. I take them every morning with my breakfast. Sometimes I forget, but I try not to. It’s important, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, Furosemide, and Digoxin. Good, that’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything over the years! Dr. Ramirez asked me that once, and I told him I hadn't had any problems. And I haven’t since. No rashes, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I do get a little sniffly sometimes with the dust, but that’s just a normal allergy, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And just to be thorough, are you currently experiencing any chest pain, fever, or chills?
PATIENT: No chest pain, Doctor. Thankfully. And no fever, not that I’ve noticed. I did feel a little warm the other night, but I just put on an extra blanket. No chills, either. Just tired… and this cough, of course. It’s just… wearing me down. It feels like it’s getting worse, even though I’m taking my pills.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s do a quick examination to listen to your lungs and heart. I’ll also check your ankles for swelling and take your blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sadhu, if you could please take a deep breath in and out for me. Okay, your lungs sound a little congested, especially at the base. I'm hearing some crackles. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, and I’m hearing a murmur. And as you mentioned, there is some swelling in your ankles. 2+ pitting edema on both sides. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated at 150 over 90. Okay, everything I'm hearing and feeling today suggests your congestive heart failure may be worsening. We need to run some tests to confirm this, but I'm concerned about fluid overload. Do you have any trouble breathing right now?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Worsening? That doesn’t sound good. No, I’m not having trouble breathing right now, but it does feel… tight in my chest sometimes. Like I’m trying to breathe through a straw. Especially when I walk. And my ankles… they’re always swollen by the end of the day, but they feel particularly puffy today. What kind of tests do you want to run, Doctor? And what does ‘fluid overload’ mean? It sounds scary.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that it sounds scary, Ms. Sadhu. “Fluid overload” means that your body is retaining too much fluid, which puts extra strain on your heart and lungs. That's why we're seeing the swelling in your ankles and hearing congestion in your lungs. I want to order a few tests. First, a chest X-ray to see how much fluid is in your lungs. Then, a blood test called a BNP to measure a hormone released by your heart when it's under stress. That will help us assess the severity of your heart failure. And finally, an EKG to check your heart rhythm more closely. While we wait for those results, I'm going to order a diuretic – a water pill – to help you get rid of some of the excess fluid. We'll start with a low dose and see how you respond. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. A water pill, that’s what Dr. Ramirez gave me years ago when my ankles were really bad. So, chest X-ray, blood test, and a heart… what did you call it? An EKG. And the water pill. Yes, alright. I trust you. Just… I hope it doesn't make me have to go to the bathroom all the time! Will these tests keep me here long? I have a little bird to feed when I get home, you know. A parakeet. His name is Chico.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Ms. Sadhu. The water pill can increase urination, so you will need to use the restroom more frequently. We'll try to time it so it doesn't interfere too much with your routine. The tests shouldn’t take too long. The chest X-ray will only take a few minutes, and the blood test and EKG can be done quickly in the lab. I’d estimate about an hour or so in total. We can get Chico fed when you get home, I promise. I’m going to have the nurse draw the blood now and then we will go for the X-ray. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… please tell me if it’s something serious, alright? I like knowing what’s going on. And thank you for being so kind. It’s nice to have a doctor who listens. Let’s get those tests done then. Poor Chico must be wondering where his dinner is.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Sadhu. I’ll be sure to keep you informed every step of the way. And you’re very welcome. It’s my pleasure. Let me call the nurse to get those tests started. She’ll be right in to draw your blood. I'll be back shortly to discuss the next steps once we have some initial results.
