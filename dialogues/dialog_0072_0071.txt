DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me in your own words what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. Yes, well, my granddaughter… she’s trying to get her paperwork settled to come live here with me. She’s coming from… oh, let me think… Honduras, I believe. And I understand she’s going to need some shots, some vaccinations, to make sure she can get her visa. I just want to make sure we’re doing everything right, you know? I want her here safe and sound.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Skarbek. You're wanting to ensure your granddaughter is up-to-date on her vaccinations for visa requirements. That’s very responsible of you. To start, could you tell me her age and date of birth, if you know it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… her mother sent me a copy of her birth certificate, I believe. Just a moment… Here we are. Her name is Isabella Rodriguez, and she was born March 12th, 2010. That makes her… fifteen years old now, I reckon. Is that what you need?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, thank you. Fifteen years old. Now, to get a better understanding of her vaccination history, has she had any vaccinations previously, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Well, that's where it gets tricky, Doctor. Her mother said she had some when she was little, the usual baby shots, I suppose. But things are… different down there, you know? The paperwork isn’t always so clear. I don't have a record of exactly what she’s had. Her mother said they tried to keep up with it, but I don't have anything official to show you, if that makes sense. We didn’t really think about needing it until now, with the visa and all.
DOCTOR: I see. So, we're working with limited vaccination records. That’s not ideal, but we can certainly work around it. We’ll need to proceed as if some vaccinations are missing, and ensure she receives what she needs to be protected. To start, has she ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. Her mother always said she was a healthy girl. No serious illnesses, no hospital stays, nothing like that. She might have had the chickenpox when she was little, but that was a long time ago. Just the usual childhood scrapes and colds, I think. She’s a strong girl, that Isabella. Always been active. She loves to dance.
DOCTOR: Good. No known chronic illnesses. And any surgeries or hospitalizations, ever?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Nothing like that. Her mother was very careful. She did her best to keep Isabella healthy and safe, even with… things being difficult there. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Just regular check-ups when she could get them. I really appreciate you taking the time to figure this out, Doctor. It's a lot to worry about, getting her settled here.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anyone in her immediate family – her mother, yourself, any siblings – had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, her mother… she has high blood pressure, I believe. She’s always been a little worried about it. And… oh, let me think. My late wife, her grandmother, she had diabetes. But that was a long time ago, before I met her, actually. Other than that, not that I recall. We don’t have a lot of family close by, so I don’t know much about their medical histories. It's mostly just us, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in her mother, and a history of diabetes in your late wife. Are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Skarbek?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, I am. Just for my arthritis, mostly. It flares up sometimes. I take something… let me see… it's a little white pill. Oh dear, I forget the name. My daughter helps me with my pills, she keeps them organized. I take one in the morning and one at night. It helps with the pain, mostly. I don't think it's anything serious.
DOCTOR: Do you know the dosage of that medication, Mr. Skarbek?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no, Doctor. I really don't. Like I said, my daughter handles that. She puts them in those little boxes, one for each day. I just take them. I'm not very good with remembering names and numbers these days, you know? I mostly just trust her to keep me right. I wouldn't want to give you the wrong information.
DOCTOR: Very well. We can obtain a medication list from your pharmacy. Now, before we proceed with assessing Isabella, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been able to eat just about anything. And I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to any medicine, not that I can recall. I've got sensitive skin sometimes, gets itchy in the sun, but that's not really an allergy, is it? Just a bit of a sunburn, mostly. I don’t think so, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, Mr. Skarbek, has Isabella had any recent illnesses, fevers, or unusual symptoms prior to her planned arrival?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, not that her mother told me. She said Isabella was healthy as a horse when she left. They were careful to make sure she wasn’t sick before she traveled. She said she had a little cold a few months ago, but she recovered from it quickly. Nothing serious, just a sniffle and a cough. She said she was fine when she left, ready to come here and start a new life. I'm trusting her mother on that, of course. I really want to get this right.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Skarbek. It appears we have enough information to begin a basic physical assessment of Isabella. Unfortunately, given the limited records and your difficulty recalling specifics, we will need to proceed with a comprehensive set of vaccinations to ensure her protection. I’m going to need to examine her now. Please, have a seat over there, and I’ll call her in when I’m ready.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'm ready when you are. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: .
