DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Chagaris. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Yeah, nice to meet you too. Uh…headaches, mostly. They’ve been…well, they come and go. Pretty bad when they do come, though. Sweaty, kinda shaky, heart races a bit. It's hard to explain exactly. I don't really…remember much about when they started, to be honest. Just…been happening.
DOCTOR: I see. Headaches that come and go, and are quite severe when they occur, accompanied by sweating, shakiness, and a racing heart – that certainly sounds concerning. It's alright that you don't recall exactly when they began; we can work through that. To get a better understanding, could you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Hmm…describe them…right. Okay. It's like…a really tight band around my head, almost. And it feels…throbbing? Not constant, more like…pulses. Usually on both sides, I think. Sometimes it's just behind my eyes. It's hard to focus when it’s bad, everything gets blurry. And light…bright light is awful. Makes it way worse. I don’t know if that makes sense. Honestly, it all kinda feels the same when it’s really hitting.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Mr. Lawther. A tight, throbbing band around the head, affecting both sides and sometimes behind the eyes, and worsened by bright light… that helps paint a clearer picture. It sounds like these headaches are significantly impacting your ability to function. Are these headaches constant, or do they occur in episodes?
PATIENT: Episodes, definitely episodes. Not…all the time. Could be weeks between them, sometimes just a few days. It’s kinda random, as far as I can tell. They build up a bit, usually. Start kinda dull, then get worse and worse until they’re…well, pretty rough. Then they kinda…fade out the same way. It’s not like a sudden thing, more gradual. Does that make sense? I'm terrible at explaining this.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly well, Mr. Lawther. Don’t worry about being “terrible”—you’re giving me very useful information. Episodes that build up gradually and then fade out… that’s helpful. Now, regarding those episodes, do you notice anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Triggers…hmm. That's a tough one. I haven’t really…noticed anything specific, not that I can recall. Stress, maybe? Work can be…stressful sometimes. But I get headaches when things are calm too. Food…I don't think so. Drinking…not really. Honestly, I wish I knew! It's kinda frustrating, just waiting for the next one to hit. I haven’t changed anything in my life recently that I can think of.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lawther. It’s difficult when there doesn’t seem to be an obvious cause. Stress can certainly be a factor, but it’s good you haven’t noticed a clear connection. Let’s move on to other symptoms. When you’re experiencing these headaches, do you have any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea…sometimes. Not usually vomiting, thankfully. Just kinda…sick to my stomach. Like that feeling before you actually throw up, but it doesn’t always happen. It’s more common when the headache is really bad. And…I get really tired. Like, really tired. Just wanna lie down in a dark room. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Lawther. Nausea, particularly with severe headaches, and significant fatigue… those are important details. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision during these episodes?
PATIENT: Vision…hmm. That’s a good question. I think…yeah, maybe. Everything gets…shimmery sometimes. Like looking through water, kinda blurry around the edges. It doesn't last long, though. Just for a bit while the headache is bad. And…bright spots, maybe? Like little flashes of light. But I’m not really sure, honestly. It all kinda blurs together when my head's hurting. I haven't had trouble seeing normally, just during these episodes.
DOCTOR: Okay, shimmering vision, blurry edges, and those brief flashes of light—those are things we definitely need to note. It sounds like you may be experiencing what we call an "aura" with these headaches. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…not really. I mean, I get the occasional cold, like everyone else. But nothing serious, nothing diagnosed. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. Divorced a few years back, that was…rough. But that’s not a medical condition, is it? I haven’t been to the doctor in…a while, honestly. I usually just try to tough things out. I don’t really…like going to the doctor. I haven’t got insurance either.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lawther. It's alright if you don’t have a long medical history, and it’s common to not enjoy doctor visits. And it's perfectly understandable to try and tough things out. Knowing you haven’t been to the doctor in a while, and that you don't have insurance, helps me understand the situation. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed any. Just the broken arm when I was a kid, but they just put it in a cast. Nothing major. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Never really been sick or injured badly enough to need anything like that. Honestly, these headaches are the worst thing that's happened to me in a long time. It’s just… frustrating not knowing what's causing them.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family—are there any members of your family who suffer from headaches or migraines?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a tough one. My mum used to get headaches, yeah. Pretty bad ones sometimes, but she never really talked about them much. Just said she had “a bad head.” My dad…I don’t really remember him having headaches. He wasn't around much. And I don't really have any contact with my siblings. So, not really. I think my mum's headaches were different, though. More like tension headaches, she always said. Not like these…with the sweating and the blurry vision.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother experienced headaches, but they seem to have been a different type. That's helpful. Now, let's discuss your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I'll have a beer with mates sometimes, but not much. A couple on a weekend, maybe. And definitely no drugs. Never been into any of that. Pretty straight-laced, actually. I work pretty hard during the week, so I don't really have much time for…any of that. Does that make sense? I'm just trying to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly clear, Mr. Lawther, and I appreciate your honesty. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I'll take a paracetamol if the headache's really bad, but that’s about it. Doesn’t always work, to be honest. Just kinda takes the edge off. And I haven’t taken anything regularly in ages. I usually just try to sleep it off. I’m not really one for taking pills unless I absolutely have to. I try to stay away from them as much as possible. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Alright, Mr. Lawther. Thank you for answering all of my questions. Based on what you’ve told me – the episodic nature of the headaches, the tight band sensation, the throbbing, the aura symptoms of shimmering vision and bright spots, the nausea, the fatigue, and the lack of significant medical history – it sounds like you may be experiencing migraines. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to perform a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes, coordination, and cranial nerves. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Migraines…okay. That…sounds about right, actually. Everything I’ve been describing does kinda fit what I’ve heard about migraines. But I’m not a doctor, am I? Yeah, a neurological exam sounds…fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just wanna figure out what’s going on and hopefully get some relief. Don’t mind me poking around a bit, do I? Just let me know if it's gonna be…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It won't be uncomfortable, just a few simple tests. Please lie down on the examination table. Okay, Mr. Lawther. Everything looks normal during the neurological exam. Your reflexes are intact, your coordination is good, and your cranial nerves are functioning as expected. This does support the possibility of migraines. However, given your lack of a prior diagnosis and the severity of your symptoms, I would like to order a few tests to rule out other potential causes. Specifically, I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to assess your thyroid function. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Tests…okay. Sounds sensible. Better safe than sorry, right? Blood count and thyroid…yeah, that makes sense. Uh…are they expensive? I haven’t got insurance, like I said. And…will it take long to get the results? I'm just a bit worried about the cost and the time. I need to get back to work, you see. And I really don't wanna keep having these headaches. It's just... stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lawther. The cost is a valid worry, especially without insurance. I will see if the clinic has any assistance programs available, or if we can find a lower-cost laboratory option. The tests themselves aren't usually extremely expensive, but it's still a consideration. Regarding the timeline, the results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as they may be more effective than paracetamol for migraines. It’s also important to stay hydrated and get enough rest. Avoiding potential triggers, such as bright lights and stress, can also be helpful. Would you like me to write down these recommendations for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that'd be great, Doc. Write it down, please. Ibuprofen, naproxen…stay hydrated, avoid bright lights. Stress…easier said than done, that one. And...if you can look into the cost, that'd be brilliant. Honestly, just knowing what's going on would be a huge relief. Even if it's just migraines, knowing why I'm getting these headaches would be a weight off my shoulders. Thank you. That's...really helpful. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lawther. I'm glad I could help. I'll speak to the billing department and see what options are available regarding the cost of the tests. I'll also have the nurse draw the blood samples before you leave today. To summarize, we’ve discussed your history, performed a neurological exam, and ordered a CBC and TSH test to rule out other potential causes. We’ve also agreed on a plan to manage your symptoms in the meantime with over-the-counter pain relievers, hydration, and avoiding potential triggers. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doc. Honestly, you've put my mind at ease a bit, just knowing what we're trying to figure out. I appreciate your patience and your help. Blood tests…right. Just let me know when you're ready. Thank you again. I’m…grateful. I'll see you when the results are back. And…if the headaches get really bad, should I go to the hospital? Just in case?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lawther. It’s my pleasure. Regarding your question about the hospital, yes, absolutely. If you experience any sudden, severe worsening of your headaches, accompanied by fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, or confusion, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Those symptoms could indicate a more serious condition that requires immediate attention. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood samples. She will explain the process and answer any questions you may have. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment once the results are back. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. Do you have any other questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doc. Honestly. You've been great. I’ll just…wait for the nurse then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
