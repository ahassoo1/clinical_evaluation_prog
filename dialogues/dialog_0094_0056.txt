DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Gegan. Now, to get started, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I suppose I am here because… frankly, the young people these days. It's utterly exhausting, trying to impart some… knowledge… to a generation that prefers these… glowing rectangles… to actual books. It's quite stressful, you see. Though, truthfully, I don’t recall the specifics. Just… stress. A great deal of it. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing stress related to… difficulties connecting with others, and perhaps feeling frustrated with current societal trends. It's completely valid to feel that way, Mr. Schlatterer. We can certainly explore that. And no, I don’t anticipate this taking a terribly long time. We'll just take things one step at a time. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this stress started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start? That’s… difficult. Years, certainly. Perhaps even decades. It's a gradual… decline, you see. A creeping… annoyance. It’s always been there, this… lack of respect for learning. The library… it’s not what it once was. Honestly, I don’t spend much time thinking about when it began, only that it is. Do you require a precise date? Because I assure you, I do not have one.
DOCTOR: No, a precise date isn't necessary at all, Mr. Schlatterer. It's perfectly alright that it's a gradual onset. It sounds like this has been a long-term source of frustration for you. To clarify, would you say this stress is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I suppose. Though… there are moments. Quiet moments, when no one is… disrupting the order. But those are rare these days. Very rare. Mostly… it’s just… there. A low hum of… irritation. Honestly, I prefer not to dwell on it. It's quite unpleasant. Are we getting anywhere with this? I have an appointment to… catalogue some acquisitions, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like this is a persistent stressor, and it's understandable that you prefer not to dwell on it. To help me get a fuller picture, and to rule out any other potential causes, could you tell me a little bit about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What sort of symptoms? I… sleep, I suppose. Though not always soundly. And I find myself… less enthusiastic. About things. About… everything. But that could be the weather, couldn't it? Or… the students. It's difficult to isolate the cause. I haven’t been… ill, if that's what you mean. No fever, no cough. Just… a general… malaise. Is that the correct word? And frankly, I’m not certain why I’m recounting all of this. It’s rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not undignified at all, Mr. Schlatterer. It's important to share everything, so we can understand what's happening. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty sleeping, and a general lack of enthusiasm – what you described as malaise – which is perfectly valid to mention. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Appetite… Hmm. I eat, certainly. Though not with the same… relish. Everything tastes… bland. And I daresay I’ve lost a little weight. My trousers feel… looser. But I attribute that to the heat, mostly. And the… lack of decent meals these days. Everything is so… processed. Honestly, it’s a wonder anyone has an appetite anymore. Are we nearing the end of this interrogation? I do have pressing matters.
DOCTOR: We’re not quite at an interrogation, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm just trying to gather enough information to understand what's going on. Okay, so you’ve noticed a decreased appetite, and some unintentional weight loss, along with difficulty sleeping and a general lack of enthusiasm. Now, have you been experiencing any difficulties with your memory lately?
PATIENT: Memory? Of course, I have! At my age? That’s… rather obvious, isn’t it? Names escape me. Dates… well, we’ve already established that. But it’s not… significant. It’s just… age. The natural decline. I’m not senile, if that’s what you’re implying. I simply… misplace things sometimes. And forget… trivial details. Honestly, it's all rather insulting. Are we finished yet? I'm growing quite impatient.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt insulting, Mr. Schlatterer. That wasn't my intention at all. I understand that memory changes can be common with age. To complete the picture, could you tell me a little about any medications you’re currently taking, or any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a small dose of… something for my blood pressure, I believe. Nothing significant. And allergies… dust, I suppose. A mild irritation. Nothing to write home about. Honestly, I'm not certain of the exact name of the medication. My daughter handles those details. She’s… more organized. Are we finally approaching the conclusion of this… assessment? I really must be going. I have a backlog of overdue notices to send. This is quite disruptive to my schedule. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I appreciate your patience. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot – persistent stress, changes in appetite and sleep, some memory changes, and a mild dust allergy, with a medication for blood pressure managed by your daughter. Based on what you’ve described, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of mild depression, possibly exacerbated by stress and age-related changes. It's important to remember that experiencing these symptoms doesn't mean you're weak or failing in any way. However, it's important to rule out any other potential causes. I would like to order some routine blood work to check your thyroid levels, vitamin D, and a complete blood count. We may also want to consider a brief cognitive assessment to get a baseline of your memory function. Would that be acceptable?
