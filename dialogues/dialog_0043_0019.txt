DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is Carlotta okay? People sometimes… sometimes say it wrong. But yes, yes, that is me. Um… my wife and I… we are thinking about… having a baby. Maybe. We want to make sure everything is… good. Before. We are… not young anymore.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Carlotta. And please, call me Leopoldo. It's perfectly alright, and I appreciate you correcting me. It's very responsible of you and your wife to consider this so thoughtfully. You are right to want to ensure everything is as healthy as possible. So, to clarify, you and your wife are considering starting a family, and you'd like a check-up to assess your overall health before proceeding?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is right. A check-up… to see if… if I am still okay to… to have a baby. My wife, she worries a little. I am… older. I used to work with metal… and plastic… making little things. For a long time. But that was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Carlotta. Your wife is wise to be cautious, and it’s commendable that you’re proactively addressing these concerns. Your age and previous occupation are both relevant factors we’ll want to consider. To get a better understanding of your health, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: A… a primary… doctor? I… I used to see someone. A long time ago. When I was working. But… I don’t remember his name. Or her name. It was… different then. I have… Medicare now. Is that… important? I go for check-ups… for old people things. But not… not for babies.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. Medicare is very important, as it allows us to access your medical records and see what’s been documented previously. And the “old people things” check-ups are a good start, we can build from there. Let's see… according to this, you’ve had a few visits for routine screenings. Do you recall anything specific about those visits?
PATIENT: Routine… screenings? Hmm… I think… they took blood? Yes, blood. And… they asked me about… feeling tired. And… my water works. A little too much sometimes. Old age, they said. I do not… remember any… special tests. Just… the usual. My wife… she goes with me. She remembers more. But she is not here today.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. That gives me a starting point. The blood work and questions about tiredness and urinary frequency are helpful. We'll definitely want to explore those further. It’s common for men your age to experience changes in urinary function. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any significant medical conditions you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… conditions? Hmm… I broke my arm, once. When I was a boy. Playing football. And… I had a bad cough, a long time ago. The doctor gave me… pills. It went away. Other than that… I don’t think so. I have… aches and pains, sometimes. But… that is just old age, I think. My wife always says… it is just old age.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. A broken arm and a past cough are good to know. And aches and pains are common with age, you’re right. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm… Let me think. I don't think so. No. No surgeries. I… I never needed anything like that. Just… a few stitches, once. When I was working with the metal. A little cut. But… not a surgery. My wife… she would have remembered a surgery. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Carlotta. No surgeries is helpful information. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… history? Oh… that is… difficult. My family… we are from Somalia. A long way away. I… I don't know much about their health. I haven't seen them… in many years. My father… he died when I was young. My mother… I don't remember much about her health either. It was… a different life then.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. It's perfectly alright if you don't have much information about your family's health history. It's common, especially if you haven’t been in contact for a long time. We can proceed without it, and focus on what we do know. Now, let’s talk about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. My wife… she does not like smoking. Very bad for you, she says. I drink… sometimes. A little wine, with dinner. Not every day. Just… on special occasions. And I try to… walk, when the weather is good. But… not so much these days. My knees… they ache.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Carlotta. Avoiding smoking is excellent, and a little wine occasionally isn't a concern. It’s good that you’re trying to stay active, even with some knee discomfort. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I take… a pill for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me. And… sometimes, I take something for the aches and pains. But… nothing special. No… no allergies. My wife always checks… before I take anything new. She is very careful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Carlotta. It's excellent that you and your wife are so diligent about medications. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… a physical… examination? Yes, yes, that is okay. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. My wife… she always says I need to see the doctor more often. But… I don't like going to the doctor. But… if you think it is important… yes. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. I appreciate your trust. It won't be anything uncomfortable, I assure you. Your blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this time. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and another… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Everything seems within normal limits so far, Mr. Carlotta. Now, I'd like to order a few laboratory tests to get a more comprehensive picture of your health. These will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid profile, and a urinalysis. We'll also check your prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which is a routine screening test for men your age. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests? Yes, yes, that is okay. Whatever you need to do. My wife… she will be happy I am getting all these tests. She worries so much. PSA… what is that for? Is something wrong with my… my prostate?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It's good that your wife is supportive. The PSA test, or prostate-specific antigen, is a blood test used to screen for prostate cancer. It's a very common test for men over a certain age, and it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything wrong. It simply helps us identify any potential issues early on, if they exist. A slightly elevated PSA level doesn't automatically mean you have cancer. Many factors can cause it to rise, including age, benign prostatic hyperplasia—which is an enlarged prostate—and even infection. If the level is elevated, we might recommend further testing, such as a digital rectal exam or an MRI, to get a clearer picture. But for now, let's just focus on getting the initial tests done. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… an enlarged… what did you say? And an MRI? That sounds… complicated. I just want to make sure… everything is okay. For my wife. And… maybe… for a baby. But… I don’t want too many… complicated tests. My wife… she doesn't like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Carlotta. You're right to be concerned about complicated tests, and I assure you, we won’t do anything unnecessary. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, is a very common condition in older men where the prostate gland enlarges. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it can sometimes cause urinary problems. And yes, an MRI is a more advanced imaging test, but we would only consider it if there were a reason to be concerned based on the initial blood work and a physical exam. Let’s start with the basic blood work first. We’ll get those results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and decide what, if any, further steps are needed. The blood draw will be quick and relatively painless. And I can assure your wife that we take every precaution to make it as comfortable as possible. Would you like me to order the tests now?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, order the tests. Let’s just… get it done. My wife… she will be happy. And… maybe then we can… think about a baby. But… not too many needles. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Carlotta. I've ordered the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid profile, and urinalysis, as well as the PSA test. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. I'll let your wife know when the results are back, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I understand your concerns about needles, and I assure you the technician is very skilled and gentle. Please don't hesitate to let me or the technician know if you’re feeling any discomfort. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Carlotta. I’m confident we can get a clear picture of your health and address any concerns you may have.
