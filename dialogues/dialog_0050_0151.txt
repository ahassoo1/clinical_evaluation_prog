DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Uzarski. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Please, call me Teretha. Well, it’s my hands and feet, mostly. They’ve been… tingling. Like pins and needles, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just… bothersome. I just want to know what’s causing it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, "tingling," you say. And how long exactly has this been going on, Teretha?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… maybe six, seven weeks ago? It comes and goes, it’s not constant. Some days are worse than others. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. I've been busy with the mail route… it's hot out there, you know? Does that make a difference?
DOCTOR: A mail route, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm a mail carrier. Been doing it for… well, a long time. Thirty years, I think. It's good work, keeps me moving, but it is a lot of walking, especially this time of year. And standing. My feet get tired, of course, but this tingling is… different. It’s not just tired. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly. Thirty years is a considerable amount of physical exertion. And where specifically are you experiencing this tingling, Teretha?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my fingers and toes, Doctor. Both hands and both feet. Sometimes it goes up my wrists a little, and up my ankles, but mostly just the tips. It's… hard to describe. Like little electric shocks, but not painful, just… weird. And numb sometimes, a little. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: "Electric shocks," and numbness. I see. And does anything specifically trigger this tingling, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think… cold makes it worse. And when I’m really tired, after a long day on the route, it’s definitely worse. But honestly, sometimes it just happens. There’s no real pattern to it. I've tried warming my hands and feet, and that helps a little, but it always comes back. I don't know if that's helpful information? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Teretha. It is always beneficial to understand the nuances of a patient’s experience. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this tingling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. No pain, like I said, just the tingling and the numbness. Sometimes my feet feel a little… heavy, but I figured that was just from being on them all day. Oh! And I’ve been a little clumsier than usual, maybe. Dropped a couple of packages, which is not like me. But that’s about it, I think. I haven't been sick, no fever, nothing like that. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It all matters, Teretha. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Oh, I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that's about it. And I broke my wrist, years ago, but it healed fine. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. I try to eat healthy, you know? Mostly. My husband… my late husband, God rest his soul… he had some heart trouble, but that was him, not me. I don’t take any regular medication, either. Just an aspirin sometimes if I have a headache. Is that enough information? I’m sorry if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, no rambling at all, Teretha. This is all quite useful. Now, and I realize this may be a sensitive topic, given your loss, but was there any family history of neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… neurological… that’s a big word, Doctor. Let me see… not that I know of. My mother had arthritis, pretty bad in her hands, but that was it. And my father… he was healthy as a horse, until the very end. No one ever talked about anything like… nerves, or anything like that. My husband’s mother, she had some trouble with her memory when she got really old, but that's about it. I don't think so, no. Not really. I just want to get this figured out, you know? It worries me.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy if I use a new soap, but that’s about it. No reactions to any medication I’ve ever taken, and I've had a few antibiotics over the years. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Healthy as a horse, my father used to say. Until… well, never mind. Just no allergies, Doctor. None that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, your muscle strength, and assess your sensation. It will involve some simple tests. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to find out what’s going on. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable? I have sensitive skin, you know. But yes, go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please, if you would, have a seat here. First, I’d like to check your reflexes. Please, relax your legs. I’m going to tap just below your kneecap with this small hammer. Normal response bilaterally. Now, let’s check your sensation. Close your eyes, please. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. That tickles a little! Yes, I feel it… there, on my left hand. And… now on my right foot. That’s a little numb, actually. Not as strong as the other one. There… that one feels… faint. Like it’s far away. Is that bad? Oh, and my toes feel cold already. I told you, I have sensitive skin!
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, I’d like to check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Like this? Is that enough? I used to help my husband in the garden, so I still have a little strength, I think. Although it's been a while since I've done much heavy lifting. I worry about getting weaker, you know? It's hard to do things on my own these days. Does that feel strong enough, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, adequate, though slightly diminished on the left side. Now, let’s check your gait. Would you mind walking a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Like this? Is that okay? I'm a little unsteady on my feet sometimes, you know? Especially when I'm tired. I don't want to fall! Does it look… strange? I've been walking this route for thirty years, but now… it feels different. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha, please have a seat. Based on my examination, and your reported symptoms, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The diminished sensation, reduced reflexes, and slightly decreased muscle strength on the left side, coupled with your reported tingling and numbness, could indicate peripheral neuropathy. However, to determine the exact cause, we will need some further testing. I would like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a Vitamin B12 level, and nerve conduction studies. The nerve conduction studies will give us more detailed information about the function of your nerves. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness. Neuropathy… that sounds… serious. And all those tests… blood and… nerves? What causes neuropathy, Doctor? Is it something… bad? And what if the tests show something… terrible? I just want to know what’s going on, but I’m scared, to be honest. Is it something I did? All that walking, maybe? I just want to be able to finish my route, you know? And take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Teretha, it is understandable to be concerned. Neuropathy simply means nerve damage, and there are many potential causes. It can be caused by diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, certain medications, autoimmune diseases, and sometimes, it can occur without a clear cause. Walking itself is unlikely to cause neuropathy, but it can exacerbate symptoms if underlying nerve damage is present. As for the tests, they are necessary to determine the specific cause in your case. It is important to remember that we haven't reached a definitive diagnosis yet. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and develop an appropriate treatment plan. We will discuss the results thoroughly when they are available, and I will answer all of your questions. To rule out other potential causes, I would also like to order an MRI of your cervical spine, just as a precaution, to assess for any compression of the nerves in your neck. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI… Oh my goodness. That sounds… frightening. And all those tests… will they be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see. My husband… he took care of everything. I’m just… on my own now. Will I have to pay a lot of money? I don’t want to be a burden. And if it is bad… what are the treatments? Will I be able to keep working? I just… I don’t know what I would do without my route, you know? It's everything.
DOCTOR: Teretha, I understand your concerns about the cost. Unfortunately, I cannot provide an exact estimate without knowing the specific facility performing the tests. However, I can direct you to the hospital’s financial assistance department, and they can discuss payment options with you. As for treatments, those depend entirely on the underlying cause of the neuropathy. It could range from vitamin supplementation to medication or, in some cases, physical therapy. It is premature to discuss specifics before we have the results of the tests. I will be honest: without knowing the cause, it is impossible to say definitively whether you will be able to continue working. However, we will do everything we can to manage your symptoms and help you maintain your quality of life. I am ordering the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, Vitamin B12 level, nerve conduction studies, and an MRI of the cervical spine. The hospital will contact you to schedule the appointments. Do you have any questions about where to go for these tests?
PATIENT: No, I… I don't think so. Just… when will I hear back? And… will someone explain the results to me? I don't understand medical words, you see. My husband… he always did the talking. I just… I hope it's not too bad. I need to finish my route. Thank you, Doctor. For trying, I mean. I think… I think I’ll just go home now.
DOCTOR: The hospital will contact you within 48 hours to schedule the appointments. And yes, I will personally discuss the results with you in detail, using plain language. I understand your concerns, and I will ensure you fully understand the findings and treatment options. Please, take your time getting home, and don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any urgent questions or concerns before your appointments. Goodbye, Teretha.
