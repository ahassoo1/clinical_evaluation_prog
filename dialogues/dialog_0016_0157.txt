DOCTOR: Hi Tasmia, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like you probably know. My husband made me come. He’s been worried. Honestly, I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure. And your husband is concerned, which is good. It's always good to have someone looking out for you. Even if you feel fine, high blood pressure can still be something we need to address. To get a better understanding, can you tell me when you first found out about it?
PATIENT: Honestly? A few weeks ago, maybe. He took me to that quick clinic down by the highway when I was complaining about headaches. They just… told me numbers and said I needed to see someone. Didn’t really explain much, just pushed pills. I didn’t even fill the prescription. I don’t like taking things if I don’t need them.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about medication, and it’s good you didn’t fill it if you weren’t comfortable. That quick clinic sometimes does rush things. Okay, so headaches were the main reason you went in initially. Can you tell me more about those headaches?
PATIENT: They're just… regular headaches. You know, like when you’re stressed or tired. I work a lot with blueprints, so I’m staring at a screen all day. Sometimes they get bad enough to make me nauseous, but usually, I just push through it. It's nothing a little water and quiet can't fix. My grandma always said rest cures everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – a family remedy is always helpful. So, the headaches are related to screen time and stress, and rest usually helps. Do you notice anything specific that triggers them, besides the screen time and stress?
PATIENT: Specific? No, not really. It’s just… work is busy. Lots of deadlines. And my mother-in-law visits a lot. That’s stressful. Does that count? It's just a general… everything feeling, I guess. It's hard to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: Your mother-in-law definitely counts! That’s a very valid stressor. "General everything feeling" is a good way to put it. Let’s talk a little more about these headaches. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very mild and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate them at their worst?
PATIENT: Ugh, probably a 7, maybe an 8 when they’re really bad. It’s not like a throbbing migraine, it’s more of a… pressure. Like a tight band around my head. And it makes me really tired. I just want to lie down in a dark room. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 7 or 8, pressure around the head, with tiredness, lasting a few hours. That gives me a better picture. Now, let's shift gears a little. Besides the headaches and the blood pressure reading, have you noticed any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Not really. I’ve been a little more… out of breath when I walk up the stairs, now that I think about it. But I’m a little out of shape, to be honest. It's been hot, so I haven’t been doing much walking anyway. Probably just that. I don’t really pay attention to that kind of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some shortness of breath with exertion, possibly related to being out of shape and the heat. That's good to note. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never been sick, really. I mean, the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious. My family… we're just healthy people. My grandma lived to be 95. And my mom's still going strong. So, I don't really worry about that stuff. I eat okay, I guess. Not a lot of junk food. Mostly just… normal food.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear about your family history of good health! And that's good you eat a generally healthy diet. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Like I said, I’ve been lucky. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that’s it. A cast, healed up fine. No big deal. My husband worries too much, honestly. He reads all that stuff online, and then he gets scared about everything.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been very fortunate, and that's great. It's understandable your husband worries, though – it comes from caring about you. Okay, let’s talk about your family history a little more specifically. Do you know if anyone in your family has high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Ugh. This again? Okay, fine. My dad's side... my grandpa had something with his heart. He died when I was little, so I don’t really remember. And my aunt… she has that sugar thing. Diabetes, I think. But that’s it, really. Everyone else is fine. My mom's side is healthy as can be. Honestly, I think my husband is just making a big deal out of nothing. He probably just wants me to slow down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your grandfather had some heart issue and your aunt has diabetes. That's helpful to know. It's good you’re aware of that family history. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Just… nothing. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's it. And I drink a lot of water. That’s what my grandma always said. Water fixes everything. Honestly, I don't like pills. They make me feel weird. My husband tries to get me to take stuff for everything, but I just don't. I prefer to deal with things myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin occasionally and a lot of water – good habits. And I understand your reluctance to take medication. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. I'm Navajo, we eat all sorts of things. My husband always asks, but no. Nothing. I’m pretty sure I’d know if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I? I’m not one of those people who breaks out in hives over everything. Honestly, this is taking a long time. Can we just get this over with? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right, you'd certainly know if you had an allergy. And I apologize for taking so long – I just want to make sure I have a complete picture. Before we move on to a physical exam, let's quickly talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. Don’t even suggest it. My family doesn't do that. It's bad for your health, obviously. I drink coffee, sometimes. That's it. And I work hard. Long hours. That's my lifestyle. Just… work. I don’t have time for anything else. Can we please just check my blood pressure now? I really need to get back to the office.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, just coffee and hard work. That’s good to know. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again to confirm the reading. Then we can discuss everything and make a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… hurry up. I have deadlines. And please, don’t tell me I need to change my whole life. I don’t have time for that. Just tell me what’s wrong and what I need to do to fix it, quickly.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and efficient as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 150 over 92. I'm hearing a normal heart rhythm, but there's a slight murmur. Your lungs sound clear. I'm also noting your pulse is a little fast, around 88 beats per minute. It's a bit higher than ideal. Do you feel anything when I'm listening to your heart?
PATIENT: No! What’s a murmur? Is that bad? You're scaring me now. I told you I was fine. See? This is why I don’t like doctors. You always find something wrong. I don't feel anything. Just… my heart beating. Like it always does. And my pulse is fast because I’m stressed! From being here!
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, deep breaths. A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes when blood flows through it. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but it’s something we need to investigate further. It's good you don’t feel anything, that’s a positive sign. And yes, being stressed can definitely raise your pulse. Now, I want to be upfront. Your blood pressure is elevated, and the murmur warrants further investigation. It's good we're catching this now so we can address it. I’m going to order a few tests - an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity and some bloodwork to check your kidney function and cholesterol levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests?! Ugh. Seriously? Now you’re just trying to make me worry more. My husband is going to be thrilled. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. But I'm telling you, it’s just stress. And too much coffee. I don't want to be on medication for the rest of my life. Can I at least get a referral to someone else? Someone who won't order a million tests? I don’t even like hospitals. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, and I want to assure you I'm not trying to make you worry. The tests are just a precaution to get a clearer picture of what's going on and rule out any potential issues. We can definitely discuss a referral to another physician if you'd prefer. I want you to feel comfortable and confident in your care. Before we proceed with the tests and referral, let’s quickly review some lifestyle modifications we can start today while we await the results. These are things you can do regardless of the test outcomes. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. But I’m warning you, I don’t have time for a whole lot of changes. I work. That's my life. Just tell me what I absolutely have to do, quickly. Don't tell me to start running marathons or something. I barely have time to sleep.
DOCTOR: Definitely no marathons! I completely understand. The goal isn't a drastic overhaul, just a few small adjustments. First, let's focus on reducing your caffeine intake. Try to limit your coffee to one cup a day, or switch to decaf. Secondly, let's aim for at least 30 minutes of light exercise most days of the week – a brisk walk during your lunch break would be great. And finally, try to incorporate some stress-reducing techniques into your daily routine, like deep breathing exercises or meditation. Even five minutes a day can make a difference. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Light exercise?! When?! Deep breathing? I barely have time to breathe! This is pointless. Okay, fine. I’ll try to cut back on the coffee. But that's it. I'm not promising anything else. And I want a referral. To someone who understands I have a job. And a life. I don’t have time for all this… fluff. Just give me the paperwork. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s a great start – cutting back on coffee is a positive step. And I absolutely respect your time constraints. Here are the referral and lab order forms. I’ve also included a handout on stress management techniques. I've also pre-filled some information for you. The cardiologist's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. They will need your insurance information, which I will provide on the faxed referral. I will also have my nurse come in and take your blood pressure one last time before you leave. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… thank you, I guess. I still think this is ridiculous, but… thank you. And please, don’t tell my husband I said that. He'll never let it go. I just want to go home now. Can I just… leave?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can definitely leave now. I completely understand your frustration, and I want to assure you we’re doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. And don't worry, I won't mention anything to your husband. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And take care of yourself. Have a good day, Tasmia.
PATIENT: .
