DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. So, Ms. Cantoran, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. It's this… tiredness. It's just getting to me. And… well, it’s weird. I keep wanting to eat… dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I just…do. Does that make any sense? I don't know why I'm doing it. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Dirt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Like… clay. From the garden. Don't look at me like that. It's not like I'm enjoying it, okay? It just… feels like I need it sometimes. And it’s not helping the tiredness, obviously. My husband… well, he used to say I was crazy. He’s gone now, though. A long time ago. Point is, this is new-ish, and I really just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, this is… unusual. And frankly, a little concerning. We need to establish a timeline. How long has this… craving been occurring?
PATIENT: Timeline? Honestly, I don't keep track of things like that. Maybe… a few months? It started small, just a little bit here and there. I thought it was just stress, you know? Life’s been… hard. But it’s getting worse. I don't know when it started exactly. It all just… blurs together after a while. I just know I feel awful. More tired all the time, and I keep wanting to eat the stuff. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: “Blurring together” isn’t particularly helpful, Ms. Cantoran. We need specifics if we're going to figure this out. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? Look, I already told you I’m tired. And I eat dirt. What more do you want? I don’t sit around cataloging my every little feeling, okay? My memory isn’t what it used to be, either. Everything just… feels like a big mess. I just want a fix! Can’t you just give me something for the tiredness?
DOCTOR: We need to rule out certain deficiencies, Ms. Cantoran. And frankly, the… ingestion of non-food items is not something we can simply ignore. Do you have any difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No! I breathe just fine. I mean, I get winded going up the stairs, but that’s just because I’m… out of shape. And tired. Everything comes back to the tiredness, don’t you see? Look, I work with computers all day, designing things, and I just don’t have the energy anymore. It’s affecting my work. Now, can we please skip the twenty questions and just do something? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: “Skipping the twenty questions” is not how medicine works, Ms. Cantoran. But very well. Let's proceed with a basic physical exam, then. Please lie down on the examination table. And try to relax. Though I suspect that may be difficult.
PATIENT: Relax? Easy for you to say. Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. I don't like doctors, never have. And I really don't have the patience for all this. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Lungs sound… clear, though somewhat diminished. Now, open your mouth, please. Hmm. Tongue appears slightly pale. No obvious lesions. Blood pressure is 110 over 70. Pulse is 72, regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Now, let's check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are… present, but diminished. Overall, physical exam is relatively unremarkable, aside from the diminished reflexes and pale tongue. However, that doesn't explain the… unusual craving. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never really had to take much, thankfully. Just… the usual aches and pains. My husband used to give me something for them, a little white pill, but I don’t remember what it was called. He handled all that. Everything's blurry, honestly. It's like my brain just… doesn’t want to remember anything. And stop asking about pills, alright? It’s just… depressing. Is this getting us anywhere? I feel like I'm wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, your lack of cooperation is hindering our progress. We need to establish a baseline, and that requires accurate information. Let’s try a different approach. Have you experienced any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Weight? Honestly, I haven't stepped on a scale in… ages. Probably lost a few pounds, though. Everything tastes like dirt these days, it doesn’t have much flavor, so I don't eat much. I used to enjoy cooking, but now… what's the point? It just makes me feel worse. Look, are you going to help me or not? This tiredness is ruining my life, and I don't understand why this is taking so long.
DOCTOR: According to your chart, your last recorded weight was 84 kilograms approximately six months ago. And your height is 164 centimeters. That puts your BMI at… 31.1. That is considered obese. Given your symptoms, your weight, and your… unusual craving, I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a ferritin level. We need to rule out iron deficiency anemia, though frankly, the craving for dirt – known as pica – is also seen in other deficiencies. A phlebotomist will come in shortly to draw your blood. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, great. Just what I needed. Fine. Whatever. As long as it gets me closer to feeling normal. But hurry up, alright? I have things to do. And please, don't poke me too much. I hate needles. This whole thing is just… ridiculous. Are you sure there isn't a pill you can just give me?
DOCTOR: "Just a pill" is rarely the answer, Ms. Cantoran. We need to understand the cause of your symptoms before we can determine the appropriate treatment. The phlebotomist should be with you shortly. Once we have the lab results, we'll discuss them and formulate a plan. Please remain seated and try to relax. And I would advise against consuming any further… soil until we have a clearer understanding of your condition. .
