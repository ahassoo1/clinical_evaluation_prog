DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's get this over with. It's this… heartburn. And stuff coming back up. It's unpleasant, to say the least. Been happening for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of heartburn and regurgitation. I understand you'd like to be quick about this. Let's try to be efficient. Can you tell me a little more about this "stuff" that's coming back up?
PATIENT: It’s… food, mostly. Undigested food. And sometimes… a sour taste. Like vinegar, almost. It usually happens after I eat, especially if I bend over. Honestly, it's just… not dignified. I eat a good meal, then blugh. Not a good look for an Emergency Management Director, believe me.
DOCTOR: Right, food regurgitation with a sour taste, worse after eating and when bending over. Okay. And how often would you say this is happening?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not every meal, thankfully. But… probably three or four times a week. Sometimes more if I have something… rich. You know, good Polish food. Sauerkraut, kielbasa… things like that. It’s a shame, really. I used to have an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four times a week, worse with richer foods. Have you noticed anything else happening along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I’ve been… a bit more gassy, maybe. And sometimes, after it happens, there’s a bit of a cough. Like something… irritated my throat. Not a bad cough, just… annoying. And, well, I wouldn't say it’s pain, exactly, but there’s this… burning feeling in my chest. Not always, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gas, a bit of a cough after episodes, and sometimes a burning sensation in your chest. Do you feel this burning sensation only after the episodes, or at other times as well?
PATIENT: Mostly after, yes. Though… now that you mention it, sometimes I get it when I lie down flat. Especially if I've eaten within the last couple of hours. It’s not crippling or anything, just… uncomfortable. And it keeps me up at night, which is just… fantastic. I have important meetings to prepare for, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Burning with lying flat, worse after eating. Okay. Let’s move on to some other things quickly. Do you have any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Trouble swallowing? No, not exactly. Food goes down fine. It’s staying down that’s the problem. It doesn't feel blocked, or anything. Just… rebellious. It wants to come back up, apparently. I'm a perfectly healthy man, you know. I don't understand why my stomach is staging a protest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no difficulty swallowing. Any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, absolutely not! If anything, I could stand to lose a few pounds. My wife makes a very good dinner. A very generous dinner. I'm a solid 210, always have been. Though, I suppose… I haven't been eating as much sauerkraut lately, because of this whole… situation. But that’s not weight loss, that’s just… sensible eating.
DOCTOR: Okay, no weight loss. Any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. High blood pressure, maybe, but it’s under control with medication. Been on it for years. And… my knees ache a bit, getting older, you know. But that’s it. Nothing that would cause this. I’m a strong man, Dr. Vanochten. I don't fall apart easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, well controlled, and some knee pain. And you’re taking medication for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. Every morning. I remember things, alright? Don’t underestimate me. And frankly, I’m starting to wonder if this whole thing is a side effect. Is that possible? It would be just my luck.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, 10mg daily. It is possible that the medication is contributing, though less common. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've taken all sorts of things over the years. Pills for colds, aches, whatever. Never had a reaction. I’m a pretty resilient guy, honestly. Though… I’m not thrilled about the thought of taking more pills just to counteract the effects of the ones I’m already on. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm a busy man.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. One last quick thing. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, it was awful. And alcohol… I have a beer with dinner sometimes. Maybe two. Nothing excessive. A Polish man enjoys his beer, you understand. It’s part of the culture. But it’s not causing this, I assure you. I’m a moderate man in all things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Altine. Let's do a quick exam. Just need to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. Then we'll see what we find.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let's get it over with. The quicker the better. Don’t poke too hard, alright? I’ve got important things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some tenderness in the upper part of your stomach when I press here. No masses or distention. Do you feel any pain when I press right here?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s it! Right there. It’s not sharp pain, more like… a burning sensation. It’s been worse lately, actually. It’s good you found it. Finally. Though, honestly, I could have told you that myself. I know my own body. This isn’t rocket science, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, tenderness in the upper abdomen. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, possibly with some esophagitis. The Lisinopril could be contributing, but it's not definitive. To be sure, I’d like to try a proton pump inhibitor – a medication to reduce stomach acid – for a few weeks. I'll also order a blood test to rule out anything else. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Proton pump… what now? Look, I don’t want to be on any more pills than I have to be. Can’t I just… stop taking the Lisinopril? That sounds simpler. And frankly, I’m not convinced this is anything serious. It’s probably just a bad batch of kielbisa. I’m not a fan of taking pills for things I could probably fix myself with a little bit of sensible eating and less stress. It’s just… not how I operate.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to add medication. Stopping the Lisinopril is not advisable without consulting your cardiologist. High blood pressure needs to be managed. And while a dietary change is important, it doesn’t always resolve GERD. We need to address the underlying cause, and the medication will help us determine if the acid is contributing. Let’s start with the proton pump inhibitor for two weeks. If it doesn't help, then we can discuss other options, including a referral to a gastroenterologist. I'm also going to recommend some lifestyle changes – avoid eating large meals before bed, elevate the head of your bed, and avoid trigger foods like spicy or fatty foods. What do you say?
PATIENT: Fine. Two weeks. But if it makes me feel worse, I’m stopping it immediately. And don't tell me about elevating the head of my bed, I know about that. My wife's been telling me that for years. It's just... all so inconvenient. But two weeks, I guess. Just get it over with. And no unnecessary blood tests, alright? I have a city to run, Dr. Vanochten.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll write a prescription for Omeprazole, 20mg once daily, for two weeks. And I’ll order a basic metabolic panel – just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. It’s standard procedure. Here's the prescription and the lab order. You can get the lab work done at the clinic downstairs. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing. If your symptoms worsen significantly before then, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just... let's hope this works. I need to get going. Don't waste my time with unnecessary phone calls, alright? I'm a busy man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. You have a good day. And please, contact us if anything changes. .
