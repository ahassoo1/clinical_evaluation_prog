DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I'm Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Right. Well, to be honest, it's… a bit of a blur, trying to remember exactly why I scheduled this. Something about not sleeping well, I think? And maybe getting… less useless? My wife, bless her, always said I needed to be more active. She’d be… well. Anyway, yeah, sleep and not being a total waste of space, I guess. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: “A bit of a blur,” yes. Vague complaints are… not particularly helpful, Mr. Redfern. But alright. So, difficulty sleeping, and a perceived lack of… motivation. Let's try to be specific. When did this difficulty sleeping begin?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics. See, that’s the problem. It feels like… always? Maybe after… everything. Honestly, doctor, trying to pinpoint a date is… pointless. It's just been… off. Not horrible off, just… not good. Like I wake up tired, even if I've been in bed for eight hours. Does that make sense? I don’t keep a diary or anything.
DOCTOR: "After everything," you say. I see. And what, precisely, does “everything” entail, Mr. Redfern?
PATIENT: It… she passed. My wife. A year, maybe a little more, ago. It wasn’t… sudden. Cancer. Long story. Look, I’m not here to rehash the tragedy of my personal life. It just feels like things haven't been right since. Everything's just… muted. Sleep's part of that, I assume. I'm not a psychiatrist, I just want to feel less… drained.
DOCTOR: Right. Loss of a spouse. Naturally, that would have an impact. I suppose we can proceed under the assumption that this is grief-related. Although, simply attributing it to grief without further investigation is… unsatisfactory. Let’s move on. Aside from the fatigue and sleep disturbance, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… I get a bit winded sometimes, walking up the stairs. Nothing major. And… I've lost interest in most things, I suppose. Used to love restoring old instruments, spending hours on the detail. Now… it feels like a chore. Appetite's okay, I eat when I'm hungry. Honestly, doctor, I'm not falling apart here. Just… not firing on all cylinders. Does that explain anything? I feel like you're looking for something dramatic.
DOCTOR: "Not dramatic" is precisely the problem, Mr. Redfern. Subtle changes can indicate serious underlying issues. We are attempting to establish a baseline here. Loss of interest, shortness of breath… these warrant further consideration. Have you noticed any palpitations, chest pain, or swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Palpitations? No. Chest pain, no. Ankles… …they look normal, don’t they? Honestly, I spend most of my time sitting, hunched over a workbench. I doubt swelling ankles are a major concern. I really think it's just… the grief, doctor. A year is a long time to be… okay. Maybe my body’s just catching up? I don't want a load of tests if it's just that. I’ve got work to do.
DOCTOR: Your medical history, as entered into the system, notes a height of 190 centimeters and a weight of 105 kilograms. Correct?
PATIENT: Uh… yes, I suppose so. Though… are you sure? I haven't been weighed recently. That sounds… a bit light, doesn’t it? For my height. I’m a big fella. Mostly muscle, though. Years of working with instruments. Precise movements, you know. It builds strength. I wouldn’t say I’m thin. Maybe the numbers are off?
DOCTOR: The records were updated six months ago, Mr. Redfern. A Body Mass Index of 29.1 would place you in the overweight category. While “mostly muscle” is a convenient assertion, it does not negate the clinical findings. May I proceed with a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Overweight? Look, doctor, I told you I’m a big guy. I’m not unhealthy. And frankly, this feels like a waste of time. I came here about sleep, not to be lectured on my… proportions. If you insist on poking and prodding, fine, get it over with. But I’m telling you now, it won’t show anything. Just do whatever you need to do so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s begin with auscultation of your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 135/88. Pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Examination unremarkable.
PATIENT: Unremarkable, huh? See? Told you. Now can we talk about the sleep? I'm starting to feel like I’m being examined for a condition I don’t have. What’s next, a blood test? I really think this is overkill, doctor. Just tell me what I can do to get a decent night’s rest. Maybe a sleeping pill or something? I'm not asking for a miracle, just a little help.
DOCTOR: While a “sleeping pill” is certainly an option, it addresses the symptom, not the underlying cause. Given your history of grief, and the lack of any acute findings, I recommend a trial of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, or CBT-I. I can provide a referral to a qualified therapist. Additionally, I strongly advise establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and limiting caffeine and alcohol intake before bed. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: CBT-I… Therapy? Honestly, doctor, that sounds… exhausting. I’m already tired. Regular sleep schedule? Easier said than done when you’re… well, never mind. Look, I appreciate the advice, but I really don’t think that’s for me. Is there anything else? A simple pill, even? I’m not opposed to medication if it will just help me sleep. I just want to feel normal again, and I’m not sure therapy is the answer. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I can prescribe a short course of zolpidem, 5mg, to be taken orally one hour before bedtime. However, I must emphasize this is a temporary solution. Prolonged use can lead to dependence and unwanted side effects. I will also provide a handout outlining the risks and benefits. Do you understand?
