DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ambris. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time for this. It's my breath. It smells. Badly. People have...commented. It’s embarrassing, okay? I work outside, it's not exactly a glamorous job, but still.
DOCTOR: “Commented,” you say. And how long has this been occurring, Ms. Ambris?
PATIENT: Honestly? Probably forever. It’s just…worse lately. Since…well, since everything. Look, does it matter when it started? It smells bad now. Can’t you just…give me something for it?
DOCTOR: While I understand your frustration, Ms. Ambris, simply providing a “something for it” without understanding the cause of the odor would be…unprofessional, and potentially ineffective. There are numerous reasons for halitosis, as it’s medically termed. To determine the appropriate course of action, I’ll need to ask a few questions. It does matter when it started, as sudden onset suggests a different issue than something long-standing. And could you describe the smell, if you can?
PATIENT: “Halitosis?” Seriously? Look, I told you, it smells bad. Like…old garbage, maybe? I don’t know. I’m not a chemist. And like I said, I don’t have time for a twenty-minute investigation. I work on the highway. It's hot. I eat when I can. Is that helpful enough? It started being noticeably worse…probably a few months ago. Since…the divorce. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, while I appreciate your…candor, a divorce is not typically a direct cause of halitosis. However, stress can contribute to certain conditions that cause it. We still need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, here we go. Look, I don't have time for this. What kind of symptoms? I'm a highway worker, not a delicate flower. I'm tired, I'm usually dirty, and I probably drink too much coffee to stay awake. Does that cover it? I just want something to make my breath not smell like…well, you know. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Ambris, it is not too much to ask. However, to proceed responsibly, I need a more complete picture. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, acid reflux, sinus issues, anything at all?
PATIENT: Look, I've had the usual colds, a broken wrist once when I fell off a ladder…nothing major. No diabetes, no…reflux, whatever that is. I'm not a frequent flyer at the doctor's office. I work. I fix roads. That's about it. And honestly, I don't see how any of this is relevant to my breath. It just smells. Can we please just skip to the part where you give me a mint or something? Or a spray? Anything?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, a thorough assessment is crucial. Now, have you had any dental work recently?
PATIENT: Look, are you seriously asking me this? I had a filling, maybe, five years ago? I go to the dentist when something hurts. I don't go for “check-ups.” I have better things to do. Honestly, this is ridiculous. You're a doctor, shouldn't you just know what's wrong with my breath by now? It smells bad! Is that not enough information? .
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, with all due respect, I cannot provide a diagnosis – or appropriate treatment – without a proper examination and a more complete understanding of your medical background. I understand you’re busy, but I am obligated to conduct a responsible assessment. Since you are unwilling to cooperate with a basic medical evaluation, I suggest you consult another physician. The receptionist will process your co-pay. .
