DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Um... the lady on the phone said I should come. Something about... learning? I don't really remember. It's...for my job, I think. Sheet metal...it's noisy. Very noisy.
DOCTOR: Right. Learning. Yes. Well, the clinic does offer some industrial health assessments. That would involve checking your hearing, primarily. Given the sheet metal work. So, it seems this "learning" is a mandated assessment due to noise exposure. Let's start with a little more detail. How long have you been working with sheet metal?
PATIENT: Ugh. A long time. Maybe... ten years? Something like that. It's hard to keep track. My husband does the numbers, not me. It's... loud. Always loud. Do I have to tell you everything about my job? It's just metal. Cutting, bending...you know. Metal stuff.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fontanazza, a detailed description is… helpful. Particularly when assessing potential noise-induced hearing loss. “Metal stuff” isn’t sufficient for proper documentation, unfortunately. Are you provided with any hearing protection at your workplace?
PATIENT: Hearing… protection? Like… earplugs? Sometimes. When I remember to take them. They're… uncomfortable. And they make my ears sweat. I usually just try to ignore the noise. It’s always been loud, you know? I'm used to it. My coworkers don’t bother with them much either.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any changes in your hearing recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm... well, sometimes things sound... muffled. Especially after a long day. Or if there's a lot of yelling. It's hard to say. My husband says I don’t listen, so maybe I’m just getting old! Is that what you’re asking? I don't know if it's my ears or my brain.
DOCTOR: It's important to differentiate, Ms. Fontanazza. And it's far too early to attribute anything to age. We’ll need to perform a formal hearing test to objectively assess the situation. Let's start with a quick examination of your ears. Could you please sit up and face me?
PATIENT: Ugh, another test? Fine. But don't stick anything in my ears. I don't like that. My sister once got an ear infection from one of those things... and it was awful. Just... look at the outside, okay? Don’t go poking around.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will simply perform an external examination, then. It will be limited, of course. I observe some slight redness on both ear canals, and a small amount of cerumen—earwax—present. It doesn’t appear to be impacted, thankfully. Now, to proceed with the audiological assessment, I will need to use an audiometer to evaluate your hearing thresholds. It involves wearing headphones and responding to tones. Are you willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Headphones? Like… music headphones? I guess so. As long as they’re clean. And you promise not to stick anything inside my ears! What if I can’t hear the tones? Will I fail? I don’t like tests. Honestly, I don’t see why I have to do all this. It’s just a job.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, this assessment is being performed to determine if prolonged noise exposure has impacted your hearing, and to establish a baseline for future monitoring. It’s a preventative measure, and quite frankly, a necessary one given your occupation. You won’t “fail.” The test simply measures your ability to hear different frequencies and volumes. If you cannot hear a tone, you indicate that. It doesn't reflect on your intelligence or any personal failing. Please, have a seat in this chair and I'll explain the procedure. It will take approximately twenty to thirty minutes. It's important to be honest with your responses. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Twenty to thirty minutes?! Ugh. Fine. But if it gets uncomfortable, I'm stopping. And I want a glass of water afterwards. Is that okay? You said I won’t “fail”, right? Just tell me what I’m supposed to do, and I’ll try. Don’t make it complicated.
DOCTOR: Perfectly acceptable. A glass of water afterwards, certainly. And yes, I assure you, you won’t "fail." This isn’t a pass or fail situation. You’ll be listening for a series of tones through these headphones. When you hear a tone, please press the button under your hand. It’s very simple. We’ll begin with your right ear. I will start at a low volume and gradually increase it until you can hear the tone. Please, just let me know when you hear something – anything – and press the button. Let’s begin.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I’m listening. I don't hear anything... it’s just… quiet. Very quiet. Is this supposed to be happening? Maybe the headphones aren't working?
DOCTOR: The headphones are functioning correctly, Ms. Fontanazza. Sometimes it takes a few moments to adjust. We’ll proceed systematically. Still nothing?
PATIENT: No. Still nothing. It's just… silence. Maybe I need to clean my ears? My husband says I never listen, maybe they’re just full of… stuff? Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. It appears that you have significant difficulty hearing at multiple frequencies in both ears. Given the results of this initial screening, and your occupation, I recommend a referral to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation. This will determine the extent of the hearing loss, and guide us in developing an appropriate plan—potentially including hearing aids or other interventions. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hearing aids?! No! No hearing aids! I don’t need hearing aids! I just work with metal! It’s a little noisy, that’s all! Are you sure you’re doing this right? Maybe you should try again? I don’t want hearing aids! I just want to go home! .
DOCTOR: Please, sit down, Ms. Fontanazza. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. A comprehensive evaluation does not automatically mean you require hearing aids. It simply provides a more accurate assessment. However, given your reported noise exposure and these preliminary findings, it's prudent to investigate further. I understand your apprehension, but ignoring potential hearing loss could lead to more significant problems down the road. I will provide you with a referral to a reputable audiologist in the area. You are not obligated to follow through, but I strongly advise it. I will also document these findings and recommend the use of appropriate hearing protection at your workplace—earplugs or earmuffs—regardless of whether you pursue further evaluation. Here is the contact information for Dr. Eleanor Vance. Please schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
