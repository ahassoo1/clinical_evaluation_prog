DOCTOR: Hi Chanz, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Dr. Maskal, is it? Yeah, well, it's…sleep, mostly. And feeling a bit… blah, I guess. Not exactly unfit, you know? I used to be quite active, back… well, never mind. It’s just not been the same lately. Honestly, I can’t really pinpoint what’s wrong, which is annoying. It's just… less. Everything’s less.
DOCTOR: Okay, "less" is a good starting point. It's common for things to build up gradually, so not pinpointing it immediately isn’t unusual. Let’s try to unpack that a bit. When you say "less," can you tell me more specifically what feels different?
PATIENT: Different… hmm. Like, I used to bounce outta bed, ready to go. Now? It's a…negotiation. And the energy… it's just not there. I used to fix clocks, you know? Delicate work. Needed a steady hand, good focus. Now I find myself… distracted. And tired. More tired than I should be, considering. It’s not like I’m doing manual labour anymore, not properly. Mostly fiddling with strings and reeds, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a change in your energy levels, difficulty with focus, and feeling tired despite not having a physically demanding job. And it sounds like this is impacting things you enjoy – your clockwork. That's helpful to know. Let's talk about the sleep a little more. You said it's a negotiation to get out of bed – what does that look like?
PATIENT: It’s… hitting snooze. A lot. More than is sensible, frankly. And then just…lying there. Staring at the ceiling. Trying to remember if I even dreamt. And when I do finally get up, I’m still… fuzzy. Like there’s cotton wool in my head. It takes a good hour, at least, to feel… vaguely human. And even then, it’s not the same. It’s not a proper wake-up, it's more… a reluctantly surfacing.
DOCTOR: Okay, hitting snooze repeatedly, feeling unrefreshed after sleep, and that “cotton wool” feeling in the morning – those are all things that suggest we need to explore what’s going on with your sleep quality. Do you have any trouble falling asleep, or is it more the issue of staying asleep and feeling rested?
PATIENT: Staying asleep, mostly. Falling asleep isn’t usually a problem. I’m…quite good at relaxing, if I’m honest. Always have been. It’s keeping it going. I wake up. A lot. Not necessarily needing anything, just… awake. And then I try to get back to sleep. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And each time it takes longer and longer, you know? It's... irritating. And then I lie there thinking about…things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you fall asleep easily, but have frequent awakenings throughout the night, and it's becoming harder to fall back asleep. And when you're awake, you find yourself thinking about things. It sounds like your mind is active at night. Do you know what those "things" are generally?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. Just…stuff. Old memories, mostly. Regrets, I suppose. And work. Things I should have done differently. Clocks I didn’t finish. It’s…a jumble. Nothing specific, just…background noise. Annoying background noise that prevents proper rest. It’s not like I’m actively worrying, it’s just…there. And it’s worse if I have a quiet evening. Counterintuitive, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That is counterintuitive, actually. Sometimes a bit of mental stimulation during the day can actually help with sleep. The fact that it's worse on quiet evenings is definitely something to note. It suggests this isn't necessarily anxiety-driven, but more… ruminative thoughts. Let's take a step back for a moment. Besides the sleep and the fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not really. I’ve lost my appetite a bit, I suppose. Nothing drastic. Just…not feeling hungry. And I get…irritable. Snappy with people. Which is unlike me. Usually. I try to avoid confrontation, you know? So it’s not a major problem, I just…don’t enjoy being around people as much anymore. It’s…exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a decreased appetite, irritability, and a feeling of exhaustion when socializing. Those, combined with the sleep issues, fatigue, and ruminative thoughts, are starting to paint a more complete picture. Before we move on, I'm going to ask a few more general health questions. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Probably. A bit. Down, I think. Not a huge amount. I haven’t been actively trying to lose weight, though. It’s just… the appetite thing, I suppose. I'm not a big eater at the best of times, and now…less so. I wouldn’t say I'm wasting away, but I’m certainly not as robust as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, a modest weight loss. And you've mentioned not being a big eater to begin with. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. Old age, probably. No, seriously. Just the usual aches and pains, you know? Nothing major. I had a bit of a bad back a few years ago, but that cleared up with physiotherapy. And…well, my wife… but that was…a long time ago. Apart from that, nothing. I'm reasonably healthy, for my age. Or I was.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical diagnoses, a history of back pain that resolved with physiotherapy, and a difficult time in the past. I appreciate you sharing that. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've always been lucky, I suppose. Avoided any serious illnesses or injuries. Just the odd scrape and bruise, you know? Nothing that required a trip to the operating theatre. I've always believed in looking after myself. Or I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgical history. And you’ve mentioned you used to prioritize looking after yourself, so it sounds like things have shifted recently. Let’s talk about your family. Do you have any significant family medical history – anything that runs in your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she had problems with her heart, towards the end. And my father… he was always a bit… forgetful. Put it down to old age, mostly. But he did get confused a lot in his later years. Not dementia, exactly, just… a bit vague. And my wife’s side… mostly just the usual things. Nothing particularly worrying. I suppose everyone gets something, eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems on your mother's side and some cognitive decline on your father's side. That's helpful information. Now, a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never. Absolutely not. Disgusting habit. Always have been opposed to it. My wife…she did, briefly, when she was younger. But she gave it up years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: A glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. A beer if I’m watching football. Nothing excessive. I'm not a big drinker. I enjoy a good conversation more than a good drink, if I’m honest. It’s just…socially, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, light to moderate alcohol consumption. Now, final question for now. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm. Just… paracetamol, if I have a headache. Very occasionally. Nothing regular. And… I used to take something for my back, but I stopped when the physiotherapy worked. Apart from that, no. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. A good cup of tea usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional paracetamol and no regular medications. Alright Chanz, thank you for that detailed information. Based on what you’ve told me, and reviewing your record, we need to investigate a few things. Your symptoms – fatigue, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, irritability, and ruminative thoughts – could be related to several different things. It sounds like this has been impacting your quality of life, and it's good you came in to get it checked out.
PATIENT: Good. Because honestly, I'm starting to feel like a shadow of my former self. What sort of things are we talking about, then? And will it involve… complicated tests? I’m not fond of hospitals, you know. Always smell of disinfectant and… sadness.
DOCTOR: I understand your aversion to hospitals. We can definitely start with some simpler tests here in the clinic, and avoid a hospital visit if possible. Some possibilities we need to consider include vitamin deficiencies – particularly vitamin D and B12 – thyroid problems, and depression. It's also important to rule out any underlying physical conditions. Sometimes, even something like anemia can cause fatigue and other symptoms like yours. So, I'd like to order a full blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D and B12 level. I’ll also give you a short questionnaire to help assess your mood and rule out any signs of depression. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A lot of blood, then? I always feel faint after giving blood. And a questionnaire? Oh, dear. I’m terrible at questionnaires. I tend to ramble. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… try not to make it too complicated, please. And could we do the blood test first? Get it over with?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can definitely do the blood test first. We only need a small sample, so it shouldn’t be too much. The phlebotomist is very good, and we’ll make sure you're comfortable. I'll also be here to help with the questionnaire - we can take it slowly and I can guide you through it. Okay, let's get you set up with the blood test. I’ll just step out to get the phlebotomist. And then we’ll get you comfortable and start with the questionnaire. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Fine. A plan. Though I still think it’s all a bit… excessive. Still. Better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long, alright? I’m not fond of being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. I'll be as quick as possible. And I'll come back and explain everything as we go along. I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: .
