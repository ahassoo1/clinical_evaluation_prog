DOCTOR: Alright, Emileigh, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um… hi. It’s nice to meet you too, I think. I just… moved here. With my husband. And I gotta… get checked out? For, like, regular stuff. I think that’s what he said. It’s all kinda new. Medicare said I should come.
DOCTOR: Okay, “regular stuff.” That’s a good start. Medicare does like to get everyone checked out, make sure nothing’s brewing. And welcome to the area. Moving is stressful enough without adding doctor's appointments to it. So, to clarify, are you having any specific concerns right now?
PATIENT: Specific…? Not… really? I mean, I get tired. But I always get tired. And my back kinda hurts sometimes, from work. I build stuff. Mechanical things. But I don’t know if that’s… a problem problem. It just… is. Does that make sense? I’m not good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some back pain. That’s… helpful. “Helpful” meaning it gives us something to work with. Building mechanical things… that definitely could be contributing to the back pain. But we need to figure out if it’s just from work, or if something else is going on. Let’s start with the fatigue. When you say you always get tired, can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Like… all the time kinda tired. Even when I sleep. Not like, can’t-get-out-of-bed tired, just… heavy. And I gotta have coffee. Lots of coffee. To get through the day. I don't remember being this tired before, but… things are kinda blurry, you know? It’s been a while since I saw a doctor regularly. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I'm probably not being very clear.
DOCTOR: Blurry is okay. We'll work through it. Persistent fatigue, needing a lot of coffee to function… that does raise a few flags. It could be a lot of things, honestly. Stress from the move, not adjusting to a new routine, something else entirely. Before we dive deeper into that, let’s talk about your back pain. Where exactly does it hurt?
PATIENT: Right here. Mostly when I'm bending, or lifting stuff. Or after a long day at work. It’s not… sharp. Just a dull ache. Sometimes it goes down my legs a little, but not always. And I can usually… push through it. Like, take some ibuprofen and keep going. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I forget what my old doctor said about pain. Everything’s kinda mixed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, aggravated by bending and lifting, radiating down the legs sometimes, relieved with ibuprofen. That’s good information. And it’s important you are able to relieve it somewhat with medication. Now, just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness…? Um… sometimes. Not all the time. Like, when I’ve been standing for a long time. Or if I’m really tired. It’s… hard to describe. It’s not like, can’t-feel-my-leg numbness, just… kinda… fuzzy. Does that make sense? Everything feels fuzzy sometimes.
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy” is… noted. Okay, so fatigue, persistent back pain, occasional radiating pain with some numbness or tingling, and a dependence on caffeine. We need to rule out a few things. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need. Just… try not to make it too weird? I don't like being poked and prodded. And… is this gonna take long? My husband is expecting me back.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll keep it as comfortable as possible. It won’t be anything too invasive, I promise. Just some basic neurological checks, feeling your reflexes, checking your range of motion. It shouldn't take more than fifteen or twenty minutes, tops. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then we’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Is it cold? It feels kinda cold. I don't like cold tables. Just… let me know if you're gonna poke me hard? I don't have a high pain tolerance.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This will just involve a little tap on your knee and ankle. Okay, and now the other side. Noted. Now, I want you to squeeze my hands as hard as you can. And finally, I’m going to check your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch your feet?
PATIENT: Ow… That's kinda weak, isn't it? I used to be able to squeeze harder. And yeah, I can feel it… kinda. It's like… not as strong as it should be? It feels… distant. Like I'm touching it with a glove on. Everything feels weird. Is something wrong? Are my hands broken?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, we have sluggish reflexes, reduced grip strength, and decreased sensation in your feet. Coupled with the fatigue and back pain, this points towards a possible neurological issue. It's not necessarily something serious, but it warrants further investigation. I’m going to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies and inflammation. We’ll also need to get an MRI of your spine to rule out any nerve compression. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye…? I don't know what that is. I don't think so? I've never had an MRI before. My husband usually takes care of all the medical stuff. I just… show up. And then get poked and prodded. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. But… he said something about penicillin once? Or maybe it was someone else? Everything is so blurry. Is this gonna be expensive? Medicare covers everything, right?
DOCTOR: Okay. Contrast dye is something used in the MRI to get a clearer picture of your spine. Penicillin allergy is important to know, so we’ll make a note of that. As for cost, Medicare should cover the majority of it, but there may be a co-pay or deductible. The billing department can provide you with more detailed information. Before we proceed with the MRI, I’m going to refer you to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. They’re the specialists in nerve and brain function. I'll also prescribe a Vitamin D supplement in the meantime, as low Vitamin D can contribute to fatigue and muscle weakness. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Not… really? It all sounds kinda scary. And complicated. I just want to feel normal again. My husband is gonna be mad I didn't ask more questions. He always says I don't think things through. Will the neurologist be nice? I don't like strangers poking me. And… how long is this gonna take? I promised my husband I’d start dinner.
DOCTOR: The neurologist is a qualified medical professional. They will explain everything thoroughly and answer any concerns you may have. The appointment will take some time, as they will need to review your medical history and perform a physical exam. I will have my nurse schedule the appointment for you and provide you with all the necessary paperwork. In the meantime, try to rest and focus on getting enough sleep. And don’t worry about dinner. Your health is more important. Do you have any other specific concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: Um… no. I think that’s everything. Just… try to make the neurologist nice, okay? And tell them I get scared easily. And… maybe let me know when the appointment is, so I don’t forget? My husband is really good at remembering stuff, but he’s busy at work right now. Thank you. For… everything. .
DOCTOR: My nurse will contact you directly to schedule the appointment and provide all necessary instructions. She will also be sure to inform the neurologist of your concerns. Have a good day, Emileigh. And don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions. .
