DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you're 38 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, 38. Uh... my chest hurts. Not all the time, but it does hurt. It's... in my breast.
DOCTOR: Your breast, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Sorry, maybe that sounds… strange? I don't know much about this. It just hurts. Like a sore muscle, sometimes. But it’s… here.
DOCTOR: It is a rather unusual presentation for a male patient, Mr. Bulaong. However, we will certainly investigate. Can you describe the pain a bit more precisely?
PATIENT: Um... okay. It's not a sharp pain. More like… a heavy ache. Sometimes it feels like it's deep inside, other times just under the skin. And it's not always in the same spot. Left side mostly, I think. It comes and goes. Like after work, when I'm tired. Does that make sense? I do roofing, so I’m moving a lot all day.
DOCTOR: Roofing, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. For about… ten years now. It’s hard work. Lots of lifting and bending. I just thought maybe it was a muscle, but it doesn’t really feel like a muscle. It’s… different. And it's been happening for maybe… two months now? Getting a little worse.
DOCTOR: Right. And has anything specifically made it better or worse besides work?
PATIENT: Hmm... Nothing really makes it better, not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes if I just… rest, it feels a little less bad. But it always comes back. Worse when I sleep on that side, I think. And when my wife… uh… when we're close. It hurts then, too. Sorry, that's... private. I just thought I should tell you everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, a thorough medical history is always appreciated, Mr. Bulaong. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Have you noticed any changes to the skin in that area?
PATIENT: Changes? Uh… not really. It looks the same as always, I think. Maybe a little red sometimes? But I don’t know if that’s just from the sun. I’m out in the sun a lot. I haven't seen any bumps or anything, though. No… leaking or anything like that. I don’t know all the words you’re looking for. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No apologies are necessary, Mr. Bulaong. Let’s proceed. Have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. I’m a little more tired than usual, maybe? But that's probably just the work. And I’ve been a little… worried, because of the pain. But no fever, no cough, no… other pains. I haven't lost any weight, either. My wife says I'm eating more than ever, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu once, when I was a kid. And broke my arm. But nothing… serious. No heart problems, no diabetes, no… anything like that. My wife is healthy, too. We don't really go to the doctor much. We’re okay, usually.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any family history of…breast cancer, or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Uh… my grandma on my mother’s side… she got sick, a long time ago. But I don’t know what kind of sick. She… passed away. My mom is okay, though. She’s healthy, as far as I know. No one else in my family… that I know of… got sick like that. Sorry, I don’t really know much about family medical stuff. My family doesn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: That will do for now, Mr. Bulaong. Now, I'm going to need to conduct a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table, and we will begin. I need you to undress from the waist up, and I’ll provide a gown.
PATIENT: Uh… okay. That sounds… private. Is there a reason I need to take all my clothes off? Can’t I just… lift my shirt? It feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, a thorough examination requires full access to the area in question. It is a standard medical procedure. I assure you, my office maintains the utmost professional discretion. If you are uncomfortable, we can proceed with a less thorough assessment, but it may not yield sufficient information for a proper diagnosis. The choice is yours, naturally, but I strongly recommend a complete examination.
PATIENT: Okay… I understand. It just feels… weird. I don’t want to be rude or anything. Alright. I’ll… I’ll lie down. Just… let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please lie on your back, arms at your sides. I will begin with an inspection of the chest wall and then palpate the area of discomfort. I will also listen to your heart and lungs. Please inform me immediately if you experience any pain during the palpation.
PATIENT: Okay. I’m ready. Just… be gentle, okay? It hurts a little even when I’m just sitting here.
DOCTOR: I am being as gentle as possible, Mr. Bulaong. I note some mild tenderness upon palpation of the left pectoral region. There is no palpable mass detected at this time. Your heart sounds are regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. I do not detect any immediate anomalies. However, given your symptoms and the tenderness, I recommend we order some imaging to rule out any underlying causes.
PATIENT: Imaging? What kind of imaging? Like… x-rays? Will it hurt? And what if you do find something?
DOCTOR: We will start with a mammogram and an ultrasound. The mammogram involves a brief compression of the breast to obtain an image. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it is generally well-tolerated. The ultrasound uses sound waves and is painless. Should we detect an anomaly, it will require further investigation. That could involve a biopsy to determine the nature of the tissue. However, let us not jump to conclusions. The imaging will provide us with a clearer picture of what is occurring. I will also order some blood work to assess your overall health and rule out any systemic causes. Are you able to provide a sample today?
PATIENT: Blood work? Okay… I guess so. I mean, if you think it's necessary. It sounds… scary. But I want to know what's wrong. I can give a sample. Where do I go? And… will the insurance cover all this? I don't have any.
DOCTOR: As you do not have insurance, you will be responsible for the cost of the tests. The clinic does offer a discounted rate for self-pay patients, but it will still be substantial. The mammogram will cost approximately $250, the ultrasound $150, and the blood work $100. You can obtain the necessary paperwork from the receptionist. The blood sample can be taken here, in the lab. As for a definitive diagnosis, we need the results of the tests. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today, to discuss the findings. In the meantime, avoid any strenuous activity and monitor for any changes in your symptoms. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: One week... that’s a long time to wait. What if it is something bad? What are the chances it's… serious? And what if I can’t afford all this? I work hard, but… it’s not easy. Is there anything… any help available?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, I understand your concerns. However, speculating on the potential severity of the condition without concrete evidence is unproductive and will only exacerbate your anxiety. I will not provide a prognosis at this time. Regarding the cost, I am unaware of any specific financial assistance programs available to uninsured patients at this time. You may wish to inquire with the receptionist for local resources. The likelihood of a serious condition is relatively low, given your age and overall health. However, it is crucial to rule out any potential causes. I have ordered the necessary tests, and the receptionist will provide you with the paperwork and instructions. If you experience any sudden or severe changes in your condition, please seek immediate medical attention. I believe that is all for today, Mr. Bulaong. .
