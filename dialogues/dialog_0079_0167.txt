DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, my foot… it hurts. Very much. It’s got a sore on it, and it’s not getting better. It’s been troubling me for… oh, maybe a month now? Longer, even. I forget easily these days.
DOCTOR: A sore on your foot, alright. And it's been present for… approximately a month, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe longer. It’s on the top of my foot, Doctor. It’s red, and it… weeps a little. It’s very uncomfortable to walk. I try to stay off it, but it’s hard. I like to garden, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. A red, weeping sore on the top of your foot, making walking difficult, and exacerbated by gardening. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or swollen lymph nodes in your leg or groin?
PATIENT: Fever? Hmm… I don’t think so. I haven’t felt hot. And… swollen… what did you say? Nodes? I don’t know about nodes, Doctor. I’m not sure what those are. Is that something I should feel for? I’m sorry, I don’t understand all the medical words.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. Lymph nodes are small glands that can swell when there's an infection. They are typically felt in the groin, where your leg bends. We can check those in a moment during the examination. For now, let's focus on the sore itself. Has anything specific caused the sore, as far as you recall?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I didn’t cut it, or anything. I just… noticed it one day. Maybe a bug bite at first? But it didn’t go away, like a bug bite should. It just… got worse. I wear slippers most of the time, even in the house. I try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known injury, and it presented without any distinct trauma. And it hasn’t responded to time. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes or poor circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The doctor told me… many years ago… I have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, he called it. And my legs… they feel cold sometimes. The circulation, he said wasn't very good. Does that have something to do with my foot? I take some pills for the sugar, but… I forget which ones sometimes.
DOCTOR: Diabetes and poor circulation – that is relevant information, Mr. Stoegbauer. And you're on medication for the diabetes. We’ll get a list of those in a moment. Now, let's have a look at the foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. There it is. It doesn't look very pretty, does it? It aches something awful, especially when I try to put weight on it.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see the sore now. It’s located on the dorsum of your foot, appears to be ulcerated, with some surrounding erythema, and there’s some serous drainage present. There’s a moderate amount of warmth to the area, and slight tenderness upon palpation. I also note some diminished pulses in your foot. Your pulses are somewhat weak, which is consistent with your history of poor circulation. I'm going to need to get some additional information. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to any pills before, not that I can remember. But… I get a little sleepy with some of them, sometimes. Is that an allergy? I just like to nap.
DOCTOR: No known medication allergies, but reports some drowsiness with certain medications. Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. Based on your history and the examination findings, this could be a diabetic ulcer, potentially complicated by a mild infection. However, to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a few tests. We will need a blood test to check your blood sugar levels and a wound culture to identify any bacteria present. I'm also going to order a Doppler ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your foot more accurately. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, that sounds… good, Doctor. If it will help my foot, then yes, please. Blood test, and a… culture. And something about my blood flow? I trust your judgement. I just want this pain to go away. Will these tests take long? And will they hurt?
DOCTOR: They won't hurt much, Mr. Stoegbauer. The blood test is a simple prick of the finger, and the wound culture involves gently taking a small sample from the sore. The Doppler ultrasound is non-invasive; it simply uses sound waves to measure the blood flow. The results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend keeping weight off your foot as much as possible. I will also prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection. We'll review the test results together once they're available and discuss the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good, Doctor. No putting weight on my foot, and some ointment. And then we see what the tests say. I appreciate you looking at this for me. It's been worrying me a lot. I’ll try my best to stay off it. Will someone tell me where to go for the blood test?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Stoegbauer. Here is a requisition form for the lab work. The lab is located just down the hall, to your left. The receptionist there will assist you. I'm also going to have the nurse come in to apply the topical antibiotic ointment to the sore and provide you with instructions on wound care. It's important to keep the wound clean and dry, and to change the dressing as directed. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the test results and monitor your progress. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you've explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you. For everything. I'll go do the blood test now, and wait for the nurse. I hope it’s not too bad. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. Take your time, and please let the nurse know if you have any concerns. I’ll see you in one week.
