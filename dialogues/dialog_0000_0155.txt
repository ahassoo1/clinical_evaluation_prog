DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Jezik, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Lyman. Look, is this gonna take long? I got… things to do. Not important things, mind you, but… things.
DOCTOR: “Things.” Of course. Well, we’ll try to be efficient. But rushing through things rarely helps. Now, tell me… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Tremor, she said. The lady on the phone. My hand… it shakes. Has been for a while now, I guess. Honestly, time… it all kinda blurs together after a bit. It's not constant, you understand. More… comes and goes. Mostly when I'm trying to… do something with it. Like holding a cup. Or… well, you get the idea.
DOCTOR: “A tremor, comes and goes, worse with use…” Right. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… oh, geez. That's a tough one. Years, I think. Maybe… five? Six? It started… subtle, you know? I just figured I was getting old. Everything shakes a little when you get old, doesn’t it? It's gotten… noticeable lately, though. My daughter, she pointed it out. Said I was spilling my coffee again.
DOCTOR: “Your daughter pointed it out.” Hmm. And has it been getting worse recently, or just… more frequent?
PATIENT: Worse, I think. Definitely worse. Harder to… control, you know? Used to be able to kinda steady it. Now… not so much. It makes things… difficult. Especially at work. Though… what is work anymore? It's all just… pipes and pumps. Not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Pipes and pumps… right. And is this tremor only in your hands, or do you notice it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Just my hands, mostly. Though… sometimes my leg feels a little… jumpy. Not like a full shake, just… restless. Like I need to tap it or something. It doesn't happen all the time, though. And it might just be my imagination. I'm old, you know? Things go wrong.
DOCTOR: “Things go wrong.” Yes, well. Let’s not jump to conclusions. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I… get tired easily, I suppose. But I’ve always been tired. And my… balance isn’t what it used to be. I stumbled a bit last week, nearly fell in the garden. But again, old age, probably. Honestly, doctor, I’m not sure what isn’t a symptom at this point.
DOCTOR: “Not sure what isn’t a symptom…” Right. And are you currently taking any medications for anything?
PATIENT: Medications… not really. Just a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. Can’t remember the name. Doctor gave it to me a while back. I take it… when I remember. It doesn’t seem to do much, honestly.
DOCTOR: “When you remember…” And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Though… my skin gets itchy sometimes. But that's probably just the weather. Or the dust. Or… well, everything. I'm not a particularly sensitive person, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Let’s have a look at your hands. And I’d like to check your reflexes and balance, if you don’t mind. Just sit there and relax. Try to keep your hands still, if you can. Though, judging by what you've told me, that might be a challenge.
PATIENT: Relax… right. Easier said than done, doctor. But I'll try. Just… don't expect miracles. This hand has seen a lot of pipes, you know. And it's starting to show its age.
DOCTOR: Okay. Resting tremor is minimal, but increases with movement. Some bradykinesia noted on finger tapping. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Balance… slightly impaired. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family ever been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease or any other neurological condition?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s… hmm. That’s a name I’ve heard. My mother… she got kinda shaky towards the end. But they just said it was old age. And my uncle, on my father's side… he had some trouble walking, I think. But nobody ever said what was wrong with him. We didn’t talk much about… that sort of thing, back then. Things were different. Nobody went to doctors much.
DOCTOR: “Nobody went to doctors much…” Right. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? I… I used to have friends. Worked with a lot of people at the plant. But… people move on, you know? Retire. Or… well. I’m divorced. Been on my own for a long time. I mostly keep to myself these days. Read the paper. Watch TV. Fix things around the house. Not much of a social life, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your symptoms, the physical exam, and your family history, it’s possible you’re developing Parkinson’s disease. However, it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We need to rule out other potential causes for your tremor and movement issues. I’m going to order some blood work to check for underlying medical conditions and I'd like to schedule a brain scan - an MRI - to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Brain scan? MRI? Goodness. That sounds… serious. Is it… bad? Look, I’m just an old man. Maybe it’s just… old age. Can’t we just leave it at that? I don’t want to go through a lot of tests. I just want my hand to stop shaking, you know?
DOCTOR: “Just leave it at that?
PATIENT: Look, doctor, I appreciate you trying to figure things out. But honestly, I don’t have a lot of energy for a lot of tests and appointments. And I don’t have much money, either. I’m retired, you know? And my insurance… well, I don’t really have any. It’s just… a lot. I just wanted something for the shaking, maybe. Not… this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns about cost and time. However, dismissing this without a proper diagnosis could be… unwise. There are medications that can help manage Parkinson’s symptoms, but they work best when started early. As for the cost, we can explore options for financial assistance. There are programs available for low-income patients. And I will write you a referral to a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. They will be able to discuss the pros and cons of the brain scan in more detail, and you can decide if it’s right for you. Here is the neurologist’s contact information. Call their office and schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low dose of a medication called amantadine. It’s a relatively inexpensive drug that can sometimes help with tremor. I'll also give you a handout on Parkinson’s disease, just so you have some information. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, doctor. I… I guess I’ll call them. It's just… a lot to take in. Parkinson's… sounds serious. I was hoping it was just old age. Well, I think that's all I can handle for today. Thank you for your time. And for… everything.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Jezik. Remember, early intervention is key. And please, follow up with the neurologist as soon as possible. Here are the discharge instructions and the medication information. If your symptoms worsen significantly before your appointment, or if you experience any new or concerning symptoms, please go to the emergency room immediately. Next!
PATIENT: .
