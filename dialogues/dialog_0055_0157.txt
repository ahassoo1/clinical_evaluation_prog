DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like you said. My husband made me come. He's been worried. Honestly, I feel fine.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s…commendable that your husband is so attentive to your well-being. Though I must say, relying solely on feeling fine isn't always the most reliable indicator of health. High blood pressure, or hypertension as we call it, often presents with no symptoms. That is why routine check-ups are important. Perhaps you could tell me a bit more about how your husband discovered this concern?
PATIENT: He bought one of those machines…for home. Said I was getting stressed with work. He checks it every other day now. It’s a bit much, if you ask me. He just keeps saying numbers were too high. I don’t really understand what the numbers mean. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: A home blood pressure monitor… yes, those can be useful, though as you’ve indicated, they can also generate some anxiety. It's good he's being proactive, but it's also important to have accurate readings and proper interpretation. “Too high” is…vague, naturally. Do you happen to know what those numbers were?
PATIENT: Ugh, numbers. Let me think… he said something like… 140 over 90 a few times. And once it was… 150 over… I don’t know, something. He was really fussing at me that last time. Honestly, I wasn’t even paying attention. It's just numbers. I don’t get worried about numbers.
DOCTOR: I see. 140/90 and 150/…?
PATIENT: Yeah, something like that. Look, I build things. Bridges, mostly. Solid, real things. Not… blood pressure. Is it going to keep me from working? Because if it is, that's a problem.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Dudney. And I appreciate you clarifying the importance of your work. It’s certainly possible to manage hypertension and continue your profession. However, uncontrolled high blood pressure can have serious consequences, and it is important to address it. Before we proceed with a plan, I’d like to gather some more information. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. This is all new. And honestly, a bit ridiculous. My family…we’re strong. We don’t get sick. We build things. Does building things not count as exercise enough?
DOCTOR: While physical labor is undoubtedly beneficial, it doesn't necessarily equate to the type of cardiovascular exercise needed to maintain optimal health. And… while family history is important, it is not a guarantee of immunity to illness. Very well. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. I take…nothing. I don't believe in all that stuff. Makes you weak. Just a multivitamin sometimes, if my husband reminds me. He buys it, so I take it, okay? Is that what you want to know? What kind of medicine are you going to try and give me? I really don’t want anything.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Dudney. And I assure you, my goal isn't to simply give you medication. It’s to assess your overall health and determine the best course of action for you. We can discuss alternative approaches, of course, but we must first have a complete picture of your condition. Before we discuss potential options, let's review your medical history a bit further. Have any close family members—parents, siblings—been diagnosed with high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, fine. My grandma… on my mom’s side. She had something wrong with her kidneys. She was older, though. Really old. And… my uncle, I think, had a stroke a few years back. He smoked. A lot. He didn’t take care of himself. Is that what you want to know? Bad family habits? I do not smoke. And I work hard. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Dudney. Family history can indicate a predisposition to certain conditions. I want to understand your lifestyle a bit more fully. Could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Look, it’s work. I wake up, I go to the site, I build things, I come home, I eat, I sleep. Sometimes my husband and I watch TV. That’s it. It's not complicated. A lot of walking, a lot of lifting. Is that what you want to know? I’m a practical person. Just tell me if I can keep building bridges. That's all I care about. I don't have time for a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Ms. Dudney. However, simply stating that you are active does not provide a complete assessment. Let’s try this: do you consume a lot of salt in your diet?
PATIENT: Salt? I don't know. I eat what my husband makes. He likes to cook. Lots of…seasoning. I guess. He puts stuff in everything. Sometimes it tastes salty. Honestly, I don't pay attention. He worries about everything. He's a worrier. I just eat. Is that bad? Should I be watching what he makes now, too? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: It’s not about assigning blame, Ms. Dudney. It’s simply gathering information. Excessive sodium intake can contribute to hypertension. Now, let's move on to alcohol consumption. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No. Never. Makes you slow. Makes you weak. My husband drinks beer sometimes, when he’s watching sports. But I don’t. I need to be… alert. Building things requires concentration. This is a waste of my time, you know. I have a schedule. And I'm already late getting back to the site. Can we just…write a prescription for something and be done with it? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your frustration, and I assure you, I am trying to gather the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. However, simply prescribing medication without a thorough assessment would be… irresponsible. Before we proceed any further, I would like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a brief neurological assessment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But if it makes me late, you're paying for the delay. My schedule is tight. And I don't have time for…nonsense. Just do what you have to do. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax, Ms. Dudney. I will start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I will check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is currently 148 over 92. As you can see, this is elevated. I will now check your pulse. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I will perform a brief neurological assessment. Please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Neurological assessment is normal. Based on these initial findings, Ms. Dudney, your blood pressure is indeed elevated. This confirms your husband’s concerns. We need to discuss a plan to manage this. However, before we proceed, I recommend a few basic blood tests to assess your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and overall health. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Tests. Of course. More waiting. Fine. Whatever it takes to get this over with. But I need those results fast. And I'm warning you, if it interferes with my work schedule… …I expect a written explanation.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Dudney. I will expedite the testing process as much as possible. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend you monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible, and keep a log of your readings. I also suggest limiting your sodium intake and engaging in regular, moderate exercise. However, based on your current readings and your family history, I believe a low-dose diuretic would be appropriate to start with. It’s a relatively mild medication with minimal side effects. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Diuretic? Sounds… unpleasant. What does it do? And what are these “minimal” side effects? I don't want to be running to the bathroom all day. Or feeling weak. I build bridges, remember? I need to be… functional. Explain it. In…simple terms. No medical jargon.
DOCTOR: A diuretic, Ms. Dudney, simply helps your body remove excess fluid and salt through urine. It lowers your blood volume, which in turn lowers your blood pressure. As for side effects, the most common one is increased urination, as I mentioned. You may need to visit the restroom more frequently, particularly in the beginning. Some people experience mild dizziness or fatigue, but these are usually temporary. I assure you, these side effects are generally manageable and shouldn’t interfere with your ability to function. It’s important to note that we will monitor your electrolytes closely while you’re on this medication to ensure they remain within a healthy range. Are you willing to try a low dose, Ms. Dudney?
PATIENT: Fine. But if I feel anything weird, I’m stopping it. And I expect a phone number to call, if it's after hours. Don't just tell me to come back to the clinic. I have a schedule, remember? A very tight schedule. And write down those side effects. In…plain English. No medical words. I need to know what to look for.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will write you a prescription for hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, to be taken once daily. I will also provide you with a detailed list of potential side effects, written in plain English, and a phone number to call if you experience any concerns, including after-hours contact information. I recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your response to the medication and repeat your blood tests. In the meantime, please monitor your blood pressure at home and keep a log of your readings. Do you have any further questions at this time, Ms. Dudney?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s…everything. Just get me the prescription. And the list. I need to get back to work. Hopefully, this will be over quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will escort you to the checkout. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. And I trust you’ll keep me informed of your progress. Have a…productive day, Ms. Dudney. .
