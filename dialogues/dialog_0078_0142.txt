DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Nice to meet you too. Right, well... headaches, mostly. Bad ones. They come and go, and when they do come, it's... not fun. I get all sweaty and my heart kinda races, you know? It's been happening for a while now, I think. Honestly, time gets a bit fuzzy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches. I understand. And you mentioned they come and go, and are accompanied by sweating and a racing heart. That sounds unpleasant, indeed. When you say “a while now,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, rough estimate… hmm. Months, definitely. Maybe… six months? Could be longer. It’s hard to pin down. Things just kinda blend together, you know? I remember it starting after… something happened. But what it was… that’s the tricky part. I just feel awful when they hit.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or so, and you mentioned something happening around the time they started. We'll try to piece that together if we can, don’t worry. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Right, yeah, okay. Uh… they're not like, a normal headache. It's not just a dull ache. It’s… throbbing, mostly. Really bad throbbing, usually on both sides of my head. And it feels like… pressure, too. Like someone’s squeezing my head. And bright lights… bright lights make it way worse. I usually have to lie down in a dark room. Just thinking about it makes it feel a bit worse, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Throbbing on both sides of your head, with pressure, and sensitivity to light. That's helpful. Do you experience any other symptoms with the headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, like I’m gonna be sick, but I haven’t actually been sick. And… I think my vision gets a bit blurry sometimes, right before the headache really kicks in. Not all the time, but sometimes. Oh! And I get really tired afterwards. Like, wiped out for the whole day.
DOCTOR: Nausea, blurry vision preceding the headaches, and significant fatigue afterwards. Okay. And how would you describe your typical day?
PATIENT: Typical day… Not much happens, to be honest. I work… I do some work at the warehouse, packing boxes and stuff. It's pretty physical, but not too bad. Mostly just… quiet. I live alone now. I get up, go to work, come home, watch some TV, go to bed. Repeat. It's kinda boring, really. It's hard to explain. And I don't really… go out much anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. And are you currently experiencing any stress in your life?
PATIENT: Stress… That's a tough one. I guess… the divorce was stressful, obviously. It’s been a couple of years now, but it still kinda hangs over me. Work’s okay, but it's not exactly… fulfilling. And being alone… that gets to me sometimes. So, yeah, I guess there's a bit of stress. Just… the usual, I suppose. It's hard to put my finger on it. It's not like anything major is happening, just… a general feeling of… blah.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly valid, Jaxston. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it’s understandable that it would take a toll. Let’s move on to some medical history questions, if that’s alright. Have you had any previous medical conditions diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football, but that's about it. Nothing serious, never been to the hospital or anything, except for the arm. I've always been pretty healthy, I think. I mean, until these headaches started, anyway. I don't take any regular medication, either. Just… over-the-counter painkillers when the headaches get really bad.
DOCTOR: No prior medical conditions, broken arm as a child, and over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgery. Definitely not. I don't like hospitals much, to be honest. They give me the creeps. And I've always been lucky enough to avoid needing any, I guess. So, no surgeries. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My dad had… high blood pressure, I think. And my grandma… she had something with her heart, but I don't really remember what. It was a long time ago. And my mom… she was pretty healthy, actually. Never really had any major problems. So, not really much, to be honest. Just a bit of high blood pressure on my dad’s side, maybe. It’s hard to say for sure. I didn't really pay much attention to it when I was younger.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your father, some heart condition in your grandmother. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, never had any trouble with food or anything like that. I can eat whatever I want, pretty much. So, no allergies. Definitely not. I'm pretty boring, really. Just headaches and… blah.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jaxston. Thank you for that information. It's helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. This will just help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… let me know if it’s gonna hurt. I’m not a big fan of doctors, to be honest. But I appreciate you trying to figure things out. So, yeah, go ahead. Just… be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. And your pulse is 72, regular and strong. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and equal. Coordination appears intact. No obvious focal neurological deficits noted. Everything seems within normal limits, Jaxston, but the elevated blood pressure and the nature of your headaches warrant further investigation. I'd like to order some blood work, just to rule out any underlying causes. And I also think a CT scan of your head would be a good idea, just to make sure there’s nothing obvious going on structurally. How does that sound?
PATIENT: CT scan… blood work… Sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doc? I mean, I just get headaches, right? It’s not like… a brain tumor or anything? I'm probably just overreacting, but… it’s scary, you know? What are we looking for exactly? And will it hurt? The scan, I mean.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Jaxston. It's always scary when something feels off, and you’re right to ask questions. We’re not necessarily looking for anything bad, but it’s important to rule out any serious causes for your headaches, especially given the accompanying symptoms and slightly elevated blood pressure. The blood work will help us check for things like inflammation, infection, and electrolyte imbalances. The CT scan will give us a picture of your brain to make sure there's nothing structurally abnormal. It’s a precautionary measure, to be thorough. The CT scan itself is painless. You'll lie on a table, and a scanner will move around your head. It's quick and doesn't involve any needles or injections. There is a small amount of radiation involved, but it's a very low dose and the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. I want to emphasize that most headaches are not caused by serious conditions. But it’s always best to be safe and investigate. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this point?
PATIENT: Okay… no needles, that’s good. And not too much radiation, that’s… reassuring. What if… what if it is something bad, Doc? What are the options then? And… will my insurance cover it? I don't have much money, to be honest. I just don't want a huge bill on top of everything else. And… what if I have to take time off work? I can’t really afford that, either. It’s just… a lot to take in. I’m probably just overthinking it.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Jaxston. Let's address them one by one. First, regarding a serious diagnosis: If the tests do reveal something concerning, we’ll discuss all of your options thoroughly. Depending on the finding, those could include medication, therapy, or referral to a specialist. We'll develop a plan together, and I’ll explain everything in detail. Second, regarding the cost: I understand that financial concerns are a major worry. Let's talk about the cost of the tests. I can have our billing department give you an estimate, and we can explore options for financial assistance. We may be able to find a program to help cover some of the costs. I’ll also see if we can work with the lab to get a discounted rate. And because you are uninsured, we can explore options for payment plans. Finally, regarding time off work: The amount of time off you’ll need will depend on the results of the tests and any treatment you might need. We can discuss that further once we have more information. I can also provide a note for your employer, if necessary. It’s important to remember that we're taking these steps to get a clear understanding of what's going on, so we can develop the best possible plan for you. Don't worry about trying to figure everything out right now. We'll take it one step at a time. Would you like me to go ahead and order the blood work and CT scan?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, okay. Let’s just… get it over with. Order the tests. Blood work and the scan. Whatever you think is best, Doc. Just… please keep me informed, okay? I don’t like being in the dark. And… thank you. For being patient with me. And for explaining things. It’s just… a lot to process. So, yeah. Let’s do it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaxston. And you're not alone in feeling overwhelmed. I'll be sure to keep you informed every step of the way. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work, and the radiology department will schedule the CT scan. I’ll also have my nurse call you tomorrow to check in and answer any questions you might have. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as a severe headache, fever, stiff neck, vision changes, or weakness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doc. Seriously. I appreciate it. I guess I’ll just… wait for the calls then. And try not to worry too much. Easier said than done, though. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaxston. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I'll be in touch. Have a good day. .
