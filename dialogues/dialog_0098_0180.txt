DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day, okay? It’s this… tiredness. Just so tired. And… well, it’s embarrassing, but I been… eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I crave it. It started a few months ago, I think. Honestly, time just kinda… blurs.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and… a craving for dirt. You said this started a few months ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, months. Maybe spring? Look, I told you, I don’t remember exactly. It’s just… I feel weak, and then I get this… need. For… earth. Clay. Whatever it is. It's stupid. Don’t judge me. It’s not like I’m out there digging holes in the yard! It’s just… if it's around, I... I eat a little. A tiny bit. Mostly when no one is looking.
DOCTOR: I'm not judging you at all, Hedy. It's important to tell me everything, and I appreciate you being honest. This craving for dirt… is it connected to any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms? I just said I’m tired! And… sometimes my stomach feels a little off. Not bad, just… unsettled. Like I ate something I shouldn’t have. Which, I guess I did. But it's not like a sick feeling, you know? More like… heavy. And… oh. Sometimes I get headaches. Dull ones. Everything just feels… blah. Is that a symptom? I don’t know. Everything feels blah lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, stomach upset – a feeling of heaviness, not necessarily pain – and dull headaches. And this has been going on for months… Let’s try to get a bit more detail. When you say “stomach upset,” is it more frequent at certain times?
PATIENT: Ugh, details, details. It happens… after. After I… indulge. I guess. Doesn’t happen every time, but usually. And it’s not like… violent or anything. Just… uncomfortable. Bloated. Like I ate too much. Which, I kinda did. Look, I’m a programmer, okay? I sit all day. I don't need a lecture about fiber. Is this getting somewhere? Because I got things to do.
DOCTOR: It is getting somewhere, Hedy. We're building a picture. You're a programmer, you sit a lot… and the stomach upset happens after you eat the dirt. Okay. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kinda changes? I already told you everything! Look, maybe I'm just getting old. My husband… he passed a few years back. Things haven't been the same. I just feel… worn down. Everything is harder. Work, getting up, even… remembering things. Now are we done? I really need to get back to work before I fall behind. It’s… complicated. People depend on me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Hedy. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it's completely understandable to feel worn down. Your husband’s passing must have been incredibly difficult. And it's good you are still working and people depend on you. Just to be thorough, I'm going to ask a few quick questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history. Honestly, I don't even remember what I had for breakfast. My doctor… the one before… he just gave me pills when I complained. Blood pressure, I think. And something for my nerves. I don't even know what it was for. Mostly I just ignored it. I don't go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. Too much hassle. Is this important? Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know, Hedy. We're trying to get a complete picture. Do you remember what your previous doctor said you had?
PATIENT: Ugh, no! I told you, I don't remember details! Something about… stress, I think. And my blood pressure was… high. He kept telling me to relax. Easier said than done, believe me. Look, can we just… skip this part? I really don't like talking about this. It's depressing. And it’s not like it matters anyway. I’m old. Old people fall apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. We can certainly move on. But just so I have a complete understanding, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Ugh, hospitals… No. Never had surgery. Not that I recall. Maybe when I was a kid? I don’t remember. Look, I’m a perfectly healthy person, mostly. I just… eat dirt sometimes. And I’m tired. And I crave things. It’s not like I’m dying or anything. I just want a quick fix so I can go back to work. Honestly, is there a pill for this? A vitamin or something? Can we just skip the questions and get to the solution?
DOCTOR: Alright, Hedy. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some possible next steps. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing appears normal, regular rhythm. Blood pressure is… 140/90. Which is a little elevated. Pulse is 88. Now, let's take a look at your throat… open wide for me, please.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. Don’t poke me with anything cold. I hate that. Honestly, I don't know why I even bother with doctors. They always make me feel worse. Just tell me what you think. Is it serious? Am I going to die? Don't beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks a little… irritated. Not severely, but there's some redness. Now, I'm going to feel your lymph nodes in your neck. Lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but not significantly. It could be from a mild infection, but given your history, we need to explore other possibilities. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Bowel sounds are normal. No tenderness to palpation, but you do appear slightly distended. Overall, the exam is relatively unremarkable, but the enlarged lymph nodes and abdominal distension, along with your reported dirt craving, warrant further investigation. Now, Hedy, I want to be upfront with you. Your symptoms are unusual, and I want to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I would like to order some blood work and a stool sample.
PATIENT: Ugh, blood work and a stool sample? Seriously? You want a piece of my dirt? Look, I don't like needles, and I definitely don't like giving up… that. Can’t you just give me something for the tiredness? A vitamin B shot or something? I really don't have time for all this testing. And… what "underlying conditions" are you even thinking about? Am I… sick? Don’t tell me it’s something awful. I just want to feel better. And I need to get back to work. People are depending on me. .
DOCTOR: Hedy, I understand your reluctance, and I want to assure you I'm not trying to cause you unnecessary stress. However, given your symptoms – the tiredness, the dirt craving, and the slightly enlarged lymph nodes – it's important to rule out potential causes. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, including checking for any nutrient deficiencies and signs of inflammation. The stool sample will help us determine if there's a parasitic infection or other gastrointestinal issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. As for what I'm thinking about, there are several possibilities. One, rarely, a craving for non-food items like dirt can be a sign of a mineral deficiency, such as iron deficiency anemia. Another possibility, though less common, could be a condition called pica, which is often associated with underlying mental health conditions. The most important thing is to get a clear diagnosis so we can determine the best course of treatment. I strongly recommend the blood work and stool sample. If you're concerned about the stool sample, we can discuss options for making the collection process as comfortable as possible. We also have social workers who can assist if this is stemming from any emotional distress. Would you be willing to proceed with the testing?
