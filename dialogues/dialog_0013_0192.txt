DOCTOR: Hi Delron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, it’s pretty simple. I gotta get this exam done for the… the army thing. They want me to take it before they’ll even think about letting me sign up. It’s a pre-exam, right? Gotta make sure I’m… fit enough. Not that I think there’ll be a problem. I keep myself in shape.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-enlistment physical. Got it. And you're right, it’s standard procedure. We just need to get a good baseline of your health. You said you keep yourself in shape – that’s great to hear! Just to clarify, is this your first time going through this process, or have you had similar exams before?
PATIENT: Similar? No. First time this specific exam, yeah. I mean, I did school sports when I was a kid, but that was… a long time ago. Nothing like this. They didn't really check anything back then, just made sure you could run and didn’t break anything during the run. This feels… thorough. Is it gonna take all day? I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a bit more comprehensive than a school sports physical, as you've noticed. We need to cover a lot of ground to make sure we're accurately assessing your health for enlistment. It shouldn’t take all day, but it will be a few steps. We'll start with some questions about your medical history – past illnesses, surgeries, family health, things like that. Then I'll do a physical exam – checking your vitals, listening to your heart and lungs, and a general assessment. I see here you're 51 years old. Have you had a regular primary care physician, or are you generally healthy and haven't needed to see a doctor often?
PATIENT: Generally healthy. Very. I haven't really needed a doctor. I mean, little things now and then, a cold, maybe pulled a muscle working on the car… but nothing serious. My wife, Ingrid, she handles all that stuff. She makes the appointments, reminds me to take something if I need it… she’s very organized. I just… don’t bother with it if I don’t have to. Family health? My father… he had some heart trouble when he got old, but that was old. And my mother… she lived a long time, mostly fine 'til the very end.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, generally healthy, wife handles most medical things, father with heart trouble later in life, mother lived a long time. Just to be thorough, do you know what specifically your father’s heart trouble was?
PATIENT: No. Not exactly. Ingrid told me something about… blockages, I think? And something about… a procedure? She explained it, but I wasn't really listening. I was more worried about getting the car fixed. She said it was serious, but he recovered. He lived another ten years after that, so it can't have been that bad. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to those details. It’s just… heart trouble. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s common not to remember all the specifics. We can skip that for now. Let's talk about you. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing. I eat whatever. Ingrid tries to get me to eat more vegetables, but that’s not an allergy, that’s just… good sense. I can take any medicine, I guess. Never had a problem. Really. I'm pretty tough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don’t take anything. Ingrid keeps trying to get me to take those… fish oil pills, she says they’re good for my heart, but I told her I’m fine. I don’t need pills. I get everything I need from my food. Mostly meat and potatoes. And the occasional sausage.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, I'd like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not. Ingrid would kill me. She's very strict about that. Drink? Occasionally. A beer with dinner sometimes, maybe a glass of wine on a special occasion. Nothing heavy. And drugs? What kind of question is that? I haven't touched a drug in my life. I’m a working man, I don’t have time for that nonsense.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional alcohol, no drugs. That's good to know. Now, this is a little sensitive, but it’s important for the enlistment physical. Have you ever had any significant injuries, surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything other than overnight observation?
PATIENT: Hmm...significant? Let me think. I pulled a muscle in my back a few years ago lifting an engine block. Ingrid made me go to the physiotherapist for a few weeks, but it wasn't serious. No surgery. Hospital? No. I fixed myself. I’m good at fixing things. Mostly cars, but I can fix myself too.
DOCTOR: Okay, pulled a muscle in your back, treated with physiotherapy. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, just one more question about your history before we move on to the physical exam. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Ongoing... conditions? No. I don’t have anything. I feel fine. Ingrid keeps saying I need to watch my cholesterol, but I feel perfectly healthy. And I don't want to know about things I don't need to know about. Honestly, I just want to get this exam done so I can talk to the army people.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're generally very healthy, and your wife is very attentive to your well-being. That’s great. So, to summarize, no allergies, no medications, no smoking, occasional alcohol, no surgeries or hospitalizations, no ongoing medical conditions. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll check your height and weight – I see here you're listed as 187 centimeters and 53 kilograms – then I'll take your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Wait a minute. 53 kilograms? That’s… that’s not right. I weigh way more than that. I’m a big guy. I build engines, you know? I’m solid muscle. Ingrid keeps saying I need to lose weight, but that’s just her. She’s small. 53 kilograms… that’s ridiculous. You gotta be mistaken.
DOCTOR: You're right to question that. That is a significant discrepancy. My apologies. It appears there's an error in the system. 53 kilograms is… remarkably low for someone of your height and build. Can you tell me your approximate weight in pounds or kilograms?
PATIENT: Pounds...hmm. Let me think. I haven’t weighed myself in a while. I'd say... around 170, maybe 175. Definitely more than 120. I'm a strong guy. You should see my arms. I could probably lift that whole computer if I had to. But yeah, 170 to 175 pounds. That’s a much more accurate number.
DOCTOR: Okay, 175 pounds. That makes much more sense. I apologize again for the error; it’s good you caught that. It’s important to have accurate information. Alright, let’s proceed with the physical exam now. First, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please sit comfortably?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as you fixed that number. I don't want some silly weight on my record. It’s important. I gotta be accurate for the army. Sit… yeah, I can sit. Just don't poke me too much. And be quick about it. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Accuracy is very important, and I've updated your weight in the system. This won't take long at all. Just relax your arm for me... and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 135 over 85. Pulse is 72, regular. Not bad at all. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Deep breath… There. Good enough? I always have good lungs. Worked with engines for years. Gotta have good lungs for that. And my heart's strong. Never had any trouble. You should listen to it, it’s a good heart. Like a well-oiled machine.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear and regular. Your heart sounds strong, as you said, and your lungs are clear. Any history of asthma, bronchitis, or other respiratory issues?
PATIENT: Respiratory... issues? No. None. Never. Like I said, engines. You gotta have good lungs. I can hold my breath for a long time, if I need to. Ingrid says I snore, but that’s just… I’m a big guy. It doesn't mean anything. Good lungs. Clear as a bell.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of respiratory issues, clear lungs. Now, I’m just going to briefly check your reflexes and range of motion. Your reflexes are normal. Can you bend forward and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: There. See? Still flexible. I can still move. Gets a little creaky sometimes, but that's just age. And working on cars. I'm not a young man anymore. But I can still get the job done. You should see me under a car, it’s a sight to behold.
DOCTOR: Good range of motion. A little stiffness, as you mentioned, but nothing concerning. Now, just a quick look in your ears and throat. Everything looks clear. No signs of infection or inflammation. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears to be normal. Now, do you have any concerns or anything you'd like me to address before we discuss the next steps?
PATIENT: No, no concerns. I told you, I’m fine. Healthy as a horse. Really. Ingrid worries too much. So, what now? Do I just… go talk to the army people? Can I get a piece of paper that says I passed? I need something official. They're very strict about paperwork. And I'd like to know if there's anything I need to do before I start training.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I can generate a pre-enlistment physical report summarizing my findings. It will state that your physical exam was normal, with a note of some minor stiffness which is not a contraindication to service. Here you go. As for training, there will likely be a more comprehensive medical evaluation at the base. They’ll assess your overall fitness level and ensure you’re prepared for the demands of service. This report will serve as a preliminary assessment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Good, good. That's what I needed. Paperwork. Always about the paperwork. Actually… yes. One thing. I got a bad back sometimes, lifting heavy things. Will that cause a problem? Ingrid keeps saying I should be careful, but you can’t be careful all the time. Will they make me do… paperwork if my back hurts?
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern. As noted in the report, you did mention some minor stiffness. While this isn’t a contraindication to service, it’s important to be proactive about back health. During their comprehensive evaluation, they will likely assess your back strength and range of motion more thoroughly. They may recommend physical therapy or specific exercises to prevent future injury. If you experience significant pain during training, they may require a medical evaluation and potentially temporary duty restrictions. It’s unlikely to be a significant issue unless it becomes debilitating. I recommend informing the medical personnel at the base about your history of occasional back pain and following their recommendations. Do you want me to write a note specifically mentioning your occasional back discomfort for their records?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, please do. A note. Mention the back. Ingrid will be happy. She likes notes. And it's better to be safe than sorry, right? Especially with the army. They're very strict. Just write whatever you think is necessary. A little stiffness, occasional discomfort, lifting heavy things… make it sound official. That's all. And thank you. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ve added a note detailing your occasional back discomfort related to lifting heavy objects. It recommends maintaining proper lifting techniques and seeking medical attention if pain exacerbates. Here you go. I’m glad I could help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that's everything. Paperwork, note, back… all done. You've been very thorough. I appreciate it. I’ll go talk to the army people now. Hopefully, they won’t ask too many questions. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Delron. It was a pleasure meeting you. Best of luck with your enlistment process. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
