DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Stoffregen, yes, that's me. Um... well, it's my... going to the bathroom. It's been a bit hard lately. Not... not bad bad, just... takes a while, you know? And I don't always... get it all out, if that makes sense. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s very common to experience changes with bladder and bowel function as we age. It's good you came in to discuss this. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice... That's a tricky one. Everything feels a bit blurry these days, you know? Maybe... a few months ago? Or was it last year? I really can't say for sure. It just sort of... gradually got harder. I don't remember a specific day or anything. My husband, he might remember better. He notices everything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. It's common for the timing to be a bit unclear. We can work with an estimate. So, roughly a few months to a year. Has the difficulty been getting progressively worse, or has it been fairly consistent since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm... I think it's been getting a little worse, maybe? Not a lot, but... like, sometimes it starts easy, and then it gets harder towards the end. Other times, it's hard right from the beginning. It's... not predictable, you know? One day it's okay, the next day it's not so much. It's just... a bother, really. Mostly just a bother.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating when it’s unpredictable. And a bother is a perfectly valid way to describe it. Ms. Stoffregen, can you describe what happens when you try to go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well... I go to the bathroom, like usual. But it just... takes a long time to start. And I have to... push a little bit. Not hard push, just... you know, like you're trying to get the last bit of something out. And sometimes... it feels like it stops and starts. Like it's not coming out smoothly. Does that make sense? I don't want to be too graphic, you know.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. You're not being graphic at all; it's important for me to understand exactly what you're experiencing so I can help. It sounds like you're describing some hesitancy, straining, and intermittent flow. Have you noticed any changes in the strength or color of your urine stream?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Color... I don't really pay attention to the color, dear. I just... go. And as for strength... hmm. It doesn't feel as strong as it used to, maybe? Like, it's not a powerful stream, if that makes sense. More... dribbly. And sometimes it sprays a little bit to the side. Not every time, just sometimes. My husband, he says I need to sit down more carefully. He's a good man, that one.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been very observant, Ms. Stoffregen, and your husband is right to offer support. A weaker stream, dribbling, and occasional spraying can all be related. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this, such as a feeling of not fully emptying your bladder, or a frequent urge to go, even if you've just been?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That feeling... not emptying completely, that happens quite a bit. I feel like I have to go back a little while later, even if I just went. And the urge... sometimes it comes on suddenly, and it's quite strong. Not all the time, but often enough to be annoying. It wakes me up at night sometimes, which is not fun. My husband has to help me get to the bathroom. He doesn't mind, but... I don't like bothering him.
DOCTOR: It's very common to experience urgency and nocturia, or waking up at night to urinate, Ms. Stoffregen, especially as we age. It's certainly not ideal, and it's good you're discussing this with me. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that have been diagnosed, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think... I had my blood pressure checked a few times, and the doctor said it was a little high, but he gave me some pills, and I take those. And I think... something about my sugar being a bit off at one point, but I don’t remember exactly what he said. I just take pills for everything these days, honestly. My memory is just not what it used to be. I go to the doctor regularly, though, so I'm sure he has all the details. He's a good doctor, too.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like you're being well-managed by your primary care physician. I can access your records through the system here, so we can get a more precise understanding of your medical history. Okay, I see here you have a history of hypertension, well-controlled with medication, and a previous diagnosis of pre-diabetes, currently managed with lifestyle modifications. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries... let me think. I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. That was a long time ago, back when I was still young-ish. And I was in the hospital once for a bad fall, but that wasn't a surgery or anything. Just a broken wrist, I think. It healed up fine, though. Nothing else that I can recall, really. It all feels so far away, you know? Like it happened to someone else.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. Cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – and a previous wrist fracture. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... I have some for my arthritis, in my hands. They make them a little less achy, you know? And sometimes I take something for sleeping, if I’m really having trouble. That little blue pill. But not every night. Just when I need it. And... I think that's it. Maybe sometimes something for a headache, but not regularly. It all gets mixed up, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so medications for hypertension, arthritis, as-needed sleep aid, and occasional headache relief. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies... hmm. Not that I know of, dear. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My husband, he's the picky one. He doesn't like seafood. But me? I eat it all. I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to a pill, either. Not that I can remember, anyway. My memory... well, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Stoffregen. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... let me see. My mother, she had some trouble with her heart when she got older. And my father, he had diabetes. He had to take shots for it, back when they didn't have all the pills they have now. And... I think my sister had some problems with her kidneys, but she lived far away, so I don't know much about it. That's about all I can remember, really. We didn't talk about these things much when I was growing up. It was just... not something we did.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart disease, diabetes, and kidney problems. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, dear. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, he used to smoke when we were young, but he quit years ago. Said it wasn't good for him, and I always told him it smelled awful. It's a nasty habit. I'm glad he quit.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit, dear. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not every night, just on special occasions, or if we're feeling fancy. Nothing heavy. My husband enjoys a beer now and then, too. We're not big drinkers, honestly. Just a little something to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional light alcohol consumption. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not much these days, dear. I used to be very active, I loved to garden and walk, but my arthritis makes it hard now. I mostly sit and read, or watch television. My husband does most of the walking now. He’s very good about it, but I get tired easily. I try to move around a bit, but it's not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, a decrease in activity level due to arthritis. Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, my old bones aren’t what they used to be. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, with good air movement on both sides. Your abdomen is soft, with no tenderness to the touch. Your reflexes are normal and your muscle strength is good. Finally, I’ll perform a rectal exam. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. The rectal exam is normal. I do not feel any masses or tenderness. Your stool is a normal color. Based on this exam, I don’t feel any immediate cause for concern. However, given your symptoms, and the changes you’ve described, I would like to order some tests to help us determine the cause. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests? What kind of tests? I don’t like tests, dear. They always make me nervous. But… if you think it's necessary, then I suppose. What kind of tests are we talking about? And will they hurt? I don’t want anything painful, you know. I'm an old woman, I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Stoffregen, and I’ll do everything I can to make sure you’re comfortable. The tests I’m recommending are fairly routine. First, I’d like to order a urinalysis – a urine sample – to check for infection or other abnormalities. That's very simple; you'll just provide a sample in a cup. Then, I’d like to order a blood test to check your kidney function, prostate specific antigen levels – to rule out prostate issues – and a complete blood count. The blood draw will only take a few minutes, and a nurse will be very careful. We'll also do a post-void residual measurement – after you urinate, we'll use a small, handheld device to measure how much urine is left in your bladder. That's non-invasive. These tests will help us rule out common causes of your symptoms and determine if further investigation is needed. They shouldn’t be painful, though you may feel a slight pinch with the blood draw. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So many tests... Urine sample, blood test, and something with my bladder... Alright, dear. If you think it's necessary, I suppose I can do it. But please be gentle. And tell me what everything is for, you know? I don't like surprises. And if it's going to hurt, tell me beforehand. What exactly will they be looking for with the urine sample? And the blood test? I need to understand. And who will tell me the results?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. I completely understand your concerns, and I’ll explain everything thoroughly. With the urine sample, we'll be looking for signs of a urinary tract infection, or any blood or protein in your urine, which could indicate a kidney problem. The blood test will help us assess your kidney function, check for any signs of inflammation or infection, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. The prostate specific antigen levels are checked to see if the prostate gland is enlarged, which sometimes causes urinary symptoms in men, but it is a good baseline to have for women, too. I will personally review the results with you, Ms. Stoffregen, as soon as they are available, which usually takes a few days. If anything concerning is found, we’ll discuss further steps, which may include a referral to a urologist – a specialist in urinary health. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and answer any questions you may have. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… better, I suppose. A specialist if needed, and you'll tell me the results. And you'll explain everything. Yes, that sounds acceptable. When can I do the tests? And where? Will I need to fast for the blood test? I had a bad experience once with fasting, it made me very dizzy.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The tests can be done here at the clinic, Ms. Stoffregen. We can schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning, and the urine sample can be collected anytime before then, or first thing tomorrow. And yes, you will need to fast for the blood test—no food or drink except water for 8-12 hours beforehand. But I understand your concerns about dizziness, so we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. You can sit down during the draw, and we’ll have a nurse monitor you closely. If you feel dizzy at any point, please let them know immediately. We can also schedule the blood draw later in the day if that makes you more comfortable. I’ll have the nurse schedule those appointments for you now. She’ll give you detailed instructions about the fasting and urine collection. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Tomorrow morning, no food. And the nurse will explain everything. That sounds… manageable, I suppose. No, I think that's all, dear. You've explained everything very thoroughly. Just… please make sure the nurse is gentle with the blood draw. I bruise easily, you know. And I don't like needles. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your patience with me. It's not easy being old, you know. Everything hurts, and I forget things so easily.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests, especially with age. We will take excellent care of you. I’ll make a note in your chart to remind the nurse to be extra gentle, and to monitor you closely during the blood draw. Please don't hesitate to let us know if you experience any discomfort at any time. I will see you at your follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as fever, severe pain, or inability to urinate – please call the clinic immediately. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Stoffregen. Have a good rest of your day.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, dear. You've been very kind. I will remember to call if anything gets worse. Have a good day to you too, doctor. And thank you again.
