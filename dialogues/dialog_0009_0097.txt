DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I am here because my husband, he insists I get one of these… advance directive forms. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… something happen. Honestly, I think it’s a bit premature, but he is quite insistent.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very thoughtful of your husband to be proactive about this, even if it doesn’t feel immediately necessary to you. It is a really important conversation to have, and getting things documented in advance can certainly ease things for everyone involved, should the need ever arise. Before we delve into that specifically, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Well, I maintain a very… refined lifestyle. I eat well – mostly. And I certainly don’t need exercise, though I do take the occasional walk. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a considerable number of years. I find most of them are unnecessarily alarmist, frankly. Is this going to be a long process? Because I have a luncheon scheduled this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Marija. And I assure you, my goal isn’t to be alarmist – simply thorough. We can certainly keep things as concise as possible, respecting your time. Perhaps we can start with a brief review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Significant medical conditions? No. Nothing of any… consequence. I had the flu, perhaps, once. A very mild case. And a rather unpleasant bout of indigestion last spring. But those are hardly… diagnoses. Really, I am remarkably healthy for my age, if you must know. I attribute it to good genes and a discerning palate. Is this form related to… end-of-life care, specifically? Because my husband has been reading a lot of… rather morbid things lately.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Marija. It sounds like you prioritize your wellbeing, which is excellent. And you are right to ask – an advance directive can cover end-of-life wishes, but it’s much broader than that. It allows you to specify your healthcare preferences even if you are unable to communicate them yourself – for example, if you were in an accident and needed emergency treatment. To get a clearer picture, and to ensure we’re on the same page, could you tell me if you've ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything other than a brief illness like the flu?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, absolutely not. I have a… delicate constitution. The very thought of it! Hospitalized… well, when I was a child, I had my tonsils out. But that was… decades ago. And a very minor procedure, really. I barely remember it. My mother handled all the details. Honestly, Doctor, are you certain this form is necessary? It seems like an awful lot of bother, and I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions. Though, admittedly, my husband is rather… overprotective. He worries about everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your reservations, Marija. It sounds like you've been quite healthy and self-sufficient, and that’s wonderful. It’s perfectly valid to question whether this form is right for you. Let's broaden the picture a little. Do you have any chronic health conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Chronic health conditions? Good heavens, no! I maintain a very strict diet. And I simply do not allow myself to be stressed. Stress is terribly damaging, you know. I do occasionally experience a… slight stiffness in my left shoulder, particularly in cold weather, but that is merely… age. My mother always said I was prone to sensitivity. It's hardly a condition requiring medical attention, I assure you. I find a warm compress is perfectly sufficient. Are you implying I have a health problem, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Marija. I’m simply trying to get a comprehensive understanding of your overall health. It’s good you have strategies that work for you – a warm compress is an excellent idea. One last question regarding your medical background, and then we can move on to your family history if you're amenable. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, goodness, no. I prefer natural remedies. I take a small spoonful of honey every morning for my throat, and sometimes a chamomile tea if I'm feeling… unsettled. But that is hardly a medication. Vitamins, perhaps. A multi-vitamin, occasionally. Though I tend to get most of my nutrients from my diet. Really, I pride myself on avoiding pharmaceuticals. They simply create more problems than they solve. Are you building a case for prescribing me something, Doctor? Because I assure you, I have no interest.
DOCTOR: No, Marija, I assure you I am not. I’m simply completing a standard health questionnaire. It’s important to know everything you’re taking – even honey and chamomile – as they can sometimes interact with medications should you ever need them. Now, if you're comfortable, let's talk a bit about your family's health history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had any significant health problems, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. That is a rather depressing topic, frankly. My mother… well, she was always a bit… delicate. She suffered from… anxieties. And she insisted on seeing a succession of doctors for every minor ailment. My father… he had a rather strong constitution, but he died unexpectedly from a… chest ailment when I was quite young. It was very upsetting. My siblings… my sister is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Though she does have rather questionable taste in clothing. And my brother… well, he lives a very… unconventional lifestyle. I rarely speak to him. Really, I don’t think our family history is terribly relevant. We are all quite different. Is this form absolutely necessary, Doctor? Perhaps I can just sign something saying I decline any… heroic measures?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to dwell on difficult topics, Marija. And it's good you're thinking about what's important to you. Even a little information is helpful. The fact that your father passed away from a chest ailment is something we should note. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but it's good to be aware. You mentioned potentially declining heroic measures. That is a component of an advance directive, but it also covers things like who you would want to make medical decisions for you if you were unable to do so yourself, and what your values are regarding different types of treatment. Before we continue, and if you’re willing, I’d like to get a few basic measurements – your height, weight, and blood pressure. It’s standard procedure, and will help me get a more complete picture of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Measurements? Oh, goodness. Must we? I haven't been weighed in… decades. I prefer not to know, frankly. It's terribly… vulgar. And I always feel rather faint when they take my blood pressure. My nerves, you see. I am quite a… sensitive person. Honestly, Doctor, I really think I’ve answered enough questions for one day. Perhaps we can just skip the measurements and I can sign something saying I wish to be left undisturbed in the event of a… crisis? I'm sure my husband will be perfectly capable of handling everything. He's very… decisive.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. Your comfort is my priority. We absolutely do not need to do anything you’re not comfortable with. If you would prefer to skip the measurements and discuss simply completing a document stating your wishes, we can certainly do that. We can focus on naming a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf – and outlining any preferences you have regarding treatment. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. That would be… acceptable. Naming my husband as my healthcare proxy seems… logical. He is, after all, quite capable. And decisive. He knows what's best. Though, frankly, I still think all of this is rather unnecessary. But if it will appease him… very well. Let's just get it over with, Doctor. I have a luncheon appointment, you know. And I simply must be on time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I have the form here. It’s fairly straightforward. We'll just need to fill in your name, your husband's name and contact information, and then we can discuss any specific instructions you’d like to include. We can start with your name and date of birth, if you don’t mind. And then we’ll add your husband’s information. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions at all. I'm here to guide you through the process, at your own pace.
PATIENT: .
