DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good mornin’ to ye, Doctor. Well, it's this nausea, see. Been gettin’ it most mornings now. Not a proper sick feeling, more like… a queasy churnin’ in me stomach. It’s been botherin’ me for a few weeks now, and I figured I best get it checked, considerin’ me heart’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And you mentioned your heart… is this related to a previous cardiac issue, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Had a bit of a scare ‘bout five years ago now. They said it was heart failure, though I don't pretend to understand all the details. Been takin’ pills since, keepin’ an eye on things. The specialist said the nausea could be a sign somethin’s up with the heart again, so I thought I’d best not take any chances. Do ye need to know what pills I’m on, Doctor? I’ve got a list here somewhere…
DOCTOR: Yes, please, let’s have a look at that list. It’s important to know what medications you’re currently taking, especially given your history. And just to clarify, this nausea… does anything seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Right, here we go… Let’s see… there’s Lisinopril, 20mg daily, and Furosemide, 40mg every other day. And Digoxin, 0.125mg, just the one every day. As for what makes it worse… not really, no. It seems to just come on with the mornin', regardless of what I’ve eaten or done. Sometimes it’s worse if I’m feelin’ a bit stressed, maybe, but mostly it's just… there. Like a slow rollin’ sea, in me belly. Does that make any sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A slow rollin' sea… yes, I suppose. It's… descriptive. Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, well… now that ye mention it, I've been a bit more breathless than usual, especially when I'm walkin' up the hill to the shops. And me ankles… they’ve been a wee bit swollen at the end of the day. I just put it down to the heat, to be honest, but maybe… maybe it’s somethin’ more. I’ve also been feelin’ a bit tired, mind you, but who doesn’t these days? It’s hard to tell what’s what, really. I’m no spring chicken anymore. Does any of that sound important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Breathlessness, ankle swelling, fatigue… yes, those are relevant. It could be related to your heart condition, as your specialist suggested. Let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever ye think best. I'm happy to be poked and prodded, if it helps. Just let me know if it's gonna be… uncomfortable. I’ve got a funny back these days, so be gentle, eh?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I’ll listen to your lungs and heart. After that, I’ll take a look at your ankles and check for any edema. And yes, I’ll be mindful of your back. Please lie back on the table.
PATIENT: Right then. Here goes nothin’. Och, this isnae as bad as I feared. Just let me know if ye need me to breathe deep or anything. I’m a bit of a fidget, mind ye, so ye might have to ask me a few times.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a bit elevated – 145 over 90. Heart rate is regular, but a bit on the slow side, as expected with the Digoxin. I’m hearing a slight S3 gallop… which is consistent with fluid overload. Lungs sound a bit congested, some crackles in the bases. And yes, definitely some pitting edema in both ankles. Two plus pitting edema bilaterally. Alright, Mr. Benic. Findings are consistent with worsening heart failure. I’m going to order an ECG and a blood test – a complete blood count and a BNP level. The BNP will help us assess the extent of the heart failure.
PATIENT: Och. Worsenin’, ye say? That doesn’t sound good at all. A BNP… is that a bad thing? And an ECG, that’s the one with the sticky things on me chest, right? I’ve had one of those before. So, ye think it is me heart playin’ up again? I was hopin’ it was just a bad case of indigestion. Is there… is there anything I should be doin’ right now? Like, should I be takin’ it easy? Less salt, maybe? I've heard that helps. And I don’t suppose ye can tell me what this all means, in plain English? I’m no a doctor, ye see. Just an old man tryin’ to keep goin’.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Benic, the findings suggest your heart failure is likely worsening. The BNP, or B-type natriuretic peptide, is a hormone released by the heart when it’s under stress. A higher level indicates more strain on the heart. And yes, the ECG is the one with the sticky pads – it checks the electrical activity of your heart. Less salt is absolutely crucial. Fluid overload, indicated by the congestion in your lungs and ankle swelling, is putting strain on your heart. Reducing salt intake will help minimize fluid retention. You should also limit your fluid intake – no more than two liters a day. As for what this means… your heart is struggling to pump enough blood to meet your body’s needs. That’s why you’re breathless, tired, and retaining fluid. We need to determine the extent of the problem with the ECG and blood tests, and then adjust your medication accordingly. I’m going to get the nurse to draw blood and schedule the ECG. In the meantime, please follow those dietary restrictions. And if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – severe breathlessness, chest pain – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I think I understand. Less salt, less water, and keep a close eye on things. And if it gets bad, straight to the hospital. It’s a bit of a shock, to be honest. I thought I was managin’ alright. Will I be needin’ to stay in hospital, Doctor? I don’t really like hospitals, if I’m bein’ honest. It’s just… a bit depressing, ye see. And I’ve got the garden to look after, the tomatoes are just comin’ ripe… I’ll get the nurse, then. Thank ye for explainin’ it all so clearly, Doctor. It’s a wee bit scary, but at least I know what’s what now.
DOCTOR: We'll assess the test results first, Mr. Benic. A hospital stay may be necessary, depending on the severity of your condition. We'll discuss all options once we have more information. For now, focus on those dietary restrictions and monitor your symptoms closely. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood and schedule the ECG. She'll also provide you with a written list of instructions regarding diet and symptom monitoring. I’ll be back to discuss the results once they are available.
PATIENT: Right. Aye. I’ll do that. Thank ye, Doctor. And… thank ye again. .
