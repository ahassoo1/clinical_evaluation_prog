DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Guilds, yeah, that's me. Look, I'm… short of breath, okay? It's been gettin’ worse. And my mouth feels like the desert. Eyes too. Real dry. Don’t know what’s causin’ it. It’s just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Short of breath and dry mouth and eyes. And you said this has been getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Recently… yeah, I guess so. Hard to say how recent. Things kinda blur together when you get to be my age, you know? It’s not like it happened overnight. More like… a slow fade. It just… is.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be hard to pinpoint things exactly. When you're doing everyday activities, does the shortness of breath bother you?
PATIENT: Everyday activities? Hmph. What are everyday activities these days? I mostly sit. Watch the TV. Maybe walk to the mailbox. Shortness of breath… yeah, even walkin’ to the mailbox. Used to be nothin’. Now… I gotta stop and catch my breath. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, so even with light activity like walking to the mailbox you're noticing shortness of breath and needing to stop. And how about when you're just sitting and resting?
PATIENT: Even sittin'! Sometimes, just… sittin' there. Feels like I can't get enough air. It’s not constant, you understand? Comes and goes. But it’s there. Annoyin’. And this dry mouth… makes it worse, I think. Hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's intermittent, coming and going, but present even at rest. And you feel the dry mouth contributes to the shortness of breath. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Now you're askin' things. I wear socks most of the time. Hard to tell. Maybe a little? Look, I ain’t one for lookin' at my feet. Never have been. Always been more concerned with what’s above my ankles, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay. And have you had any chest pain or a cough associated with this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. Not really. A little discomfort sometimes, but nothin’ I’d call pain. And a cough? I cough. Everybody coughs. Old man cough, you know? Dust, allergies… who knows. It's not a new cough, if that’s what you’re askin’. Just… a regular cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no new chest pain or cough. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Now there’s a question. I… I don't weigh myself. Used to, maybe, back when… well, it doesn’t matter. I’m probably… lighter. Haven’t been eatin’ much lately. Not much of an appetite when you can’t breathe right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Medicare gives me somethin’ for my blood pressure, I think. Little white pill. Take it every mornin’. Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with pills. Just… take ‘em.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a medication for blood pressure. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Name? Hmph. Doctors always wantin' names. Look, the bottle's at home. Little blue bottle, I think. I don't bother with memorizin' names. Just take the pill the nice lady tells me to take. It's all a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, we can look that up later. And have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Oh, goodness. Let me think. Years ago… when my mother… no, that wasn’t me. When I broke my arm as a kid. That was a long time ago. And… somethin’ with my appendix maybe? It was a long time ago, before they had all these fancy machines. Everything's a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken arm as a child and possibly an appendectomy in the past. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My sister, Elena, she's still around. Lives in Miami. We don't talk much, though. And… my son. He… he passed away a few years back. Sad story. As for illnesses, she's healthy as a horse. He… he had some problems. Heart, I think.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your son. And your sister Elena is healthy. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Just don’t expect me to remember much of what you tell me. My mind ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could just take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Okay, and now I’m going to listen to your heart. I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, and your heart sounds a little… distant. Now, let’s check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen level is 92%, which is a little low. I’m also going to check your ankles for swelling. There’s a little bit of swelling present, especially on your right ankle.
PATIENT: Wheezing? Swelling? See? I told you somethin' was wrong. Distant heart… that don't sound good. My son… he had heart problems, you know. Is it… serious? Don’t tell me it’s serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds. Let's not jump to conclusions. The wheezing suggests some narrowing of your airways, and the swelling in your ankles could indicate fluid retention. The slightly low oxygen level is also something we need to address. It’s not necessarily serious right now, but it does warrant further investigation. I want to order a chest X-ray and some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. It could be related to a number of things, including a possible infection, heart condition, or fluid buildup in your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-rays? Blood work? More tests… It never ends, does it? Fine. Do what you gotta do. But don’t expect me to understand all the fancy words. Just tell me if it’s somethin’ I gotta worry about. And… how long will this take? I got my stories on.
DOCTOR: Okay. The X-ray will only take a few minutes, and the blood work will be done right here in the clinic. It will take a few hours to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll discuss them together and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you an inhaler to help with the wheezing and shortness of breath. I’ll also recommend a low-sodium diet and encourage you to drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Inhaler… low-sodium… It's all so much. Look, will this inhaler help me breathe better right away? That’s all I care about. And… who do I call if somethin' goes wrong? My mind's not what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, the inhaler should help you breathe easier fairly quickly. It may not be immediate, but you should notice some improvement within a few hours. It works by opening up your airways. And if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever – please call my office immediately at 555-123-4567. The number is also on the prescription. We have someone on call 24/7. Do you have any other questions before I send the prescriptions to your pharmacy?
PATIENT: 555-123-4567… okay, I’ll try to remember that. A high fever… right. Just help me breathe, that’s all I ask. I don’t want to end up like my son. Alright. Send the prescriptions. And… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guilds. I'm sending the prescriptions to your pharmacy now. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the discharge instructions with you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re here to help. Have a good day, and try to rest. .
