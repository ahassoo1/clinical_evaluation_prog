DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. Nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have a lot of time. Just…tired. Really tired. And I…eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I need it. It's stupid, I know. Don't ask me why, I don't know why. Just…get on with it, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to rush, but I understand you're short on time. Tired, and…a craving for dirt. Okay. Let’s try to figure this out. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Honestly? I have no idea. A while ago. Months, maybe? Everything just…blurs together these days. I used to be able to get things done, you know? Work...I used to be a good programmer. Now I just…sleep. Or want to. Does it matter when? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: It does matter, a little, but I understand if it’s hard to pinpoint. Months of fatigue… that's significant. And this…urge for dirt. Has anything changed in your life around the time this started?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean? My husband…he passed a few years back. That was a change. Everything changed then. But this…this dirt thing? No. It just…started. Look, I don't eat rocks, okay? It's just…earth. Like, from the garden. It’s embarrassing. Don’t look at me like that.
DOCTOR: No judgement here, Hedy, truly. It’s my job to understand what’s going on. And it is helpful information. Craving non-food items…that’s something we need to explore. It can be connected to a few different things. Let's talk about your diet generally. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, diet. I mostly just grab whatever's easy. Toast. Sometimes soup. I don't really cook anymore. Not since…well, you know. I don't have much of an appetite. And honestly? Sometimes the dirt feels…better than food. I know that sounds crazy. Don’t make me explain it. I just want a quick fix, alright? Is there a pill for this?
DOCTOR: I understand you’re looking for something quick, and we’ll get there. But a “quick fix” isn’t always possible, or healthy. And it's important to understand why you’re feeling this way. Okay. We’ll run some tests. First, let’s do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, heart rate, just a general look. Then we'll get some bloodwork done. That will give us a lot more information. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. I have things to do. And don’t ask me about my feelings. I don’t do feelings. Just…the tests. Quickly, please. And tell me if it’s going to cost a lot of money. I don't… I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No feelings talk, I promise. We’ll focus on the tests. And I'll be upfront about costs. We'll keep it as minimal as possible, and I can connect you with resources if needed. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Can you just relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Just hurry up. It feels like I've been here forever already. And it's hot in here.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Not drastically, but something we'll want to monitor. Pulse is 78, regular. Breathing sounds a little…wheezy. Do you have any history of asthma or allergies?
PATIENT: Asthma? No. Allergies… maybe a little dust sometimes. But nothing serious. Look, is this dirt thing…serious? Am I sick? Don’t tell me it’s something awful. I just want to feel…useful again. I used to be good at things. Now I just…eat dirt and sleep. It’s pathetic.
DOCTOR: It's not pathetic, Hedy. It's concerning, and we're going to figure out what's going on. The craving for dirt, along with the fatigue and the slightly elevated blood pressure and wheezing…it could be a few different things. It could be a nutritional deficiency, like iron. It could be something else entirely. That’s why we need the bloodwork. I'm going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. We'll also check your thyroid levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Thyroid? What does that even mean? Just…fine. Whatever you need to do. Just get it over with. And don’t expect me to understand any of it. I never was good with medical stuff. My husband…he always handled things like this. Now… Just do the tests. Quickly. I have…appointments. Important appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the requisition for the lab. The phlebotomist is just down the hall. They'll draw some blood. It shouldn’t take long. And don’t worry about understanding everything. I’ll explain the results to you when they come back. And if you need a moment, or just want to sit quietly for a bit after the bloodwork, just let the nurse know. We’ll get through this, Hedy.
PATIENT: Fine. Just…don’t bother me with details. I’ll go do the blood thing. And please, don’t ask me about my feelings. It’s…irritating. .
