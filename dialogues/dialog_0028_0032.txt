DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, so what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Memmolo, is it? Yes, Memmolo. A… delicate matter, really. It’s… something I’ve noticed. A bit of… leakage, you see. Not a flood, mind you, but… present. Quite bothersome, actually. It’s been… a while now. I’m not entirely sure how long. Days, perhaps? Weeks? Time slips away, you know.
DOCTOR: Leakage. Right. Is this… urinary leakage?
PATIENT: Urinary? Good heavens, no. Not that kind of leakage, Doctor. Though, I suppose at my age, one can expect… things to loosen. No, this is… from down there. A discharge, I believe the younger generation calls it. Rather unpleasant, really. And my wife… well, she’s quite insistent I have it looked at.
DOCTOR: A discharge… from the… genital area. I see. And you haven’t noticed any… odor?
PATIENT: Odor? Well, now that you mention it… yes, a faint one. Not overpowering, mind you. More… musty, perhaps? Like old linens left in the attic. It's not a strong smell, Doctor, but… noticeable. Particularly after… exertion. Though what exertion at my age is, is another matter entirely.
DOCTOR: And have you had any pain, burning, or itching associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? Goodness, no. I am not a child, Doctor. Though, there is… a slight discomfort. A bit of… sensitivity. Not agonizing, mind you, but… present. It’s hardly worth mentioning, really. Itching? No. I keep myself… clean, you understand. My wife sees to that, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Changes… hmmm. Let me think. It takes a bit longer to start, perhaps. A slight hesitation. And… it’s not as forceful as it once was. A mere trickle, really. I suppose I shouldn’t expect much at my age. But no burning, no pain, Doctor. Just… diminished. And the aforementioned hesitation.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you had any recent sexual activity?
PATIENT: Sexual activity? Doctor Memmolo! At my age? Honestly! I am eighty-three years old, not a… a young buck! My wife and I… well, let’s just say our days of activity are long behind us. What an impertinent question!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to be… indignant. Let’s move on. Any history of sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Infections? Good heavens, no. I’ve lived a respectable life, Doctor. A good, honest life. My wife and I have always been… discreet. Before we were married, certainly. And after. I can assure you, I haven't contracted any… diseases. The very suggestion! It's… uncouth.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… now that is a good question. Hmm… I believe I had a bit of a rash once, after taking something for my… arthritis. A red, itchy business. But what the medication was… that escapes me entirely. My wife handles all that, you see. She has a better memory for these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think. There's… the one for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And something for my cholesterol, I believe. Another small one. And… oh, yes, the one for my prostate. My wife keeps track of all this, really. I wouldn’t want to give you the wrong information. It’s quite a list, actually. I'll have her write it down for you later, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: That would be helpful. Alright. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Well, I suppose it’s necessary. Though I must say, Doctor, I am not particularly fond of being… prodded and poked. But if it’s for the best… Yes, go ahead. But please, be gentle. And quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to need to palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. I’ll need to examine the genital area now. Please turn over. I see some discharge. It's a yellowish color and has a mild odor. There’s some mild inflammation. I’ll need to send a sample to the lab to determine the cause.
PATIENT: A lab sample? Goodness. Is it… serious, Doctor? What is it, exactly? This inflammation… is it something I should be worried about? My wife will be terribly upset if this is anything… untoward. And what about this discharge? Is it contagious?
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively without the lab results, Mr. Krok. However, the yellowish discharge and inflammation could indicate a bacterial infection, potentially a sexually transmitted infection, though that’s not confirmed. It could also be a non-sexually transmitted infection. The lab work will help us determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment. As for whether it’s contagious, it’s best to abstain from sexual activity until we have the results and a diagnosis. I'll order a urine sample and a swab of the discharge. The nurse will explain the procedure. Don’t worry, we'll get this sorted out. I’ll also order a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying issues.
PATIENT: A complete blood count? Good heavens. This is becoming rather involved, isn’t it? And abstain… yes, well, that’s hardly a concern at my age. But still… a laboratory sample… and a swab… My wife will not be pleased. Very well, Doctor. Do what you must. But please, be quick about it. This whole ordeal is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse come in to collect the samples. I'll also give you a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic to start while we await the lab results. It won't cure the problem if it's not a bacterial infection, but it won’t hurt while we’re waiting for a diagnosis. I'll also refer you to a urologist for further evaluation. This is just to be thorough, given your age and the nature of the symptoms. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: A urologist? Goodness gracious, no. Must we involve another specialist? This is becoming quite the production, Doctor. And a prescription… while we wait? It feels rather… haphazard, doesn’t it? But… I suppose if it won’t cause harm… Very well. But I expect a full explanation of everything, Doctor. And quickly. I’m not a young man, you know. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns. The antibiotic is precautionary, to prevent any potential complications while we wait for the lab results. The urologist referral is also a standard precaution, given your age and the duration of the symptoms. I'll ensure they receive all the necessary information. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the samples and explain the medication. I’ll review the lab results as soon as they’re available and contact you with the findings. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Just… please, expedite things as much as possible. This whole ordeal is… quite distressing. And tell the nurse to be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll inform the nurse. I’ll be in touch.
