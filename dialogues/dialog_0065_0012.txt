DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month, and the cruise line needs some medical information from a doctor. Just a general check, really, to make sure I’m fit to travel. I lost my husband last year, and well, one wants to be prepared, doesn’t one?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, preparedness is… sensible. Although, a thorough medical evaluation is always a good idea, regardless. So, to start, can you tell me about any current medical problems you're dealing with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Nothing major, Doctor, truly. My knees ache a bit when it’s cold, especially damp cold, and I get heartburn if I eat anything spicy. And I do get a little breathless walking uphill, but I’ve always been a bit that way, I suppose. Nothing new, and nothing that stops me from doing things. I still manage the shop, you know – window displays and all. It keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long have you been experiencing this breathlessness, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. A long time, Doctor. Years, I should think. Since I was, oh, maybe in my thirties. It’s never been severe, just… noticeable. More noticeable when I’m rushing about, or the weather is poor. I haven't ever seen a doctor about it specifically, no. I just… slow down a bit when it’s bad. Is that alright? I hope that doesn’t sound silly.
DOCTOR: It’s not…silly. But it is important information. So, you’ve had this breathlessness for potentially decades and haven’t sought medical evaluation. And to clarify, does this breathlessness come on with exertion only, or do you experience it at rest as well?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, not at rest. Never at rest. Only when I’m doing something. Like carrying things up the stairs at the shop, or, well, hurrying to catch the bus. Or, I suppose, when I’m arranging particularly heavy displays. It never lasts long, Doctor. Just a few minutes, then it’s gone. And, as I said, it's gotten no worse over the years. It's just…always been there a little bit. Do you need to know what sort of displays I do? I’m very good at themed windows, you know. We won an award last Christmas.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your…enthusiasm, Ms. Squiers, let’s focus on the medical aspect. You mentioned your knees and heartburn as well. Are these ongoing problems, and if so, how long have you been experiencing them?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. My apologies for rambling. The knees, well, they’ve been troublesome for about five years now. More in the winter, as I said. I take over-the-counter pain relief sometimes, but it’s not usually necessary. The heartburn… that comes and goes, really. If I eat something rich or spicy, then it flares up. It's never terribly bad, just a bit uncomfortable. I have some antacids, but I don't take them regularly. Honestly, I'm a fairly healthy person, Doctor. I eat well, I sleep well, and I keep busy. I wouldn't want the cruise company thinking I'm frail or something!
DOCTOR: <stage>I make a note of the over-the-counter medications, but my expression remains impassive. "Healthy" according to whom, exactly?
PATIENT: And do you take any other medications at all, even vitamins or supplements? It’s important to have a complete picture, Ms. Squiers. And have you been hospitalised for anything in the past? Or had any serious illnesses or operations?
DOCTOR: And, finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. No, no regular medications at all. Just the occasional pain reliever for my knees. And vitamins sometimes, but not consistently. As for hospitalisations… well, I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, that was many, many years ago. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree, but that was a very long time ago too! As for serious illnesses… nothing comes to mind, Doctor. I’ve been very fortunate, I think. And allergies… hmm. No, I don’t believe so. I enjoy gardening, and I’m out in the pollen all the time. No problems. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. Is that alright? I hope I’m not forgetting anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one, Doctor. My family… well, they weren’t really ones for talking about illnesses. My father died young, of a heart attack, I believe, but he smoked, you see, and worked very hard. My mother lived to a good age, but she always kept herself to herself. I think she had a bit of arthritis in her hands, but she didn’t complain much. And my brother… well, he moved to Canada years ago and I haven’t seen him in ages. I don’t really know about his health. I suppose there’s a history of… longevity on my mother’s side. She always said it was the fresh air, and a good strong constitution. Is that helpful? I’m not very good at remembering these things, I’m afraid. It all happened such a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Squiers, with your permission, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. That will give me a better understanding of your overall health. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I do bruise easily, you see. And I get a bit nervous around needles, but I can manage. You seem very competent. Just… take it easy, alright? And do let me know what you find. I’m very keen to go on this cruise, you see. It's a trip around the Mediterranean. I’ve always wanted to see Italy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Your breathing sounds a little wheezy, Ms. Squiers. It's subtle, but I can hear some narrowing of the airways. I'll need to listen to your back as well.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Wheezy? Is that bad, Doctor? I do get a bit of a cough sometimes, especially in the winter. But I always thought it was just a bit of a cold. I haven’t ever bothered going to the doctor about it, as I said. Is it something serious? I’m starting to feel a bit anxious now, Doctor. Perhaps this cruise wasn’t such a good idea after all…
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Ms. Squiers, but it does warrant further investigation. The wheezing suggests some airway obstruction, which could be caused by several things—asthma, bronchitis, or even an underlying lung condition. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 140 over 85. Slightly elevated. We'll also check your heart rate and oxygen saturation. 96%. That’s acceptable. Now, let me just take a quick look at your ears and throat. Your throat looks clear, but your ears are a little…waxy. No signs of infection.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Elevated blood pressure? And wheezing? This is all very worrying, Doctor. I do get a bit stressed easily, you see. And I have been a bit preoccupied with planning the cruise. Perhaps that's it. Is it possible it’s just nerves? I’ve never had any problems with my blood pressure before. And I always thought a little wax in the ears was normal! This is all rather unsettling, Doctor. Do you think I should cancel the cruise?
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I understand your concern, and it's good you’re bringing these issues to light now. While your anxiety may be contributing to your slightly elevated blood pressure, and a degree of earwax is normal, the wheezing is something we need to investigate further. I cannot clear you for travel without knowing the cause. The possibility of an underlying respiratory condition is a concern, and traveling, particularly long-distance travel, could exacerbate it. I recommend a chest X-ray and pulmonary function testing to assess your lung function. And I'd also like to start you on a trial of an inhaler to see if it improves your breathing. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A chest X-ray? And more tests? That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. I don’t think I’ve ever had an X-ray before. And an inhaler? Is it likely to be… asthma? I don't feel like I have asthma. I get a bit breathless, as I’ve said, but it's not constant. I don’t know… I’m starting to think this cruise is a terrible idea. It’s all too much stress. And I don’t want to be a burden. What if it’s something really serious? What if I need… oxygen? Perhaps I should just stay at home. It's safer, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, it's perfectly normal to feel anxious when facing the unknown. And I understand your concerns completely. We’re not jumping to any conclusions here. The X-ray and pulmonary function tests are simply to help us determine the cause of your breathlessness. It could be something minor, like bronchitis, or it could be something else. But knowing the cause is the first step towards getting you the right treatment. As for asthma, that's just one possibility. We need to rule out other conditions first. And the inhaler is simply a trial to see if it helps relieve your symptoms. It's not a definitive diagnosis. Regarding oxygen, that's a very unlikely scenario at this stage. We're taking things one step at a time. It's far better to be cautious and get this checked out now, than to risk something happening while you're traveling. And I can assure you, you won’t be a burden. That’s what I’m here for. Now, let's focus on getting those tests scheduled. Would you like me to help you with that?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Yes, please, Doctor. Please do help me. I feel so… flustered. Scheduling the tests sounds… sensible, I suppose. If you think it’s best. But… what if the tests show something terrible? What if it’s something incurable? And what about the cruise money? We’ve already paid for everything. It’s a lot of money… Perhaps… perhaps I should just cancel the cruise and stay at home. It would be simpler, wouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, it's perfectly understandable to feel anxious about the possibility of a serious diagnosis. But it's important to remember that we don't have any definitive answers yet. Worrying about something that might happen is only going to increase your stress levels. Let's focus on getting those tests done first. Once we have the results, we can discuss all your options and develop a plan that's right for you. Now, I'm going to write a referral for a chest X-ray and pulmonary function testing at the local hospital. It usually takes a few days to get an appointment. Regarding the cruise money, that's a valid concern. Many travel insurance policies cover cancellations due to medical reasons. We can look into that together once we have a better understanding of your condition. But for now, let's focus on getting those tests scheduled and taking things one step at a time. I'll also write a prescription for a short course of an inhaler to see if it alleviates your breathlessness in the meantime. It’s a trial, remember. Just to see if it helps. And Ms. Squiers, please know that you're not alone in this. I'm here to support you every step of the way.
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Thank you, Doctor. That… that does make me feel a little better. Knowing you’re there to support me… and the inhaler trial… yes. That sounds sensible. Perhaps… perhaps it won’t be so bad after all. Would you… would you mind explaining the tests to me again, just so I know what to expect? And… and could you write down the hospital’s phone number, just in case I forget? I do get a bit flustered easily, you see. And thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. Happy to. The chest X-ray is a simple imaging test that allows us to look at your lungs and see if there are any abnormalities. You'll simply lie on a table, and a technician will take a few pictures. It doesn't hurt at all, and it takes only a few minutes. The pulmonary function testing is a bit more involved. You’ll breathe into a tube connected to a machine that measures how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can do it. It will take about 30 minutes. You’ll have to follow the technician’s instructions carefully. It can be a bit tiring, but it’s not painful. Here’s the hospital’s number. Feel free to call them if you have any questions. I’m also going to write down a few resources for anxiety management, just in case you find yourself feeling overwhelmed. And remember, Ms. Squiers, you're not alone in this. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. No, I think that explains everything, Doctor. Thank you so much. You’ve been very patient with me. I do get a bit worked up easily, you see. I suppose… I should just call the hospital and schedule the tests then. And try not to worry too much. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been a lifesaver. I think… I think that’s all for now. Perhaps… perhaps the cruise will still be possible after all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. And remember, try to stay positive. Worrying won't change the outcome, but taking action will. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And good luck with the tests. I sincerely hope everything turns out alright. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. .
