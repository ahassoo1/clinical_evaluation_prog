DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… my ear, I think. Feels blocked. Full, you know? It’s been… a while now. Honestly, I can’t quite put my finger on when it started. Things aren’t what they used to be with remembering, sadly.
DOCTOR: Hmm, blocked. Right. And you said it’s been going on for a while… difficult to pinpoint when exactly. Okay. Is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, I believe. Yes, definitely the left. It’s… hard to hear out of it sometimes. Not completely gone, just… muffled. Like there’s cotton in there, maybe? I don’t know. Honestly, I just want it gone. It’s distracting, you see? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, muffled in the left ear. Any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Not a sharp pain, anyway. More… a pressure, I guess? Like when you go up too high in an airplane. That sort of feeling. It comes and goes, though. Mostly just annoying, to be frank. I’m an Agricultural Inspector, you see, and I need to hear things. Birds, pests… all sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure, like with altitude changes, and it’s interfering with your work. Any drainage from the ear?
PATIENT: Drainage? No, I don't think so. Let me see… No, nothing like that. I've been keeping it pretty clean, I assure you. I used to… well, my wife always said I was very particular about hygiene. It's all a bit fuzzy now, though, remembering details. Just no drainage. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Right, no drainage. Any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… Oh dear. That's a tough one. I… I had a bit of a cold, maybe? A few weeks back, perhaps? It wasn't anything serious, just a sniffle and a cough. Nothing that kept me in bed. Is that what you mean? Honestly, I forget the dates. Everything blurs together these days. I was hoping to get this ear sorted quickly, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cold a few weeks ago. And no fever or other symptoms with that cold that you recall?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Just the sniffles, a bit of a sore throat, you know, the usual. Nothing major. I took some… some over-the-counter stuff. Pills, I think. Orange bottle. I really can’t recall the name, I’m afraid. Look, is there a way to just… check the ear? See what's going on? I have a meeting later this afternoon and I need to be able to hear properly.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let’s have a look. I’m just going to take a quick look inside your ear. It might be a little uncomfortable for a moment. Just let me know if you feel any pain. I'll need you to stay still.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… quick would be good. Yes, quick is good. I don't like things poked at, if you don't mind. But do what you need to do. Just… gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some wax buildup in your ear canal. It looks a bit impacted, which is likely causing the blockage and pressure. The eardrum itself looks a little red, but doesn't appear to be perforated. This is common, especially with wax buildup. It could be a mild inflammation as well. I think we can safely remove the wax and see if that resolves the issue. It should relieve the pressure and improve your hearing. Are you allergic to any ear drops?
PATIENT: Ear drops? Oh, good question. I… I don’t think so. No, I haven’t used them in years. My wife used to handle all that sort of thing. I don’t recall any allergies, no. But… let me think. Is there anything specific I should be looking out for? I don't want to… well, you know. I just want my ear to work again. Is it a long procedure? Because, like I said, I have that meeting…
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies, good. It’s a quick procedure. I'll use a special solution to soften the wax, then gently irrigate the ear to remove it. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes per ear. There's a slight chance it could cause temporary dizziness, but it's rare. We can take it slowly and stop if you feel uncomfortable. Are you alright with me proceeding?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, alright then. Slowly is good. Very slowly. And if I feel anything… strange, you’ll stop, right? Just… get it done quickly, if you can. I really need to hear for this meeting. It's about… about pest control, actually. Important stuff. Very important. Let's just… get on with it. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I'm going to warm up some water. Then I will gently insert this syringe into your ear canal, and irrigate it with the water. You might feel a little pressure, like a warm flush, and you’ll likely hear some swishing. It’s important to stay still during the process. I'll stop immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort. Just let me know. Here we go. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a bit… cold! And a little strange. Like… water in my ear, obviously. It’s… not painful, exactly. Just… unsettling. And a bit… cold. Yes, definitely cold. Is it supposed to be that cold? Maybe a little warmer next time? I feel a… a slight pressure. Like… popping, almost. Is that normal? I'm staying very still, I assure you. Very, very still.
DOCTOR: You're right, it’s a little cold. Apologies. I’ve adjusted the temperature, hopefully that’s better. The popping sensation is normal, that’s the wax breaking up. The water should start running clearer soon. I’m seeing some wax coming out now. Just a little more, and it should be clear. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… much better, the temperature. Thank you. And yes, I think I can feel… something moving. Like… a blockage being released. It’s… a strange sensation. Not unpleasant, exactly. But… noticeable. I think I can hear a little better already. Yes! A little. Still muffled, but… less so. Keep going, I think. Just… gently. And tell me if you see anything… concerning. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, I think we've got most of the wax out. I'm seeing clear drainage now. Let me suction out the remaining water. There. Looks much better. The eardrum is clear now, and the canal is clear of wax. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh… that is better! Yes, much better. I can hear you much clearer now. And… it doesn’t feel blocked anymore. It’s… a relief, honestly. Like… a weight lifted. I can hear the clock ticking, which I couldn’t before. It's amazing. Thank you, Doctor. That was… a very good job. Are you certain it's all out? I don’t want it to come back tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. And yes, I’m quite confident we got it all. It’s possible a small amount of wax may build up again over time – it’s a natural process – but it shouldn’t be as impacted as it was. I recommend avoiding using cotton swabs in your ear, as they can actually push the wax further in. I'll document that we performed cerumen removal on your left ear, with successful resolution of the blockage. Do you have any other concerns today?
PATIENT: No, no. I think that's everything. Honestly, just the relief of being able to hear again is wonderful. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very helpful. And… gentle. I appreciate that. I have that meeting now, so… I should probably be going. Is there anything I need to pay? Or… instructions? No, don’t worry about the instructions. I'll just… avoid putting anything in my ear, like you said. Thank you. Really. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m glad I could help. The receptionist will take care of the payment. And yes, just avoid putting anything in your ear. If you experience any pain, drainage, or decrease in hearing, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Have a good meeting. Goodbye.
