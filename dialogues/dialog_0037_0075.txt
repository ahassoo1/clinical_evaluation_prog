DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I've been feeling awfully sleepy during the day, even though I’m using one of those machines for my sleep apnea. It just…doesn’t seem to be doing the trick anymore, you see. It's a little frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Paske. It's definitely concerning when a treatment isn’t working as expected. Let's try to figure out what's going on. First, can you tell me a little more about this sleepiness?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it's not like I’m falling asleep standing up, thankfully! But I find myself nodding off in my armchair while reading, or feeling very drowsy during lectures… I teach a couple of courses at the community college, you know, history and a bit of culture. And sometimes, mid-sentence, I just… feel like I could drift off. It’s not every lecture, but often enough that it’s becoming a problem. It worries me, because I like to be sharp for my students.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and I appreciate you clarifying that it’s not a sudden, overwhelming sleepiness. It’s helpful to understand the context. So, you’re noticing this drowsiness particularly when you're engaged in quieter activities, like reading or lecturing?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Things that don't require a lot of physical effort. When I’m, say, gardening – I do a bit of gardening, keeps me moving – I don’t notice it nearly as much. It's when I’m sitting still, focusing… that's when it hits. And it's been going on for… oh, I’d say about three months now, maybe a bit longer. It’s gotten gradually worse, not sudden.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months of gradual worsening, primarily when you’re sedentary and focusing. That helps. Now, let's talk about the sleep apnea machine. What kind of machine is it—a CPAP, BiPAP, or something else?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the machine. It's a CPAP, I believe. It has a mask that goes over my nose, and it blows air into me while I’m sleeping. The doctor – a different doctor, a few years ago – said it would help me breathe better. And it did, for a while. My wife used to say I snored terribly, and that stopped. But this daytime sleepiness… it feels like a separate issue, even though it's connected to the sleep, I suppose. I try to use it every night, but sometimes I take it off if it's too uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're using a CPAP, and it helped with the snoring, which is good. But you’ve noticed it doesn’t fully address the daytime sleepiness, and you don't always use it consistently because of discomfort. Can you tell me about how often you'd say you are using the CPAP per night, on average?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Honestly, it varies. On a good night, I'll get a solid six or seven hours with it on. But then there are nights where I only manage a couple of hours, or I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep with it on, so I just take it off and finish the night without it. I'd say… maybe four nights a week I use it properly, and the other three are… spotty. It’s probably less than I should, I admit. I just… it feels a bit claustrophobic sometimes, and it dries out my nose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly four nights a week with consistent CPAP use, and the other nights are inconsistent due to discomfort. That’s helpful information. Now, let's move on to other things that could be contributing. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question. Actually, yes. I’ve put on a few pounds over the last year. Not a lot, but enough that my trousers feel a bit snugger. I used to be around 85 kilos, and now I'm closer to 92, I think. I haven't been as active as I used to be, perhaps. Gardening isn’t quite the workout it once was. It's just… getting older, you know? Everything slows down a bit.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weight gain of about 7 kilos over the last year, and a decrease in activity. That's definitely something we need to consider. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that have been diagnosed, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have a bit of high blood pressure, yes. The doctor put me on medication for it about five years ago, and I’ve been taking it regularly ever since. Other than that… nothing major, really. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, but that was a one-time thing. No diabetes, no heart problems as far as I know. I have the usual aches and pains of an old man, but nothing that keeps me up at night, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have diagnosed hypertension managed with medication, and a history of gallbladder removal. Thank you for sharing that. Now, can you tell me what medications you’re currently taking, including the dosage, if you know it?
PATIENT: Certainly. For the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. The dosage… let me see if I have the bottle handy… Yes, here it is. 20 milligrams, once a day. And… that's it, really. Just the Lisinopril. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's not a prescription, you understand. Just something for general health.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension, and occasional multivitamins. Now, I’m going to ask about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had any trouble with medications, as far as I can recall. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. My wife used to be allergic to bee stings, but that was her problem, not mine!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and he regretted it terribly. It wasn't a good sight, seeing him cough and struggle. So, I stayed well away from them. I’ve always been careful about my health, you see. I enjoy a good glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's about it. Nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking, and occasional social drinking. Now, let's move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or sleep apnea?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had heart problems later in life, she needed a pacemaker eventually. And my brother… he had diabetes, type 2, I think. He wasn’t very careful with his diet, unfortunately. As for sleep apnea… now that you mention it, my wife’s father snored terribly, and she always said he was very tired during the day. But we never really knew if it was actual sleep apnea, you understand. It was just something she observed. So, heart disease and diabetes on that side of the family, perhaps some sleep apnea, but nothing definite.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart disease and diabetes in the family, and a possible family history of sleep apnea. Finally, let’s talk about your daily routine. What is a typical day like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I usually wake up around 7:00 AM, although sometimes a bit earlier if I have something important to do. I have a light breakfast – toast and coffee, usually – and then I’ll read the newspaper for a while. I try to get a bit of exercise in the morning, either gardening or a short walk. Then I have a couple of lectures at the college in the afternoons, and I spend the evenings reading, grading papers, or spending time with my… well, I spend time on my own these days, mostly. I’m divorced, you see. I try to eat a sensible dinner, and I’m in bed by 10:00 PM. It’s a quiet life, but I enjoy it. I keep busy, and I try to stay active, both mentally and physically.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That gives me a very good overview of your health and lifestyle. I see here that your last physical exam was about a year ago. Your blood pressure was well-controlled on Lisinopril at that time. It looks like you’ve had routine blood work done annually. Let me take a look at those results. Okay, your cholesterol is a little elevated, but not significantly. Your blood sugar is normal. Your thyroid function is also within normal limits. I do see a recent note from your primary care physician mentioning your complaint of daytime sleepiness. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to check your heart, lungs, and to assess your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Absolutely, go ahead. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I just want to figure out what's causing this tiredness. It's starting to interfere with things, you know? I want to be able to keep teaching, and I want to enjoy my life. So, yes, please do your exam.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. I’ll also take a quick look at your throat and ears. Your throat looks clear, and your ears are normal. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears to be normal. However, given your complaint of daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use, and the fact that your weight has increased, I'm concerned about the possibility of obstructive sleep apnea that is not being adequately treated, or perhaps a different sleep disorder altogether. We also want to investigate the elevated cholesterol.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. It's good to know nothing obvious is wrong, but I agree, the sleep is the biggest concern. And, yes, my weight has crept up a bit, I suppose. What do you suggest we do next? More tests? Perhaps a different kind of machine? I'm open to whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. I appreciate your trust. Given your history, I recommend a few things. First, I'd like to order a repeat polysomnography – a sleep study – to reassess the severity of your obstructive sleep apnea while you’re using your CPAP. This will help us determine if your CPAP is still effectively managing your sleep apnea, or if adjustments are needed – perhaps a different mask, or a change in pressure settings. Secondly, I'd like to order a blood lipid panel to further investigate your elevated cholesterol levels. Finally, I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel. It will give us a broad overview of your kidney and liver function, and help rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A sleep study, blood work… it’s all sensible. And I understand why you’d want to check my kidneys and liver, just to be thorough. I don’t have any questions, no. Where would I go to get the sleep study done? Is it the same place as before? And, will my insurance cover all this? I'm on Medicare, you see. I just want to make sure I don’t get any unexpected bills.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question about the sleep study and insurance. Yes, the sleep study should be done at the same facility as before – Sleep Diagnostics Center on Elm Street. I’ll send an electronic referral to them. They are familiar with your history. As for Medicare coverage, both the sleep study and the blood work should be covered, as long as they are deemed medically necessary, which I believe they are in your case. However, it’s always a good idea to confirm with your insurance provider directly to avoid any surprises. Their number is on the back of your Medicare card. I’ll also have my office staff call them to pre-authorize the sleep study. Once we have the results of these tests, we can discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan that’s tailored to your specific needs. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to use your CPAP as consistently as possible, even if it’s not fully relieving your symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough and explained everything clearly. I appreciate your patience and attention. I’ll make an appointment with the Sleep Diagnostics Center, and I’ll have my office call Medicare, just to be sure. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. Thank you again. Perhaps we can discuss the results in a few weeks?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could help. That’s exactly what we’ll do. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in about three weeks, once we have the results of your tests. My office will call you to schedule that. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as increased daytime sleepiness, difficulty breathing, or chest pain, please contact my office immediately. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good rest of your day, and I look forward to seeing you in a few weeks.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you, Doctor. Thank you for your time and expertise. I will be in touch.
