DOCTOR: Good morning, Lucia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, I keep… belching. A lot. It’s embarrassing, really. It just… happens. I don’t even know why it happens.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can certainly be disruptive and uncomfortable when something like that happens unexpectedly. Okay, so frequent belching is the primary concern. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it a recent development?
PATIENT: Um… not that long. Maybe… a month? Before that, it was normal, you know? Not a lot of belching. But now… after I eat, sometimes even when I’m not eating. It’s weird. I don’t think I’m sick, though. I feel okay, other than that.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month is relatively recent. And you feel otherwise healthy, that's good to know. To help me understand a little better, could you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a hard question. I try to eat… okay food. I like rice and beans, chicken… sometimes pork. And… fruit. Mango is my favorite. I drink… juice, mostly. And water. I don’t eat a lot of… vegetables. Is that bad? I don’t know what to tell you. I just eat what tastes good, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lucia. It’s helpful to have an idea. And when you say juice, what kind of juice are you usually drinking?
PATIENT: Mostly mango juice. Sometimes orange juice. I like the kind from the store… in the carton. Not… fresh squeezed. Does that matter? I don’t know anything about… food and belching. It just started, and I thought maybe… something I ate? But everything tastes okay.
DOCTOR: That’s good information. It could be related to what you’re eating, absolutely. Mango juice, in particular, can sometimes contribute to increased gas. Do you notice if the belching is worse after drinking the juice, or at any specific time of day?
PATIENT: Um… yes! I think… it is worse after the juice. And… maybe in the afternoon? After lunch. I eat lunch… usually rice and beans, and chicken. And sometimes… a little bit of juice. Maybe that’s why? I don’t know. I never thought about it before, really. Just… embarrassing belches.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be correlated with the mango juice and potentially after your lunch. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the belching, like bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No… no pain. Not really. Sometimes… maybe a little bit… full feeling after I eat. But not pain. And… no, everything is… normal, you know? Just the belching. And the… full feeling sometimes. It's not bad, just… uncomfortable. I don't feel sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, no nausea, and bowel habits are normal. Just belching and occasional fullness. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently – either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My weight is… the same. I think. I haven’t… weighed myself. But my clothes still fit. So, I think… no change. I like to eat! I don’t think I’ve lost any weight. I wish I had, maybe!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Before we move on, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything. No pills, nothing. I don’t like to take medicine if I don’t have to. Just… regular food. No vitamins, nothing like that. I try to stay healthy, but… I like my food too much, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. Do you have any allergies to foods or medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I eat lots of things. I’ve never… reacted to anything. My mom always said I had a strong stomach. Maybe that’s why I’m getting all these belches! She’d be laughing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It will just be a quick listen, nothing invasive. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. I don’t mind. As long as it’s not… too bad. I don’t like doctors too much, but… I want to stop the belching! So, whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lucia. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with this stethoscope. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll start here, on your right side. Try to breathe normally. Okay. Breathing deeply for me… and again. It sounds… normal, no unusual sounds. I'm going to gently press on your abdomen now, to check for any tenderness. Let me know if anything feels painful. Starting here… And here… any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That doesn’t hurt. Just… feels normal. I mean, I feel my tummy, you know? But no pain. It feels… okay. A little bit… pushy, but not painful. Like when you press on it. But no hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, no tenderness noted. Everything seems normal on physical examination. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it seems likely this is related to gas, possibly triggered by the mango juice and certain foods. It's not usually a cause for serious concern, but it can certainly be uncomfortable. I recommend trying a few things. First, see if reducing your intake of mango juice helps. Secondly, eating smaller, more frequent meals might assist. And finally, avoiding carbonated beverages or foods known to cause gas. We can also discuss over-the-counter remedies like simethicone or activated charcoal if these lifestyle changes aren't enough. Would you like to discuss those options?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Less juice, smaller meals… I can try that. I really don’t want to take pills if I don’t have to. But… what is… simethicone? And… activated charcoal? What do they do? Do they taste bad?
DOCTOR: Simethicone helps break up gas bubbles in your stomach and intestines, which can relieve bloating and discomfort. It doesn’t get absorbed into your body, so it doesn’t have a lot of side effects. It usually comes in tablet or liquid form, and it doesn't really taste bad, it's more like swallowing a small pill or a slightly sweet liquid. Activated charcoal is a bit different. It works by absorbing gas and toxins in your digestive system. It’s also available as a tablet or capsule. It can sometimes cause constipation or interfere with the absorption of other medications, so it's best to use it occasionally, not regularly. It can also turn your stool black, which can be a bit alarming, but it’s harmless. I’d recommend starting with simethicone if you’re feeling uncomfortable. It’s generally well-tolerated. We can discuss activated charcoal if simethicone doesn’t provide enough relief, but let’s try the simethicone first. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Simethicone sounds… better. No black poop, right? I don’t need that. So… where do I get this… simethicone? At the store? Like the pharmacy? And… how much do I take? I don’t want to take too much. I get nervous about pills, even if they’re just for gas.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Lucia. No black poop with simethicone. You can find simethicone over-the-counter at most pharmacies or drugstores, often in the digestive aid section. The dosage usually depends on the brand, but generally, adults take 250 to 500 milligrams after meals, as needed. It’s best to start with the lower dose and see how it works for you. The package will have specific instructions, so please read those carefully. It’s generally safe to take it up to four times a day. I’ll write down the name of a common brand – “Gas-X” – and the typical dosage for you. “Gas-X – 250mg after meals, up to four times a day.” Keep an eye on how you feel, and if your symptoms don’t improve after a week of trying simethicone and dietary changes, or if they get worse, please come back and see me. We can then discuss other possible causes or consider further investigation. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that’s everything. Thank you. You explained everything very well. No black poop… I appreciate that! I’ll try the simethicone and… less juice. Maybe less rice too? It makes me full. Thank you again, Doctor Chagaris. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lucia. I’m glad I could help. And yes, reducing your rice intake might also be helpful if it makes you feel full. Remember, small changes can often make a big difference. Please don’t hesitate to come back if you have any concerns or if your symptoms persist. Have a good day as well, Lucia, and I hope you feel better soon.
