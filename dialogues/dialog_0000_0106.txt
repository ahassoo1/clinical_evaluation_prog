DOCTOR: Alright, Louine Cannington, 89 years young. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. This sore… it just won’t heal. I’ve had it for… oh, goodness, it feels like forever now. It’s right here, on my heel. And it’s painful, you know? Really painful when I try to walk. It's a disgrace, frankly. A person my age shouldn't have to put up with this.
DOCTOR: Forever isn’t a very precise measurement, Louine. Can you give me a better idea?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t quiz me, dear. I remember details, not dates. Let me see… it was after my grandson, Kaimana, visited. He came all the way from Majuro, lovely boy, but tracking mud through the house… that was in… April, I believe. Yes, April. Right after his visit it started getting bad. It was just a little thing then, a tiny cut, but now… well, you see it. It’s dreadful. I keep it covered, of course, but it leaks through the bandage.
DOCTOR: April… alright. And this pain… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s pretty constant, truthfully. It’s worst in the mornings, when I first get out of bed. Feels like someone’s sticking needles in it, sharp little jabs. Then it dulls a bit throughout the day, but it’s always there, a throbbing ache. Makes me dread getting up, it does. Honestly, I used to be so active... now look at me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you noticed any redness, swelling, or pus draining from the sore?
PATIENT: Pus? Oh, dear, I wouldn't know what 'pus' looks like. It... leaks, yes. It’s yellowish, I suppose. And the skin around it is… not a nice color. Reddish, and sort of puffy. It's not a pretty sight, I assure you. I've been keeping it clean, with soap and water, but it doesn’t seem to help much. It’s just… stubbornly refusing to get better. I do worry it’s infected, but what does infected even mean, these days?
DOCTOR: Well, an infection, Louine, is when bacteria get into the wound and cause it to become inflamed and… problematic. It sounds like you could have an infection. Now, have you had a fever, chills, or any other symptoms alongside this sore?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not a fever. Though I do get a bit warm sometimes, but that's just my age, I expect. And chills… well, the air conditioning in here is quite strong. Makes me shiver a bit, but that’s hardly a symptom, is it? I just feel tired, really tired. More tired than usual, and this foot just… aches. And it smells, if I'm being honest. Not a pleasant odor at all. I don’t know what’s causing it all, but it’s making me miserable. It’s very… undignified.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no fever, chills related to the air conditioning, just fatigue and an odor. And you say this started after your grandson’s visit in April. Let’s take a look at this foot. Please, sit back on the examination table and remove your slipper. I need to get a proper assessment. Don't worry, I've seen worse. Much worse.
PATIENT: “Much worse,” I’m sure. Honestly. There. Be careful, now. It's rather sensitive. And try not to make a mess. I just had these stockings washed. This whole situation is just… a nuisance, really. A terrible nuisance. And I do hope you have some good cream. The last doctor just gave me something that didn't do a thing.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes. Alright, Louine. There’s significant erythema and edema around the heel. The wound itself appears to be ulcerated, with purulent drainage. I can also detect a foul odor, which, as you mentioned, isn’t a good sign. Palpation reveals warmth and tenderness to the touch. I'm concerned about a possible deep tissue infection, possibly osteomyelitis, given the chronicity of the wound. We need to rule that out. Now, do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: “Chronicity?” Are you suggesting I'm old? I may be 89, but I’m perfectly capable of understanding what's going on! And osteo… whatever that is… sounds dreadful. Antibiotics? Well, let me think… I had some penicillin as a child, I believe. Made me quite sick, tummy troubles mostly. And something else, years ago, but I can’t for the life of me recall what it was. Honestly, doctors keep prescribing me so many things, it’s all a blur. All I know is, I don’t want any more tummy troubles. Is there something else you can give me? Something… gentler? This all sounds very serious, and I'm not sure I can handle a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, penicillin allergy noted. And you're right, Louine, "fuss" is probably not what you need at this stage. However, given the potential for a deep infection, we can't simply ignore this. We need to determine the extent of the problem. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and inflammatory markers, to assess for signs of infection. We’ll also need to get a wound culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the problem. And, unfortunately, we will need an X-ray to rule out osteomyelitis. It's the only way to be certain. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work, cultures, X-rays… Honestly, it sounds like you’re trying to turn me into a science experiment! I’m a very old woman, Doctor Batara. I just want my foot to heal, not be poked and prodded and analyzed. But… if it's the only way to know what’s going on… I suppose I can tolerate it. But please, be gentle. And tell me plainly what all of this means. None of your medical jargon, understand? Just tell me if it's serious or not, and what we need to do to fix it. And if it involves any more tummy troubles, I’m walking out of here. Do you understand that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Louine, I understand perfectly. No jargon, gentle touch, and absolutely no tummy troubles, if I can help it. The blood work will tell us if your body is fighting an infection. The wound culture will identify the specific bacteria causing the problem, so we can choose the right antibiotic. The X-ray will show us if the infection has spread to the bone, which is what osteomyelitis means. If it has spread to the bone, it’s more serious and will require a longer course of antibiotics, potentially even hospitalization. If it hasn’t, we can likely treat it with oral antibiotics and wound care. We'll know more once we have the results. I’m going to send you to the lab for the blood work now. After that, we’ll schedule an X-ray. I’ll have my nurse, Kaimana, explain everything to you in detail before each test. And I will personally review the results with you when they come back, in plain English, I promise. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Kaimana, you say? Is he… your grandson? Small world. Well, if you’re promising plain English, and no tummy troubles… and Kaimana is involved… alright. I suppose I can go to the lab. But tell him to be careful with the needle. I bruise easily at my age. And make sure he doesn’t poke around too much. I need my blood, you know. Just… hurry up with these tests, if you can. I don't want to spend all day in a doctor’s office. And do tell Kaimana to explain everything very clearly. I don't appreciate being kept in the dark. Honestly, all this fuss over a sore foot. It’s simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Yes, Kaimana is my grandson. He’s very gentle, I assure you. And we will move as quickly as possible, Louine. I’ll have him meet you at the lab door. Kaimana! Please assist Louine Cannington to the lab for blood work. We'll get this sorted, Louine. Don't worry.
