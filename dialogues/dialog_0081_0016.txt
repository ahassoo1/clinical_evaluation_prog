DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s about my bruising, really. I've been on… well, the blood thinner, you know, since my wife passed. And lately, I’ve been bumping into things and ending up with these… unsightly marks. It’s becoming quite a nuisance, frankly. I didn't used to bruise like this.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you’re experiencing increased bruising despite being on a blood thinner. And you haven’t noticed this level of bruising previously, correct?
PATIENT: Correct. It's… unsettling. I’m a reasonably careful person, Doctor. Not clumsy, certainly. I used to be able to knock heads with the best of them, you know, back in my rugby days. But now? A little tap and… boom. Like an eggshell. It’s quite embarrassing, actually. I don’t want people thinking I’m falling apart.
DOCTOR: Rugby, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A lifetime ago, practically. Played prop. Good strong build back then. Still reasonably fit, I suppose, for my age. Though this bruising… it's making me wonder if something else is going on. I mean, a little bit of bruising I can understand, with the medication, but this is… excessive. I don’t even remember how I got half of them. Perhaps I’m just getting old. Though I resist that thought fiercely.
DOCTOR: Well, “getting old” rarely explains a sudden increase in bruising, Mr. Farson. It’s good you’re paying attention to this change. Let's try to narrow down what might be happening. First, can you tell me exactly which blood thinner you are taking, and what dosage?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question, Doctor. Honestly, I leave most of that to my… well, to the pharmacy. They handle the refills and everything. I think it’s… Warfarin? Yes, that sounds right. As for the dosage… Let me see. I usually just show them the bag. I don't memorize things like that anymore. It’s… five milligrams, maybe? Is that right? It's a small, white pill. I take one every evening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Warfarin 5mg daily. And you've been on this dosage consistently since… how long ago?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Since… since my wife, Maria, passed. It’ll be… almost two years now, I suppose. Maybe a little over. Everything gets a bit blurry, you know. She did all the remembering. I just… followed instructions. It's been a constant, I assure you. No changes. Unless… unless the pharmacy switched brands. Perhaps that’s it. Do different brands affect things?
DOCTOR: Different brands can sometimes cause variations, yes. It’s not uncommon. But we’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. No… no fever, no pain… not unusual pain, anyway. I get a bit of stiffness in the mornings, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing out of the ordinary, really. Oh! Wait. There is one thing. I’ve been… more tired lately. Just a general feeling of being run down. But I attributed that to the summer heat, frankly. It's been quite oppressive.
DOCTOR: Increased fatigue and unexplained bruising… alright. And you said no bleeding from anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No nosebleeds, no blood in the stool, nothing like that. My gums don’t bleed when I brush, either. No cuts that won’t stop bleeding. Just… the bruises. They seem to appear out of nowhere. Honestly, it's quite unsettling. I'm a practical man, Doctor, I like to know what's going on. Is it possible I’m not getting enough… vitamins? I've heard that can cause bruising.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re thinking about vitamins, Mr. Farson. We will certainly consider that. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll want to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at these bruises. Then we'll order some bloodwork to get a clearer picture of what's happening. Sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly acceptable. I appreciate you taking this seriously. It's good to have a doctor who listens. Please, proceed. I'm ready whenever you are. Though, if you don't mind, perhaps a chair? My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Nurse, could you please assist Mr. Farson to the examination table and help him sit comfortably?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Yes, a little assistance would be most welcome. It’s not pride, you understand, just… practicality. These old bones aren’t as forgiving as they once were. Lead the way, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 140/90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let me examine these bruises. These are… variable in size and color. Some appear quite recent, others are older. And there’s some bruising on your shins that doesn’t seem to correspond to any particular injury. No obvious signs of swelling or tenderness. All right. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'm going to order a complete blood count, a coagulation panel to check your Warfarin levels and kidney function, and a metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. I appreciate that. The kidney function test… is that to see if the medication is affecting things? I've heard things about blood thinners and the kidneys. Honestly, I worry about side effects. I don’t want to end up bedridden. But, yes, please, proceed with all the tests. The sooner we know something, the better. Though, perhaps you could explain what each test looks for? It helps to calm my nerves, you understand. A practical man likes to know the details.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The complete blood count, or CBC, will tell us about the different types of cells in your blood - red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Platelets are important for clotting, so we'll check those levels carefully. The coagulation panel checks how well your blood is clotting, and confirms your Warfarin levels are within the therapeutic range. It's important to make sure you're taking the right dosage. As for the metabolic panel, that checks your kidney and liver function, as well as electrolytes. Blood thinners can sometimes affect kidney function, which is why we'll check that. And finally, we'll look at your electrolytes because imbalances can also contribute to fatigue and bruising. Does that explanation make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s… remarkably clear. You explain things well. I appreciate your patience. So, essentially, you’re checking everything to make sure the medication isn’t going awry, and to rule out any other underlying problems. That makes perfect sense. So, how long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back for another appointment? Because, frankly, I’ve got a bit of a schedule, you understand. A man’s got things to do.
DOCTOR: The lab work should be completed within 24 to 48 hours. I will review the results as soon as they are available. I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in three business days to discuss them with you. That will give me adequate time to thoroughly analyze everything. Does that timeframe work for you, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Yes, three business days is acceptable. I suppose I can rearrange things. It’s just… inconvenient, you understand. But if it’s necessary, it’s necessary. So, I should just… continue taking the medication as usual until then? Unless you advise otherwise, of course. I wouldn’t want to risk a… complication.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Farson. Continue taking your Warfarin as prescribed until we discuss the results. Do not adjust your dosage on your own. If you experience any unusual bleeding – nosebleeds, blood in your stool, excessive bruising, or any other concerning symptoms – contact my office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Perfectly clear. Continue as prescribed, and report any unusual bleeding. I've made a note of that. I pride myself on being a responsible patient. Well, I believe that's everything for now, then. Thank you for your time, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease, at least a little. Though I still anticipate the results with… trepidation.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Farson. I understand your apprehension, but we’ll get to the bottom of this. Nurse will escort you to the front desk to schedule your follow-up appointment and provide any necessary paperwork. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and be careful.
