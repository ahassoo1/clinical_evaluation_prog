DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. I’m not usually one to complain, but this has been going on for a bit now, and I thought it best to get it looked at. It's a… a discharge. From… down there. It’s not pleasant, let me assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jinnie, no need to be embarrassed at all. That's what I'm here for. Many women experience this at some point, and it's good you're getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… watery, mostly. Not thick, thank goodness. And it's… yellowish. Though sometimes it looks a bit… greyish. Honestly, it comes and goes. Some days it's barely there, other days… well, other days I need to change more frequently. It doesn’t hurt, per se, but it’s… uncomfortable. And the smell. Oh, the smell is… not good. Not good at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, watery, yellowish to greyish, comes and goes, and has an odor. I understand. Has the odor changed recently, or has it been consistent?
PATIENT: Consistent, I’d say. Though… perhaps a little stronger lately. Not dramatically, but enough that I noticed it. I keep myself very clean, you understand. Always have. It’s just… this keeps happening despite everything. And it's frankly… concerning. I haven’t… well, I haven’t been with anyone in quite some time, so it’s not as though it’s anything new… if you understand my meaning.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. And it's good you've been mindful of hygiene. Since there hasn't been any recent sexual activity, that helps narrow things down. Have you experienced any itching, burning, or pain with urination?
PATIENT: No, no pain with urination. And not really itching, either. Though… sometimes it feels a little… irritated, down there. Not a sharp pain, just… a general soreness. Like I've been… rubbing against something rough, though I haven’t been. Really, it's just the discharge and the smell that are the main problems. It’s just… unladylike, Doctor. That’s what bothers me the most.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jinnie. Okay, so no pain with urination, minimal irritation, and the main issue is the discharge and odor. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Goodness, Doctor, are you asking about… that? I suppose not dramatically. I have… regularity, if you must know. Always have. A bit much fiber, perhaps, but nothing untoward. Is that… is that related to this, Doctor? I’m not quite understanding the connection.
DOCTOR: It’s just ruling things out, Jinnie. Sometimes changes in the bowel can be connected, though it's not common. Okay. And just to be thorough, have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Definitely no chills. And no abdominal pain. I'm a rather robust woman, generally. I eat well, I sleep well, I don't indulge. It's just… this. It feels… out of character, frankly. Like something is simply wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No fever, chills, or abdominal pain. I appreciate you giving me this information. It sounds like we need to do a quick examination to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An examination? Well… I suppose so. As long as it's… discreet. I do have a bit of a sensitive constitution, you understand. And I’d prefer you explain everything as you go, Doctor. I like to know exactly what’s happening, every step of the way.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jinnie. Absolutely. I'll explain everything as we go, and we’ll be as discreet as possible. I'll need you to lie on the examination table with your feet in the stirrups, just like a regular pelvic exam. First, I’ll visually inspect the area, then I’ll use a speculum to get a better look at the cervix. I’ll likely collect a sample to send to the lab to check for infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A speculum… Oh dear. I haven't had one of those in… well, a very long time. Is it… necessary, Doctor? Couldn't we just… look? I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea of something… inserted. Though, I suppose if it’s necessary… I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. And explain everything beforehand, as you promised.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. I understand your apprehension. A speculum allows me to get a much clearer view of the cervix, which is crucial for diagnosis. It’s a standard part of the exam, and I will be as gentle as possible. I'll walk you through each step. First, I’ll have you lie on your back with your feet in the stirrups. Then, I'll use a warmed speculum – it's made of plastic and is lubricated – to gently open the vaginal canal. It might feel a little pressure or discomfort, but it shouldn't be painful. I'll take a swab to collect a sample of the discharge. This sample will be sent to the lab to check for bacterial vaginosis, yeast infection, and sexually transmitted infections, just to be thorough. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Sexually transmitted infections? But… I haven't… as I said, I haven’t been with anyone. Are you suggesting…? That’s… rather insulting, Doctor. I assure you, I am a woman of virtue. And even if… well, it’s been years! It couldn’t possibly be that.
DOCTOR: Jinnie, please don't take offense. I apologize if I caused any upset. It’s standard protocol to rule everything out, even if the likelihood is low. It's simply due diligence. It’s not a judgment of you or your history, and I truly apologize if it came across that way. I assure you, it’s a routine part of the exam, and we can discuss the results and what they mean afterward. Would you still like to proceed with the examination?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. It’s just… upsetting to hear that suggested. But you're right, best to be thorough. But please, Doctor, be quick about it. And gentle, as you promised. I am not used to these… examinations. I haven't had one in decades.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, if you could just lie back and relax, we’ll get started. I'll let you know each step as I go. First, I'm just going to take a look at the external area.
PATIENT: Very well. It's rather cold, isn’t it? Are you sure this room is adequately heated, Doctor?
DOCTOR: You’re right, it’s a little chilly. My apologies, let me adjust the temperature. Alright, I’m just visually inspecting the area now. I see some slight redness, but no obvious signs of irritation or infection. Now, I’m going to gently insert the speculum. Just breathe deeply and try to relax your muscles. It might feel a little pressure.
PATIENT: Oh! That is cold! And… uncomfortable. Are you certain that’s adequately lubricated, Doctor? It’s… quite tight. Please, be careful.
DOCTOR: You're right to tell me, Jinnie. I apologize. It seems I need to add a bit more lubricant. There we go. Is that a little better?
PATIENT: A little. Though, it’s still… unsettling. I never understood why women put up with this. It feels… intrusive. Are you seeing anything? Anything at all? Please, tell me something to distract me. Tell me about… your garden. Do you have a garden, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do, Jinnie. I find it very relaxing. I mostly grow tomatoes and herbs. This year, the basil is doing particularly well. It seems the extra sunshine has helped. Okay, just getting a sample now. Almost done. I do see some yellowish discharge, as you described. It doesn't appear to be any obvious inflammation or lesions. Just a little bit of discharge. And I’m finished with the sample now. Just a moment while I remove the speculum.
PATIENT: Thank goodness. That’s over. And yes, the basil, you say? Is it the Genovese variety? My grandmother used to grow the best Genovese basil. She made a pesto… Never mind. So, what does it mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? Am I going to need… injections? Or pills? Please, don’t tell me it’s something I caught.
DOCTOR: Okay, all finished. You did very well, Jinnie. Now, we need to send the sample to the lab for analysis, which usually takes about two to three days. From what I can see visually, it doesn’t appear to be anything overly serious. It's most likely either bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection, both of which are easily treated with medication. It’s less likely to be a sexually transmitted infection, given your history, but we'll confirm that with the lab results. I’ll order the tests right away. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss treatment options. Most likely, it will be either a topical cream or oral medication. We'll know more once the results come back. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Topical cream… That sounds… manageable. Though, I do worry about side effects. And oral medication… oh dear. I haven’t taken pills in years. But, it’s good to know it’s likely nothing… serious. Would it be alright if I called your office in a few days to check on the results? And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything at all? Perhaps… avoid certain foods? Or… undergarments?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jinnie. You can absolutely call my office in a few days to check on the results. Just ask to speak with the nurse, and she can let you know if they’ve come back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding douching, as it can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina. Wear cotton underwear, as it’s more breathable. And avoid scented soaps and feminine hygiene products. Other than that, just continue with your normal routine. There are no specific dietary restrictions. I'll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once we have the results, so we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. No douching, cotton underwear, no scented soaps. I can manage that. My grandmother always said cotton was best. She knew everything, that woman. And a follow-up appointment… Very good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience, and your… thoroughness. Though, I still maintain this whole ordeal is rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jinnie. And you're right, it is unpleasant. But it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Alright, I'm finishing up my notes now. My nurse will be in to give you discharge instructions and schedule that follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions or concerns before I let you get dressed?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all, Doctor. Just… please make sure the nurse is very gentle. And that she explains everything clearly. I don't like surprises. Thank you again. And… please tell me your basil is thriving. It seems a very… rewarding plant.
DOCTOR: I will certainly make sure the nurse is gentle and explains everything clearly, Jinnie. And yes, my basil is thriving. It's incredibly rewarding – the smell is wonderful, and it's so fresh! It’s a small pleasure. Alright, I'll let you get dressed. The nurse will be right in. Take care, Jinnie. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Very well. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you. Hopefully, it's just the basil...
