DOCTOR: Well hello there, Kiante. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated. I’m hoping you can help.
DOCTOR: A letter for flying, alright. Yes, I can certainly look into that for you. It’s not uncommon. Sometimes airlines require a little documentation. Complicated how?
PATIENT: It’s just… after my husband passed, there were some complications with the insurance. Medicare was… slow to process things. And now, when I book a flight, they sometimes ask for extra verification. It’s mostly just peace of mind for them, I think, but it’s a hassle. I just want to avoid any trouble at the airport. It happened once already, and I really don't want a repeat of that.
DOCTOR: Oh dear, that sounds incredibly stressful, Kiante. Losing a husband is hard enough, without dealing with insurance complications on top of it. I completely understand wanting to avoid a repeat of that airport experience. It's good you're being proactive. To write the letter, I'll need to confirm a few things, if that's alright. Just a standard check-up, really. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. No, nothing major. Just… normal aches and pains for my age, I guess. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I try to stay active, walk a lot. No serious illnesses or anything requiring ongoing treatment. I had a check-up with my dentist last month, and everything was good there too.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Kiante. “Normal aches and pains” – perfectly normal! Staying active is wonderful. And a recent dentist visit is always a plus. Alright. Just to be thorough, and to help me write the most accurate letter, could you tell me a little bit about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: I don’t take anything regularly. Occasionally, if my back is really bothering me, I’ll take ibuprofen, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter stuff when I need it. I really try to avoid medication if possible.
DOCTOR: That’s sensible, Kiante. Avoiding medication when you can is always a good approach. Just occasional ibuprofen – good to know. And just one more quick question regarding allergies – are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, food or otherwise. It’s one of the few things I don’t have to worry about, thankfully. Is that all you need for the letter? I'm hoping it doesn’t need to be too detailed.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news, Kiante! No allergies is a definite plus. And no, it shouldn’t need to be overly detailed, thankfully. Just confirming your general good health and fitness to fly. Now, I'd like to do a very quick physical exam, just to be on the safe side. It’s standard practice. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and maybe just check your blood pressure. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I understand it’s standard. I just want to get this letter sorted as quickly as possible, really. It’s a trip to see my sister, and I don’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. Just a quick listen then. Please take a nice, deep breath for me… in and out. And again… Everything sounds clear and healthy, Kiante. Good strong heartbeat. And lungs are nice and clear. Now, let’s just take your blood pressure. Can you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Okay. No problem. It’s probably a bit high, if I’m honest. I get a little nervous at doctors, and I had a bit of a stressful morning getting here. The traffic was terrible. But usually it's fine.
DOCTOR: Yes, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. As you said, a little stressful morning and being at the doctor can certainly cause that. It's not drastically high, and given your history, I'm not overly concerned, but I will make a note of it in the letter just to be thorough. Everything else looks good, Kiante. Heart rate is normal, and you seem in good general health. Now, to write the letter, I just need your date of birth to verify your information. Could you tell me that, please?
PATIENT: Sure. It's April 12th, 1992. I’m turning 33 later this year. Hopefully, this is all the information you need. I really appreciate you fitting me in today, Doctor. It’s been a big weight off my mind just talking to you.
DOCTOR: April 12th, 1992. Thank you. And you’re very welcome, Kiante. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Alright, here is the letter confirming your fitness to fly. It mentions the slightly elevated blood pressure, and notes it was likely due to situational stress. It should be sufficient for the airline. Please keep a copy for your records. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Kiante?
PATIENT: Perfect, thank you so much! That looks great, exactly what I needed. No, I think that's everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor Renzi. I really appreciate your time and patience. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I’m glad I could assist you. Have a safe and wonderful trip to see your sister! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Take care now.
