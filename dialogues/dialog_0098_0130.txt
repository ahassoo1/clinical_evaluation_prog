DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well… family. Lots of family got… bad things. I want to make sure I don’t get them, you know? My mother… she had problems with her heart. And my brother… cancer. I just want to be sure I’m okay.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart problems and cancer. We can definitely do some things to assess your risk and make sure you're as healthy as can be. To start, could you tell me a little more about your mother's heart problems?
PATIENT: She… she got tired easy. Real easy. And her legs… they would swell up. She went to the hospital lots of times. The doctors… they said something about her heart not working strong enough. It was a long time ago. I don't remember all the words they used. She passed away when I was… maybe twenty? Twenty-one? Something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a starting point. Swelling in the legs and fatigue are common signs of heart failure, as you may have heard. And it sounds like she was indeed diagnosed with some form of heart condition. And your brother's cancer… do you know what type it was, or where it was located?
PATIENT: Hmm… cancer. He… he smoked a lot. Always smoked. It was in his… lungs, I think. Maybe throat too? I don't know for sure. He didn’t talk about it much. It happened pretty quick. Real quick. He went to the doctor, and then… not long after, he was gone. Sorry. It’s sad to think about.
DOCTOR: It is sad, Mr. Schwer. And it’s perfectly understandable that you don’t remember all the details. Those are difficult things to go through, and it's common to focus on the emotional impact rather than the specifics. Okay, so we have a family history of heart problems and lung cancer, with a smoking history contributing to your brother’s case. Now, let’s talk about you. Do you have any current symptoms that you're experiencing?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel okay. Tired sometimes, but… I'm old, you know? Seventy-three. I get tired. Nothing special. No pain, no swelling… like my mother. I eat okay, I guess. Not fancy food. Just… normal. I walk a little bit, not much. I used to work hard, selling things, but now… I mostly just sit.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. No current pain or swelling is a positive sign. And it's common to experience fatigue at your age. We’ll want to investigate further just to be sure, though. Now, have you ever smoked, or been exposed to a lot of secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked. My wife… she didn’t like it. She made sure I didn’t. And she didn’t smoke either. Always said it was bad for you. Good woman. She… she passed away a few years ago. But no, no smoking for me. Never.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Avoiding smoking is one of the best things you can do for your health. And it sounds like you had a very supportive wife. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other health conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor said something about it a long time ago. I took pills for a while. I don’t remember what they were called. Then I switched doctors and… I don’t know. I think he said I didn’t need them anymore. Everything else… no, not really. I had the flu a couple of times, but that’s it. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible history of high blood pressure that may have been treated and then discontinued. That’s good information. We’ll want to check your current blood pressure today. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. That’s it, I think. No other surgeries. No other hospitals. Just the broken arm. A long time ago. They put it in a cast. It healed okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my… knees. They hurt sometimes. The doctor gave it to me. It's white and small. I think it’s for arthritis. And sometimes I take something for… gas. You know, when my stomach hurts. But that's not every day. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a medication for your knees, likely for arthritis, and something for gas as needed. Do you know the names of either of those medications?
PATIENT: No. I don’t remember. I just ask the pharmacist for them. She knows what I need. I don't bother with the names. Old man, you know? Too much to remember. I just tell her what hurts.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Schwer. We can often look up the medications based on what they’re for. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. Never had a problem. I eat most things. I don’t eat spicy food, but that's just because I don’t like it, not because I'm allergic. And no… no allergies to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s fine. Go ahead. I don’t mind. I trust you, Doctor. Just… don’t poke too hard. My knees are sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be very gentle. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today – 142 over 88. It’s not alarmingly high, but it is something we’ll want to monitor. I’m listening to your heart now. I hear a regular rhythm, but there’s a slight murmur. It's not necessarily cause for concern, but we should keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear and open, which is good. And your knees do have some swelling and tenderness, as you mentioned. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Ouch. It hurts a little. Not too bad, but… it’s not as easy as it used to be. And they make a little… cracking sound. Old man problems, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear that crepitus. That's fairly common with arthritis, and it sounds like you do have some limited range of motion. I'm not going to push it too much. Okay, that completes the physical exam for now. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you likely have some degree of osteoarthritis in your knees, and your blood pressure is a bit elevated. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work. It will help us check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function, and we can also check for inflammation. I also recommend an X-ray of your knees to see how much cartilage you have left. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work and… X-ray? Okay. If you think it’s necessary. I trust you, Doctor. It’s just… I don’t like needles. And X-rays… I worry about radiation. But if it helps… yes. Do what you think is best. Just… try to be quick with the needle.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the needle and radiation. We use the lowest possible dose of radiation for the X-ray, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. And I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is very gentle with the blood draw. Okay, I’ll write the orders for the blood work and X-ray now. You can go to the lab downstairs, and they’ll take care of you. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your knee medication as needed, and try to stay as active as you can without overdoing it. Gentle exercise, like walking or swimming, can help keep your joints mobile. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything pretty well. Blood work and X-ray… then come back and talk. That sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I feel a little better knowing someone is looking into this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. That’s what I’m here for. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
