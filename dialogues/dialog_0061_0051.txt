DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Darl. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Lovely clinic you have here. Let me see… well, my son, he said I should come get my… what was it now? Oh, my blood type! Yes, that’s right. He says it’s good to know, just in case. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Right, your blood type. That’s a very sensible thing for your son to suggest, Darl. It’s always good to be prepared. Let me just pull up your chart here… Okay, Darl Nini, born… Hmm. It doesn't look like we have your blood type on file currently. No problem at all, we can get that done today. Before we do that, though, is there anything else bringing you in?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I wouldn’t know about charts. Everything feels so…new these days. No, no, just the blood type, I think. My son, bless him, he worries so. He's a good boy. I just want to get it done and then I can tell him I did what he asked. Is it a long process? I don’t have much patience for… poking and prodding, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Darl. It's a very quick process, just a small blood draw. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. We'll just need to get a little sample, and then the lab will analyze it. It’s pretty standard stuff. Before we do that, though, just to make sure I have a good overall picture, could you tell me about any health conditions you have?
PATIENT: Health conditions… Oh dear. Well, I’m 79, you know? Things ache a bit here and there. My knees aren't what they used to be, and I get tired easily. And I had a bit of a scare with my heart a long time ago, but they fixed it. It was… decades ago, now. I don’t remember much about it, to be honest. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, I think. But mostly, I just try to take things easy. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. So, knees bothering you, fatigue, and a history of a heart issue that was treated decades ago, and you take something for your blood pressure. Do you remember the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Names… they all blur together, you see? It’s a little white pill, I think. Small. I've been taking it for… a long time, now. Maybe my son knows? He handles a lot of that sort of thing. I just… take it with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Darl, we can certainly ask your son. It's common for medications to become a bit of a routine without remembering the specifics. And just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder out. A long, long time ago. And… I think I had a little something done on my eye when I was younger, but I don’t recall the details. It didn’t hurt much, thankfully. That’s all I can think of right now, dear. My mind is a bit foggy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a procedure on your eye. And you said your son helps manage your medications?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. He’s a very responsible boy, my son. Always looking after me. He brings me my pills, makes sure I eat properly… I don’t know what I’d do without him. He lives nearby, which is a blessing. He’ll probably be calling later to see how it went. He worries so much!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you have such a supportive son, Darl. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can get that blood draw done. Have you ever had any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything over the years, you see? I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle with certain flowers, but nothing serious. I can't recall ever having a bad allergy though.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good to know. And finally, do you smoke or drink alcohol, Darl?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol in… well, decades, dear. Not since my husband passed. It just didn’t seem right, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking or alcohol. Okay, Darl, that gives me a good overview. So, to recap: you’re 79 years old, no known allergies, no smoking or alcohol, history of heart issue treated decades ago, gallbladder removal, procedure on the eye, take a small white pill for blood pressure, and your son helps manage your medications. You're here today to get your blood type checked. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that sounds perfectly right. You’ve a good memory, you do! Everything feels a bit…scattered in my head these days. It’s good to know someone is keeping track. Yes, the blood type… let’s get that done, shall we? The sooner it’s finished, the sooner I can tell my son.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Alright, let's go ahead and do that blood draw. We'll just step into this other room, and the nurse will take care of you. It won't take long at all. I’ll be right here when you're finished, and then we can discuss the results once the lab has them. Do you have any questions before we head over?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, I don't think so. Just… will it hurt much? I don’t like needles, you see. Always been a bit squeamish. But if you say it won't take long, I trust you, dear. Let’s get it over with, shall we? The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Darl. The nurse is very gentle, and it’s usually a very quick pinch. Let's head back here, and she'll get you all set up. I’ll be right outside if you need anything. She'll explain everything as she goes. Don't worry, you're in good hands.
PATIENT: Okay, dear. Thank you. I do appreciate your kindness. It's reassuring to have someone so patient. I'm ready when you are… I suppose.
DOCTOR: You've got this, Darl. I'll be just outside if you need me. Take a deep breath, and the nurse will take excellent care of you. And remember, we are just getting a little bit of information to keep you healthy.
