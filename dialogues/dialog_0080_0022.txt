DOCTOR: Hi Soila, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat so much anymore. Not like I used to. It’s just… strange. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A little bit at a time, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, “tummy feels big” and a decreased appetite… that's a good place to start. When you say it feels big, can you describe that feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… like it’s full of water, maybe? Not painful, just… heavy. And tight. Like a balloon, but not… hurting. It’s hard to explain. I’ve always been small, you know? Not much to me. Now it’s… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, “full of water,” “heavy,” and “tight” – and you’ve noticed a change from your usual size. That’s helpful. And no pain, which is good. About how long would you say this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a hard one. A while, I think. Maybe… a few weeks? A month? It all blurs together after a time, you know? I used to keep track of things… but not anymore. I just… wake up and the days are here. I don’t really feel like it’s been very long, but it could be. Everything feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be hard to keep track. “A few weeks to a month” is a good estimate. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not that I recall. I haven’t been traveling. I still read, when I can… and I see my friend, Irina, sometimes. She brings me cookies, but I haven’t been eating many lately. Not with my tummy feeling like this. Oh! And the television man came and fixed the picture! That was nice. But… everything else feels the same. Regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no recent travel, consistent with your usual activities, and the TV was fixed. That’s good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Bathroom habits? Oh… you mean… going to the toilet? Well… it's been… regular. I haven’t had any trouble, not really. Just… the usual. Sometimes a little bit more, maybe? But nothing to worry about, I don’t think. It's all… a little bit blurry, you see? It's hard to remember specifics.
DOCTOR: Okay, “regular” with maybe a little bit more frequently. That's good information. Now, have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Nausea? Oh, no, not really. I haven’t thrown up. And… stool? You mean… what comes out? I haven't noticed anything… different about it. Just… normal. Sorry, Doctor. I’m not very good at… explaining these things. It’s been so long since anyone asked me about… that.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly fine, Soila. It's perfectly normal to not be used to talking about these things. Let's switch gears a bit. Any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh… well, Irina said I look a little thinner. She worries about me, you see. I haven't weighed myself, though. Not for a long time. I used to, when I was younger… but I don’t really bother anymore. I just… feel a little weaker, maybe? But that could be the age, you know? It’s hard to tell. I haven't been eating much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Irina noticed some weight loss and you've noticed feeling a bit weaker, and you haven't been eating as much. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'd like to listen to your tummy and feel it gently, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That's alright. Go ahead. I trust you. I haven't felt so good lately, so if you think it will help… please do. Just be gentle, please. My bones are old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. Your abdomen is slightly distended, and there's a little tenderness when I press down here , but nothing too concerning. Your bowel sounds are a little quieter than usual. I'm also going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 108/68. Pulse is 72 and regular. Lungs sound clear. I'm going to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. We'll check a complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, and a thyroid panel. I'd also like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, just to get a good look at everything. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my… that’s a lot. Blood work… and a… what did you call it? A scan? Is something very wrong, Doctor? I just want to feel better. Will these tests tell you what's happening? I don't mind having them done, if it will help… but I do get scared easily. I'm an old woman, you see. And I don't have much money. Will it cost a lot?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila, and it sounds like a lot, but it's just to be thorough. We want to rule out anything serious and find out what's causing your discomfort. The tests will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. As for cost, I will have the billing department contact you regarding potential costs and if there are any programs to help with financial assistance. I will also make sure we order only the necessary tests at this time. The most likely possibilities, based on what you've told me, are something relatively minor like constipation or a mild infection. But it's important to rule out anything more serious. We'll start with the blood work. The CT scan is more expensive, but will give us a much more detailed view. We can discuss whether to proceed with that after we get the blood results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a relief to hear it might not be anything too bad. And you’ll help me with the money? That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Yes, let’s do the blood work. And… we’ll see about the scan later. If it’s necessary, then… we’ll do it. I trust you. When do I have to go to have the blood taken? And will it hurt very much? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll start with the blood work. It will be done right here in the clinic, so you don't have to go anywhere else. As for the needles, I know they can be unpleasant. The phlebotomist here is very experienced and gentle. It's a quick pinch, and it will be over before you know it. We can also use a smaller needle if that helps. I'll write you a lab order now, and the nurse will come in and draw your blood shortly. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes. After that, you can rest for a bit and then you’re free to go. We should have the results back in a few days. I’ll call you as soon as they come in to discuss them and decide on the next steps. Does that sound alright, Soila?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Ten minutes, you say? I can do ten minutes. And you’ll call me? That’s good. I sometimes forget things, you see. Thank you, Doctor. You're very patient with an old woman. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. It's my job. And don’t worry about forgetting, that happens to all of us. I’ll make sure to call you directly. Here’s the order. The nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to get you set up. She'll explain everything to you. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit. Just… please don't let it be anything too bad. I just want to feel like myself again. I'm so tired of feeling… fuzzy. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Soila. We’ll do everything we can to find out what’s going on and get you feeling like yourself again. Try not to worry too much until we have the results. Maria will be in shortly. If anything changes or you start feeling worse, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I’ll be in touch soon. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
