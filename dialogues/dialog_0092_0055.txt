DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Giganti, it’s about time, isn’t it? Frankly, I’ve been meaning to address this for some time. It’s regarding… a medical marijuana certification. My daughter suggested I look into it. She’s very… modern, you see. I’m not entirely convinced it’s necessary, but one must explore all avenues, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ellan. A medical marijuana certification. Certainly, we can discuss that. It's good you’re exploring all options. To determine if it's appropriate for you, I'll need to gather some information. First, could you tell me a bit more about why your daughter suggested it?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. She says it’s for my… “discomfort.” She means my aches and pains. A woman of my age, Doctor, one expects a little discomfort. It’s simply… life. But she insists it will help me “relax” and “sleep better.” Honestly, the coddling. But she’s very insistent, and her husband seems to agree. They read things online, you know. Always reading things online. I haven’t actually felt the need for anything, but… I suppose it can’t hurt to be examined.
DOCTOR: I see. So, aches and pains, difficulty sleeping… and your daughter and her husband are encouraging you to explore this as a potential solution. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about these aches and pains?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly in my joints, Doctor. My knees, primarily. And my back. One doesn't simply live for seventy-four years without some wear and tear, you understand. It’s not a crippling pain, mind you. It’s just… there. A dull ache, mostly. Worse in the mornings, naturally. And after I’ve been on my feet for too long. I do a lot of… supervising, you see. One must maintain standards. It requires a great deal of walking. And standing. And occasionally, lifting. Though I have people for that now, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily knee and back pain, worse in the mornings and with activity. And it sounds like it impacts your ability to do some of the things you enjoy – the supervising, the walking. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain on a typical day?
PATIENT: Hmm. A typical day… well, it fluctuates, of course. It’s rarely a ten, Doctor. I’m not one to exaggerate. But it’s certainly not a zero. Perhaps… a three? On a good day. A four, maybe, if I’ve been particularly busy. It’s… manageable. I simply wish it wasn’t there at all. It’s the principle of the thing, you understand.
DOCTOR: A three or four on a typical day, manageable but present. That gives me a better understanding. Now, besides the aches and pains, you mentioned difficulty sleeping. Could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it's nothing dramatic, Doctor. I don't lie awake all night. It’s more… restlessness. I find myself… tossing and turning. And waking up several times. It's not that I can't fall asleep, it's staying asleep. And then, of course, there’s the worry. One always worries, doesn’t one? About everything. But I suspect the discomfort contributes to it. It’s a vicious cycle, really. A rather annoying one, I must say.
DOCTOR: Restlessness, waking up multiple times during the night… and you suspect the discomfort plays a role. It certainly sounds like a cycle. Before we move on, let’s talk about any other medical conditions you might have. Have you been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I assure you, I’ve been quite meticulous about my health over the years. I’ve always taken excellent care of myself. However… I do have a touch of hypertension. It’s well-controlled with medication, thankfully. And I had a rather unpleasant bout of shingles a few years ago. But that has cleared up completely. Other than that… nothing of any significant consequence. I’ve been quite fortunate, really.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, well-controlled with medication, and a history of shingles that has resolved. That’s good to know. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s… Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once daily. My physician, Dr. Alvarez, prescribed it. A perfectly competent doctor, though a bit… young, if you ask me. He insists on discussing everything online. Honestly, it’s quite impersonal. But he keeps my numbers in check, so I suppose I shouldn’t complain.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril ten milligrams daily. Thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. No, I don't believe so. I’ve never had any significant allergic reactions. Perhaps a slight itch sometimes when I eat shellfish, but nothing I’d consider a true allergy. I’ve always been rather careful about what I consume. One doesn’t simply eat everything one is offered, you understand. It’s a matter of principle. And good taste, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible sensitivity to shellfish. Now, before we move on to your family history, let me ask about past surgeries. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… yes, actually. Quite a few, when you think about it. I had my tonsils removed as a child, of course. That was standard practice back then. And I had a hysterectomy in my early thirties. Perfectly routine, thankfully. And… ah, yes. I had a knee replacement about fifteen years ago. On this knee, actually. It was quite painful for a while, but it’s improved considerably. Though, as you can see, it still gives me some trouble. It's… temperamental.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, hysterectomy, and a knee replacement fifteen years ago. Thank you. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Where to begin? My mother… she suffered terribly from arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis, I believe. It crippled her hands quite badly. And my father… he had heart problems. Congestive heart failure, I think it was. He passed away quite young, actually. And my brother… he had diabetes. Type 2, I believe. And… oh, yes. My aunt… she had a touch of Alzheimer’s. It was quite distressing. As you can see, we have a rather… unfortunate family history, generally speaking. Not much good health to go around, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand. History of rheumatoid arthritis in your mother, congestive heart failure in your father, Type 2 diabetes in your brother, and Alzheimer's in your aunt. That is quite a bit to consider. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: My social history? Really, Doctor? I hardly think my social engagements are relevant to my aches and pains. However… I suppose one must answer these questions. I’ve been married for forty-seven years, to a perfectly respectable man. He’s retired now, thankfully. We have two grown children, both happily married with children of their own. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion. And I do enjoy a good game of bridge. Otherwise… I lead a rather quiet life. It suits me perfectly, I assure you. I prefer the company of good books and sensible conversation. Not much call for wild adventures at my age, you understand.
DOCTOR: Married forty-seven years, two grown children, no smoking, occasional alcohol, enjoys bridge and reading. That provides a good understanding. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your current symptoms. You mentioned aches and pains, and difficulty sleeping. Are there any other symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes I feel a bit… foggy. A little unclear. It's not constant, mind you. It's more like a mild… absentmindedness. I occasionally misplace things. My keys, mostly. Or my glasses. It's rather annoying, but I attribute it to my age. And… I suppose my appetite isn’t quite what it used to be. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, never have. But I find myself eating less overall. I’m not losing weight, thankfully. But I’m certainly not gaining any, either. It’s just… a general lack of enthusiasm for food, I suppose. And occasionally, I feel a little… irritable. But who doesn't, from time to time?
DOCTOR: Foggy feeling, occasional absentmindedness, decreased appetite, and some irritability. Thank you for sharing that. Now, to get a clearer picture, let’s do a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose it’s unavoidable, isn’t it? One must endure these things. Very well, Doctor. But please be gentle. My bones are rather… delicate. And I do have a rather low tolerance for discomfort. Proceed, but with caution, if you please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138 over 76. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Balance is stable, coordination is intact. Knees have a limited range of motion, with some crepitus noted on movement. Mild tenderness to palpation on the medial aspect of both knees, no significant swelling. Alright, Ellan. Everything appears generally within normal limits, though your knees do have some limited range of motion and tenderness.
PATIENT: Well, that’s hardly surprising, Doctor. As I’ve already explained, my knees are rather… temperamental. It's always the knees, isn't it? The very thought of them giving out… it’s quite unsettling. And the crepitus… oh, yes. I’m quite aware of the crepitus. It’s a rather… grating sound, actually. So, what does all this mean, Doctor? Are you going to prescribe me something? Or are we simply going to sit here and discuss my knees indefinitely?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ellan. The crepitus and limited range of motion are consistent with osteoarthritis, which is common with age. The physical exam findings, combined with your symptoms – the aches and pains, difficulty sleeping, foggy feeling, and decreased appetite – suggest a few possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a Vitamin D level. These tests will help rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. We can also order X-rays of your knees to assess the extent of the osteoarthritis. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. More tests. It seems I’m constantly being poked and prodded. Very well, Doctor. If you insist. I suppose it’s better to be thorough. But please, let’s not draw too much blood. I have a rather low tolerance for needles, you understand. And please, expedite the process. I don’t want to spend the entire day in a waiting room. Very well, proceed with your tests. But I expect a prompt and accurate diagnosis. And then, perhaps, we can finally discuss a solution to my… predicament.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. We'll take only the necessary amount of blood, and I’ll ensure the process is as quick and comfortable as possible. I’ll expedite the orders, and we should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, to address your symptoms while we await the results, I recommend continuing with a healthy diet and regular, gentle exercise, such as walking or swimming, if you’re able. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can also help manage the pain. Before we finish, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Well… yes, actually. About this… medical marijuana. Is it truly effective for someone of my age? I've read so many conflicting articles. And what form would it take? I certainly don’t want to be… smoking anything. And will it interfere with my medication? I’m quite diligent about taking my Lisinopril, you see. And finally… is it legal? I wouldn’t want to get into any trouble with the authorities. These are rather important considerations, Doctor. I do hope you can provide me with some reassurance.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ellan. Let’s address them one by one. Medical marijuana can be effective for managing chronic pain, improving sleep, and stimulating appetite, particularly in older adults. However, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution, and the effectiveness varies from person to person. Regarding the form, you absolutely do not need to smoke it. There are many other options available, such as tinctures – liquid extracts taken under the tongue – capsules, edibles, and topical creams. We would start with the lowest possible dose and gradually increase it as needed, always monitoring for side effects. Regarding your Lisinopril, there is a potential for interaction with certain forms of marijuana, specifically CBD. We would need to carefully consider the dosage and potential risks. I would coordinate with your primary care physician, Dr. Alvarez, to ensure your medication regimen remains safe and effective. And finally, regarding legality, medical marijuana is legal in this state with a valid certification. We would ensure all necessary paperwork is completed correctly to avoid any issues. However, I want to emphasize that medical marijuana is not a substitute for conventional medical care. It’s an adjunct therapy that may provide relief from your symptoms. It's also crucial to understand the potential side effects, which can include dizziness, drowsiness, and changes in appetite. Given your history of hypertension and your current medication, I believe a trial of medical marijuana could be considered, but only after we have the results of your blood work and after careful discussion with Dr. Alvarez. Would you like me to prepare the necessary paperwork for the certification process?
PATIENT: Well… it’s all rather complicated, isn't it? So many potential risks and side effects. And coordinating with Dr. Alvarez… honestly, the paperwork alone will be a nightmare. But… if it could alleviate my discomfort, even slightly… perhaps it’s worth a try. Very well, Doctor. Prepare the paperwork, but please, keep it as simple as possible. And ensure Dr. Alvarez is fully informed. I don’t want any surprises. And I insist on starting with the lowest possible dose. I don’t want to feel… altered, or anything of the sort. Just a little relief from my aches and pains, that’s all. And finally… what are the costs involved? I wouldn’t want to be taken advantage of. I’ve always been very careful with my finances. Yes, prepare the paperwork, but with all due caution, and please, provide me with a clear and concise breakdown of all associated costs. And keep me informed every step of the way. I do hope this doesn’t turn into a complete and utter ordeal.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. I understand your concerns, and I’ll ensure the process is as smooth and transparent as possible. I will prepare the necessary paperwork, keeping it as simple as I can. I’ll also contact Dr. Alvarez to discuss your medical history and medication regimen. The cost of the certification process varies depending on the dispensary, but it typically includes a consultation fee, a medical evaluation fee, and the cost of the certification itself. I’ll provide you with a detailed breakdown of the costs upfront, so there are no surprises. The cost of the marijuana itself will depend on the form and dosage you choose. I’ll also be happy to answer any questions you have along the way. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss your symptoms and the results of your blood work. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything for now. You’ve been… remarkably thorough, I must admit. And patient, despite my… persistent questioning. I do hope this proves to be a worthwhile endeavor. And I do hope it doesn’t turn into a complete and utter mess. Very well. Proceed with your preparations. And please, keep me informed every step of the way. I do appreciate your assistance. I believe that will be all for today. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ellan. I’m glad I could assist you. I'll be in touch soon to discuss the next steps. Don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, Ellan.
