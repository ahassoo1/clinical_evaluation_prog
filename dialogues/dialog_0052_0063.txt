DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. Nice to meet you too. Um… my back. It’s been really bad. Real bad pain. It’s… well, it’s the cancer, I think. It’s where the cancer is. It just hurts so much now.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’re experiencing significant back pain, and you believe it may be related to a previous cancer diagnosis. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about your cancer history?
PATIENT: Okay. It was… lung cancer. They found it, oh, maybe five years ago? I had… chemo, and then radiation. It went into… what they call remission. For a while. But… a few months back, it started hurting again. Not so much in my chest, but… in my back. Lower back. And now… it just keeps getting worse. I don’t know… is it back? Is the cancer back? It just feels different than before.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Meigs. It’s helpful to know the timeline and the location of the pain. You mentioned it feels different this time around – could you describe those differences for me?
PATIENT: Well… before, with the chemo, it was more… a cough. And tired. Really, really tired. This… it’s just pain. A sharp pain. Like someone is stabbing me. And it goes down my leg sometimes. Not all the time, but… yeah. And it’s hard to… to sit for long. Or stand. Everything makes it hurt. It’s… constant. Not going away. Before, the tiredness would come and go, but this… this doesn't stop.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful. So, the previous cancer symptoms were primarily cough and fatigue, while now it’s predominantly a sharp, constant pain radiating down your leg, making it difficult to sit or stand for extended periods. I want to get a clearer picture of the pain itself. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… right now? It’s… maybe an eight. Yeah, an eight. It’s just… there. Even when I try to be still, it’s still hurting. Sometimes it feels like… like a fire. A burning fire in my back. And then the sharp stabbing pain comes on top of that. It makes me… dizzy sometimes. It’s just… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. An eight out of ten with burning and stabbing sensations, accompanied by occasional dizziness. That sounds incredibly difficult to manage, Ms. Meigs. To help me determine the cause of your pain, I'd like to ask a few more questions, and then I’ll need to perform a physical examination. First, could you tell me if anything specifically makes the pain worse?
PATIENT: Um… bending over. Definitely bending over. And… twisting. Like, trying to look behind me. Or… lifting anything. Even just a grocery bag. But honestly, even sometimes just… moving. Like, getting out of a chair. It’s just… a lot of things make it worse. Sitting for too long doesn’t help. Standing for too long doesn’t help. I feel like I can't win.
DOCTOR: It sounds like many everyday movements aggravate the pain, which is understandably frustrating. And you're right to feel that way. Now, is there anything that provides any relief, even temporary?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes, when I lie down flat on my back, it feels a little bit better. Not gone, but… not as sharp. And… sometimes I take… Tylenol. But it doesn't really do much anymore. I used to take it and it would help, but now… not so much. Maybe takes the edge off for a little while, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat on your back provides some relief, and Tylenol used to help but is now less effective. Thank you. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about other areas of your body. Have you experienced any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Sometimes. My legs feel… heavy. Like they're just… tired all the time. And my feet… sometimes they feel numb. Not all the time, but when I walk for a long time, they start to feel… tingly. And numb. It’s… hard to explain. Like they're not really mine.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. So, you've noticed heaviness in your legs and tingling/numbness in your feet, particularly with walking. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel or bladder function – any difficulty urinating, changes in frequency, or any incontinence?
PATIENT: Oh… um… No. Not really. Everything… works normal, I think. Maybe… I have to go to the bathroom a little more often, but that could just be… the water I drink. Or… I don’t know. Nothing… bad. Just… normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant changes in bowel or bladder function. Thank you, Ms. Meigs. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, I want to ask about your past medical history. Aside from the lung cancer, have you had any other serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That’s about it. And… high blood pressure. The doctor gave me pills for that. I take those every day. Other than that… no. Nothing else. I’ve been pretty healthy, until the cancer.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, appendectomy as a child and currently managed high blood pressure. And you take medication for the high blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes. Every day. One pill. In the morning. It helps. I think.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. This will involve checking your reflexes, strength, sensation, and range of motion, as well as some palpation of your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on. And if there’s something… something that can help.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie down on your back on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then we’ll move on to assessing your back. I’ll explain everything as I go, so you know what I'm doing. Let's start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles auscultated. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Reflexes… okay.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. That’s within the normal range. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It hurts a little…
DOCTOR: Grip strength is 4+/5 bilaterally. Some discomfort reported with the assessment, likely related to the back pain. Now, I’m going to test your sensation. I’m going to gently touch different parts of your legs with this cotton swab. Please tell me when you feel the touch. Sensation is intact to light touch bilaterally in the lower extremities. Now, I'm going to feel along your back. Please let me know if anything is particularly tender. Tenderness to palpation noted along the lumbar spine, particularly at L4-L5. Moderate muscle spasm present bilaterally. No step-off deformity palpated. I've completed the physical examination. Based on your history and examination findings, your pain appears to be localized to the lumbar spine, with tenderness and muscle spasm. The weakness and numbness in your legs are concerning, and the possibility of recurrence or metastasis needs to be investigated.
PATIENT: Okay. That… that sounds bad. Recurrence? What does that mean? Is it… is the cancer back?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re worried, Ms. Meigs. “Recurrence” means that the cancer has come back after a period of remission. And the numbness and weakness in your legs, combined with the significant pain, certainly warrant further investigation to determine the cause. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean the cancer has returned. There are other possibilities that we need to rule out, such as nerve compression, a herniated disc, or other spinal issues. To get a clearer picture, I recommend we order some imaging studies. An MRI of the lumbar spine would be the most helpful to visualize the spinal cord, nerves, and surrounding tissues. We’ll also order some blood work to check for any signs of cancer recurrence. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: MRI… blood work… yes. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. And if there’s something… something to help the pain. It’s just… so much pain.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Meigs. And we will do everything we can to get you some relief. For the pain, I can prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a stronger pain medication to help manage it while we wait for the imaging results. I will also recommend physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles and improve your posture, which may help alleviate some of the pain. Would you like me to go ahead and write those prescriptions for you?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. The prescriptions… and the physical therapy. Anything to help.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve written a prescription for cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant, and oxycodone for pain relief. Please take them as directed, and be aware of the potential side effects, which I'll explain to you in a moment. I’ve also sent a referral to a physical therapist in the area. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ve also scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results of the MRI and blood work. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly or you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, weakness in your legs, or bowel or bladder dysfunction, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Shely. You’ve been very helpful. I just hope… I hope it’s not the cancer back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I understand your concerns, and we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Remember, we’re taking things one step at a time. We'll get the imaging results, assess the findings, and develop a plan based on those results. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I wish you all the best, and I'll see you in two weeks. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor.
