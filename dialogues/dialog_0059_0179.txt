DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in… yes. Well, it’s… the words. They don’t come so easy now. I have… difficulty finding words, yes. It is… frustrating. I apologize if I speak slowly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gyamfi. It sounds concerning that you’re experiencing difficulty finding the right words. That is frustrating, and you shouldn't apologize at all for speaking at your own pace. We’ll take our time. Could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: When did it start… oh dear. That is… a difficult question. It was… some time ago, I think. Not suddenly, no. More… a slow fading, perhaps? I do not remember exactly when. Maybe… six months? Or longer? It is hard to say. My wife… she would know. But… she is gone now.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Gyamfi. That must be incredibly difficult. It's understandable that remembering details might be harder during a stressful time. So, if we put the timeframe at around six months or longer, has this difficulty with words been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Yes, it is… quiet now, but it was… a great loss. Constant… hmm. No, not constant, no. Some days are… better than others. Some days the words… they hide more. And some days… they are almost there, but not quite. It is… like trying to catch smoke, yes? It comes and goes. It is worse… when I am tired, I think. Or… when I try to explain something complicated.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good description, Mr. Gyamfi – “like trying to catch smoke.” It sounds like it's fluctuating, and that fatigue or complex thought seems to make it worse. That gives us some helpful information. Now, aside from the difficulty finding words, have you noticed any other changes in your speech or thinking?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… I repeat myself. Not often, but… occasionally I say the same thing twice. My son… he points it out. He is very observant. And… sometimes I have trouble understanding others. Not all the time, but… if someone speaks quickly, or uses… difficult words, I have to ask them to repeat themselves. Is that… what you mean? I do not know if this is new, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean, Mr. Gyamfi. The repetition and trouble understanding others are important things to note. It sounds like both your ability to express yourself and understand others is being affected. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… well, I am… an older man. I have my aches and pains, as you would expect. I have… Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups. I try to eat healthy, mostly. I do not smoke, and I drink… a small glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. My blood pressure… it is sometimes a little high, but the doctor has medicine for that. I do not… do much exercise now. I used to walk a lot, but… after my wife… it is hard to find the motivation.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Gyamfi. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and I appreciate you being so open with me. Now, I'd like to ask about any medications you are currently taking, if you can recall their names. Also, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Medications… yes. Let me see. I take… a small white pill for my blood pressure. I do not remember the name, I'm sorry. The doctor… he sends it to the pharmacy. And… sometimes I take something for my… joints, when they are very sore. A yellow capsule, I think. Also, I take a vitamin… a multivitamin, yes. Allergies… no, I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat… everything. I do not have… skin allergies, or anything like that. No, I do not have any allergies, I believe.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Gyamfi. We can always confirm the names of your medications with the pharmacy records. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family experienced problems with memory or speech?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That is… a difficult question. My mother… she had some trouble remembering things when she was very old. But she was very, very old. And my uncle… he had a stroke, I think. He had trouble speaking after that. But… other than that… not that I recall. My father… he was always very sharp, very quick-witted. And my wife's family… I do not know them very well. We did not see them often. So… not that I am aware of, no.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. This will involve testing your reflexes, strength, and coordination, and a simple speech test. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Please, proceed. I will do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Alright, first, let’s check your blood pressure. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Coordination is slightly reduced, but within normal limits. Speech is fluent but slightly slow, with occasional pauses to find the correct word. Alright, Mr. Gyamfi, thank you for your cooperation. Based on the examination, your neurological function appears generally intact, but there is some mild slowing of speech and some reduced coordination. It’s subtle, but it's worth investigating further. I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions and a brain scan to get a clearer picture of your brain structure. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds sensible. If you think it is necessary, then yes, please order the tests. I want to understand what is happening, yes. Blood work and… a scan. Whatever you recommend. I trust you. Will the scan… hurt?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Gyamfi. The scan I’m recommending is an MRI, which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It’s completely painless. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It can be a little noisy, so we’ll provide you with headphones. It’s important to remain still during the scan to get clear images. The whole process takes about 30-45 minutes. I'll also order some routine blood work to check your overall health and rule out any deficiencies that could be contributing to your symptoms. I'll have my nurse schedule these tests for you. While we're waiting for the results, I'd like to recommend some cognitive exercises to help sharpen your memory and language skills. We can also explore some strategies to help you cope with the difficulty finding words. Would you be interested in learning more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. No pain, that is good to know. And… exercises. Yes, I would like that very much. I would like to try anything that might help. Strategies… yes. Please, tell me more. I want to… keep my mind sharp, yes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gyamfi. There are several simple things you can do. Things like doing crossword puzzles, Sudoku, or reading regularly can help keep your mind active. For language, try to actively recall names and objects, describe things in detail, or practice storytelling. There are also apps and websites specifically designed for cognitive training. Regarding strategies, when you're having trouble finding a word, don't struggle in silence. Try to describe what the word means or what it does. Sometimes, that can help trigger your memory. You can also use a notepad or phone to jot down key words or phrases to help you remember what you want to say. And it's perfectly okay to ask people to repeat themselves or slow down. I'm also going to give you a referral to a speech therapist who can provide you with more personalized exercises and strategies. She can help you develop a plan to address your specific challenges. We'll get the results of your tests back in about a week. I'll give you a call as soon as they're available to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact my office. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That is… very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. Crosswords… I used to do those with my wife. I will try to remember that. And I will… try not to struggle in silence. No, I do not think I have any questions right now. You have explained everything very clearly. I… appreciate your patience and kindness. I think that is all for today. Thank you again, Doctor Chagaris.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. My nurse will be with you shortly to schedule your tests and provide you with some resources. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
