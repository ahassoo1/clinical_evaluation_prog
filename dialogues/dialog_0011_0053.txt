DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s like it takes a long time to start, and then it’s not a strong stream, you know? It's been going on for a couple of weeks now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not embarrassing at all, Ms. Yadao; these things are quite common, and we can certainly address them. So, to clarify, you’re experiencing difficulty initiating urination, and when you do urinate, the stream isn’t as strong as it usually is. You mentioned this has been occurring for a couple of weeks—roughly how long would you say?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… right after I helped my grandson with that heavy garden work. He was building a new raised bed. That was… the second week of July, I believe. So, maybe five, six weeks now? It’s hard to say exactly, I don't pay much attention to the days unless I have an appointment. But definitely since that garden work. And it hasn't gotten better at all.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Ms. Yadao. The timing with the garden work is helpful information. And you're right to point out it hasn't improved. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the sensation you feel before you’re able to urinate?
PATIENT: Well, it feels like… I have to go, you know? Like a normal urge. But then… nothing happens right away. I have to strain a little, and push. It's not painful, exactly, just… frustrating. And then it starts, but it’s weak. Not like it used to be. It doesn’t feel like I empty my bladder completely either, if that makes sense. I find myself going back a little while later.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Yadao. So, a sense of urgency, difficulty initiating the stream, requiring straining, a weak stream, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… it's been a little cloudy sometimes. Not every time, but a few times I’ve noticed it wasn't clear like usual. And maybe a little stronger smell, but I drink a lot of water, so I’m not always sure what's normal! I’ve been trying to drink even more water, thinking that would help. No blood or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. Drinking more water is generally a good practice. Now, let's move on to some other questions. Have you experienced any fever, chills, lower abdominal pain, or pain in your back or flank—that’s the area on either side of your lower back?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my back feels fine. My lower abdomen… sometimes a little uncomfortable, but nothing sharp or really painful. Just a sort of dull ache, on and off. I thought maybe it was from lifting things around the garden, but it's not constant. I do take a bit of ibuprofen for my arthritis, could that be it?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Yadao. The ibuprofen is relevant, we'll discuss that shortly. Now, concerning your past medical history, do you have any other medical conditions besides arthritis that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe thirty years ago. And high blood pressure, but I take a pill for that every day, keeps it under control. Oh, and my doctor told me I have a bit of wear and tear in my hips, that’s why my arthritis is in my legs. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else major. I see Doctor Milkevicius for my regular check-ups, he’s a good doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you. History of gallbladder removal, hypertension managed with medication, and some arthritis related hip issues. And Doctor Milkevicius, good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, I don't think so. Maybe some stitches when I was a little girl, falling off my bicycle, but nothing serious like a full surgery. My gallbladder was the only real operation I’ve ever had. And I haven’t been in the hospital for anything other than when I had that taken out. I’m usually pretty healthy, all things considered. I walk every day, I eat my vegetables, and I try to stay active.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Yadao. It's good you maintain an active lifestyle. Now, regarding family history—are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as kidney problems, prostate issues in any of the men, or bladder cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a hard one. My father… he had some trouble with his kidneys when he was older, I think. He was always very private, didn’t talk much about his health. And my brother, he had some kind of cancer, not bladder cancer, I don't remember what kind, but he passed away a few years ago. My mother… she was healthy as a horse, really. No problems that I remember. My grandfather on my mother's side... he had a weak heart. It's a long time ago, I don't know much about it. Is that helpful? I'm not very good with remembering all that.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Yadao. Knowing about your father’s kidney issues and your brother's cancer gives us some important background. And it’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall everything. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My mother always warned me about smoking. It’s terrible for you, she said. I've always avoided it. And I don't drink much either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Nothing regular. I'm not much of a drinker, never have been.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, finally, regarding allergies and medications—do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. And as for medications, I take lisinopril for my high blood pressure, and ibuprofen when my arthritis is acting up. That’s it. I try to take the ibuprofen as little as possible, just when I really need it. And I get my prescriptions filled at the pharmacy in town, with Mrs. Kaminska, she’s a sweet lady.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. That gives me a very complete picture of your health history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. I will explain everything as I go, and please do let me know if anything is uncomfortable. First, I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. I’m listening for any unusual sounds. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’m going to gently palpate—or feel—your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. A little pressure, maybe, but no pain. Just feels like… someone’s poking me, you know? That’s all. And that’s fine, it doesn’t bother me. I’ve had a bit of a tummy since I was young, so I’m used to being poked!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, I’m going to check your lower back for any tenderness as well. Any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt either. Maybe a little stiff, but I always feel a bit stiff in the mornings. It’s the arthritis, I think. I do my exercises, but sometimes it’s still a bit sore. No sharp pain, though. It's just... an ache, you know? Like I said before.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. Now, I'd like to perform a neurological exam—that's a quick assessment of your reflexes and sensation. This will help me rule out any nerve-related issues. I'm going to gently tap your knees with this little hammer to check your reflexes. This may feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s alright. That tickled a little! Both my legs jumped, I think. It’s been a while since I had a doctor tap my knees, I’ve forgotten what that feels like! Everything feels normal to me, but you know more about these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, both reflexes are present and equal, which is good. Now, I'm going to lightly touch your legs with this cotton swab to check your sensation. Please tell me when you feel the touch. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. Both legs. It’s a little ticklish, but yes, I can feel it. Everything feels the same on both sides, if that makes sense. No numbness or tingling or anything like that. Just… a little tickle.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Sensation is intact bilaterally. Now, finally, I'd like to perform a quick prostate exam. This involves a gentle digital rectal exam to assess the size and texture of your prostate gland. This can provide important information about possible causes of your urinary symptoms. I understand this can be uncomfortable, and I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I’ve heard about that exam. I wasn’t expecting that. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? It sounds… invasive. And I haven’t had that done before. Could we perhaps try something else first?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Ms. Yadao. It’s a fair question. You are right, it is not the most comfortable exam. However, given your symptoms—difficulty initiating urination, weak stream, and incomplete emptying—and your age, it’s important to assess the prostate gland, as enlargement can contribute to these issues. It helps me to rule out more serious causes. That being said, we can start with some other tests. I can order a urinalysis to check for infection or blood in your urine. And I can order a PSA test – that's a blood test to screen for prostate cancer. Those results will help guide our next steps. Would that be more comfortable for you at this point?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be much more comfortable, Doctor. The blood tests and the urine test sound much better. Let's start with those. I trust your judgement, and I understand you need to do your job to figure out what’s going on. But I'm not very keen on that exam, if we can avoid it for now. Thank you for understanding.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. Your comfort is my priority. We will absolutely start with the urinalysis and PSA test. I’ll write the orders for those now. The lab is located just down the hall, and the receptionist there will be able to assist you. They'll need a sample of your urine and some blood drawn. Once the results are back—usually within a few days—my nurse, Sarah, will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you for being understanding about the exam. I really appreciate it. And I’ll go to the lab right away and get those tests done. I hope they don't take too long. It's a bit of a walk from here to the lab, but I’m used to walking.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could address your concerns. Sarah will do her best to get you in and out quickly. And remember, if anything changes or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Here are the lab orders. I wish you a good day, and we’ll talk soon. Stop by anytime if you have questions.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I think that’s everything. I’ll see you soon. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Yadao. Have a good day. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all.
