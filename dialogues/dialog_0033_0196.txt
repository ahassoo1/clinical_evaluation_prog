DOCTOR: Right. Janie Licano, 52. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… the tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for… well, a long time now, I guess. I don’t really keep track of dates so well these days. It’s just… draining, you know? Everything feels like such a lot of effort.
DOCTOR: “A long time…” Right. And is this tiredness… constant?
PATIENT: Pretty much, yeah. Some days are worse than others, I suppose. But… even when I’ve had a good night’s sleep – or what I think is a good night’s sleep – I still wake up feeling like I haven’t rested at all. It's… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes. And anything else accompanying the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my muscles ache, you know? Not like a sharp pain, just… heavy. And I feel… foggy. Like I can’t quite… focus. It’s hard to explain. I forget things too. Sorry, I probably don’t make much sense.
DOCTOR: Foggy…muscle aches…Okay. Do you notice this fogginess or muscle ache at specific times of the day, or is it fairly consistent?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Consistent, I think. It's… all the time, really. Though maybe worse in the afternoons? It's hard to say. I don't really plan my day around it, if that makes sense. Just… get through it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your weight, appetite, or bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Weight… I haven't weighed myself in… a while. I think I’ve lost a bit, but… honestly, I couldn’t say for sure. Appetite is… okay, I guess. Not huge. And… oh, well, things aren’t as regular as they used to be, if you know what I mean. Sorry to be so… vague.
DOCTOR: Vague is…common. Let’s move on. Any history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, my husband… he passed a few years back. Heart trouble. I… I don’t really remember what I’ve had. The doctor… well, I saw a doctor before, but I can't recall anything specific. Nothing major, I don’t think. I get a bit mixed up. I have Medicare, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Medicare is…helpful. And any surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. I think. And… oh, I broke my wrist once, when I was younger. Fell off a ladder, cleaning the gutters. But that was… a long time ago. That’s about all I can remember, honestly. I hope that's useful.
DOCTOR: Right. Family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family… My mother had… arthritis, I think. And my father… well, he smoked a lot. That's about all I recall. We weren't a very close family, to be honest. It's hard to say what ran in the family. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. But honestly, I take so many little pills these days, I’ve lost track. I don’t remember ever having a bad reaction to anything. But that doesn’t mean I haven't. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you list the medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a lot to list. Let me see… I have a pill for my blood pressure, I think. And something for my cholesterol. And… oh, a little white one for… something. I just take them every morning with my breakfast. I honestly don't know what half of them are for. I have a big pill organizer, though!
DOCTOR: Do you have that pill organizer with you?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… no. No, I didn't bring it. I just thought I could list them off. It's got all the days of the week on it, and the pharmacist fills it for me. I really wish I had it though… This is so difficult.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Then we’ll see if we can narrow things down. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. Just let me… take my time.
DOCTOR: Take your time. Breathing sounds are clear bilaterally. Heart rate is…slightly elevated, but regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Reflexes are… diminished, but symmetrical. Blood pressure is 140/90. Temperature is normal. Anything feel particularly painful when I touched your abdomen?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s just… I often feel a bit… bloated, you know? But no sharp pains or anything like that. It’s just a general… discomfort. Like everything’s a bit… heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this exam, and what you’ve told me, it could be a number of things. Your symptoms – fatigue, muscle aches, foggy thinking – are rather nonspecific. We need to do some blood work to rule out things like anemia, thyroid issues, and vitamin deficiencies. I’ll write an order for a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a vitamin D level, and a basic metabolic panel.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary. Will it take long to get the results? I really just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: The lab should be able to process them fairly quickly. A few days, at most. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible, and maintain a healthy diet. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… all. Thank you. Just… getting the tests done is a relief, I suppose. I just hope they find something. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, then. You’ll receive a call from the office to schedule your follow-up. Have a good day. .
