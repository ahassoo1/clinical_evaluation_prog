DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to Early KAMMER Clinic. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… Kammer, actually. Early Kammer. Yes. Well, I don't usually come to doctors. But my daughter, she thinks I need one of those… cards. A “get well” card. She says it would… lift my spirits. It’s silly, really. But she pays the bills, so… I guess I need you to write one for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like your daughter is concerned about your well-being, and that's a good thing. While I'm happy to address any concerns she has, a "get well" card isn’t quite what I do here. I'm a family medicine doctor, so I focus on your overall health. Is there anything you’re feeling unwell with?
PATIENT: Well, now you’re making it complicated. I just want the card! She said something about needing a doctor’s… signature. To make it official. I don't feel sick, exactly. Just… old. And tired. Is that something you write cards for? Because I assure you, being old is a legitimate ailment.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. And you're right to advocate for yourself. While I can't just write a card, I can certainly document your concerns about feeling tired and generally unwell. It’s important to take those feelings seriously. Perhaps if we talk a bit more about what you're experiencing, we can rule out any underlying medical causes for the fatigue. To start, could you tell me a little more about when this tiredness began?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I’ve been tired my whole life. I used to operate boilers, you know? Big, hot, dangerous boilers. Now that's tiring. Then I retired, and I'm still tired. It’s just… what happens when you get older. This is all very… unnecessary. Is this what you do with patients? Ask them when they started feeling old?
DOCTOR: You're right to question me, Mr. Kammer. I apologize if my questions seem silly or intrusive. It's my job to explore all possibilities, even if it seems like something simple. Fatigue can be a symptom of many things, and even if it's simply a part of aging, it’s good to rule out anything more serious. Just to be thorough – and I promise, I’ll make this quick – have you noticed any changes in your tiredness recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… Well, it’s probably worse now that my daughter is constantly on my back about “self-care” and “doctor’s appointments”. Stress is a change, isn’t it? It used to be just boilers, now it's… everything. And the card, don’t forget the card! Is writing a card really that difficult, Doctor? You went to school for all this… just to not write a card?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like your daughter's concern, while well-intentioned, is adding to your stress. And you're right, it's a bit ironic that I spent years in medical school and I’m not immediately writing a card! Let’s try this. Let’s document all of this – the fatigue, the stress, your feelings about the appointments – and then we can discuss if a note addressing your daughter's concerns would be appropriate. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: …Acceptable is a strong word. But… better than nothing, I suppose. If it gets my daughter off my back, I’ll allow it. Just… don't make it too… flowery. I'm a boiler operator, not a poet. And please, document the stress caused by the card request. That’s important.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kammer. No poetry, I promise. And I will definitely document the stress related to the card request. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and stress?
PATIENT: No. Just… tired. And annoyed. And, as I’ve mentioned approximately five times, stressed about the card. My knees ache a little, but that's just old age. I don't need it documented, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. No other symptoms. Just fatigue, annoyance, and stress related to the card. It’s helpful to know what isn’t bothering you, too. Now, sometimes, even if someone doesn't feel "sick," we do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. It helps us monitor your health over time. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? For a card? Doctor, are you trying to make this more complicated? I came here for a signature, not a… check-up. I assure you, everything is where it's supposed to be. It’s just… old.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Kammer. It’s not just for the card. It’s standard practice when a new patient presents with concerns, even if those concerns are primarily about fatigue. It helps me build a complete picture of your health. It’s quick. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees since you mentioned they ache. It doesn’t have to be extensive, I promise. It’s really just a precaution.
PATIENT: …Fine. But make it quick. I have… important things to do. Like avoid my daughter. And if you find anything wrong, don’t tell her. She’ll just make me eat kale. And schedule another appointment. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Quick and painless, I promise. No kale talk here. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just take some deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but there’s some slight decreased breath sound in the bases, could be normal in someone your age. Now, let's take a look at those knees... There's some mild tenderness on the medial aspect of both knees, consistent with some age-related wear and tear. No swelling or significant range of motion limitations. Alright, that's all. Nothing alarming. Just some expected findings for someone your age.
PATIENT: "Expected findings." That's doctor-speak for old, isn't it? Look, can we please get to the card? I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon being… examined. And don't tell my daughter about the "findings", please. She’ll start talking about physical therapy and… things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. No mention of physical therapy, I promise. And "expected findings" just means everything is generally as we’d expect for your age, which is good. Let’s document all of this and then we can address your daughter’s concerns and the note. Okay, I've documented everything. Now, tell me exactly what would make your daughter happy. Do you want me to specifically address her concerns about your fatigue?
PATIENT: She wants… reassurance. That I’m “taking care of myself”. That I’m “being proactive”. And… a note saying I saw a doctor. She needs proof. Something official. Just write something about “evaluated fatigue and stress”, and that I’m “under medical care”. And don’t mention kale. Or exercise. Please. And maybe… something about getting enough rest? She’s always on my back about that, too.
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. It says: “Mr. Kammer presented today with concerns regarding fatigue and stress. He was evaluated and is currently under medical care. We discussed the importance of adequate rest and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.” It’s fairly general, but it addresses her concerns without mentioning anything you’re opposed to. Is that satisfactory?
PATIENT: …Yes. That will do nicely. “Adequate rest.” She’ll like that. And it’s official. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you not making me eat kale.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I’m glad we could find a solution that worked for you. Remember, if you do experience any new or worsening symptoms, don’t hesitate to reach out. And if you ever need a second opinion on the benefits of kale, I can recommend a good nutritionist. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
