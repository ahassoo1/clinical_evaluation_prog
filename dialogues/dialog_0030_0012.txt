DOCTOR: Good morning, Velda. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today because I am going on a cruise – a lovely one, actually, to the Caribbean – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I depart. They sent a form, and I thought it best to get a doctor to complete it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Velda. That’s a very sensible approach. Cruise lines often have those requirements for good reason. I'm happy to help you complete the form. To start, let's go through some general health questions. Could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was married for twenty years to a very good man, Alistair. Sadly, he passed away five years ago now. As for my own health… I’ve generally been quite well, thankfully. I’ve not had any major illnesses, not that I recall. I had the usual childhood things, measles and such, but nothing serious. I did have my appendix out when I was seventeen, but that was quite some time ago, and there were no complications. I’ve always been fairly active, walking a great deal, and I eat a balanced diet. Is there anything in particular you are wanting to know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Velda. I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Alistair. It sounds as though you've been quite proactive about your health, which is wonderful. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a few specific areas. First, have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Not that I know of, anyway. I've never been told I have any of those things. My general practitioner, Doctor MacIntyre, always said my blood pressure was a bit on the low side, actually, but he never mentioned anything serious. I've never had any trouble breathing, nor have I ever been told I have any sugar problems. I go for a check-up every couple of years, just to be sure, but everything has always been fine. I’m fairly sure I am as healthy as a woman my age can be.
DOCTOR: That's reassuring to hear, Velda. And it's excellent that you maintain regular check-ups with Dr. MacIntyre. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t take anything regularly. Not a single thing! I tried some vitamins a few years ago, a multi-vitamin, but I couldn’t remember to take them every day, so I stopped. I might take an aspirin now and again if I have a headache, but that’s it. I prefer to get everything I need from my food, if possible. I believe in a good, wholesome diet and plenty of fresh air. That’s always been my philosophy.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and I’ve never had any trouble with shellfish, nuts, or anything like that. I’ve taken antibiotics when I’ve needed them, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to those either. I’m quite fortunate, I think, in that regard. Is it common for people to have allergies these days?
DOCTOR: It is becoming more common, Velda, yes. But you're right to be fortunate if you haven't experienced any. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be eighty-seven, and she was remarkably healthy all her life, although she did have arthritis in her hands towards the end. My father had a heart condition, I believe – angina, it was – but he didn’t get it until he was in his seventies. He smoked a pipe for most of his life, which probably didn’t help. My only sibling, my brother Hamish, is still alive and well, living in Canada, but he’s not particularly forthcoming about his health, if I’m honest. He’s always been a bit private. So, overall, nothing too serious on either side of the family, thankfully. Do you need to know any more details, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That gives me a good overview, Velda. Thank you. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your current health status. Have you been experiencing any symptoms lately – anything at all – that are concerning you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I've been feeling quite well, as a matter of fact. I perhaps tire a little more easily than I used to, but I suppose that’s to be expected at my age. And my knees sometimes ache a bit in the cold weather, but that’s just the arthritis, I expect. Nothing that requires attention, certainly. I sleep well, I eat well, and I generally feel quite cheerful. I don’t believe I have any complaints, thankfully. I’m a very practical woman, Doctor, and I wouldn’t bother a doctor if something wasn’t genuinely bothering me.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your practicality, Velda. That's very helpful. Just to be thorough, let's go through a quick review of systems. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I maintain a fairly steady weight, always have. I’ve put on a little bit over the winter, perhaps a pound or two, but nothing significant. It's easy to do when the weather is cold and you’re not getting out as much. But it comes off again in the summer, when I’m walking more. I weigh myself every couple of weeks, just to keep an eye on it, and I’ve not noticed any drastic changes. I’m about ten stone, give or take a pound, and I’ve been that weight for years. Is that what you were wanting to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Velda. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, my appetite is as good as ever! I enjoy my food, always have, and I’ve not noticed any change in that regard. I eat three meals a day, and I don't skip breakfast. I enjoy a good, hearty breakfast, actually – porridge with a little honey, and a cup of tea. And I enjoy a nice dinner in the evening, too – something wholesome and nutritious. I’ve always believed in the importance of a good diet, and I’ve never had any trouble with my appetite. It's always been very reliable, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you experienced any issues with your bowel movements or bladder function?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. Everything is quite regular, thankfully. I've never had any trouble in that regard. I drink plenty of water, which I believe is very important, and I eat plenty of fruit and vegetables. I’ve always been very conscientious about my health, and I’ve never had any problems with my digestion or bladder. It's all quite normal, if you’ll excuse my frankness. Is it common for people to have trouble with those things?
DOCTOR: It can be, Velda, but you sound very healthy in that regard. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any recent changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. My eyesight is not what it once was, of course, but I wear glasses, and they keep everything nice and clear. I had my eyes tested last year, and the optician said everything was fine. And my hearing is still quite good, although I do have to ask people to speak up occasionally, especially if there’s a lot of noise. But that’s just part of getting older, I expect. I’ve never had any serious problems with my vision or hearing, thankfully. I'm very grateful for that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, have you experienced any recent skin changes – any new moles, rashes, or unusual growths?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. My skin is a bit dry in the winter, of course, but I use a good moisturizer, and that keeps it nice and smooth. I've never had any trouble with moles or rashes, and I've never noticed any unusual growths. I'm very careful about protecting my skin from the sun, too – I always wear a hat and sunglasses when I'm outdoors, and I avoid spending too much time in the direct sunlight. I've always been very conscientious about my health, and I've never had any problems with my skin. I'm very grateful for that. Is there anything else you would like to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, Velda, that’s a very thorough account. Thank you. Now, if you’ll permit me, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline reading and ensure everything is as you’ve described. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. I understand the need for it. I haven't any objections at all. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do, or any particular way I need to be positioned. I'm a very practical woman, as you know, and I'm happy to cooperate in any way that will help. I trust your professional judgment implicitly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Velda. If you could just relax and breathe normally. Blood pressure is 128/76, which is excellent. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear, with good breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly noted. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Peripheral pulses are present and strong in all extremities. Ears, nose, and throat appear normal. Overall, the examination findings are consistent with your report of good health. Everything appears to be within normal limits. Do you have any questions about the findings?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, that’s very reassuring to hear! I’m pleased that everything checks out. No, I don’t think I have any questions, not at the moment. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to examine me so carefully. It’s good to know that I’m in good shape for my cruise. Now, about that form the cruise line sent… will you be able to complete it for me? That was the main reason for my visit, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Velda, absolutely. That's what I'm here for. I'll just fill this out now, based on our conversation and the examination findings. It asks about your medical history, current medications, allergies, and any chronic conditions… which, as we’ve established, you don’t have. Alright, I've completed the form. It states you have no significant medical history, no current medications or allergies, and a normal physical examination. I’ve signed and dated it as your physician. Here you are. Please review it to ensure everything is accurate.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, Doctor, thank you so much! Yes, that looks absolutely perfect. Everything is accurately documented, and I’m very grateful for your thoroughness. This will certainly put my mind at ease before my cruise. I appreciate your taking the time to help me with this. Is there anything I need to pay you for today?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Velda. I’m glad I could help. As you are uninsured, our fee for the consultation and form completion is $150, payable today. We accept cash or credit card. And please, enjoy your cruise! The Caribbean is a beautiful place. If you experience any health concerns while you're traveling, don't hesitate to seek medical attention.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you are, Doctor. $150, exactly. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been most helpful, and I truly appreciate your kindness and professionalism. I shall certainly enjoy my cruise, knowing that I have a clean bill of health and a completed form. I shall recommend your clinic to my friends should they ever require medical attention. Have a lovely day, Doctor Quicksey.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Velda. That means a great deal to me. And you have a wonderful cruise as well. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns in the future. It was a pleasure meeting you. Goodbye.
PATIENT: .
