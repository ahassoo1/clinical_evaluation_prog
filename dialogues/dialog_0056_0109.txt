DOCTOR: Hi Mitchell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My head… back of my head hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now. Not a bad hurt, but… always there. Like a weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for three days, consistently present, like a weight. Got it. And is this headache new, or have you experienced headaches like this before?
PATIENT: New, Doctor. I get little headaches sometimes, you know, from the sun. Or if I don’t drink enough water. But this… this is different. It’s in the back always. Not all over. Never felt this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so definitely a change from your usual headaches. And it's consistently located in the back of your head. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… nothing makes it worse, I don’t think. Lying down… maybe a little better? But not much. Nothing really helps it go away. I tried some water, like always… didn’t do much. I work hard, you know, with the trains. Maybe that?
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down offers minimal relief, and water hasn’t helped. And you mentioned you do physical work with the trains. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: I work at the rail yard. Been doing it… a long time. Almost seventy years! Now I mostly… check the dinkeys. Little trains, they move the cars around. And… help move the bigger ones. Hostlers, they call it. Lots of… starting and stopping. And… sometimes I have to climb on top of the cars, but not so much anymore. Old man now, you know. But still… it’s work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a lot of physical activity, some lifting, some climbing, even if it's less now. And you've been doing this for almost seventy years – that's incredible. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I eat okay, I sleep okay… maybe a little tired, but that's just being old, I guess. No dizziness. No blurry vision. No… nothing feels different, except the head. Sometimes… I feel a little… shaky, but that's when I haven't eaten. Not with the headache though. Just… tired sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, no dizziness, no vision changes. Just some fatigue, and shakiness when you haven't eaten, but not directly related to the headache. And you said you eat and sleep okay. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never really been sick. A few colds, you know, when I was a boy. But nothing the doctor ever needed to see me for. Old man's aches and pains, that's it. Never had… high blood pressure or anything like that. My wife… she had some trouble with her heart, but I… I've been lucky. No insurance though. Too expensive, always.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, and no insurance. That's good to know. Have you taken any medications regularly, even over-the-counter medications like pain relievers, for this headache or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take nothing. I tried a little water, like I said. But no pills. Never been much for pills. My wife… she took some for her heart, but I… I just tough it out. I’m an old man, you know. A little headache isn't going to stop me. It's just… bothering me more now. That’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. I understand you prefer to tough things out, but it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle, old man, you know. Everything creaks.
DOCTOR: Of course. Okay, I'm just going to feel around the back of your head and neck. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. ...Okay, a little bit of tightness in the muscles back here. And I'm just going to have you gently turn your head side to side...and look up and down... Okay, range of motion seems good, but there's some discomfort when I move it this way… ...and this way. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It's just routine. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Do you get your blood pressure checked anywhere regularly?
PATIENT: A little tight, yes. Always been a little tight. Been working hard a long time, you know. And that side… right side… feels a little… funny. Not pain, exactly. Just… a little off. No, Doctor. Never had my blood pressure checked. Like I said, no insurance. Never really needed a doctor, until now, I guess. 150… is that bad? My wife… she always worried about numbers. I never paid much attention.
DOCTOR: 150/90 is a bit higher than we'd like to see, and it’s good we caught it. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything drastic, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Given the headache, the tightness in your neck, discomfort on the right side, and the elevated blood pressure, I’m thinking it could be a tension headache, possibly related to muscle strain from your work, but we need to rule out other possibilities. To do that, I'd like to order a CT scan of your head, just to be safe. It will give us a clear picture and help us rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A scan… sounds expensive. I… I don’t have much money, Doctor. Never been good with money. My wife… she handled all that. Scan… what will it show? And… how much will it cost? I don't want to get into trouble.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the cost. I understand your concern. A CT scan can be expensive, and I don’t want to put you in a difficult position. Let me see if we can work something out. This clinic has some financial assistance programs for patients who are uninsured and have limited income. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, speak with you after the exam to explore those options. Also, we can look into any free or reduced-cost imaging centers in the area. The scan will show us a detailed picture of your brain and the structures around it. It can help us rule out things like a bleed, a tumor, or any other structural problems that could be causing your headache. It's the best way to be sure. Even if it's just a tension headache, it's good to have the peace of mind. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… financial assistance… that would be good. Maria… she sounds nice. Peace of mind… yes, that sounds good too. I just want to know what's wrong. Been working hard all my life, don't want to be stopped now. Yes, Doctor. Let's do the scan. Thank you for understanding.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad we could talk through that. Okay, Maria will be in shortly to get some information from you about the financial assistance program. While we wait, I’m going to write an order for the CT scan, and also a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with the neck tension. It might help alleviate some of the discomfort while we wait for the scan results. And I'd like you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. A muscle relaxant… that would be nice. My neck does ache. And one week… yes, I can do that. Maria… she will help with the papers? I’m not good with papers. Thank you again, Doctor. You are very kind. It's good to know someone cares.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Maria is excellent, and she’ll walk you through everything. And it’s my pleasure, Mitchell. That’s what I’m here for. I’ll have her come in now. "Maria, could you come in here for a moment, please?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I hope it's nothing too serious. Just an old man, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll get to the bottom of it. .
