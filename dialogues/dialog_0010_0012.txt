DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a bit of a dream trip, really – and the cruise line needs some information about my health before I can go. They sent a rather detailed form, and I thought it best to get it filled out properly by a doctor, rather than trying to remember everything myself. It’s August the 2nd, isn't it? I always lose track.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is August 2nd. Very sensible of you to get it checked out thoroughly. Cruise lines are quite right to be cautious. Let's get this form taken care of. To start, can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve generally been quite alright, Doctor. I mean, I’m not as young as I once was, of course – 45 years young, to be precise – but I don’t have any major illnesses that I know of. I work as a merchandise displayer, so I’m on my feet a fair bit, and that keeps me moving. I lost my husband a few years back, so it’s just me now, but I manage. I wouldn’t say I’ve had any serious hospital stays or anything like that. Just the usual aches and pains, I suppose. Do you want me to list any allergies I have? I think I'm allergic to dust, but it's not life-threatening, just a bit of a sneeze.
DOCTOR: Okay, 45, merchandise displayer… that's good to know. And I'm sorry to hear about your husband. It's helpful to have a general picture. Yes, please, let's go through allergies first. Dust is a good start. Anything else – foods, medications, insect stings, anything at all that causes a reaction?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No food allergies that I’m aware of. I haven’t reacted badly to any medicines, not that I take many. Just over-the-counter pain relievers now and then for my back, as I mentioned. And I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything in… well, not in living memory! I suppose I’m quite lucky, really. I did have a rather bad bout of the flu a few winters ago, but that was years back, and I recovered fully. Would you like to know about any childhood illnesses? I had measles, mumps, the usual things when I was a wee girl, but I don't think that's relevant now, is it?
DOCTOR: No, measles and mumps aren’t likely relevant now. Good. So, no known drug allergies, no food allergies, just occasional pain relievers for your back… That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your back. How long have you been experiencing pain, and can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Well, it comes and goes, Doctor. I'd say it started properly about five years ago, after I lifted a rather heavy display. It’s not constant, thankfully. Most days I’m alright, but if I’ve been on my feet all day, or bent over a lot, it aches in the evening. It's a sort of dull ache, really, not a sharp pain. It doesn't go down my legs or anything like that, it’s just… lower back stiffness and ache. I manage it with a bit of paracetamol, and I try to be careful when lifting things. I haven't seen a specialist or anything for it, because it’s never been bad enough, I didn’t think. Do you want me to rate the pain on a scale of one to ten, when it’s at its worst?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. That would be helpful. And tell me, does anything relieve the pain, besides the paracetamol?
PATIENT: Well, a good lie-down usually does the trick, Doctor. And a warm bath. That relaxes the muscles nicely. Sometimes, if it’s really bothering me, I’ll use a hot water bottle. I find that helps a lot. And being sensible and not overdoing it, of course. I try not to lift anything too heavy if I can avoid it. I'm not as sprightly as I once was, I have to admit. It’s usually better after a good night’s sleep, too. Perhaps a six or seven on a bad day, if I’ve really pushed myself. Not constantly, mind you. It's more of a niggle, most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family history, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Hmm… my mother had arthritis in her hands when she got older, but it wasn’t severe. My father was quite healthy, actually, lived to be 80. He didn't have any major illnesses, just the usual age-related things. I don’t know much about my grandparents’ medical history, I’m afraid. They passed away when I was very young. My husband… he had high blood pressure towards the end, but it wasn’t something that caused him a great deal of trouble. I don’t believe there’s any history of heart disease or cancer in the family, but I couldn’t say for certain. It’s not something we talked about much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s useful to know. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh, dear. What do you mean exactly, Doctor? I'm not sure what you need to know. I live on my own, as I mentioned, and I don't go out a great deal. I enjoy reading, and I do a bit of gardening when the weather allows. I don’t smoke, and I only have a small glass of wine with my dinner occasionally. I don’t use any recreational drugs, never have. Is that the sort of thing you’re looking for? I’m a fairly quiet sort of person, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly the sort of thing I’m looking for. It helps me get a complete picture. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drug use. That’s all good. Do you have any pets?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I do. I have a wee cat called Maisie. She's a lovely tabby, very affectionate. She keeps me company, you see. She's quite a character, always getting up to mischief. I've had her for about seven years now. She’s a rescue cat, you know. A lovely creature. And I used to have a dog, a little terrier, but he passed away a few years back. I miss him terribly. But Maisie keeps me going. Do you need to know anything else about my… pets? I suppose it’s not very important, is it?
DOCTOR: Not at all. It’s good to know. Pets can be important for overall well-being. Now, just to finish up with the medical background, have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, I haven't had any major surgeries, Doctor. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago. And I had a wisdom tooth removed, but that was just a local anesthetic. Nothing serious, nothing that would be relevant now, I wouldn't think. I've never been in hospital for anything other than having my tonsils out, as a child, and a short stay when I broke my arm when I was a teenager. Nothing else. I'm quite fortunate, really. I've always been quite healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers. That’s very helpful. So, to summarise: you're 45, generally healthy, work as a merchandise displayer, occasional lower back pain managed with paracetamol and rest, no major medical history, no surgeries of note, and no significant family history. Do you have any allergies we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Just the dust, as I said. Nothing serious. I’ve tried to think carefully, and I can’t recall anything else. I’m quite sure. Is there anything else you need to know? Perhaps about the cruise itself? I mean, I’m not planning on doing anything too strenuous, I’m hoping for a bit of relaxation, a bit of sun. I wouldn't want to cause any bother on board.
DOCTOR: No, that’s good to know. Let's just do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure… 128 over 76, that's good. Pulse is 72, regular. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds clear. And I'll just check your reflexes… Those are normal. Now, can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Oh, that’s a bit stiff, you know. As I said about my back. It’s not terribly painful, just… tight. I'm not as flexible as I used to be, I'm afraid. I used to be able to do all sorts of things, but those days are long gone. Is that alright? Is everything okay?
DOCTOR: There's some tenderness there, as you said. No signs of anything acute. Range of motion is slightly limited, but nothing concerning. It sounds like a mild musculoskeletal issue, likely aggravated by your work. So, Ms. Squiers, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it doesn’t seem like there’s anything that would prevent you from enjoying your cruise. I'd recommend continuing to manage your back pain as you have been – paracetamol, rest, and gentle stretching. And be mindful of lifting anything heavy. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. That’s very reassuring, thank you. Just the thought of having something wrong with my back was worrying me, you see. It's just… I didn't want to ruin the cruise. I’ve been looking forward to it for ages. So, that's a weight off my mind. Will you be able to fill out the cruise line’s form for me, then? That was the whole reason for coming, you know. I’m not very good with medical things, and I wouldn’t know what to write.
DOCTOR: Certainly. That’s what I’m here for. Okay, I'm just confirming your medications… paracetamol as needed for back pain, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's right. Only when needed, you know. Not a regular thing. And just the occasional glass of wine with my dinner, as I said. Nothing else. I'm a very simple person, really. Is there anything else you need to know for the form? I want to make sure everything is correct, you see. I don't want any misunderstandings with the cruise line.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers, here is the completed form. I’ve documented your medical history, physical exam findings, and my assessment. It states you are generally healthy with mild musculoskeletal discomfort in your lower back, well-managed with over-the-counter pain relief. It also includes a recommendation for sensible activity and avoidance of heavy lifting. Please review it to make sure everything is accurate. I don’t see any reason why you shouldn’t enjoy your cruise. I recommend staying hydrated, using sunscreen, and listening to your body. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that looks very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. Yes, everything looks correct. You've written everything down perfectly. I appreciate you taking the time to do this for me. No, I don’t think I have any questions. You’ve been very helpful, and you’ve put my mind at ease. Thank you again for everything. Is there anything I need to pay you now?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I’m glad I could help. As you are uninsured, the fee for the consultation is £60, please. And have a wonderful cruise! If you experience any new or worsening symptoms while travelling, please don't hesitate to seek medical attention onboard. Do you need a copy of this form for your records?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please. A copy would be very useful, you know. Just in case. Thank you. Here you are. £60, is that correct? And thank you again for everything, Doctor. I really appreciate your kindness. I shall certainly enjoy my cruise now, knowing that everything is in order. I'll be sure to stay hydrated and take it easy. It's very kind of you to remind me. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. Here's your copy. Enjoy your cruise, and have a lovely time. If you need anything in the future, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day! .
