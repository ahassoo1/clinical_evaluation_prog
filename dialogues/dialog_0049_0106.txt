DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my foot. This… sore. It just won’t go away. Been bothering me for weeks now. A very unpleasant development, I assure you. And I’ve had feet all my life, you know. One would think they’d behave better after all this time.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say. And is this a new problem, or has it come and gone before?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s new. Well, not entirely. I've had little things before, cuts that wouldn't heal properly. But this… this is different. It’s deeper, and it hurts. It’s not like a scrape, you understand. It’s… a proper sore. And frankly, at my age, one doesn't need these sorts of complications. I've always been careful, you know. Very careful.
DOCTOR: Careful is good. And where exactly on your foot is this sore located?
PATIENT: On the bottom, naturally. Where one walks. Though, increasingly, I do less of that. It’s… right on the heel, I believe. Hard to see properly myself, you know. Back isn’t what it used to be. And I haven’t the flexibility, not anymore. It’s a most inconvenient spot, really. Everything’s inconvenient these days.
DOCTOR: Right on the heel. I see. And has anything specifically made it worse – certain shoes, increased activity, or perhaps a recent injury, however minor?
PATIENT: Shoes? Honestly, Dr. Nestingen, I wear sensible shoes. Always have. You think I’d be foolish enough to wear something… unsuitable? No, no injury. Though I did shuffle a bit further than usual to get the mail yesterday. Old Mr. Henderson finally got a new dog. Barking frightfully, it was. But a bit of walking shouldn't cause this. It’s ridiculous, frankly. Really, the things one endures.
DOCTOR: Right. Sensible shoes. And the barking didn’t directly bother your foot, just prompted a longer walk. Very well. I'm going to need to take a look at it, Ms. Cannington. Could you please sit on the examination table and remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Examine it? Really must you? I suppose it’s necessary, though I do wish doctors wouldn’t poke and prod so. Very undignified. There. Be quick about it, will you? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It's quite a deep ulceration, Ms. Cannington. And the surrounding skin is… rather pale. There's some redness, but no obvious signs of infection at this moment. I'm also noticing the skin is very thin. Pulses are present, though a bit weak. I’m going to need to document this thoroughly. Is this sore painful to the touch?
PATIENT: Painful? Of course it’s painful! Honestly, Dr. Nestingen, must you ask? It’s a sore, remember? A deep, unpleasant sore. It throbs, it aches… it’s a constant irritation. And frankly, at my age, I shouldn’t have to endure this. Do you understand? It’s just… inconsiderate. A proper nuisance, that's what it is. And likely related to… well, you know. The sugar. My late husband always warned me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. The discomfort is significant, and it seems you are aware of a possible connection to your blood sugar levels. I see here in your records a history of diabetes. Have you been monitoring your glucose levels recently?
PATIENT: Monitoring? Oh, I try. My daughter, bless her heart, keeps telling me to. A whole contraption, it is. Pricking and poking, like some sort of laboratory experiment. But honestly, it’s a bother. I manage. I eat reasonably well, I suppose. Not like those young people with their… sugary drinks and processed foods. Though it’s hard, you know. Everything tastes better with a little sugar. And sometimes, one just needs a treat. My late husband used to bring me baklava… But yes, I try to monitor it. Not always successfully.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, with all due respect, managing isn't enough when you have diabetes and a non-healing ulcer. Uncontrolled blood sugar significantly impairs healing and increases the risk of infection. We need to get your glucose levels under control. I'm going to order some blood work, including a comprehensive metabolic panel and a Hemoglobin A1c to assess your average blood sugar over the past three months. We also need to rule out any underlying vascular issues. I'm going to order a vascular ultrasound of both legs.
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Vascular… what did you say? Sounds… invasive. My late husband hated tests. Always said they just upset the natural balance. And what about this blood work? More pricking and poking? Honestly, Dr. Nestingen, I’m not sure I can endure all of this. It’s all so… complicated. Can't you just… give me something for the pain? A cream, perhaps? A nice, soothing cream? That's all I really want. To feel a little bit better.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your reluctance, but simply masking the pain isn't addressing the underlying problem. This ulcer is a serious concern, and ignoring it could lead to a much more significant infection, potentially requiring hospitalization or even amputation. I’m not going to prescribe anything just to temporarily alleviate your discomfort without a thorough work-up. We need to know why this isn't healing. The blood work and ultrasound will help us determine that. I'm also going to prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment to prevent infection while we investigate. But that’s merely a preventative measure. We must also address the underlying issues. I’m going to refer you to a podiatrist for specialized wound care. They can debride the wound and provide appropriate dressings. And I strongly recommend a consultation with a diabetes educator to help you manage your blood sugar levels. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Amputation? Oh, my. Goodness gracious. My late husband… he always said doctors were too quick to cut things off. A podiatrist… another specialist? And a… diabetes educator? Honestly, it’s all so overwhelming. Is it absolutely necessary? Fine. Do what you must. But please, be gentle. And no more talk of amputation. It’s… unsettling. Just… try to make it quick. And yes, I suppose I’ll see this podiatrist. But I’m warning you, I’m not a fan of strangers poking at my feet. Now, about this cream… a nice, soothing one, you said?
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm ordering a topical antibiotic ointment - silver sulfadiazine 1% - to apply to the wound twice daily after gently cleaning it with mild soap and water. It may sting slightly at first. I will also provide you with instructions on proper wound care. Here are the instructions, the referral forms, and a list of local podiatrists and diabetes educators. I’m scheduling a follow-up appointment for you in one week to review the blood work results and discuss the podiatrist’s recommendations. If you notice any signs of infection – increased redness, swelling, pus, or fever – please contact my office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Pus? Heavens. No, I don’t think so. I mean… not that I’ve noticed. This is all very… alarming. And one week? That seems awfully soon. But… no, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. Just… try not to frighten me too much, Dr. Nestingen. My heart can’t take it. I suppose I should be going. Thank you… I think. Now, where did I put my sensible shoes… .
