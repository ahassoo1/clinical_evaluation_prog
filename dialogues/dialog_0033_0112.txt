DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. MacVittie, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hello Doctor... Dech-ene, is it? Yes. Well, it’s rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been… going to the bathroom a lot. More than usual, definitely. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. Honestly, it's hard to say exactly how long. Time just… slips away. But it’s frequent. Very frequent.
DOCTOR: Frequent… yes. And can you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Quantify… That sounds… precise. I’m not very good with numbers, I’m afraid. Let me see… normally, I’d say… maybe four or five times a day? But lately… it feels like every hour, or even more often. Perhaps six, seven times? It’s very disruptive. And I apologize for not being more exact, it’s just… I don’t really keep track of these things. It’s just… a constant awareness, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is it… just frequent, or is there anything else accompanying this?
PATIENT: Oh, well… now that you mention it, yes. Sometimes, when I… have to go, it feels a bit… urgent. Like I really need to get there right now. And… occasionally, a little bit of discomfort afterwards. Not pain, exactly, but… a lingering feeling that something isn’t quite right. It doesn't last long, though. It’s really just the frequency and the… urgency that are bothering me the most. I don't know if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Urgency… and post-void discomfort. Do you experience any burning or pain during urination?
PATIENT: No, not during. It's really only afterwards, and it's not… sharp pain, like a cramp or anything. It’s more like… a dull ache, or a bit of pressure. And it doesn’t happen every time, only sometimes. I don’t think I’ve ever felt burning, though. No, definitely not burning. It’s just… unsettling, you know? To have to go so often, and then feel a little bit… off afterwards. I'm sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes in my… urine. I haven’t really… looked, if that sounds strange. I suppose not. It looks… normal, I think? The usual color. I haven't noticed any blood, or anything unusual like that. I honestly can't say I've paid much attention to it beyond confirming… well, that it is urine. I apologize, Doctor. I’m not very observant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. No fever, no chills, definitely no vomiting. And I haven’t felt nauseous at all. I feel… well, I feel generally fine, aside from the… bathroom situation. It’s just… inconvenient and a little worrying. I’m glad you're asking, though. I often worry I'm missing something important. Do you think it could be something serious? I apologize, I'm probably being silly.
DOCTOR: We'll see. Have you had any recent changes in your diet or fluid intake?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. No, not really. I… I don’t think so. I try to drink enough water, but I haven’t made any conscious effort to drink more recently. And my diet… well, it’s pretty much the same as always. Lots of fish, some vegetables. I don't eat a lot of processed food, if that's helpful. I did have a glass of cranberry juice a few days ago, but I read it doesn't really do anything, and I've always been a bit… skeptical of those old wives’ tales. Honestly, I can’t think of anything I’ve changed. It’s all rather baffling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any past medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and… I broke my arm once, skiing. Nothing major, really. And… I was divorced a few years ago, if that counts as a medical problem. No, seriously. Physically… I’ve always been quite healthy. I don’t take any regular medications, and I haven't been hospitalized since the appendix. I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of, either. I think that’s… everything. It’s just the frequent urination, and the… little bit of discomfort. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Right. And family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… That's a bit tricky. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think? And my father… he had some sort of heart condition, later in life. But honestly, I don’t really know the details. We weren’t very close. And I don’t have any siblings, so I don't have anyone to ask about their medical history, either. I apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. I'm not very good with remembering things, especially family matters. It's all rather… hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Just let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do. I apologize, I'm always a little anxious during these things. A bit silly, I know, but... here goes.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your back with your knees bent. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. And I'll do a quick neurological check. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Knees bent, yes. Just let me know if anything feels… odd. I apologize, I'm always a little self-conscious during these examinations. I worry I'm making a fuss, even though I know I shouldn't. And… is that cold? The table feels rather cold.
DOCTOR: I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. Now, I’m just going to feel for any tenderness. No acute tenderness, but slight discomfort in the suprapubic region. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Relax my legs. The suprapubic region… that’s… down there, isn’t it? Yes, I do sometimes feel a little discomfort there, especially after… you know. It’s not sharp, like pain, but more of a dull ache. It comes and goes. And… is this normal? To feel discomfort there? I apologize, I'm probably being silly again, asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Now, I'm going to perform a quick neurological exam. Sensory function appears intact. Right. That’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That wasn't too bad, was it? Sensory function intact… that’s… reassuring, I suppose. So… what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious? I apologize, I know I'm being a bother, but… the uncertainty is rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Based on your history and the exam, it’s likely a urinary tract infection, or possibly interstitial cystitis. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'm going to order a urine analysis and a urine culture. We need to confirm the diagnosis. And to be thorough, a complete blood count.
PATIENT: Oh. A… urinary tract infection? Is that… serious? And interstitial… what was it? Cystitis? A urine analysis and a… culture? And a blood count? That sounds… quite involved. Is it going to be painful? Will it require… medication? And will I be able to… work? I apologize, I'm probably overreacting. It's just… I don't do well with medical things. It makes me rather anxious.
DOCTOR: A UTI is common, and usually treatable with antibiotics. Interstitial cystitis is a chronic bladder condition, but we won't know for sure until we get the test results. The urine analysis is just a sample; not painful. The blood count is routine, to rule out other infections. As for work, it shouldn’t interfere with your ability to work. Here’s the requisition form for the lab. They’re located just down the hall. Take this to the receptionist, and they'll direct you. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss treatment options.
PATIENT: Oh. Antibiotics… that sounds… alright. And a chronic bladder condition… Down the hall, you say? And the receptionist will… direct me? I… I suppose that’s good. Thank you, Doctor. I… I think I can manage that. Is there… is there anything else I should know? Or do? Before I go?
DOCTOR: Just drink plenty of fluids, and try to avoid caffeine and alcohol until we have the results. And if you develop a fever, chills, or severe pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, see you at your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: Oh. Drink plenty of fluids… avoid caffeine and alcohol… and a fever… Right. Thank you, Doctor. .
