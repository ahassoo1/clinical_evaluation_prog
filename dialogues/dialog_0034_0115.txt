DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… it’s about my coloring, you see. A bit yellow, and not the pleasant sort. It's been… troubling. My daughter insisted I come. She worries so. Honestly, I don’t recall all the details, something about my liver… it’s all a bit muddled, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if details are muddled, Ms. Durig. We can sort through everything together. Your daughter is right to be attentive to changes like that. Yellowing of the skin, or what we call jaundice, can certainly indicate a few things, and it’s good we’re looking into it. You mentioned something about your liver. Do you recall if a doctor has discussed this with you previously, or if you've had any tests related to your liver in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests… I truly can’t say. It’s possible. So many doctors over the years… and I don’t have the best memory, you understand. Hepatitis, was it? The name sounds familiar… but where, when… it escapes me. I do remember feeling quite unwell some time ago, a general tiredness, but that could have been anything. Honestly, I wish I could be of more help. Is this… serious?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Durig. Don't worry about recalling specifics. We have your medical records here, and we can review those together. The mention of hepatitis is helpful, though. It’s a possible cause of liver issues, but there are many others. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the tiredness… It wasn't a sudden thing, you see. More of a… gradual fading. Like a light dimming, slowly. It started, I think… well, months ago. Everything felt like an effort. Even getting out of a chair. And I wasn’t eating much, either. Food just didn't appeal. Everything tasted… bland. It’s hard to explain. I just didn’t have the energy for it. I mostly just… rested. Is that helpful? I feel rather foolish trying to recall things so long ago.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Durig. It's not foolish at all – any information you can provide is valuable. A gradual fading of energy and loss of appetite are important symptoms. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Oh, my… stool color? Goodness. I… I honestly haven't paid much attention. I suppose… maybe a bit paler than usual? It’s terribly embarrassing to speak about such things, Doctor. But truthfully, I haven't been looking. As for my urine… I don’t recall anything different. I drink plenty of water, though, so it’s usually quite clear. I'm afraid I'm not a very observant patient. Is this… a common thing?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Durig. These are perfectly normal questions, and you’re not expected to be a medical expert. Many people don't routinely check these things. It's helpful that you drink plenty of water, though. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh… chronic conditions… Let me think. I believe I had a touch of high blood pressure years ago, but it was well-controlled with medication. I stopped taking it… oh, quite a while ago now. My doctor at the time said it was under control, and I was fine to stop. As for anything else… no, I don’t think so. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. Until recently, of course. But again, my memory… it's so unreliable. I’m terribly sorry. I wish I could give you a more definitive answer. This is all rather stressful.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Durig. Don’t worry about it at all. It's very common for people to have difficulty recalling past medical history, especially over a long period of time. We can also review records if needed. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Yes, I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. That was… oh, in the 1980s, I believe. And I had a hysterectomy, as well, sometime after that. Other than those two, I don’t recall any surgeries. Though, again, my memory… it’s terribly frustrating. I feel like I’m letting you down, Doctor. I want to be helpful, but I simply can’t remember everything. Is this going to take much longer? I have a bridge game this afternoon…
DOCTOR: You’re not letting me down at all, Ms. Durig. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and hysterectomy is very helpful. We’re making good progress. And we’ll try to keep things as brief as possible, considering your bridge game. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medications. Let me see… Just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. Ibuprofen, I think it is. When the pain flares up. And a multivitamin, just a general one. That's it, I believe. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. My daughter keeps telling me to take more, but I don’t like the feeling of being dependent on them. Honestly, I rarely take anything regularly. I prefer a cup of tea when I’m feeling unwell. Is that all you need to know? I'm getting rather tired now.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Durig. Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and a multivitamin. It’s good that you’re mindful of avoiding unnecessary medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. Though… my skin does get a bit itchy sometimes, especially in the winter. But I just assumed it was the dry air. My daughter says it might be something I’m allergic to, but I haven’t bothered with it. It’s just a minor irritation, really. Honestly, I’m not a very sensitive person. Is there anything else I need to tell you? I really must be going soon. My bridge game starts at two.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just some occasional itchy skin. That's good to know. Now, just a few quick questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or liver problems?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. That’s a difficult one, Doctor. My family… well, we weren’t very forthcoming with medical information, if I recall correctly. My mother… she died young, of something… but I don’t remember what. And my father… he had a weak heart, I think. But he didn’t talk about it much. As for my siblings… they all seem to be quite healthy, as far as I know. Honestly, I don’t have a very good grasp of my family’s medical background. It’s terribly frustrating. Is this… important? I really must be going soon. My bridge game… you know. Perhaps we're done?
DOCTOR: Okay, limited information on family history, which is perfectly alright. It’s common for that information to be difficult to obtain. Given what you’ve told me, Ms. Durig, the yellowing of the skin, the fatigue, loss of appetite, and history of possible liver concerns, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well, I suppose so. But please be gentle, Doctor. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And… I really mustn't be too long. My bridge game starts at two, you see. And I promised Martha I’d bring the cookies. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? Honestly, I don't do well with doctors poking and prodding. I'd prefer to just get a diagnosis and be done with it. But… if you think it’s necessary… alright. But please be quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll just be checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. I understand your concern about the bridge game and Martha's cookies, and I'll work as quickly as I can. Let's start by checking your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Oh… very well. But do be quick, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't much patience for this. And please, don't tighten it too much. My circulation isn’t what it used to be. I'm rather prone to bruising, you see. My daughter is always telling me to be careful. Just get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. Just relax, and take a few deep breaths. 150/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh… A bit… yes, there. Just a little. It's a dull ache, really. Not sharp, but… uncomfortable. It's been bothering me on and off for a few weeks now, I think. But I didn't think much of it. It comes and goes, you see. Is that… bad? Honestly, I don't like being touched. It makes me nervous. Perhaps we can skip the rest of it? I really must get going soon. My bridge game…
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Durig. That tenderness in your upper abdomen is noted. Given the tenderness, along with your fatigue, loss of appetite, and the yellowing of your skin, it's important to investigate this further. Based on what you've told me and my brief examination, I suspect there may be an issue with your liver or gallbladder. However, to get a definitive diagnosis, we'll need to order some blood tests to check your liver function and rule out other possibilities. We may also need an ultrasound of your abdomen. Would you be willing to have those tests done?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests. More tests? Honestly, it never ends with doctors, does it? My daughter will be thrilled. She’s always telling me to get checked out. Well… I suppose I have no choice, do I? If it will help determine what’s wrong… alright. Blood tests and an ultrasound. But please, Doctor, make it as quick as possible. And could you please explain the results to me in plain English? I don't understand all that medical jargon. And… can I still play bridge after the blood tests? I promised Martha…
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. We’ll get those tests ordered right away. You should be able to play bridge after the blood tests, yes. They’re just a simple draw of blood, and shouldn’t interfere with your game. As for the ultrasound, we can schedule that for tomorrow morning. I will absolutely explain the results to you in plain English. No medical jargon, I promise. We’ll go over everything together, step by step. I’m going to write you a referral for the blood tests and an order for the ultrasound. My nurse will review the instructions with you before you leave. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… well. I suppose… no. Not right now. I’m still rather overwhelmed. Tests, ultrasounds… it's all a bit much. Will it… will it be painful? Both the blood tests and the ultrasound? And… is it serious? My daughter will be beside herself if it’s something serious. Just… tell me plainly. No beating around the bush, please. And… when will I get the results? I need to know if I can still bring the cookies to Martha's bridge game. It's very important.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Durig. The blood tests will involve a small pinch, but it’s usually very quick and not very painful. The ultrasound is completely painless – it uses sound waves to create an image of your organs. You’ll lie on a table, and a technician will move a probe over your abdomen. As for whether it’s serious, it’s too early to say. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms, and then we can discuss treatment options. It could be something relatively minor, or it could be something more significant. We won’t know until we have the results. We typically get the blood test results back within 24-48 hours, and the ultrasound results within a few days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or jaundice, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… well. No, I suppose not. Thank you, Doctor. For… explaining everything. And for not making me feel like a foolish old woman. I really must be going now. My bridge game… and the cookies. Just… please hurry with the results. My daughter will be beside herself. And… tell your nurse to be gentle with the blood tests. My veins are rather fragile, you see. Goodbye, Doctor. And… thank you again.
