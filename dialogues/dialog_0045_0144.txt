DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Billman, is it? Hmm. Well, honestly, I'm not entirely sure. My daughter insisted I come. Said I should just…get checked out. She worries too much, that one. I feel fine, mostly. Just…old, I suppose. Is that something you check for?
DOCTOR: Well, “getting checked out” is a good start, even if you feel fine. And yes, we can certainly assess how things are functioning. “Old” isn’t a diagnosis, though. It's just a number. Let's start with why your daughter is concerned. Has she noticed anything specific?
PATIENT: Oh, she always notices something. Honestly, it's usually about my memory. Says I repeat myself. Or ask the same questions over and over. Which…well, maybe I do. It’s just…things slip my mind these days. It’s not like I’m forgetful forgetful, you understand. It’s more like…misplacing things. Like words. Or…what was I saying? Oh dear. See? This is exactly what she’s talking about. Honestly, she makes a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Right. So, concerns primarily revolve around memory…specifically, repetition and difficulty recalling things. And you feel this is more occasional than a consistent issue?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not constant. Not like I don't know my own name or anything. It's just... frustrating. I used to be so sharp. Worked in the operating room for forty years, you know. Forty years! You have to have a good memory for that. Now…well, sometimes the words just don't come. Or I’ll start a sentence and…poof. Gone. It's embarrassing, really. And my daughter makes such a fuss. Honestly, she treats me like a child.
DOCTOR: Forty years in the OR is impressive. It's understandable that you'd feel frustrated with any changes. Changes are difficult. We all experience some cognitive slowing as we get older. It’s perfectly normal. Now, aside from the memory concerns, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Slowing? Well, I suppose I am a bit slower getting around these days, but that’s my knees, not my brain. Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly capable. It's just…this whole thing is a waste of time, isn't it? My daughter just thinks I need to be…occupied. Keeps her mind off of her own problems, I suspect. No, I don’t have any other symptoms. Just a bit tired sometimes, but who isn't? And a little bit…out of sorts, I suppose. But that’s probably the weather. It’s been awfully humid lately.
DOCTOR: “Out of sorts” isn’t very specific, Ms. Calvery. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s hard to explain. Just…not myself, I suppose. A little…quieter. Less interested in things. I used to love my garden, spent hours out there. Now…I just don’t seem to have the energy. And I snap at my daughter more easily than I used to. She says I’m being…irritable. Honestly, she just doesn’t understand. It's not like I want to be difficult. It's just…things aren’t the same. And it's probably just because I'm lonely, now that your father's gone. Though I would never tell my daughter that, of course. She’d make a whole production out of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, we have some changes in mood – increased irritability, decreased interest in hobbies, and some feelings of loneliness. Along with the memory concerns, it sounds like there’s been a shift in your overall energy levels. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Sleep…well, it comes and goes. I wake up a lot during the night. Usually just to go to the bathroom, though. But sometimes I just…lay there. Thinking. And appetite…not much of one lately, to be honest. Everything just seems…bland. I used to love cooking, experimenting with new recipes. Now, I just don’t bother. It’s easier to just have a little something and be done with it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a fussy eater. Never have been. It's just…not appealing, I suppose. Everything seems like a chore these days. Even getting dressed in the morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, Ms. Calvery, have you experienced any changes in your vision, any difficulty with balance, or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Vision’s a little blurry sometimes, but I just figured it was my age. I have an appointment with the eye doctor next month, though. Balance…well, I’m a little unsteady on my feet, but again, that’s my knees. And weight loss…maybe a little? I haven’t weighed myself in ages, honestly. I don’t really pay attention to those things. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like you're looking for something that isn’t there. My daughter's just…overly cautious. That's all it is. She worries about everything. She always has. Now, can I go? I have a bridge club meeting this afternoon, and I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: We’re just going through the motions, Ms. Calvery. It’s standard procedure. Now, regarding your medications…are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And a vitamin D supplement, my daughter makes me take that. Says I don't get enough sunshine. And…sometimes I take something for my knees, when they're really bothering me. Ibuprofen, I think it is? Honestly, I can't remember all the names. My daughter keeps track of everything. She has a list somewhere, I'm sure. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit overwhelming. Can't she just tell you? I'm sure she's already told you everything. She always does. She’s very thorough. Now, are we almost done? This chair isn’t very comfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. Let's try something. I’m going to do a very brief cognitive assessment, just a few simple questions and tasks. It will help me get a better understanding of your current mental function. It won't take long. And then we can discuss a plan. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A test? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure I like the sound of that. I already told you, I feel perfectly fine. I don’t need to be…tested. I used to give tests, you know. I was a surgical technician for forty years! I’m perfectly capable of remembering things. Honestly, this is all a bit…patronizing. But…fine. If it will get my daughter off my back, I suppose. Just…make it quick. And don’t ask me anything too complicated. I’m not as sharp as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll start with something simple. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s…date? Oh dear. Let me think. It’s…August, isn’t it? Yes, August. But what day…? Oh, goodness. Is it the first? No…my daughter mentioned something…the second? Or maybe the third? Honestly, I’m terrible with dates. Always have been. Is it important? I know what year it is. It's…twenty twenty-five, of course. But the day…? Oh dear. This is embarrassing. I really should write these things down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Next question. Can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? What three words? You haven’t told me any words yet. Honestly, Doctor, this is a bit confusing. Are you going to tell me the words, or just expect me to…guess? I need a little help here. I’m not a mind reader, you know. My daughter is always telling me to concentrate. Maybe I should have brought my glasses. Or…or maybe I just need a cup of tea. This is awfully stressful.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Calvery. Let me rephrase. I will say three words, and you will repeat them back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes. I think so. But please, don't make them too difficult. And speak clearly. My hearing isn't what it used to be. Go ahead. I’m listening.
DOCTOR: Apple… Table… Penny. Now, can you repeat those words for me?
PATIENT: Apple… hmm… table… and… Oh dear. That last one…it’s on the tip of my tongue. It was something small…shiny… Was it…button? No…that’s not right. It’s… a name? A place? Honestly, it’s gone. I’m terrible at remembering things. Apple…table… and… something. I just can’t seem to grasp it. Oh, dear. This is awful. My daughter is going to be so disappointed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. It appears we have some concerns regarding short-term memory. I'm going to recommend a comprehensive neurological evaluation, and some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to these changes. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A neurological evaluation? Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, are you sure all this is necessary? I told you, I feel perfectly fine! I just have a little trouble remembering things sometimes. It’s called getting old! I don’t need to be poked and prodded and have my blood drawn. My daughter is going to be thrilled. She always wants me to get more tests. Honestly, it’s a waste of time and money. But…fine. If you insist. But don’t expect any miracles. And can we please hurry this along? I have a bridge club meeting, you know. And I don’t want to be late. Now, what do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. I will write you a referral for a neurological consultation with Dr. Lee at City General. She’s excellent. The order for the blood work will be sent to the lab downstairs. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. It's a fairly standard panel to assess your overall health and rule out any deficiencies. I’ll also have my nurse go over some safety precautions with you, as these changes can affect daily living. It's always better to be cautious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Safety precautions? Daily living? Honestly, Doctor, are you implying I’m incompetent? I’ve been taking care of myself for sixty-four years! I can still cook, clean, and drive perfectly fine. But…fine. If it will appease my daughter, I’ll let your nurse talk to me. But don’t expect me to change my entire life based on a few forgotten words. And please, tell Dr. Lee not to waste my time with unnecessary tests. Now, can I finally go? I really need to get going. This has been…quite an ordeal. Honestly, I'm starting to feel rather faint. A cup of tea, that's what I need. Now, where did I park the car…? Oh dear. This is just dreadful.
