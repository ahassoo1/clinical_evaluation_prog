DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It just…doesn't smell like me anymore, you know? It's been going on for a few weeks now, maybe a month.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's perfectly alright to discuss these things, and you're not alone – changes in body odor can be quite concerning. A month is a reasonable timeframe to investigate. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the change in odor a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It’s hard to explain… It’s not worse, exactly. Just…different. Sweeter, I think? And maybe a little bit…sour? It’s not like I’ve changed anything – same soap, same deodorant, same clothes. It’s just…not my usual smell. I usually don’t smell at all, really, unless I’ve been working hard. And even then, it’s just a normal, sweaty smell. This is…other.
DOCTOR: Okay, "sweeter" and "a little bit sour," that’s helpful. And you’re right, the fact that it’s a change from your normal is important. You also mentioned you haven’t changed anything in your routine – that’s good to know. Now, have you noticed this odor consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty consistent, actually. It’s there every day, as long as I’m not freshly showered. Even after a light bit of work, I notice it. It doesn't seem to get worse with more activity, just…stays the same level of different. I’ve even asked my daughter if she noticed anything, and she said she did, too. She didn't know what it was, just said I smelled…different.
DOCTOR: Alright, consistent and noticed by someone else – that adds a little more weight to it. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Have you experienced any other changes recently – like changes in your weight, appetite, energy levels, or any new medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… My weight has been pretty stable, thankfully. Appetite’s normal, I guess. Maybe a little less energy lately, but honestly, who has lots of energy these days? I work pretty hard laying floors, you know. No new medical conditions, not that I’m aware of. I have Medicare, so I get checked up pretty regularly. They haven't said anything about anything new. I did have a little bit of a cold a few months back, but that’s gone now.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the weight and appetite. And a recent cold wouldn’t necessarily be related, but it’s good to know. Now, I'm going to ask some questions about your medical history, just to get a complete picture. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, kidney problems, or liver problems?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I do have a little bit of arthritis in my knees from all the floor laying, but that’s been managed with some over-the-counter pain relievers. Nothing serious. The doctors have checked my blood sugar a few times during my Medicare checkups, and it’s always been fine. I’ve never had any problems with my kidneys or liver, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very reassuring. And good that your blood sugar has been consistently normal. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a few days when I gave birth to my daughter, but that was… well, a long time ago, too! Nothing since then, not that I can remember. No other surgeries or hospital stays. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just the over-the-counter pain relievers for my knees – ibuprofen, sometimes naproxen. And I take a multivitamin every day, just a basic one. Nothing else. I really try to avoid taking a lot of pills, if I can help it. I don't like how they make me feel.
DOCTOR: Alright, just ibuprofen, naproxen as needed, and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. Same with medications. I’ve taken ibuprofen plenty of times for my knees, and never had any problems. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Never had a rash, never had trouble breathing, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or close relatives – with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, and she was diabetic towards the end of her life. My father was pretty healthy, as far as I know. He passed away a long time ago. I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ medical history. They lived in Ethiopia, and we didn’t have a lot of contact. My sister is healthy, as far as I know, but we don’t talk a lot. I think she’s doing okay. Mostly, my family is just…normal, I guess. No really serious health problems that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure and diabetes in your mother. That's helpful to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. Don’t drink alcohol, either. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a pretty simple woman, Doctor. I work hard, I take care of my daughter, and I try to stay healthy. That’s about it. No bad habits, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. Alright, Kerriann, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general appearance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? It’s just…strange, this smell.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142/90, but that can be common with a little anxiety in a medical setting. Your heart sounds normal, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, let me take a look at your overall appearance. I’m just looking for any obvious signs that might explain the change in odor. Your skin looks normal, no rashes or lesions. Your nails are healthy. I don't notice anything immediately concerning. It's difficult to pinpoint the cause of the odor just with a physical exam. It could be something minor, but given the consistency and that your daughter noticed it, it’s worth investigating further. I think it would be best to run some blood tests to get a better picture of your overall health. We'll check your blood sugar, kidney function, liver function, and a complete blood count. We might also want to check your thyroid levels, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause changes in body odor. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests sound… reasonable. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? I'm not really worried, I guess, but it's just unsettling to smell…different. So, blood tests it is. I hope they don't take too long. I have to get back to work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll get the tests done as quickly as possible. The lab usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if you notice any other symptoms – like weight loss, fatigue, or changes in your skin – please don’t hesitate to call the office. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood, and we’ll get the orders sent to the lab. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered all my questions. Just…thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's a little silly to worry about a smell, but… I'm glad I came in. I'll let the nurse know I'm ready when she is.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. It’s never silly to address your health concerns. That’s what I’m here for. And you're right to get it checked out. It’s always better to be safe. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. She’ll come in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor.
