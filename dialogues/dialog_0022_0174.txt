DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. A bit down, you see. It’s… difficult to explain. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I just want to get back to feeling like myself again, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, I understand. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things, so thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing some changes in your mood. Could you tell me a little more about what "not feeling yourself" means?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… a lack of enjoyment, I suppose. Things I used to love – gardening, seeing my grandchildren, even a good film – don’t bring me the same pleasure. I find myself… tired, mostly. Not physically, although I am getting on in years, you understand. Just… emotionally drained. And I’ve been sleeping… too much, perhaps? Or maybe not enough. It’s all a bit muddled, to be honest. I apologize for being vague.
DOCTOR: No apologies at all, Ms. Derasmo. It is often muddled when you're dealing with something like this. It's helpful that you're noticing these changes. So, a loss of enjoyment in things you usually love, feeling emotionally drained, and some changes in your sleep. Has this been happening for a specific amount of time – a few weeks, a month, longer?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… at least a couple of months now. Perhaps three? It started gradually, just a little less enthusiasm for things, and then it just… grew. I thought it was just getting old, you understand? A bit of sadness is to be expected. But it hasn’t lifted. It just… lingers. It's rather unpleasant, truthfully. I just want to feel… lighter.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it’s good you’re recognizing that this isn’t just “getting old” and that it’s impacting your quality of life. Three months is a significant amount of time. To get a better picture, have you noticed any other changes alongside this – perhaps in your appetite, your weight, your concentration, or your energy levels throughout the day?
PATIENT: Yes, now that you mention it… my appetite hasn’t been the best. I don’t really feel hungry. I’ve lost a little weight, I suppose, although I haven’t weighed myself recently. And concentrating… that's become difficult. I used to love reading, but I find my mind wanders after a few pages. It’s all rather frustrating. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like a shadow of my former self. A very tired shadow. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: It's certainly not ideal, Ms. Derasmo, but it's not uncommon to experience these kinds of symptoms. It sounds like we're building a clearer picture here. Loss of appetite, weight loss, difficulty concentrating, along with the low mood, fatigue and loss of enjoyment. To help me understand your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious. As I got older… I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. And I had a hip replacement five years ago, but that’s healed well. I've been managing my blood pressure with medication for the last ten years – it fluctuates a bit. Apart from that… nothing major. I go for regular check-ups with my GP. Do you need to know about… allergies? I don’t have any that I’m aware of. I'm probably forgetting something… old age, you see! Is this sufficient?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Derasmo. No, you're not forgetting anything critical. So, gallbladder removal 20 years ago, hip replacement 5 years ago, and managing your blood pressure for 10 years. No known allergies. To clarify, what medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it right here. It’s… Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I also take a small dose of Hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 milligrams, also once a day. My GP adjusted the dosage a few times over the years. I’ve been quite diligent about taking them regularly. I believe I’m taking them as prescribed. Honestly, Doctor, I try to be a good patient. It’s just… this feeling is so persistent. It's making it difficult to even enjoy being diligent!
DOCTOR: That's good to know, thank you. Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide, both once daily. It sounds like you're very conscientious about your health, and that's excellent. Now, thinking about your family… have any of your close family members – parents, siblings, children – experienced anything similar to what you're going through – perhaps depression, anxiety, or significant mood changes?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she was always a worrier. Very anxious, prone to bouts of sadness. But she never sought help, you understand? It was just… her nature. My sister, on the other hand, is the strong, practical type. Never seemed bothered by anything. My children… well, they both lead very busy lives. I don’t really know what goes on in their heads, if I’m being honest. They seem fine. I suppose it’s possible… my eldest son, he went through a difficult divorce a few years ago. He seemed… withdrawn for a while, but he didn’t talk about it much. It’s difficult to say, really. We’re not a family that shares feelings openly, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Derasmo. It sounds like there may be some history of anxiety in the family, and potentially some emotional difficulties with your son, though not openly discussed. That's helpful information. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Could you tell me a little bit about your social life?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My social life… It’s diminished, I’m afraid. Since my divorce, I haven’t really… reconnected. I used to enjoy going to church, but I haven’t been regularly in a while. I have a few friends I see occasionally for tea, but it’s not the same. Mostly, I keep to myself. My grandchildren are a delight, of course, but they live quite far away. I speak to them on the phone, but it’s not the same as having them around. Honestly, Doctor, I feel rather… isolated. And that feeling… it just exacerbates this… sadness. I'm ready for this to be over, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've experienced some significant changes in your life, and a degree of social isolation. That can definitely contribute to how you're feeling. Okay, Ms. Derasmo, if you're comfortable, I’d like to just do a brief physical exam – check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Just to rule out any other medical causes for how you're feeling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I suppose I should expect that. Get it over with, you see. The sooner we know, the better. Please, do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to take your blood pressure first. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so, considering you're already on medication. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra noises. Your lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. No significant findings there. Now, just a quick neurological check – I'm just going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes.
PATIENT: There… and there… It’s a little… blurry, if I’m being honest. I haven’t had my glasses adjusted lately. But yes, I can see it. Is that alright? Am I doing it correctly?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. A little blurry is good to know - it might explain some difficulty with concentration. It doesn't seem to be anything concerning neurologically. Okay, Ms. Derasmo, that’s all I need for the physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits, given your medical history. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms of depression. I want to be clear – this is a common condition, and it's very treatable. It’s not a sign of weakness, and you shouldn't feel ashamed. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes a great deal of sense, Doctor. Honestly, I’ve suspected as much. It’s just… admitting it. And knowing what to do about it. It’s a weight lifted, to be frank. A small weight, perhaps, but a weight nonetheless. So… what now? What do we do? I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to feel… myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Ms. Derasmo. And I'm glad you feel a little relieved. There are several options we can consider. We could start with lifestyle modifications – things like regular exercise, a healthy diet, and ensuring you have a good support system. We could also explore talk therapy – counseling or psychotherapy – to help you process your feelings and develop coping strategies. And finally, there are medications – antidepressants – that can help regulate your mood. Often, a combination of these approaches is the most effective. I think, given your symptoms and the duration, starting with an antidepressant medication, along with encouraging you to explore some social activities – perhaps reconnecting with your church group or joining a local club – would be a good first step. We can discuss the different medication options – their benefits, side effects, and potential interactions – and choose one that’s right for you. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Medication… I’m not particularly keen on taking more pills, if I’m being honest. But… if you think it's necessary. And if it will help. Perhaps we could start with the… lifestyle modifications first? Reconnect with the church group… that sounds… manageable. And then, if that’s not enough, we can revisit the medication. I’m a little wary, you see. I’ve heard stories… side effects and such. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Let’s try the lifestyle changes first. And then… we’ll see. Is that acceptable? Perhaps you could suggest some… resources? Clubs or groups for someone my age?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Derasmo. That’s a very reasonable approach. We can certainly start with lifestyle modifications and see how you respond. It’s always best to try the least invasive options first. I have a list of local resources here – several senior centers, church groups, and clubs that offer a variety of activities. There's a gardening club that meets weekly at the community center – that might be a good fit, given your enjoyment of gardening. And the senior center offers several exercise classes specifically designed for older adults. I also want to emphasize that I’m here to support you every step of the way. We can discuss your progress at your next appointment, and adjust the plan as needed. We can also talk about any concerns you have about medication – the benefits, side effects, and potential interactions. I'm going to write a prescription for a blood test, just to rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms – things like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. And I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for four weeks from today, to see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good, Doctor. Thank you. A gardening club… that does sound appealing. And the blood test… sensible, very sensible. Four weeks… that gives me time to… adjust. To try the gardening club and see how I feel. I appreciate your patience, Doctor. And your… understanding. It’s a relief to finally be addressing this. I just want to feel… normal again. Is there anything… anything I should be doing? Apart from the gardening club, you see. Anything to prepare for the next appointment? Anything to… focus on?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Derasmo. Apart from trying the gardening club, I would encourage you to keep a daily journal – just jot down your thoughts and feelings, even if it's just a few sentences. It can be helpful to track your mood, energy levels, and any triggers that seem to worsen your symptoms. Also, try to prioritize self-care – things that bring you joy and relaxation. And most importantly, don’t hesitate to reach out to friends or family if you're struggling. For the next appointment, just come prepared to discuss your progress – how you’re feeling, any challenges you’ve faced, and any questions or concerns you have. We can review your journal together, and adjust the plan as needed. I'm also going to give you a handout on depression – it includes information about the condition, treatment options, and resources for support. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough. And very… kind. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I suppose… it's a little overwhelming, to be honest. All this information. But I feel… hopeful. For the first time in a long time. Thank you, Doctor Tosca. Sincerely. I believe that will be all. I look forward to our next appointment. Perhaps I’ll have a blooming garden to show you then.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Derasmo. I’m glad you’re feeling hopeful. And I look forward to hearing about your garden! Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before our next appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you in four weeks.
