DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Petrimoulx. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. I've been experiencing a rather persistent pressure in my bladder, and it’s become quite bothersome. It’s the main reason for my visit today.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent bladder pressure. I understand. That does sound bothersome. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it doesn't necessarily hurt, it’s more of a… fullness, like I need to go to the bathroom even when I haven't had much to drink. It happens throughout the day, but seems a bit worse in the evenings, if that makes sense. And it’s been going on for about three weeks now, I believe. I’ve been trying to keep track.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, and worse in the evenings… that's helpful information. And no pain, just the sensation of needing to go. Do you find yourself going more often than usual, or is it just the feeling that you need to go, even when you haven’t?
PATIENT: It's definitely the feeling, Doctor. I wouldn't say I'm going to the bathroom significantly more often, though I might be just to be sure. It’s more that the urge feels… constant, or nearly so. I find myself thinking about it quite a bit, which is a little disruptive. It's hard to explain exactly. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Marialena. Constant, or near-constant, urge… that’s good to know. And it’s understandably disruptive if you're constantly thinking about it. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think... No, not that I’ve noticed. The color seems normal, and I haven’t seen any blood. Stream-wise, it’s been pretty consistent – no difficulty starting or stopping, and the force is normal as well. I try to pay attention to these things when I’m… well, when I’m going to the bathroom, and nothing seems different there.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in the urine color or stream itself, which is good. And you've been attentive to those details. Now, let’s broaden the picture a little bit. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower back pain along with this bladder pressure?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, thankfully. And no lower back pain either. I did have a slight ache in my abdomen a couple of times, but it was very mild and went away quickly. It didn’t feel related to the bladder pressure specifically, more like… indigestion, perhaps. I haven't had that ache in several days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild abdominal ache that has resolved. Let’s talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. I have Medicare, so I've had regular check-ups, but everything has always been normal. I am married, and my husband keeps telling me I worry too much! He thinks I'm being overly cautious about this whole thing. But it is persistent, and it's unsettling.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you've had regular check-ups and they’ve been normal. And it's understandable to be unsettled by something persistent, even if it hasn't been definitively diagnosed. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries at all, Doctor. Nothing like that. I've been very lucky, I suppose, in terms of avoiding major medical issues. I do take a daily vitamin, that’s about it. And I try to drink plenty of water, as you probably tell everyone. I’m not sure if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you haven’t had any surgeries and only take a daily vitamin. And staying hydrated is important, so good on you for that! Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—anything with the bladder or kidneys, or perhaps diabetes?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think... My mother had high blood pressure, and my grandfather had diabetes, but nothing specifically with the bladder or kidneys that I know of. My siblings are both healthy as well, as far as I know. We don't have a very extensive family history readily available, if that makes sense. We're not very good about keeping track of those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother and diabetes in your grandfather. That’s helpful. And now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. My husband used to smoke, but he quit several years ago. He's very proud of that accomplishment! I wouldn’t allow it in the house, anyway. I’m very health-conscious, so I try to avoid things like that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally – perhaps two or three times a week, at most. It's usually just a small glass, nothing excessive. And my husband will have a beer with his dinner sometimes as well. We enjoy a good meal, and sometimes that includes a little wine or beer. But we don't drink heavily.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine, not heavy drinking. That's good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication or food that I’m aware of. I’m quite fortunate, honestly. I don’t even have seasonal allergies, which is rare for someone who lives where I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. That's excellent. So, to summarize, you’ve been experiencing a persistent sensation of bladder pressure for about three weeks, worse in the evenings. It’s not painful, just a constant urge. No fever, chills, back pain, or changes in your urine. You've had regular checkups, no surgeries, no significant family history, and no allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and do a gentle pelvic exam to rule out any obvious issues. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I appreciate you being so thorough. A physical exam sounds reasonable. I understand you need to rule things out, and I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marialena. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll start here. Your bowel sounds are normal, and I don't hear anything concerning. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. I will let you know if I feel anything unusual. No tenderness to palpation. Everything feels normal there. Now, I’m going to perform a quick pelvic exam. I will explain everything as I go. This will involve a visual exam and a gentle internal exam. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort at any time. Okay, the pelvic exam was normal as well. I didn’t feel any masses or abnormalities. The external and internal genitalia appear normal. Everything appears normal physically, which is good. However, because your symptoms have persisted for three weeks, I think it would be prudent to order a urinalysis and a urine culture to rule out a urinary tract infection. I also want to check your post-void residual – that's a measurement of how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. That can help determine if you are completely emptying your bladder. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable indeed. If everything appears normal physically, checking for an infection and ensuring my bladder is emptying completely makes perfect sense. I’m glad you're being so thorough. A urinalysis and the post-void residual test sound good to me. What’s involved with the post-void residual test? Is it uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It's a very simple test, Marialena. After you urinate, you’ll use a small, handheld ultrasound device – it's non-invasive. I simply place it on your lower abdomen, and it measures the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It doesn’t involve any needles or internal instruments. It's completely painless and takes just a few seconds. The lab will need a urine sample for the urinalysis and culture. I’ll give you a sterile cup and instructions. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means you start urinating, then collect the sample mid-flow. This helps to reduce contamination. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and determine the next steps. If the tests are negative, we may consider other possibilities, such as overactive bladder or interstitial cystitis. But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. Let’s get these tests done first. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. A simple ultrasound and a mid-stream urine sample are easily manageable. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly and not jumping to conclusions. I'm happy to proceed with the tests. Please just let me know when you need me to collect the sample, and I’ll do my best to follow your instructions. Thank you for your time and attention so far. I feel much better knowing we're taking a methodical approach to this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. I'm glad I could reassure you. I’ll have the lab technician bring you the cup and instructions for the urine sample. You can collect it in the restroom right down the hall. Once you've collected it, just hand it to the technician, and they'll send it to the lab. It should be back within a few business days. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or lower back pain, please contact the clinic immediately. I’ll have the results sent to my office, and I’ll contact you as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe I have any further questions at this time. You've answered everything I was concerned about, and you've outlined the next steps very clearly. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and your kind manner. Thank you again for everything. I will wait here until the lab technician arrives, then I will proceed with the sample collection. Have a lovely day, Doctor Petrimoulx.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. And you have a lovely day as well.
