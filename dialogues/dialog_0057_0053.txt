DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. My name is Letitia Sieh, and I’m one of the family medicine doctors here. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Sieh. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my… urination. I’ve been having trouble with it lately. It just… takes effort, you know? It’s not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with urination. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it feels like… I have to push, a little. And sometimes it starts and stops. Not a strong stream, if you know what I mean. It's been going on for maybe… three weeks now? I don't really keep track of dates, but around three weeks, I think. It’s definitely not getting better on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks of difficulty starting, stopping, and a weaker stream. And it's not improving. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning either. That’s why I waited a bit to come in, to be honest. If it hurt, I’d have been here right away. It’s just… inconvenient, and a little worrying, because it’s not normal for me.
DOCTOR: I understand. No pain or burning is good. Has the amount of urine you're passing changed at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, no. I still go about the same amount, it just… takes longer to get it all out, you know? And like I said, it’s not as strong a stream as it used to be. I haven't been getting up more often at night, if that’s what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the volume feels the same, no increase in nighttime urination, but it takes longer and feels weaker. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no blood. I always check, you know, just to be sure. Everything looks normal in that regard. It’s just this… effort. And I’m a little tired, now that I think about it. Maybe because I’m concentrating so much on getting it going?
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood in the urine. And you’ve noticed some fatigue as well. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We'll listen to your abdomen, and I’d like to do a gentle abdominal exam, and a quick neurological check, just to get a better picture of what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle, please. My back isn’t what it used to be, from all those years at the post office.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be very gentle. Alright, Kandy, just relax and take deep breaths. I’m listening to your abdomen now, and everything sounds normal. I'm gently pressing on your abdomen now, just checking for any areas of discomfort. Do you feel any pain or tenderness anywhere specifically?
PATIENT: No, that’s… no pain there. It feels a little strange, because I haven’t had anyone poke around in there for years, but not painful. Maybe a little pressure when you push right… there, on the lower side, but not really pain. It’s hard to explain. Just… awareness, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little awareness of pressure on the lower abdomen. That’s good information. Now I’m just going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs and feet. This will help me rule out any nerve issues that could be contributing to this. Just relax your legs for me, and I’ll tap a few spots.
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. I used to be quite nimble on my feet, delivering the mail, but things slow down, you know? Arthritis, mostly. Hopefully it hasn't affected everything. Tap away, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, which is not unexpected given your history of arthritis. Sensation seems intact. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. The difficulty with urination, the weaker stream, and the awareness of pressure, along with your age, could point to a few different possibilities, including an enlarged prostate – although women don’t have a prostate, it helps to rule things out – or a bladder issue. I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a post-void residual volume test. That will tell us how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. We might also need to consider a bladder ultrasound if the residual volume is high. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… complicated. An ultrasound? I’ve never had an ultrasound before. But… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to get this sorted out. An infection sounds… unpleasant. Is the residual volume test… painful? Will it involve needles? I’m not a fan of needles, you see.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound complicated, but I understand your concern. An ultrasound is a painless test – a technician will use a gel on your lower abdomen and a handheld device to create an image of your bladder. As for the residual volume test, it’s not painful. We'll have you urinate as normally as possible, and then a small catheter will be inserted into your bladder to measure the remaining urine. It's a quick procedure, and most people don't feel much discomfort. We use a very small, flexible catheter. I’ll write the orders for the urinalysis and the residual volume test. The nurse will come in shortly and explain where to go for those tests. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Just the arthritis, which I mentioned. And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago now. That’s it, I think. Nothing else bothers me much, aside from the usual aches and pains of getting older. And thank you for explaining about the tests. That makes me feel a little better, knowing what to expect. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, arthritis, and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. Good to know. And you're very welcome, I’m happy to explain everything as clearly as possible. Alright, the orders are sent to the lab. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule those tests and provide you with the necessary paperwork. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a handout about urinary frequency and urgency, just to provide some general information. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor. Just… get this sorted out, please? It’s a little unsettling, this whole thing. Thank you again for your time and patience. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something about it. Hopefully it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Kandy. We’ll get this investigated thoroughly. It’s perfectly normal to feel unsettled when something changes with your body, and we’ll work through this together. We will review the results as soon as they are available, and discuss the best course of action. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly. .
