DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Chilla. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, my husband, he insists I come. He's been reading about these… plans one makes for when one is, shall we say, incapable. Something about making sure my wishes are known. He calls it an “Advance Directive” or a “POLST” form. Honestly, it all sounds rather… dramatic. But he’s quite insistent, and I prefer to avoid unpleasantness. So, here I am.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It’s very responsible of your husband to be thinking ahead, and it’s good of you to come in. Those forms – Advance Directives and POLSTs – are about planning for future healthcare decisions, just in case you're unable to speak for yourself. It can feel a bit daunting, but it's really about ensuring your voice is heard, even then. Before we dive into those forms specifically, though, I like to get a good overall picture of your health. Just to make sure we're starting from a solid base. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I find all this rather unnecessary. I assure you, my health is perfectly… adequate. I maintain a reasonable lifestyle. But, if you must, I suppose a brief overview won’t cause any harm. Though I fail to see how my preference for mint tea will dictate medical decisions. Do get on with it, please. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. We'll keep it concise. Let’s start with the basics. Any significant medical problems you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well, when I was quite young, I had a rather unpleasant bout of tonsillitis. Required surgery, you know. But that was… decades ago. Aside from that, nothing of consequence. I’ve always been… robust. Though I did sprain my ankle once, attempting a more energetic dance at a wedding. But a bit of rest and it was fine. Really, Doctor, I'm not a fragile creature.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, decades ago, and a sprained ankle. Good to know. Any other surgeries at all?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I have always been quite careful about… interventions. All this poking and prodding, I find it rather barbaric. My mother always said, “Let the body heal itself.” And it usually does, perfectly well. I haven't needed anyone's assistance to… cut me open. It's quite uncivilized, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my husband, of course. He's… quite attentive. We have two grown children, both married with… children of their own. They live quite far away, in France. They are… busy people. They call occasionally. My mother, bless her soul, passed away several years ago. She lived a very long life, very healthy. Always insisted on fresh air and proper posture. It's a shame more people don’t follow her example. As for illnesses… my uncle had something with his heart, I believe. A long time ago. But otherwise, we’re a fairly robust family.
DOCTOR: Husband is attentive, two adult children living in France, mother passed away at a good age, uncle with heart issues. Now, thinking about your daily life, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I find the question rather… presumptuous. I am very discerning about what I consume. I have never knowingly had an allergic reaction to anything. Perhaps a slight discomfort after eating particularly rich pastries, but that is merely a matter of moderation, not an allergy. I certainly don't go around ingesting random substances, hoping for the best. It’s simply… not done. And no, I do not have any allergies to medications. I rarely take anything, thankfully. A bit of chamomile tea when I’m feeling… unsettled. That is all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And currently, are you taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Doctor, must you pry? As I just explained, I rarely take anything. A bit of chamomile tea, perhaps, when I am feeling… overwrought. My husband occasionally suggests a multivitamin, but I find them quite unnecessary. I maintain a perfectly balanced diet. I assure you, I do not rely on artificial concoctions to sustain my well-being. I find the entire concept rather… undignified. Now, are we approaching the topic of these… forms, or shall we continue cataloging my perfectly healthy habits?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. We can move on to the Advance Directive and POLST forms. But before we do, just to be thorough, can you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Really, Doctor. What an impertinent question. I live. I maintain a respectable home, I enjoy reading, I occasionally attend social gatherings… I travel when I can. I am a cultured woman. I do not spend my days engaging in… questionable activities. It’s a rather simple, yet elegant existence. I’ve never smoked, I drink wine—in moderation, naturally—and I try to take a walk most days. Is that satisfactory? Do you require a detailed itinerary of my weekly schedule? I find the entire line of questioning rather… intrusive. Now, let's get to these forms, before I expire from boredom.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. You've been very clear. No smoking, moderate wine consumption, regular walks. Let's talk about these forms, then. The Advance Directive lets you write down what kind of medical care you want if you can't speak for yourself. Things like whether you want life-sustaining treatments. And the POLST form is a medical order, a specific set of instructions for your healthcare team. Do you have any initial thoughts or concerns about either one?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it all sounds rather… morbid. The idea of pre-determining my fate, of dictating terms from beyond the veil of consciousness… it’s simply appalling. I believe in trusting the medical professionals to use their best judgement. I have faith in their expertise. I do not need to… micromanage my potential demise. But my husband… he insists. He claims it’s about “peace of mind”. Honestly, I suspect he simply enjoys being in control. But if you must force me to contemplate such unpleasantness, perhaps you could explain this “life-sustaining treatments” in more detail. What exactly does that entail? And who decides what constitutes “sustaining”? It all sounds rather vague and unsettling.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Ms. Chilla. It is a difficult topic, and it’s good you’re thinking critically about it. “Life-sustaining treatments” can include things like being put on a ventilator if you’re having trouble breathing, getting CPR if your heart stops, or receiving artificial nutrition and hydration if you can’t eat or drink. As for who decides, that’s where the Advance Directive comes in. You get to write down what you want, what you don’t want, and who you want to make decisions for you if you’re unable to. It’s not about micromanaging, it’s about making sure your wishes are respected. It sounds like your husband is concerned about ensuring those wishes are known. We can talk through scenarios, and I can help you understand the options. There’s no pressure to make any decisions right now. Would you like to start by discussing what would happen if you were seriously ill and unable to breathe on your own?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, simply contemplating such a scenario is rather… distressing. But if you insist, I suppose I can humor you. I suppose… if I were unable to breathe on my own, I would not want to be… prolonged indefinitely. I have lived a full life. I do not wish to be kept alive by machines, a mere… shell of my former self. But I also do not wish to be… abandoned. I would want to be comfortable, and I would want my family nearby. And I would certainly not want to be subjected to… experimental procedures. Is that clear enough? Honestly, it’s all rather… bleak. And it makes me quite… uncomfortable. Perhaps a glass of water would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. That’s very helpful, thank you. So, you wouldn’t want to be kept alive by machines indefinitely, you want to be comfortable, and you want your family nearby. And no experimental procedures. Now, let's talk about CPR. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation – that’s when we try to restart your heart if it stops beating. It can involve chest compressions and sometimes electric shock. It’s a very… aggressive intervention, and it’s not always successful. Some people don't want it, because it can be painful and it doesn’t always work. What are your thoughts on CPR?
PATIENT: Electric shock? Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. The very thought is… barbaric. I have seen enough of hospitals to know that such interventions are rarely… gentle. I certainly do not wish to be jolted back to life, only to be subjected to further… indignities. If my time has come, let it come. I do not wish to be… resuscitated. It seems rather… undignified. Though my husband may have a different opinion. He has a rather… morbid fascination with medical dramas. Honestly, the entire process sounds rather… terrifying. Perhaps we should discuss the… comfort measures first. What exactly does that entail? I would want to be assured of… peace and tranquility, should the inevitable occur. And minimal… poking and prodding, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. No CPR, you want peace and tranquility, and minimal intervention. “Comfort measures” – also known as palliative care – focuses on relieving pain and other symptoms, and providing emotional and spiritual support. It doesn’t mean giving up, it means focusing on your quality of life. We would work with you to manage any pain, shortness of breath, or anxiety. We can also involve a chaplain or social worker if you’d like. It’s important to remember this isn't about deciding when you die, it’s about making sure your final days are as comfortable and meaningful as possible. We've covered a lot today. Would you like me to summarize everything and perhaps prepare some forms for you to review with your husband?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… overwhelming. But if you insist on forcing me to contemplate my own mortality, I suppose a summary would be helpful. And yes, preparing some forms for my husband to review… he will no doubt have a… detailed opinion on every clause. Though I remain skeptical of the entire process. I still believe in trusting the medical professionals to use their best judgement. But if these forms offer some measure of… peace of mind to my husband, then I suppose I can humor him. Just… please, keep it concise. And avoid any mention of electric shock. Honestly, the very thought is… unsettling. And perhaps, a glass of water before we proceed? This entire conversation has left me quite… parched.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Chilla. A glass of water is on its way. And I will certainly keep it concise, and avoid any mention of electric shock. Here’s a summary: You do not want to be kept alive by machines indefinitely, you want to be comfortable and have your family nearby, and you do not want CPR. You would like a focus on palliative care, with minimal intervention. I’m preparing some Advance Directive forms that address these wishes. We can also discuss a POLST form, which is a medical order for your healthcare team. But let’s focus on the Advance Directive for now. After you and your husband review it, we can schedule another appointment to discuss it further. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Focusing on the Advance Directive for now is… prudent. And scheduling another appointment allows my husband ample time to… scrutinize every detail. Honestly, the entire process is rather… exhausting. But if these forms offer some measure of… reassurance to him, then I suppose it’s worth the effort. And perhaps, a brief explanation of the POLST form at a later date? Though I remain skeptical of the entire concept. Honestly, I find the entire medical world rather… overwhelming. But thank you, Doctor, for your patience. And please, let me know when these forms are ready. And perhaps, another glass of water? This entire conversation has left me quite… depleted.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Chilla. I’ll have the forms ready for you by the end of the week. And yes, we can discuss the POLST form at our next appointment. It’s a medical order, so there’s no rush. Let me get you that water. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before our next appointment. I understand this is overwhelming, and I’m here to help in any way I can. .
PATIENT: .
