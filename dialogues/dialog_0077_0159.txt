DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. It’s good to meet you too. Uh, well, it’s kinda weird, to be honest. I’m just… having a hard time getting up out of chairs. Like, it feels like I need a winch sometimes. Not all the time, but often enough it’s a problem. Mostly after I’ve been sitting for a bit.
DOCTOR: I see. A difficulty rising from chairs… and it’s more noticeable after periods of sitting, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Like, if I’m out working, moving around all day, no problem. But if I sit down for lunch, or… well, sometimes even just relaxing in the evening… then it’s a struggle. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… hard. Like my legs are glued down or somethin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Fratoni?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It started… maybe six months ago? It was just now and then at first, I didn’t think much of it. Figured I just slept wrong or somethin’. But it’s been gettin’ worse the last couple of months, definitely. It’s startin’ to worry me a little bit. Especially with the work I do.
DOCTOR: Six months, gradually worsening… I understand your concern. Now, besides the difficulty rising, have you noticed any other symptoms associated with this?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. My legs feel normal when I’m walkin’ around. No numbness, no tingling, no pain like I said. Just… that stuck feeling when I go to stand up. Sometimes my knees feel a little creaky, but I figured that’s just from the work. I’ve been doin’ that kind of labor since I was a kid, so… I dunno if that counts.
DOCTOR: No numbness, tingling, or pain… creaky knees, possibly related to your occupation. And what kind of work do you do, Mr. Fratoni, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: I work on the rigs, mostly. Oil and gas. A little bit of everything, really. Hauling equipment, fixing things, general labor. It's rough work, gets you movin' all day, but… it pays the bills. Lots of heavy lifting, lots of being on my feet. And a lot of sittin’ on crates when we’re takin’ a break. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a better understanding. Heavy lifting and prolonged sitting… Alright. Now, have you had any injuries to your legs, knees, or back in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve twisted my ankle a few times, nothing serious. A couple of sprains. And I pulled a muscle in my back a few years ago, but I got it fixed up. It didn’t seem to bother me too much after that. Nothin’ major, Doc. No broken bones, no surgeries, nothin’ like that. Just the usual bumps and bruises from the job.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant injuries or surgeries. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Don’t take nothin’ regularly. And no allergies that I know of. I’ve taken ibuprofen for headaches sometimes, but that’s about it. I usually just tough things out, to be honest. Not a big fan of pills. Mostly just drink a lot of water and try to get some rest when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, no known allergies. And finally, do you have any family history of muscle or joint problems?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. My mom… she had some trouble with her knees when she got older, but I don’t know what exactly. Arthritis, maybe? And my grandpa… he had a bad back for years. But I don’t know a whole lot about it. We weren’t really close, and nobody talked about medical stuff much in my family. It was just kinda… expected that you’d hurt eventually. You know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Mr. Fratoni. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. We'll check your strength, reflexes, and range of motion in your legs and back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine, Doc. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do, like… stand a certain way or anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit on the table, please. And then we’ll start with your legs. I'm going to have you bend them at the knees and hips, and I'll check your range of motion. I'll also feel for any tenderness. Do you experience any pain when I press on your legs?
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. No, not really. Just… a little stiff sometimes, like I said. But nothin' that hurts when you poke around. I can feel it getting a little harder to bend 'em, though. Like they're tryin' to fight me. But no pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about this?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a little tender right… here. Not bad, but I can feel somethin’ there. It's not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache when you press on it. It wasn’t botherin' me before, but now that you’re messin’ with it, I can feel it. It feels kinda… tight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness to palpation on the medial aspect of the right knee. And what about bending your knee all the way?
PATIENT: It… gets kinda stuck. I can get it all the way, but it takes effort. And it feels… kinda creaky. Like there’s somethin’ rubbin’ in there. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s not smooth like my other knee. Feels a little… rough. And it's harder to straighten it all the way too.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your left knee?
PATIENT: That one's fine, Doc. No problems at all. Smooth as butter. Like it should be. It feels completely different from the other one. No creakin’, no stickin’, nothin’. It’s kinda obvious, right? The right one just doesn’t move the same way.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is quite noticeable. Now, let's check your strength. Could you please try to push your foot against my hand?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. I'm tryin'… feels… okay. Not as strong as it usually is, maybe? It feels kinda… weak. Like I’m havin' a hard time pushin’ against it. But I can do it. Just feels like it takes more effort than it should.
DOCTOR: Alright. Decreased strength in right leg extension. Now, let’s move on to your back. Could you bend forward and touch your toes, if you can?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's… not easy. Nope, can't quite reach 'em. And it feels a little tight in my lower back. Not pain, exactly, but… like somethin's pullin’. I can feel it kinda… achin’ when I bend over. Feels better when I stand up straight. But it's definitely tighter than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knees with this little hammer.
PATIENT: That one… felt kinda weak. And that one felt normal. Like it should. The right one just… didn't kick out as much. Does that make sense? It's kinda hard to explain. Just feels… duller.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Fratoni. Thank you. That was helpful. Based on the physical exam, it appears you have some decreased strength and reflexes in your right leg, tenderness to palpation on the medial aspect of your right knee, and a limited range of motion. The diminished response also indicates a possible neurological component. It's not possible to make a definitive diagnosis without further testing, but these findings suggest a possible meniscal tear, ligament sprain, or even nerve impingement. I'd like to order an MRI of your right knee and an electromyography study to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: MRI… and… what was the other one? Electrowhat? Look, Doc, I ain’t gonna lie. I don't know what any of that stuff is. And honestly… I don’t have a whole lot of money for fancy tests. Can you… explain it to me in plain English? And… how much are we talkin' here? I don’t even have insurance, so… it’s gotta be somethin’ I can afford.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Fratoni. I apologize for using medical jargon. Let me explain it in simpler terms. An MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is a scan that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the inside of your knee. It doesn’t hurt, you just lie still in a machine for about 30-45 minutes. It will show us if there's any damage to the cartilage, ligaments, or other tissues in your knee. The EMG study, or Electromyography, is a test that measures the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves. It will help us determine if there’s any nerve impingement, meaning if a nerve is being compressed or irritated. It involves inserting small needles into your muscles, which can cause a slight discomfort, but it’s usually well-tolerated. As for the cost, I understand you don’t have insurance. The MRI can cost around $600 to $800, and the EMG study around $300 to $500. However, I can see if the clinic offers a discount for uninsured patients, or if there are any financial assistance programs available. I can also discuss with you the pros and cons of conservative treatment, such as physical therapy, which might be a more affordable option in the meantime. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Six hundred… eight hundred dollars? And another three to five? Doc, that's… that's a lot of money. I work hard, but… I just don't have that kinda cash lyin' around. Physical therapy… that sounds better, to be honest. Less scary, less expensive. What would that involve? And… how long would it take to see if that even works? I need to be able to work, you know? I can't just be layin' around gettin' therapy for months. I gotta provide for myself. Maybe if we try that first… and see how it goes? If it doesn’t work, then… then we can talk about the other stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Fratoni. It's perfectly reasonable to start with conservative treatment, and physical therapy is an excellent option. It involves exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knee, improve your range of motion, and reduce pain. The physical therapist will also teach you how to prevent future injuries. Typically, a course of physical therapy lasts for about 6-8 weeks, with sessions 2-3 times per week. The duration can vary depending on the severity of your condition and your progress. We can adjust the schedule to minimize disruption to your work, and the therapist will work with you to develop a home exercise program that you can do on your own. I can write you a referral to a physical therapist in the area, and they will assess your condition and develop a personalized treatment plan. We can also discuss with them the possibility of adjusting the schedule to accommodate your work commitments. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… a lot better. Six to eight weeks, I can probably manage that. And if they can work with my schedule, that'd be great. I usually get a little bit of down time in the evenings. Yeah, let's do that. Let's get me a referral. And… thanks, Doc. I appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly. It's… it's a relief to finally have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Fratoni. I'm glad I could help. I’ll print out the referral now and go over the instructions with you. Here you are. It has the therapist's contact information and appointment scheduling details. The address is [therapist's address]. They do take walk-ins, but I recommend calling ahead to schedule an appointment. It is important to follow the therapist's instructions carefully and attend all scheduled sessions to maximize your recovery. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Nope. I think you covered everything, Doc. I really appreciate your help. I'll give 'em a call tomorrow and get somethin' scheduled. Thanks again. And… have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Fratoni. I wish you a speedy recovery. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Have a good day as well. .
