DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, good morning. It’s… my ear. Feels blocked, mostly. Like something’s… full of cotton, maybe? It’s been… a while now. Honestly, I can’t quite say how long. A few weeks, I think? It’s just… annoying, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a blocked ear for a few weeks. That is annoying. Let's try to get a better idea of what's going on. First, is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, I believe. Yes, definitely the left. The right one is… fine, as far as I can tell. I haven't really paid attention to it, to be honest. It’s the left that’s the problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the left ear. And is there any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. Just… pressure. Like when you go up in an airplane, that feeling. But it doesn't go away. And sometimes it feels a little… muffled. Like people are talking through a pillow, you know? It's not sharp, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure and muffled hearing, no sharp pain. Have you noticed any discharge from the ear, or any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Discharge… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I haven't… cleaned it or anything, if that’s what you mean. And ringing… maybe a little? It’s hard to say. I live near the trams, so there’s always some noise. It could be that. I'm not sure. Honestly, I'm terrible at remembering details like that.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable with the trams. No noticeable discharge. Let’s take a look at your ear. Could you sit up and face me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I have… things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some cerumen – earwax – in the canal. It's a bit impacted, meaning it's built up. The eardrum itself looks a little dull, but I can see it moving, which is good. No obvious signs of infection. I’m going to gently irrigate the ear to remove the wax. It might feel a little strange. Do you have any tubes in either ear?
PATIENT: Tubes? Oh dear. No, I don't think so. Never had any tubes. Not that I remember, anyway. My wife… she always handled things like that. I… I just don't keep track of those details. Irrigation? Will it… hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't hurt, but it might be a little uncomfortable. It’s just warm water going in to loosen and flush out the wax. We’ll take it slow. I'm going to use a bulb syringe. Let me know if you feel any pain or dizziness during the process. We can stop at any time.
PATIENT: Alright. As long as it doesn’t hurt. Just… be quick, please. I have… appointments. And I don't like water in my ears. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm starting now. Just relax, and try to breathe normally. Do you feel any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that’s… a bit odd. Not painful, exactly, but… wet. And a little… swishy? It’s just… not a pleasant sensation. Is it almost done?
DOCTOR: Okay, that should be enough for now. Let me take a look… There's still a little wax remaining, but it's significantly improved. The eardrum looks clearer now and is moving well. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It… feels less blocked, I think. A little… airy. Not entirely normal, but… better. Definitely better than before. Still a bit… wet inside, though. And a little… sensitive. Is this going to last? Do I need another… water treatment?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear it feels less blocked. The sensitivity and feeling of wetness should subside within a day or so. I wouldn't recommend any further irrigation at this time. Let's see how you feel in a week. If the blockage returns, or you experience any pain, dizziness, or discharge, please come back and see me. I'm going to document this as cerumen impaction treated with irrigation. Do you have any allergies to medications, or take anything regularly?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. My wife always handled the medications, you see. And I… I don’t take anything regularly. Just a vitamin D supplement in the winter, sometimes. She… she said I was deficient. Other than that, nothing. Really. It's all very… vague. Is this finished?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies and just a vitamin D supplement occasionally. Okay. So, to recap, we treated your left ear for earwax buildup with irrigation. The eardrum looks healthy, and you should feel improvement over the next day or so. If things don't improve, or if you notice any new symptoms, please schedule a follow-up. Do you need a work note for any time off?
PATIENT: No, no work note needed. I just want to get home. I have… things to do. Is there anything else? Honestly, I’m terrible at sitting still for long periods. And I’m starting to feel a bit… lightheaded, I think. Just… can we finish this up, please?
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. No work note needed. Let me just print a short summary of our visit for your records. Here you go. This outlines what we discussed and what to watch for. If you experience any dizziness, hearing loss, or pain, please call the clinic or seek immediate medical attention. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s… that’s fine. Thank you. I think… I think that’s all. I really need to get going now. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're welcome. Have a good day, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. And please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns.
