DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rowbottom, yes. Look, it’s nothing pleasant, I can tell you that much. Been… well, there’s blood. In my stool. Not a little, either. It’s concerning, naturally. A man my age… you don’t want to be seeing that.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood in the stool. Naturally concerning, as you say. Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… not days, exactly. More like… a week, maybe? Hard to say for certain, to be honest. I don’t spend a lot of time examining things, if you catch my drift. It just… appeared. And it hasn’t gone away, which is the problem. It's not like a one-time thing.
DOCTOR: A week, consistently. Alright. And can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Well, it’s red, Doctor. What do you want me to say? Bright red, sometimes darker. Sometimes there's a lot, sometimes less. It's… messy. And it doesn't smell right, either. Not like it used to. I’ve seen enough in my life to know what normal looks and smells like, and this… this ain’t normal.
DOCTOR: Bright red, darker at times, and a change in odor… Alright. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, my stomach’s been a bit… unsettled. Not exactly pain, but… cramping, I suppose. And I’m tired, always tired. Though, at my age, what isn't tired? Still, it's more than usual, I’d say. And I haven’t been… regular, if you know what I mean. Constipated, mostly.
DOCTOR: Cramping, increased fatigue, and constipation. Okay. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Thankfully. I hate vomiting. Makes me feel weak. Nausea… sometimes, a little queasy, but I wouldn't call it proper nausea. More like a general feeling of… unwellness. Like something’s just off. And I haven't had much of an appetite, either. Food doesn't seem as appealing as it used to. Though, maybe that's just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmph. Well, my knees ache something fierce, if that counts. And the doctor told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but I stopped taking the pills. Didn’t like the side effects. Besides, I’ve always been a strong man. A pilot, you know. We don’t get sick. Well, didn’t get sick. Used to be. Haven’t had anything serious, not like heart trouble or anything. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Had my appendix out when I was a boy, ages ago. And a bit of work done on my shoulder after that crash in ’78. Nothing major, just to fix it up a bit. And… oh, yes. Had a mole removed from my back a few years back. They said it was nothing to worry about, just a precaution. That's about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… now there’s a mess. My father… he died young, heart trouble. Mother lived to be old, but she wasn't right in the head towards the end. My brother… drank too much, liver problems. My sister… well, she never amounted to much. Not much in the way of good health on either side, if you want my honest opinion. A lot of weak constitutions. That's why I always took care of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No. Haven’t taken a pill in years, as I said. Don’t believe in them, mostly. Mess with your system, that's what they do. I take a little vitamin C now and again, if I remember, but that's about it. Prefer to let nature take its course. A strong constitution, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. We'll start with your abdomen. Lie back on the examination table, please. I need to feel for any abnormalities. And I will also need to do a rectal exam. It’s necessary to determine the source of the bleeding.
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Now hold on just a minute. You want me to… well, that’s a bit much, isn't it? I’m an old man, Doctor, not a young lad. I’ve been examined enough in my life. And frankly, I don’t see how poking around down there is going to tell you anything a decent look at the stool wouldn’t. I’m not comfortable with that, not at all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, with all due respect, a visual inspection of your stool is not sufficient. A digital rectal exam is a crucial step in evaluating the source of bleeding, especially given your age and symptoms. It allows me to check for masses, tenderness, and other abnormalities that would not be visible otherwise. I understand your discomfort, but it is a necessary part of a thorough examination and is essential for determining the appropriate course of action. We have a professional obligation to ensure a correct diagnosis. I assure you, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. If you absolutely refuse, I can refer you to another physician, but I strongly advise against it. It’s your health we’re talking about.
PATIENT: Hmph. Professional obligation, is it? You doctors all say the same thing. Still… poking around down there… it just doesn't sit right. But… you're right, I suppose. I don’t want to waste any more time. And I do want to know what’s going on. Fine. But be quick about it, and gentle, like you said. And no unnecessary… fuss.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie on your left side, with your knees bent. I’ll explain each step as I go. And yes, I assure you, I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Now, I’m just going to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel for any abnormalities. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Take a deep breath and relax.
PATIENT: Alright, alright... Just get it over with. It is cold. And… uncomfortable, as you said. No need to linger. Just tell me what you find, and let’s be done with it. Honestly, doctors these days…
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m feeling some slight tenderness on the lower left side. And… yes, I do feel a small, hard mass. It’s about the size of a grape, located a few inches inside. It’s not particularly painful to the touch, but it’s definitely present. Okay. That is… concerning. It requires further investigation. It could be a number of things, but we need to rule out more serious possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count to check for anemia and a stool sample to look for blood and other abnormalities. But more importantly, I’m ordering a colonoscopy. It’s the most accurate way to visualize the entire colon and determine the cause of the bleeding and assess the mass. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Now that sounds serious. Sticking a camera up… well, that doesn’t sound pleasant at all. And all this trouble just because of a bit of blood? I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. Maybe this is just… old age catching up with me. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t we just… monitor it? Take another blood sample in a few weeks? I don’t like the sound of this colonoscopy one bit.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, with all due respect, this is not just a bit of blood. You’re experiencing persistent rectal bleeding, fatigue, and changes in bowel habits. And I’ve palpated a mass during the examination. While it’s true you’ve lived a long life, that doesn't negate the possibility of a serious underlying condition. Ignoring these symptoms or simply monitoring them could have devastating consequences. The mass could be a benign polyp, but it could also be cancerous. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment. A colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing and treating colon cancer. I understand your reluctance, but it’s a necessary procedure. It’s the only way to get a definitive diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of action. We can discuss the preparation process and answer any questions you have about it, but I strongly urge you to proceed with the colonoscopy. Delaying this could significantly impact your prognosis. I'm not suggesting the worst, but we need to rule it out, and the only way to do that is with a colonoscopy. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cancer… you think it could be cancer? I… I hadn’t even thought of that. Well, that changes things. My father… he had a touch of it, towards the end. Didn’t end well. Alright. Fine. Do the colonoscopy. But… make it quick. And… gentle. And tell me everything. I want to know what you find, no sugarcoating. And… how long will it take to get the results? And what if… what if it is cancer?
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your concerns, Mr. Rowbottom. Yes, the possibility of cancer needs to be investigated, but it’s important to remember that it’s just one possibility. We won’t know for certain until we perform the colonoscopy and take a biopsy. The procedure itself usually takes about 30-60 minutes. You’ll be sedated, so you won’t feel any discomfort. You’ll need someone to drive you home afterwards. The results typically take 5-7 business days to come back from the lab. If it is cancer, we will discuss all your treatment options. These may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. We will work with you to develop a plan that is tailored to your specific needs and preferences. I will refer you to an oncologist if necessary. I’m going to order the colonoscopy today. The scheduler will contact you to arrange an appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a referral to a gastroenterologist for the procedure and give you instructions on how to prepare for it. I want to reassure you that we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all for now. Just… get it done, Doctor. Get it done as quickly as possible. And… be thorough. I don’t want to have to come back here again if you’ve missed something. And… thank you. For… being honest. It’s not what I wanted to hear, but… I appreciate it. Alright then. I suppose I’ll be seeing you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Rowbottom. We’ll take good care of you. The scheduler will be in touch shortly. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, and we’ll see you soon. .
