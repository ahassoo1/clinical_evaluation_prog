DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Deschane. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am here regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks, and I was hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption. It’s causing some… difficulties, and I want to be respectful of everyone’s health, of course.
DOCTOR: Difficulties?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s… well, it feels like it restricts my breathing. Not constantly, but enough that it makes my job harder. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and sometimes I need to… move quickly. It's hard to explain, but it feels unsafe when I can't get a full breath. I don’t want to put myself or anyone else at risk, that’s why I’m here. I’ve never had trouble breathing before this, mind you. It just started when the mask rules began.
DOCTOR: And how long ago did these mask rules begin at your workplace, specifically?
PATIENT: About six months ago, Doctor. Right around the start of March. At first, I thought it was just me needing to get used to it. But it hasn’t gotten easier, and if anything, it's become a bit worse. It’s not a panic feeling, just… a tightness. I try to explain it to my supervisor, but it’s hard to put into words. I’m a big man, you see, and maybe that makes a difference. It feels… constricting.
DOCTOR: Right. Constricting. And has this tightness been consistent over those six months, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Some days it's barely noticeable. Other days, especially if I’m doing something physical – like helping someone move, or if the weather is very warm – it becomes quite prominent. It hasn't stopped me from doing my job entirely, but it does require me to slow down and be more careful. I'm worried about being able to respond quickly if there’s an emergency. I wouldn’t want to put anyone in danger because of it.
DOCTOR: And have you had a cough, wheezing, or any other symptoms alongside this tightness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s the strange part. No cough, no wheezing, no dizziness, nothing like that. Just the tightness in my chest. That’s why I’m so puzzled. I thought maybe it was allergies at first, but allergy medicine doesn’t help. And I haven’t been sick with a cold or the flu. It really just seems to be the mask itself. I was hoping you might have some insight, or perhaps suggest a different type of mask that might be more comfortable. I’ve tried a few different kinds, but none of them seem to make much difference.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get some basic information recorded. Do you have any history of asthma, COPD, or other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve always been healthy, thankfully. I’ve never even had bronchitis. I used to spend a lot of time outdoors growing up, running and playing. I haven't been to the hospital for breathing problems, or anything like that. My family… well, my mother had high blood pressure, but nothing related to the lungs. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor, I don’t take any medications regularly. I'm generally very good health. That's what makes this so concerning.
DOCTOR: Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. Never will. I find it quite unhealthy, and I've always avoided it. My father smoked for a while, but he quit years ago, and he always encouraged me to stay away from it. I try to live a clean life, Doctor. I eat healthy, I exercise when I can, and I avoid harmful substances. That's why this mask situation is so baffling. It feels… contradictory to my lifestyle.
DOCTOR: And what kind of masks have you been trying?
PATIENT: Mostly the standard blue surgical masks, Doctor. And the N95 ones, the white ones. My workplace provides them. I've tried different sizes, you know, to see if that made a difference, but none of them fit comfortably. I even bought a few cloth masks, thinking maybe they'd be better, but they didn't seem to help either. They just felt… restrictive. I've tried tying them tighter, looser, different knots... It's been quite a process, trying to find one that works. I'm not sure if it's the material, the fit, or something else entirely. It's a frustrating situation.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. We’ll need to do a basic physical exam. I want to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. Then we can discuss this further. Please remove your shirt and shoes.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds reasonable. I understand. Let me know if there’s anything else I should do. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can to figure this out. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Lungs sound clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Your oxygen levels are normal, and your lungs sound healthy. There’s no indication of any underlying respiratory issue.
PATIENT: I see, Doctor. That’s… good to hear, I suppose. But if my lungs are healthy, why am I experiencing this difficulty? It’s just so strange. It feels like something is physically restricting my breathing, but you’re saying there’s nothing wrong. I'm afraid I don't understand. Could it be… anxiety, perhaps? Though I don't feel particularly anxious about wearing the mask, it's just uncomfortable. Or could it be something else entirely that we haven’t considered?
DOCTOR: It’s likely a matter of getting accustomed to wearing a mask, Mr. Knabenshue. A healthy individual experiencing difficulty adjusting to a new sensation is not uncommon. It’s not a medical condition requiring treatment. However, to cover all bases, we could perform a spirometry test to assess your lung function more precisely. But I anticipate the results will be normal. Would you like to proceed with the spirometry test?
PATIENT: I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor, but if you already anticipate the results being normal, I’m not sure if it’s necessary. I don't want to waste your time, or the clinic’s resources, if it’s just going to confirm what you already believe. Perhaps… could you offer any suggestions on how to better tolerate the mask? Different types, techniques for wearing it, anything at all? I’m willing to try anything to make this work, but I feel like I’ve already exhausted all the basic options. And I do worry about the impact on my ability to perform my job safely. It's not simply a matter of "getting used to it," Doctor. It impacts my work.
DOCTOR: Frankly, Mr. Knabenshue, you are a large man. The mask is likely simply too small and constricting. Try a larger size if your workplace provides them. If not, I suggest you discuss this with your supervisor and explore alternative options, or request a medical accommodation. I do not recommend pursuing unnecessary testing. I will document our conversation. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: I see, Doctor. So, you’re suggesting it’s simply a matter of size, and nothing more? That's... somewhat disappointing. I had hoped for a more definitive answer, or perhaps some guidance on techniques for mitigating the discomfort. I have already discussed this with my supervisor, but they require documentation of a medical condition, hence my visit today. It seems we’ve reached an impasse. I appreciate your time, Doctor, but I'm not sure this consultation has been particularly helpful. I suppose I'll have to explore other options on my own. Thank you, nonetheless. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I have documented our discussion. If you experience any actual difficulty breathing – wheezing, chest pain, or shortness of breath – seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day.
