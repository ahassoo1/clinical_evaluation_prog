DOCTOR: Good morning, Monsieur Schieber. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s rather inconvenient having to come here, but my wife insisted. It’s… a bit embarrassing, really. There’s something… well, it’s in my mouth. It’s white, and it doesn’t just go away when I try to wipe it off. It’s quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be unsettling when something new appears, and it's good that your wife encouraged you to come in. No need to be embarrassed at all, Monsieur Schieber – we see all sorts of things. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It's… patchy, I suppose. Not all over, just in spots. And it's… slightly raised. It doesn't hurt, precisely, but it's uncomfortable. It feels… rough. Honestly, it makes eating rather unpleasant. I've been trying to ignore it, but it’s not going away, and my wife… well, she's very particular about these things. I haven't the slightest idea what caused it, and frankly, I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, patchy, slightly raised, rough texture, making eating unpleasant, and not painful, but uncomfortable. You haven’t noticed any pain at all?
PATIENT: No, not pain. Discomfort, yes. A sort of… grittiness. And it makes my tongue feel… funny. Look, I work with timber all day. Faller, you understand? Rough work. It's possible something got in there. But it should have come out with brushing. It's been… oh, I don't know, a week or so, maybe a little longer. I really haven't paid it much attention until my wife… insisted.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week or so, associated with your work as a faller… that’s helpful information. So, the discomfort feels like a grittiness, and you've noticed it on your tongue as well?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, the tongue. It's a general unpleasantness, really. It’s not as if I’ve been meticulously examining it, Doctor. I have work to do. I brush my teeth twice a day, as anyone sensible does. Is this something… serious? Because frankly, I don't have time for complicated treatments.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Monsieur Schieber. It's good you practice regular oral hygiene. To get a better idea of what we’re dealing with, I'd like to take a quick look inside your mouth. It will only take a moment, and it will help me determine if any further investigation is needed. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I appreciate your… thoroughness, but I really don't see the point. I work with wood all day. Splinters, dust… it's probably just something like that. But, fine. Get it over with. Quickly, please. I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright, Monsieur Schieber. If you could open wide for me. I'll just take a quick look and then we can discuss the possibilities. Hmm. I see the patches you were describing. They are located on the inside of your cheeks and on your tongue. They do appear a bit irregular, and as you said, they aren't easily removed. There's no obvious bleeding, which is good. It could be something as simple as irritation from your work, but given the persistence and the appearance, I want to be cautious. It's possible this is a condition called leukoplakia. Have you ever been told you have that before?
PATIENT: Leuk… what now? No, absolutely not. I’ve never heard of such a thing. Honestly, Doctor, I thought you said you saw nothing serious? Is this going to involve… needles? Because I have a very low tolerance for needles. And I certainly don’t have time for a lengthy treatment plan. Just tell me if it's something I need to worry about, and if there's a simple solution. Preferably one that doesn't involve a lot of… fuss.
DOCTOR: Leukoplakia isn’t necessarily serious, but it can sometimes be a precursor to more concerning conditions. That's why I want to be thorough. It’s a condition where the mucous membranes in your mouth develop white patches that can’t be scraped off. It's often linked to tobacco use, but it can also be caused by irritation, and sometimes the cause is unknown. Given your work, irritation is a strong possibility, but to be certain, I’d like to take a small biopsy – a tiny sample – of one of the patches. It will allow us to examine the cells under a microscope and determine the exact cause. As for needles, it's a very quick pinch – a local anesthetic will numb the area beforehand, so you shouldn't feel much discomfort. It’s the most reliable way to rule out anything more serious. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Now you want to cut me? Absolutely not! This is ridiculous. I told you, I work with wood. It's probably just a splinter or something. I am not subjecting myself to a procedure for something as trivial as this. I’ll just… rinse my mouth with some salt water and see if it goes away. That’s what my wife would do. Honestly, Doctor, this is a complete waste of my time. I’m leaving. .
DOCTOR: Monsieur Schieber, I understand your frustration, and I respect your decision. However, I must strongly advise against dismissing this without further investigation. While irritation is possible, leukoplakia can sometimes develop into something more serious, such as oral cancer. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment. I’m concerned about the persistence of these patches and the lack of improvement with standard oral hygiene. I can provide you with a referral to an oral surgeon for a second opinion. They can assess the situation and determine if a biopsy is necessary. I’m happy to write a note for your wife as well, explaining my concerns. However, I will not be able to offer any further treatment without a definitive diagnosis. Do you wish me to prepare a referral?
