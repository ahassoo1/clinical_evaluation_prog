DOCTOR: Hi Brad, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it’s… unpleasant. Real unpleasant. Been throwin’ up blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to scare the bejesus outta me. Happened a couple times now, over the last few days. Figured I better get it checked before it gets worse, ya know? It’s… well, it's blood, doc. Can’t really ignore that, can ya?
DOCTOR: No, you absolutely can't ignore that, Brad. It’s good you came in. Okay, so you've vomited blood a couple of times in the last few days. Can you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do ya mean, describe it? It’s… red, naturally. Like, it’s blood. But it wasn't… bright red, if that makes sense. More… dark. Kinda like coffee grounds, actually. And it smelled… metallic, I guess. Look, I don’t spend my days lookin’ at vomit, alright? I work with… ashes. It’s not a pleasant job. But yeah, dark red, kinda chunky, and smelled… bad. Like pennies, maybe? Is that helpful? I’m tellin' ya what I saw, doc. Not a doctor.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Brad, thank you. Dark red, like coffee grounds, metallic smell… that gives me some ideas. And you mentioned you work with ashes – what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I run the crematory over in Oakhaven. Been doin’ it… oh, nearly twenty years now. It’s… necessary work, somebody's gotta do it. Folks pass on, families need closure. I handle… the rest. It’s quiet work, mostly. Lot of paperwork, makin’ sure everything’s done right, respectful-like. But it’s… not a job for the faint of heart, if ya catch my drift. A lot of… sadness. And a lot of dust. Real fine dust gets everywhere. Maybe that’s got somethin’ to do with this, I dunno. I ain't exactly breathin' fresh air all day, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work at the crematory, long-term exposure to fine dust. That's good information. Besides the vomiting blood, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… let me think. I've been feelin' a bit… weak lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And kinda lightheaded when I stand up too fast. Usually goes away after a minute, but it’s there. Oh, and my stomach’s been… unsettled. Not necessarily painful, just… queasy. Like I’m gonna be sick even when I haven’t eaten anything. And… I haven't really been hungry. Lost a few pounds, I reckon, but haven't bothered weighin' myself. Honestly, doc, I’m not one for fussin' over myself. Wife… well, my late wife, she was the one for that sort of thing. This all just… started up a few weeks ago, same time as the… issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness, lightheadedness, nausea, loss of appetite, and those symptoms started a few weeks ago alongside the vomiting blood. Have you had any pain in your abdomen, or noticed any black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Abdomen pain… not really. Maybe a little… discomfort, like somethin's been rubbed raw, but nothin' sharp or awful. Comes and goes, if that makes any sense. More of a dull ache. And… tarry stools? No, not that I’ve noticed. Everything's been… normal-ish in that department, if ya don't mind me bein' blunt. Look, I'm a simple man, doc. I deal with… final arrangements. I don't spend much time lookin' at what comes out of people. Just tellin’ ya what I know. I've been a little… preoccupied lately, if you get my drift. It's been a rough year, you know? Losing her… and now this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brad. Losing your wife must be incredibly difficult, and it's completely understandable if you've been preoccupied. And you’re right, it’s good you came in. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, go ahead. I ain’t got anything to hide. Just… be gentle, alright? I’m not exactly used to bein’ poked and prodded. And try not to take too long, if that’s possible. I got things to… see to. Arrangements, ya know? Folks don't just… wait.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll feel your abdomen. After that, I'd like to check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. It'll only take a few minutes. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, not particularly painful, but I do feel a little bit of fullness up here, in the upper part of your stomach. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and your temperature is 98.6. That's all within normal limits. Now, can you tell me about any medications you take regularly, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. Just a little somethin' for my back, now and then, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think it is. Over the counter stuff, nothin’ fancy. And allergies? Nope, none that I know of. Never had a problem with pollen or… anything, really. I’m a pretty simple fella, doc. Don’t take much to keep me tickin’. Used to be, my wife would always remind me to take a multivitamin, but… well. Never really got into the habit. Mostly just drink my coffee black and try to keep busy. Don't go botherin' with all them pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for back pain as needed, no other medications, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, looking at your chart, it doesn't mention anything about a previous history of ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding. And given your work environment, prolonged exposure to dust, and the coffee… and the dark, coffee-ground-like emesis, I'm concerned about a possible upper gastrointestinal bleed. It could be an ulcer, gastritis, or even irritation from the dust exposure. To be sure, I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for anemia, and a stool test to rule out any other sources of bleeding. And, the most important thing, we need to do an endoscopy. That's where we use a small camera to look inside your stomach and esophagus to find the source of the bleeding. Would you be willing to have that done?
PATIENT: Hold on now. A… camera? Down my throat? Doc, you're serious? Look, I understand you gotta do your job, but… that sounds awful. And anemia? Anemia sounds… bad. I just… I don't know. Is there any other way? I mean, I’ve been feelin’ a little weak, sure, but I ain’t exactly… fallin’ apart. And puttin’ a camera down my gullet… that just seems… extreme. I just wanna know why I'm throwin' up blood, not have a vacation inside my stomach. Can’t we just try somethin' else first? Maybe some pills? Or… somethin'? I’m a simple man, doc. I ain't one for fancy procedures.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Brad. It does sound invasive, and I wouldn't recommend it if it wasn't important. Unfortunately, "pills" alone won’t tell us where the bleeding is coming from. And knowing the source is crucial to stopping the bleeding and preventing it from happening again. Think of it this way: throwing up blood isn't normal. It means something is irritated or damaged in your digestive system. Without looking, we're just guessing. The endoscopy allows us to see exactly what's going on, take a small sample if needed, and potentially stop the bleeding during the procedure. There are some risks involved, yes, but they are relatively low. We would give you medication to make you comfortable and sedated during the procedure, and a nurse would monitor you closely. If we don’t find out the source of the bleeding, it could continue, or even get worse, and lead to more serious complications. We need to be proactive here. I can explain the procedure in more detail, if you'd like. And I can answer any questions you have. Perhaps we could start with medication to reduce the acid in your stomach to give you some immediate relief while we discuss the endoscopy further?
PATIENT: Immediate relief… that sounds good. Anything to get this queasiness under control. Alright, alright. Look, I trust you’re the doctor, I guess. But… this camera thing… it still makes me uneasy. Explain it to me again. What exactly will happen? And what are these… risks you’re talkin’ about? And what if… what if you find somethin’ bad? I’m not afraid of dyin’, doc, I’ve seen enough of that. But… I don’t wanna be laid up in a hospital for weeks because of this. I got things to do. Arrangements, ya know? Families waitin’. Just… lay it on me straight. No sugar-coatin'. What's the worst that could happen?
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, I will lay it on you straight. The endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end down your esophagus, into your stomach and the first part of your small intestine. You’ll be sedated, meaning you’ll be very relaxed and likely won’t remember much of the procedure. It typically takes about 15-20 minutes. During the procedure, I’ll look for the source of the bleeding – ulcers, inflammation, or any other abnormalities. If I find something, I can take a small sample for further examination, or potentially stop the bleeding with certain medications or techniques. Now, about the risks. The most common risks are minor – a sore throat afterwards, some bloating or gas. Rarely, there's a risk of bleeding, perforation , or infection. The anesthesia also carries some minimal risk. We monitor you closely throughout the entire procedure to minimize these risks. As for finding something bad… it’s possible. We could find an ulcer that needs treatment, or, in rare cases, a more serious condition. If that happens, we would discuss your options, which could include medication, further testing, or, in some cases, surgery. But it's important to remember that we don’t know what’s going on yet. The endoscopy is the best way to find out, and we’ll take it one step at a time. I'm going to start you on a medication called a proton pump inhibitor . It reduces the amount of acid in your stomach, which can help with your nausea and give the lining of your stomach a chance to heal. I'll also give you a prescription for an antiemetic to help with the vomiting. Then, I want to schedule the endoscopy as soon as possible. We can discuss the details of the procedure further, and answer any other questions you have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Give me the pills. Anything to stop this feelin’… unsettled. And… schedule the camera thing. But no promises I won’t be a pain. I don't like bein’ poked and prodded, doc. And I don’t like bein' told what to do. But… I guess I understand. You’re the doctor. Just… make it quick. And don't find anything too terrible, alright? I got arrangements to make. Families waitin'. And frankly, I’m too old to be messin' with all this complicated stuff. Now, what do I gotta do with these pills? When do I take ‘em? And what kinda schedule are we talkin' about for this… endoscopy? I got commitments. Important ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. I will do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I’m prescribing you Pantoprazole, 40mg, once daily in the morning, 30 minutes before breakfast. That's the PPI to reduce stomach acid. And I’m also prescribing you Ondansetron, 4mg, as needed for nausea, but no more than three times a day. As for the endoscopy, the scheduler has an opening next Tuesday at 9:00 AM. It will take about 3-4 hours total, including preparation and recovery. You’ll need to fast after midnight the night before. And you'll need someone to drive you home, as you won’t be able to drive yourself after the sedation. Here are the prescriptions. And here’s a handout with detailed instructions about the endoscopy preparation. I understand you have commitments, and we’ll do everything we can to accommodate them. If something comes up, please call the office, and we’ll see what we can do. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 9:00 AM. Fine. I'll see what I can rearrange. Hopefully, nobody dies before then. Look, doc… this is probably a stupid question, but… is this… is this somethin' serious? Like, am I… am I lookin’ at the end of the line here? I've seen enough of the end of the line in my job. I just… don’t wanna be one of ‘em. Straight answer, doc. No sugar-coatin'. What are we talkin' about here? Worst-case scenario. I need to know. I got things to settle. Arrangements to make. Can't be hangin' around if I'm about to… you know.
DOCTOR: Brad, I understand your concern, and I appreciate you asking me to be straight with you. It’s difficult to say definitively without knowing the cause of the bleeding. However, based on your symptoms, it’s unlikely this is immediately life-threatening. The most common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding are ulcers, gastritis, or inflammation. These conditions are often treatable with medication, and sometimes require procedures like the endoscopy to stop the bleeding. The worst-case scenario, while rare, would be a more serious underlying condition, like a cancerous tumor. But it's important to remember that this is not what we're expecting, and we won’t know until we do the endoscopy. We need to find out what's causing the bleeding so we can determine the best course of action. But right now, I don't believe you are facing an immediate life-threatening situation. I know that's not necessarily reassuring, but it’s the honest truth. I’m going to focus on getting to the bottom of this, and we'll take it one step at a time. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Alright. One step at a time. I can handle that. Better than… layin' around waitin' for the inevitable. Look, doc… about the arrangements. I run a small crematory over in Oakhaven. It’s… a family business, kinda. My wife… she handled most of the paperwork, the… sensitivities. I'm not exactly the… comforting type. If… if somethin' does happen, would you… could you maybe… recommend someone? Someone who could help with… things? I'm not lookin' to put my whole life on hold, but… I got families countin’ on me. Just… in case. It's a stupid question, I know. But… it's best to be prepared, right? Especially in my line of work.
DOCTOR: That's not a stupid question at all, Brad. It’s incredibly responsible of you to think about that. And given your profession, it’s perfectly understandable why you’re asking. I have a colleague, Dr. Eleanor Vance, who specializes in grief counseling and estate planning. She often works with families during difficult times, and she’s very compassionate and thorough. I can give you her contact information, if you’d like. She could potentially assist with the administrative tasks and emotional support if needed. Here’s her card. I also have a list of reputable estate attorneys in the area, if you’re interested. Please, don’t feel like you’re anticipating the worst. But it’s always good to have resources available, just in case. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Dr. Vance. Alright. I’ll keep it in mind. Thanks, doc. You… you’ve been more helpful than I expected. Most doctors just look at you like you're… a case. You actually seem to… care. No, I think that’s all. Just… gotta get through Tuesday, I guess. And try not to think about it too much. Arrangements waitin'. That’s all. Alright. Well, thanks again, doc. I appreciate your time. And your… honesty. I’ll see you on Tuesday.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brad. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before Tuesday. We’ll do everything we can to help.
