DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Rowbottom, is it?
PATIENT: Rowbottom. Arbie Rowbottom. And yes, it is Rowbottom. Been a pilot for… well, a long time. Longer than most folks have been alive, probably. What’s this about, exactly? Don’t tell me it’s another one of these newfangled computer forms I gotta fill out.
DOCTOR: No, no forms. Though, frankly, those would be helpful. You’re here because… well, what brought you in today, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Well, it's my… stool. Been seeing a bit of red in it. Not a lot, mind you. But enough to bother a fella. And I’ve seen things, you know? Seen things that’d turn your hair white. This… this ain’t normal. Though, what is normal these days? Seems like everything's gone to pot. Don't mean to complain, just stating facts.
DOCTOR: Red in the stool. Right. How long has this been happening, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s been… a week, maybe? Hard to say exactly. Things get a bit blurry at my age, you know. Not everything is blurry, mind you. I still got a perfectly good sense of direction, thank you very much. But keeping track of… bodily functions… isn’t exactly high on the priority list. It just started, and it bothered me enough to come in. Took me long enough, though. Wife – ex-wife, now – always said I was stubborn.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. A week. And is it… bright red, dark red, or something else?
PATIENT: Bright red, mostly. Like… well, like a fresh cherry, if you’re gonna ask me to compare it to fruit. Though, I don’t eat much fruit anymore. Too much sugar. Gives me the jitters. And I’ve had enough jitters in my life, flying those old planes. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t see what a color has to do with anything. Is it serious? That's what I want to know. Are you gonna poke and prod at me all day?
DOCTOR: Bright red suggests it’s likely lower intestinal bleeding. We will need to do a quick examination, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s standard procedure. And no, I won’t “poke and prod” all day. Just a brief digital rectal exam, and I’ll listen to your abdomen. It will give us a starting point. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, or changes in your bowel habits - constipation, diarrhea, anything like that?
PATIENT: A digital exam? Good heavens. Is that really necessary? Can’t you just… look at it? Fine, fine. If you insist. But I’m telling you, I’ve had more comfortable landings. As for pain… a bit of cramping, now and then. Old age, probably. And things are… irregular. Sometimes too much, sometimes not enough. Like I said, things are just irregular. It's all falling apart, you know. Like a poorly maintained aircraft. And frankly, I’m not particularly keen on being examined like some… some mechanic’s project.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. If you could lie down on the table, please. And just try to relax. It will be quicker if you do. While you're doing that, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… Just a little something for my arthritis. Can’t remember the name of it, off the top of my head. Small white pill. And sometimes, if I’m really achin’, I take an over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think it is. That's about it. Don’t go for all those fancy drugs the TV’s always advertising. Give me a good old-fashioned rest and a cup of tea any day. Now, is this going to be terribly uncomfortable? Because my back isn’t what it used to be. And I’ve got a very sensitive… well, never you mind. Just get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen can sometimes irritate the stomach lining, which could contribute to bleeding. Let’s just get this over with. Please lie on your side, knees drawn up. I'll need to lubricate the area, and then I'll perform a brief exam. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Try to breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Lubricate? Honestly! The indignity of it all. Fine, fine. Just… be quick about it. And please, try not to poke too hard. I’ve got old bones, you know. And if you find anything… unpleasant… please don’t make a face. It’s bad enough having to go through this. Just tell me what you find, and let’s get it over with. This whole thing is… unsettling. And I’ve faced storms that were less disturbing than this.
DOCTOR: Alright. I did feel some… irregularities. And there was a small amount of blood present. It’s not an alarming amount, but it’s enough to warrant further investigation. I recommend a fecal occult blood test, to confirm the presence of blood in your stool. And we'll need to discuss a possible colonoscopy. It’s the best way to determine the cause of the bleeding.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Good heavens, are you serious? Stick a camera up there? Absolutely not. I’ve had enough poking and prodding for one day, thank you very much. I’m 88 years old! I don’t need any more… interventions. A fecal… whatsit? That sounds slightly less invasive, I suppose. But a colonoscopy? Out of the question. Is there nothing else you can do? Perhaps some… some magic pills? Or a good cup of tea? This is ridiculous. And frankly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel rather insulted.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your concerns. But a colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing the cause of rectal bleeding, especially at your age. It’s essential to rule out anything serious, such as polyps or cancer. The fecal occult blood test will simply confirm if there’s blood present, it won't tell us where it’s coming from. We can discuss the preparation for the colonoscopy, and I assure you, we’ll do everything possible to make it as comfortable as possible. However, refusing it entirely isn’t a responsible course of action. We need to be proactive about your health. If you're adamant about refusing it, we can schedule the fecal occult blood test, but I strongly advise you to reconsider the colonoscopy. It's for your own well-being.
PATIENT: Well-being?! I've lived a long life, Doctor. A good life. I’ve flown airplanes, seen the world, and survived things you wouldn’t believe. I’m not about to spend my remaining years undergoing invasive procedures for… for what? Some vague possibility of something being wrong? No, thank you. I’ll take the… fecal whatsit. And I’ll take my chances. I’m a stubborn old man, I admit it. But I know my own body. And right now, my body is telling me to avoid anything involving cameras and… and prodding. So, let’s get this test done. And then, let’s be done with it. No colonoscopy. Absolutely not. I’ve made up my mind. And frankly, I’m not interested in being talked into anything further. Stubborn old fool, probably… but it's my stubbornness.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. We can schedule the fecal occult blood test. I will give you instructions on how to collect the samples. However, I must document your refusal of the colonoscopy. It’s important to understand that this carries certain risks. I will also recommend a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the test. If you experience any significant bleeding, abdominal pain, or changes in your bowel habits, you must seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Significant bleeding, abdominal pain, changes… I’ve heard it all before. And yes, I’ll come back for a follow-up. Though, frankly, I doubt it’ll be necessary. Probably just a bit of indigestion. Too much tea, perhaps. Or maybe that dodgy fish I had last week. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. But fine, I’ll do the test. I'll collect the samples. And I’ll try not to worry about it. Though, I can’t promise anything. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need a lie-down. And a very strong cup of tea. And perhaps, just perhaps, a little bit of peace and quiet. .
