DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 33 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right. I need a letter, if possible. Confirming that I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I’m hoping you can help.
DOCTOR: A letter confirming your ability to fly… I see. While I understand you want this letter, it's not quite as straightforward as simply stating whether or not someone can fly. It requires a medical assessment to determine if there are any contraindications. It’s a significant responsibility, Ms. Sayar. To begin, are you currently under the care of any other physicians?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Not currently. Just… Medicare for general things, if that counts. And honestly, this is the first time I’ve needed anything specific like this. It’s a long story, but it came up suddenly. Is that okay? Should I explain more about why I need the letter?
DOCTOR: While your Medicare coverage is relevant, it doesn’t constitute being under active care. And yes, Ms. Sayar, I do need you to explain why you require this letter. Simply stating it “came up suddenly” doesn’t provide me with the necessary medical information to make an informed decision. Specifically, what airline or travel agency is requesting this documentation, and what are their specific requirements?
PATIENT: It’s… Air Nomad. They’re a smaller company, doing flights to… well, it doesn't matter where exactly. They just need a doctor to sign off saying I don’t have any conditions that would make flying dangerous. Things like heart problems, or… I don’t know… anything that could be made worse by altitude or pressure changes? They sent a form with a list, actually. I have it here. It's mostly just checking for… standard stuff, I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s take a look at this. Standard, as you say. Still requires a thorough assessment. Now, Ms. Sayar, let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – anything at all, even if you think it’s minor?
PATIENT: No, nothing diagnosed. I… lost my husband a few years ago, and he had a lot of health problems, so I was mostly focused on his appointments. I didn’t really need a doctor for myself. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. A few colds, the usual things, but nothing serious. I don't think so, anyway. Would something like… grief count? I know that’s not a medical condition, exactly.
DOCTOR: While I understand your recent loss, Ms. Sayar, grief is not a medical condition requiring a physician's clearance for air travel. We are concerned with physical health issues that could be exacerbated by flying. Have you ever been hospitalized?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even as a child. I… I broke my arm once when I was little, climbing a tree, but it wasn’t serious enough for a hospital stay. Just a cast. Other than that, nothing. I really haven’t been sick much. It's probably why this is all so strange, to be honest. They’re being very careful with this flight.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to eat healthy and get enough sleep. That’s it, really. My husband… he was on a lot of medication, so I always preferred to stay away from it if possible. It’s just… I don’t want to be reliant on anything, if I don’t need it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing I'm aware of, anyway. I've never had a reaction to anything. My husband was allergic to penicillin, but that's… irrelevant. It’s just, I really haven’t had any issues. I know this is probably frustrating, Doctor, because I don’t have anything to report. But honestly, that’s the truth.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Sayar. However, a lack of reported medical issues doesn't necessarily equate to a complete absence of underlying conditions. It simply means they haven't been identified yet. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and assess your overall physical condition. It’s standard procedure. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. Yes, of course. Whatever you need. I just… hope this doesn’t take too long. I have a few things I need to do later.
DOCTOR: Please sit here, and I'll begin. Take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Again… and again. Heart sounds are regular. Deep breath in… and exhale. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 118 over 72. Pulse is 70 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Everything appears normal at this initial assessment, but I'd like to run a few basic blood tests just to be certain. Specifically, a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. If it will help, then yes. Please do whatever you think is necessary. I just want to get this letter, if possible. It's... important.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse draw the necessary blood samples. It will take approximately 15-20 minutes for the results to become available. In the meantime, is there anything else you would like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just… the letter, if the tests are okay. And thank you for your time, Doctor. I appreciate it. I just... I need to be on this flight.
DOCTOR: We'll determine if you are medically cleared for travel once the lab results are in, Ms. Sayar. It’s important to remain realistic. Please remain here while I review the results.
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: The lab results have returned. Your complete blood count and basic metabolic panel are within normal limits. However, I noticed a slightly elevated eosinophil count. It’s not drastically high, but it is above the standard range. Do you have any history of allergies – seasonal allergies, food allergies, or any other type of allergic reaction?
PATIENT: No... not that I know of. I told you, I really don't have any allergies. That's why this is so strange. My husband was the one with the allergies, not me. Is that… bad? What does an elevated eosinophil count even mean?
DOCTOR: An elevated eosinophil count can indicate several things, Ms. Sayar. It’s often associated with allergic reactions, parasitic infections, or certain skin conditions. It can also be idiopathic – meaning there is no identifiable cause. Given your upcoming flight and the potential for altitude and pressure changes, it's essential to investigate this further. While it may be nothing, we cannot rule out a potential underlying condition that could be exacerbated during travel. I recommend a consultation with an allergist for further evaluation and testing. They can perform a skin prick test or blood test to identify any potential allergens. I am hesitant to issue a letter confirming your ability to fly without a more thorough assessment.
PATIENT: An allergist… That’s going to take time, isn't it? And I need to be on this flight… soon. Is there… anything else I can do? Any test that could be done right now to prove I'm okay? It's really important, Doctor. It's… a family matter.
DOCTOR: While I understand your urgency, Ms. Sayar, I cannot compromise patient safety. There are no quick tests that will definitively rule out a potential allergic reaction or underlying condition. To issue a letter without proper due diligence would be irresponsible and could put your health at risk. I can offer you a referral to a fast-track allergist in the city, but even then, an appointment is unlikely to be available within the next 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I am willing to draft a letter stating that you have undergone preliminary medical assessment and are awaiting further evaluation by an allergist. However, the airline may require documentation from the allergist before allowing you to travel. This would be at your discretion. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. A letter stating I'm waiting for the allergist… That’s… better than nothing, I suppose. It's not ideal, but it might be enough. Yes, please. Draft that letter. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for trying to help.
DOCTOR: Very well. Allow me a few moments to draft the letter. Here you are. This letter outlines the preliminary assessment and your pending consultation with an allergist. It is up to Air Nomad to determine if this documentation is sufficient for travel. I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with the allergist as soon as possible. And please, if you experience any allergic symptoms – hives, difficulty breathing, swelling – seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your time and your honesty. I’ll schedule the appointment right away.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a safe trip, Ms. Sayar. .
