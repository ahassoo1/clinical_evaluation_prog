DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these… bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, both of ‘em, and they’re really bothering me. They’re red and kinda painful. Not all the time, but when I rub against somethin’… or even sometimes just when I’m standin’ around.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on both shins, red and painful, especially with friction or even just standing. I understand. And how long have you been noticing these bumps, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been a few weeks now, I guess. Maybe a month? It started with just one or two, and then more kept showin’ up. I didn’t think much of it at first, figured I just bumped ‘em on somethin’ at work. But now there’s quite a few, and they’re not goin’ away.
DOCTOR: A month, starting with just one or two and gradually increasing… and they’re not resolving on their own. Alright. Are they itchy at all, Mr. Aluia, besides being painful?
PATIENT: No, not really itchy. Mostly just sore. Like a bruise, kinda. Sometimes they feel warm too, if that makes sense. Not feverish warm, but… warmer than the rest of my skin, you know? It’s hard to explain. And they’re kinda hard, not squishy.
DOCTOR: Okay, sore, not itchy, slightly warm to the touch, and firm, not squishy. That’s helpful. And where do you work, Mr. Aluia, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, not at all. I work down at the warehouse, unloadin’ trucks mostly. Lots of standin’ and walkin’ around, and movin’ boxes, that sort of thing. It’s pretty physical work, if that matters. Dust and stuff too, sometimes. Been doin’ it for… oh, a long time now, close to forty years.
DOCTOR: Forty years at the warehouse - that’s a long time! Okay, standing, walking, moving boxes, potential dust exposure. That gives me some ideas. Do you remember anything specific that might have triggered the bumps appearing?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, it was hot that week, I remember that. And I was wearin’ different boots for a few days, 'cause my usual ones were gettin' fixed. Maybe that had somethin' to do with it? They weren't new boots, but they weren't broken in like my regulars. I just figured it was from rubbin’ against ‘em. But like I said, they haven’t gone away.
DOCTOR: Alright, hot weather and a change in footwear around the time they started. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, Mr. Aluia. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. . Blood pressure’s a little high sometimes, the doctor told me a while back, but I take a little pill for it. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains from gettin' old, you know? And I’m on Medicare now, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, just a little high blood pressure managed with medication. And Medicare is good to know. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And haven’t been in the hospital, thankfully. Broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin’ out of a mango tree, but that was a long time ago! They just put a cast on it. Not a big deal. Everything else has been… just colds and stuff, nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or significant hospitalizations, just a childhood broken arm and occasional colds. Now, thinking about your family... do you have any family members—parents, siblings, children—who have had similar skin problems, or any conditions like diabetes or circulation problems?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mom, she had kinda… sensitive skin, always complainin’ about rashes. But nothin’ like these bumps, not red and sore like this. My dad, he was a strong man, never really got sick. And my kids… they're both healthy, as far as I know. No skin problems or anything like that. We don’t talk about health much, to be honest. . You know how it is.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, sensitive skin in your mother, but no other significant family history of similar conditions. And you mentioned a medication for high blood pressure. What's the name of that medication, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Let me see… I got it right here. … It’s Lisinopril. That’s what the doctor told me to take, once a day. Been takin’ it for… oh, maybe five years now, somethin' like that. Keeps the pressure down pretty good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril once a day for high blood pressure for five years. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Never had a reaction to any medicine before. The doctor always asks, and I always tell ‘em the same thing. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Never been one to get sick easily, even when the kids bring home somethin’ from school.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Aluia, this is very helpful. Now, I’d like to take a look at those bumps on your shins. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. They’re right here, you see. They’re kinda hard, like I said. And they get more painful if I press on 'em.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see them. They are raised, red, and firm, as you described, and located on both shins. I'm noting some slight warmth to the touch. They do appear somewhat tender to palpation. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I'm seeing here, these could be shin splints with a secondary inflammatory reaction, or potentially a form of dermatitis caused by friction or irritation. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. Do you recall if these appeared after any strenuous activity, or perhaps after a long period of standing or walking?
PATIENT: Well, I was unloadin' a big shipment that week, a lot of heavy boxes. And like I said, I was wearin' different boots for a few days, 'cause mine were gettin' fixed. I was on my feet all day, runnin' back and forth. Maybe that had somethin' to do with it? I usually don't have any trouble, even with the heavy liftin', but maybe the boots made a difference. They weren't brand new, but they weren't broken in properly. I didn’t really think much of it at the time, just figured my legs were tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy workload with potentially ill-fitting boots. That's very pertinent information. To rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a couple of simple tests. First, a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection. And second, a skin biopsy of one of the bumps, just to get a closer look at the tissue under a microscope. That will help us determine the exact cause and ensure we're on the right track with treatment. Does that sound alright to you, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: A blood test and a little piece taken out of the bump? Hmm… Sounds alright, I guess. As long as it doesn’t hurt too much. . I just want to get rid of these bumps, they’re really bothering me. How long will it take to get the results? And where do I go for the blood test?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I'll make sure the biopsy is as painless as possible. It's a very quick procedure, and we'll numb the area beforehand. As for the blood test, you can go to the lab right across the street. I’ll write you a requisition form. And the results for both tests should be back within 5-7 business days. In the meantime, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible, avoiding strenuous activity, and wearing comfortable, well-fitting shoes. You can also try applying a cool compress to the area to help reduce inflammation. Do you have any questions about the tests, or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: Okay, rest, good shoes, cool compress… and the blood test across the street. I think I got it. Five to seven days for the results, that's alright. No, I don't think I have any more questions right now. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to me. I'll go across the street and get the blood test done right away.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I'm glad I could help. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. Here's the requisition form for the lab. The staff over there are very friendly and will take good care of you. And remember, try to rest those legs! We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results to discuss the next steps. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. You have a good day too. I appreciate everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
