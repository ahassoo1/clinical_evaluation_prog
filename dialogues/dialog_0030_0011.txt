DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Honcoop is the name. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s just get this over with. I need somethin’ signed so I can… well, get somethin’ done. A procedure. That’s all. I don’t recall exactly what it is, just that I need your okay.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you’re looking for me to sign off on a procedure. To ensure I can do that safely and appropriately, I’ll need a little more information. Do you recall who referred you for this procedure, or perhaps the name of the facility where it will be performed?
PATIENT: Facility? Refer-what-now? Look, I went to a… a man. Yes, a man. He works with… towers. Radio towers. Somethin’ like that. He said I needed this signed before… before he could do the fixin’. That’s all I know! Honestly, I don't pay attention to names. It was a while ago. This whole thing is a bother, really. Can't you just sign it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. However, I have a professional and ethical responsibility to ensure any procedure I authorize is medically appropriate and safe for you. Simply signing off on something without knowing the details could be harmful. Do you happen to have any paperwork from this "man" or the facility?
PATIENT: Paperwork? No, no paperwork. I told you, I don't keep things. It was all… verbal. He explained it to me. Somethin’ about lookin’ younger, I think? It’s all a blur. Look, I just want to get this done and be on my way. I ain't got time for paperwork and explanations. Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're seeking a quick solution, but I need to gather some information to ensure your well-being. A procedure to "look younger" could encompass many different treatments, some with significant risks. Without knowing exactly what is being proposed, I cannot ethically approve it. To help me understand, can you describe the procedure as best as you remember?
PATIENT: Look, it involved… needles. Yes, needles. And a cream. He put a cream on my face, then poked me with needles. Not a lot, but enough. Said it would tighten things up. That's it! Honestly, Doctor, I don’t remember much beyond that. It was a whole sales pitch, really. He talked a lot about radio waves and…collagen, I think? It’s all a mess in my head. Can you just ask him to send you somethin'? What's a fax number, anyway? I haven’t used one of those in years. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. It sounds like you may have undergone a cosmetic procedure involving injections and a topical cream, possibly aimed at improving skin tone or reducing wrinkles. Since you don’t have any paperwork and don’t recall the name or contact information of the practitioner, this is proving difficult. Do you remember approximately when you had this procedure done?
PATIENT: When…? Hmm. Let me think… It was… before the election. Yes, before the election. The one with… the lady. No, the other lady. Before she lost. That was… two years ago, maybe? Three? Time just slips away when you get to be my age. It definitely wasn't this year. I’d remember that. Look, can we just skip this part? I feel like I’m bein’ interrogated. It was a procedure, I want it signed, end of story. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I must reiterate that signing off on a procedure without knowing the details could be harmful. We are talking about injections into your face – there are risks of infection, scarring, and other complications. Given that you don’t have any information about the practitioner, the type of injections, or the substances used, I cannot ethically approve this procedure. I would strongly recommend against proceeding without this crucial information. Would you be open to me attempting to locate records for you?
PATIENT: Locate records? Doctor, with all due respect, that sounds like a whole lot of trouble for somethin' that probably isn't even a problem anymore. It's been years! And frankly, I doubt they keep records for… well, for people like me. This whole thing is a waste of time and money. Look, I’m not lookin' for trouble. I just want a signature. If you won’t sign it, fine. But don't expect me to come back here again. I'll find someone else. This is ridiculous. I’m done. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration. However, I must prioritize your safety and well-being. Authorizing a procedure without proper information is a breach of medical ethics. I strongly advise you to reconsider seeking treatment without knowing the specifics of what was done and the potential risks. If you are able to recall any information about the practitioner, please contact me. I wish you well.
