DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. My chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me a little, you know? Like a… a tight feeling. It started maybe a week ago.
DOCTOR: I see. A tight feeling in your chest that started about a week ago. Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Chelberg. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More like… someone is sitting on my chest. And it feels… heavy. Sometimes it goes up into my shoulder a little, this side. <points to left shoulder> It doesn’t go away completely, but it gets worse when I walk up the hill to the store, you know? Makes it hard to breathe good.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy, tight feeling, sometimes radiating to your left shoulder, and worsened with exertion like walking uphill. And it affects your breathing. I appreciate you being so descriptive, Ms. Chelberg. Has anything specific triggered these episodes, or does it seem to come on randomly when you're active?
PATIENT: Hmm… randomly, I think. Not like… if I eat something bad or anything. But… the hill always makes it worse. And… yesterday, I was washing dishes and bending over a lot, that made it feel tighter too. It didn't last long after I sat down, though. Just when I was bending.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, exertion and bending seem to be the main triggers. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest tightness?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Sometimes… I get a little short of breath, even when I'm not walking. Just… sitting and talking, sometimes. And… I think I get a little bit sweaty, when the chest hurts. Not a lot, but… a little. Oh, and my left arm feels… tingly sometimes. Not all the time, but when the chest feels bad.
DOCTOR: I see. Shortness of breath even at rest, some sweating with the chest discomfort, and tingling in your left arm. Those are important details, Ms. Chelberg. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Doctor, my memory isn't bad, but… it’s been a lot of years! I have Medicare, so I've seen doctors before, of course. I had… a bad gallbladder once, a long time ago, they took it out. And… my blood pressure, the doctor said it was a little high sometimes, years ago, but they gave me a little pill for it. I take that pill every day. I don’t remember the name, sorry. And… nothing else, I think. My husband, Ricardo, he knows more about that stuff.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Chelberg. That’s helpful. So, a history of gallbladder removal and a diagnosis of high blood pressure for which you take a daily medication—we’ll try to ascertain the name of that medication shortly. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the pill for the blood pressure. And… sometimes, I take something for my arthritis in my hands. It’s a little white pill, but I don't take it every day. Only when my hands really hurt. Ricardo buys it for me, he remembers the name. Oh! And sometimes I take a little bit of Tylenol for headaches. That's it, I think. Not much else.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, a medication for high blood pressure, a medication for arthritis as needed, and Tylenol for headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, and I haven't been stung by a bee in… oh, I can't even remember! Ricardo says I'm too tough for bees. <laughs softly> I don't have any trouble with pollen or anything like that, either. I garden a lot, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Chelberg. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had a little bit of trouble with her heart when she got old. She was very tired a lot, and she had to take water pills. My father was very healthy, a strong man. He lived to be 90! My brother, Ricardo’s brother, he had… diabetes, I think. He had to give himself shots. That's about it, I think. They're both gone now, so it’s hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Chelberg. That gives me a good overview. And finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I don't like the smell of it. Ricardo used to smoke a little when he was young, but he stopped a long time ago. He says it was a very bad habit. We both eat pretty healthy, I think. Lots of vegetables from my garden. We don't drink much alcohol, either. Just a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing crazy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Chelberg. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your hands and feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I'm happy to help. Just let me know if it will be cold. My hands get cold easily, you know. I'll sit right here. <gestures to the chair>
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chelberg. I’ll make sure everything is comfortable. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I’m hearing some mild crackles in your lungs. Your pulse is a little weak, but present. I also notice some swelling in your hands, consistent with the arthritis you mentioned. Your blood pressure is 140/90. Now, I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good. Tests? What kind of tests, Doctor? I don't like needles, you know. Is it something serious? <looks concerned> 140 over 90… is that bad? My husband always checks my pressure. He knows all about this stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Chelberg. Let me explain. 140/90 is a little elevated, and it suggests your blood pressure isn’t as well-controlled as we’d like. As for the tests, I'd like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check the electrical activity of your heart. We will also do a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and a blood test to check for certain markers that can indicate heart strain or other problems. The blood test will involve a small needle prick, and the EKG and X-ray are painless. These tests will help me determine the cause of your chest discomfort and develop the best course of treatment. It’s too early to say if it’s something serious, but it’s important to investigate these symptoms thoroughly to rule out any potential problems. I want to be cautious and make sure we get to the bottom of this. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Oh… well, if you think it’s best, Doctor. I don't like the sound of needles, but… I don’t want anything bad to happen. I do trust you. An X-ray and blood test… okay. But please, be quick with the needle. And… will Ricardo be able to come with me? He's better at understanding all this medical stuff. I get nervous, you know? Maybe he can come to the next appointment?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your nervousness, Ms. Chelberg. I will certainly be as quick as possible with the needle, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. Yes, absolutely, Ricardo is more than welcome to accompany you to the next appointment, and I encourage him to come. Having someone there for support and to help with understanding the results is a very good idea. I will have the nurse draw the blood now, and then we can schedule the chest X-ray for later today. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now, Doctor. Just… try not to hurt too much with the needle, okay? And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. You're a very kind doctor. <smiles weakly> Let's get it over with then, I guess. Where is the nurse?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chelberg. I’ll let the nurse know to be as gentle as possible. She's very skilled, and we'll have you seated comfortably. Nurse Ramirez, could you please come in and draw some blood for Ms. Chelberg?
