DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I… I believe I’m here for a check-up before a surgery? Something I’m hoping to have done. To be honest, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I don't recall all the details. My husband… he handled most of the arrangements.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. It's common to feel a little overwhelmed with arrangements, and we're here to help clarify everything. So, you're coming in for a pre-operative evaluation before a scheduled surgery. Do you recall what type of surgery you are hoping to have, even a general idea?
PATIENT: It was… something to do with my face, I believe. A… lifting, perhaps? Or tightening? He mentioned wanting me to feel more like myself again. It’s all a bit blurry, truly. I apologize for being so vague. It was after… after everything happened with my husband, and I wasn’t really thinking clearly about details like that.
DOCTOR: You don't need to apologize at all, Ms. Brightful. It's completely understandable that you wouldn't be focused on medical details after a difficult time. We'll figure it out together. “Lifting” or “tightening” suggests a facial plastic surgery procedure, likely a facelift or a browlift. To help me understand your situation better and ensure you are a good candidate for surgery, could you tell me a bit more about why you are considering this procedure?
PATIENT: Well… my husband, bless his soul, he always said I looked tired. And… I suppose I do. I look in the mirror, and I barely recognize myself anymore. It’s not just the wrinkles, though. It’s… a sadness, I think. He thought… he thought if I felt better about how I looked, it would help me feel better inside. He was a very kind man. I just… I want to feel like me again, if that makes sense. It feels like a part of me is… missing.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Brightful. It’s very common to want to restore a sense of self, and surgery can sometimes be a part of that process. It sounds like your husband was a very supportive person. To get a clearer picture of your overall health, could you please tell me about any medical conditions you have, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical conditions… Let me think. I don’t believe I have anything major. My blood pressure was a little high once, years ago, but the doctor said it was just stress. And… I had a bout of the flu last winter, but that’s about it. Nothing chronic, I don’t think. Oh! I do have allergies. Mostly pollen. They bother me terribly in the spring. Is that important? I take an over-the-counter antihistamine when it’s bad.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Brightful. That's helpful. Occasional high blood pressure and seasonal allergies are good to know. And it's good you manage your allergies with an over-the-counter antihistamine. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a very long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, when I was about ten. That required a cast, but I don’t think that counts as a surgery, does it? Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. No major hospital stays either, thankfully. Just the usual check-ups and things.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Brightful. And no significant hospitalizations. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me see… Mostly just the allergy medicine, when I need it. It’s… cetirizine, I think that’s the name. And I take a multivitamin every morning, just a standard one. Nothing fancy. Sometimes, when my joints ache, I’ll take ibuprofen, but that’s only occasionally. It’s over-the-counter, of course. I don’t take anything regularly, except for the multivitamin.
DOCTOR: Okay, so cetirizine as needed for allergies, a daily multivitamin, and ibuprofen occasionally for joint aches. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I eat everything, pretty much. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication before, as far as I can recall. My husband always said I was lucky that way. He used to joke that I could eat anything without getting sick. I did have a bee sting when I was a child, but that was just a local reaction, nothing serious. It didn’t require a trip to the hospital or anything.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Ms. Brightful. That's very helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… That's a bit of a difficult subject. My mother passed away when I was young, from… from heart trouble, I believe. And my father had diabetes, later in life. My brother is healthy, as far as I know, but we don’t see each other very often. I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ health. It was a long time ago, and my parents didn’t talk about it much. I’m afraid that’s not very helpful, is it?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Brightful. Knowing about your mother's heart trouble and your father's diabetes gives me a good starting point. It's perfectly understandable that you don't have detailed information about your grandparents' health. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle… Well, it's rather quiet, I'm afraid. After my husband passed away, I haven't been doing much. I live alone, and I mostly keep to myself. I enjoy gardening, when the weather is nice. It's very therapeutic. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I try to eat healthy, but sometimes I just don't have the energy to cook. I walk a little, when I can, but I'm not very active, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture, Ms. Brightful. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's understandable that your lifestyle has changed. It’s good you enjoy gardening and try to maintain a healthy diet. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any concerns or questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, I suppose my biggest concern is whether I’m even a good candidate for surgery. I just… I want to feel like myself again, but I don’t want to go through all of that if it’s not going to make a difference. And… I worry about the recovery. I don’t have anyone to help me much, so I’m a little scared of being alone afterwards. Is it a very painful procedure? And how long would I need to take off work?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Brightful, and very reasonable concerns. Let’s address them one by one. Determining whether you’re a good candidate for surgery requires a thorough physical exam and potentially some additional tests. We’ll assess your overall health, skin elasticity, and facial structure. As for pain, facial plastic surgery can be uncomfortable, but it’s managed with medication. We use a combination of local anesthesia and pain relievers to minimize discomfort. The level of pain varies from person to person. Regarding recovery, it typically takes several weeks to fully heal. You will have some swelling and bruising, and you’ll need to follow specific post-operative instructions. As for time off work, that depends on the type of surgery and your job. We can discuss that in more detail after the exam. Now, if you don’t mind, I'd like to perform a physical exam. This will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your face and neck. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. I suppose I should just get it over with, then. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with me. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not alarming. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to examine your face and neck. I’ll be looking at skin elasticity, muscle tone, and any areas of concern. I notice some skin laxity in the jowls and neck. The skin has good elasticity overall, but there’s some loss of volume in the cheekbones. I don't feel any unusual lumps or bumps. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. However, the skin laxity and volume loss are things we'll discuss further in relation to your surgical goals. Now, do you have any existing medical conditions or any history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a little tender, there. As for medical conditions, no, not really. I told you about the occasional high blood pressure, but nothing serious. And no, I’ve never had any problems with blood clots, thankfully. My husband always said I had good circulation, even in my old age. I just… I get cold hands and feet easily, if that counts for anything. But that’s been my whole life.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Brightful. Tenderness in the jawline is not uncommon, and we can address that during the surgical planning. Cold hands and feet can be a sign of poor circulation, but it's often benign. We’ll keep that in mind during your evaluation. Now, to get a better understanding of your health, I would like to order some routine blood work. This will help us assess your overall health, check your blood count, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to make sure I’m healthy enough for this, if it’s even possible. I just… I don’t want to cause any trouble. I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to be cautious, Ms. Brightful. It's important to be thorough, and that's exactly what we're doing. The blood work is a standard precaution, and it will help us make the best decision for your health and safety. I’ll have my nurse draw the samples right away. It will only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and talk about your surgical options in more detail. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient with me. I appreciate it more than you know. I just… I really want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Brightful. It’s not too much to ask at all. We’re here to help you achieve that. We will do everything we can to make that happen. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood now. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
