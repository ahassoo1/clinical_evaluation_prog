DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Gibbel, Percell, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Percell. Just Percell is fine, though. Most folks call me that. And you are…?
DOCTOR: Dr. Memmolo. Ronnisha Memmolo. Now, let's not get bogged down in formalities. You're 84, and I have… a lot of patients. So, Percell, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this headache. Back of my head, mostly. Been going on for… oh, goodness. A couple weeks now, I reckon. Not constant, comes and goes. Feels like a dull ache, nothin’ sharp. It’s just…annoying, you know? And it feels different than my usual aches and pains. I’ve lived a long life, got a few creaks here and there, but this is…new.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks… right. New headache. And you say it’s…dull?
PATIENT: Yep, dull. Not like a splitting migraine or anything. More like… someone’s tightened a band around my head, but not too tight. It doesn't make me nauseous or anything, and light doesn’t bother me. It just… is there. Sometimes it’s worse when I’m tryin’ to concentrate, like readin’ the paper. Other times, not so much. It’s kinda unpredictable, really.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable. And you said it’s in the back of your head. Any other symptoms accompanying this…headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I sleep alright, maybe a little restless sometimes, but that’s usual for an old man. Appetite’s been okay, I’m still enjoyin’ my food. I haven't felt dizzy or anything like that. Oh! Now that you mention it, I've been a little more forgetful lately, but honestly, at my age, who isn't? I remember things pretty good normally, but… little things slip my mind now and then. Like what I had for breakfast yesterday. Which…was probably eggs. I think.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness… right. And normal appetite, normal sleep. Let’s move on. Any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to start? I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox. Nothing serious. Back in the service, I got a shrapnel wound to my leg, but they patched me right up. And… well, I had my gallbladder removed maybe twenty years ago. Other than that, not much. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin’ like that. I used to smoke, a pack a day, but I quit about thirty years ago. Best thing I ever did. Still breathin’, ain’t I?
DOCTOR: Shrapnel wound, gallbladder removal, past smoker… Alright. Any family history of…anything?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mama, she lived to be 92, strong woman. She had arthritis somethin’ awful towards the end, but other than that, she was pretty healthy. My papa… he didn’t live as long. He passed when I was still a boy, heart trouble, I think. And… my sister, she had high blood pressure, but she managed it with medicine. I don’t really know much about the rest of the family, to be honest. We weren’t close, and most of ‘em are gone now. Things were different back then, you know? Folks didn't talk about this sort of thing much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I pride myself on that, actually. I don’t like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. Always figured the less you put in your body, the better. I take a multivitamin now and then, just to be safe, but that’s about it. I try to eat healthy, get a little exercise when I can, and just… take it easy. Seems to be workin’ alright so far, wouldn’t ya say? Considering I’m still kickin’ at 84!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look at you, then. Just a basic exam. If you don't mind.
PATIENT: No, no, not at all. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors pokin’ and proddin’. Just try not to find too many things wrong with me, alright? I’m gettin’ too old to fix ‘em.
DOCTOR: Lymph nodes are within normal limits. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Respiratory rate is 16. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Now, let's check your neurological function. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally in all extremities. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Coordination is intact. No focal neurological deficits noted.
PATIENT: Well, that’s good to hear, isn’t it? Everything workin’ like it should, as far as I can tell. Though I always did have a pretty good memory, even before this headache. So I’m not surprised everything’s checkin’ out alright up there. What do you think it is, Doc? Is it somethin’ serious? I’m tryin’ not to worry, but an old man can’t help but wonder, ya know?
DOCTOR: Given your age and the description of your symptoms, and the unremarkable neurological exam… it's likely a tension headache. Stress, perhaps. Or just the natural aches and pains of getting older. But, to be thorough, I’d like to order a basic blood workup – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – just to rule out anything else. And I think an MRI of the brain would be prudent, given your age. It's best to be cautious.
PATIENT: Blood work and an MRI, huh? Well, alright, if you think it’s best. I always did trust a good doctor’s judgment. Though an MRI sounds… complicated. Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I don’t like bein’ stuck in small spaces, to be honest. I was never good with enclosed places. And how much is all this gonna cost? I'm on a fixed income, ya know. I didn't get insured after my divorce. It just...never seemed worth the expense.
DOCTOR: The MRI is non-invasive. You lie flat on a table, and it uses magnets and radio waves to create an image of your brain. It’s noisy, but it doesn’t hurt. As for the cost… I’m not certain. You’ll need to speak with the billing department. They can discuss payment options. I’ll write the orders now. I’m also going to prescribe you a mild anti-inflammatory to help with the headache in the meantime. But, honestly, Percell, try to manage your stress. And ensure adequate hydration. That often helps with tension headaches. Here are the orders for the blood work and the MRI. And the prescription. Schedule those appointments as soon as possible. We'll review the results at your next appointment. Is there anything else you want to discuss?
PATIENT: Well, that's a lot all at once. Magnets and radio waves… sounds like somethin' outta a science fiction movie. I’ll try to manage the stress, Doc. Easier said than done, though, with all this goin’ on. And I’ll get those appointments scheduled. No, I don’t think there’s anything else at the moment. Just… thank you for takin’ the time to listen. And for tryin’ to figure out what’s wrong with this old head of mine. I appreciate it.
