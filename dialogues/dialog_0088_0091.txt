DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. I'm Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Piet. Well, is just… I does be feeling real thirsty all the time. And hungry too! Even after I eat a good plate of food, I feel like I need more. Is not normal, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling very thirsty and hungry, even after eating – that’s definitely something we should look into. And you say this isn't normal for you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Is not at all. I always have a good appetite, yes, but this is different. I drinking water like a fish now! And I eating, and eating… it frightening me a little, to be honest. My husband, he say I need to come and see you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long have you been feeling this increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I think is start maybe… two months now? Maybe a little less. Is not sudden like, one day I just start. Is just… get worse and worse slowly. I does try to drink less water, but I just have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, two months, gradually getting worse. Have you noticed any other changes along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Well… now that you ask… I does have to go to the bathroom more often, yes. Especially at night. Waking me up and all. And I does feel a little tired, you know? Not sick tired, just… sluggish. Is hard to explain. I just not have the same energy like before.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urination, especially at night, and some fatigue. Do you have any blurry vision or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Blurry vision? No, not really. My eyesight always was a little bad, so I wear glasses. Is the same, I think. Weight loss… hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself, but my clothes feel a little looser, maybe? But I don't know if is because of the heat, you know? Is very hot these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Hmm… let me see. My mother, she was a little sick when she get older. I does remember my auntie, she was sick too, she always had to go to the doctor. But I don’t know what was wrong with them. They never really talk about it. Is a long time ago. I don't know if is that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any pills. I don’t like taking pills. And I don’t think I have any allergies, no. I never had a problem with any medicine before. Just the usual little headache now and then, I take a paracetamol if I need.
DOCTOR: Alright. And could you tell me a little bit about what a typical day of eating looks like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I does wake up, have a little coffee with some bread. Then for lunch, usually rice and stew, with some chicken or fish. My husband, he does the cooking mostly. Then dinner is usually something lighter, like soup or roti. I does like my food, yes. And I does have a little sweet now and then, a biscuit or a piece of fruit. Nothing too much, I try not to. But I does like a little treat sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you do much exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise? Not really, Doctor. I does walk a little, go to the market and back, that’s about it. I used to do more when I was younger, but I get older now, you know? My knees does bother me sometimes. I does mostly just sit and relax when I not working. Is a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Bianca, based on what you've told me – the increased thirst, increased urination, hunger, fatigue, and some possible weight loss – it would be good to run some tests to check your blood sugar levels. It could be a number of things, but these symptoms are often seen in diabetes. I'd like to do a blood test and a urine test, if that's alright with you.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think is best, I trust your judgement. I just want to know what is wrong with me, you know? I don’t like feeling like this. So yes, please do the tests. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Alright, I'm going to have the nurse draw some blood and collect a urine sample. It will just be a small amount of blood, and for the urine sample, I'll give you a cup and instructions on how to collect it. It’s important to drink normally before the urine test. We’ll send these off to the lab, and we should have the results back in a couple of days. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That sounds… alright. A couple of days is fine. You explain everything very clear. So I just drink normal water before the… the pee test? And then the nurse will take some blood? Is that all? I think I understand. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Drink normally before the urine test, and the nurse will take some blood. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them with you and figure out the best course of action. I’ll have the nurse come in and get started. Thank you for coming in today, Bianca.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I just hope is nothing too serious. I feel a little anxious now, to be honest. But I trust you.
