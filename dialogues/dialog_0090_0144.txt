DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Kur, was it? Honestly, I can't quite recall why I scheduled this appointment. My daughter, bless her heart, she's always fussing over my health. She probably thought I needed a check-up or something. It's just... things get a little fuzzy these days, you know? I'm not feeling ill, not particularly. Just... curious, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, fuzzy. Like an old radio signal. Not everything is gone, mind you. I remember being a surgical tech for… well, a long time. And I know my way around a kitchen, still. But dates? Names of people I met last week? Forget about it. It's rather embarrassing, actually. I used to have a very good memory.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, this is primarily a concern about memory loss. And it seems to be relatively recent in onset, and affecting recall more than… well, more than knowing who you are or how to do things?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, exactly! It’s not like I don’t know my own name, goodness no. And I still manage to keep the house tidy, mostly. It’s just… remembering what Mrs. Henderson said about her cat yesterday? Gone. What I had for lunch? Usually gone. And don’t even ask me about appointments! That’s why my daughter is always involved. She handles all that now. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this memory loss been getting progressively worse?
PATIENT: Progressively… hmm. That’s a good question. It’s hard to say, really. There are some days it seems… better. And some days… well, some days I feel like a complete nincompoop. But overall? I suppose it has been getting a little worse. Not drastically, you understand. Just… a slow fade, like an old photograph. It's just… worrisome. My husband, bless his soul, he always had a sharp mind. I don’t want to end up like… well, never you mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re recognizing this is a change. Now, let’s talk a little more broadly. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Other than being forgetful? Well, sometimes I feel a little… unsteady on my feet. Not enough to fall, mind you. Just a little wobbly. And my hands… they sometimes tremble a bit when I’m trying to do something delicate, like threading a needle. But I just figured that was old age catching up with me. Is that… is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: The unsteadiness and tremors are relevant. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision? Not that I've noticed, no. I get my eyes checked every year, and they always tell me I just need stronger glasses. And they keep increasing the strength! It's getting ridiculous. Everything's a blur without them. But no sudden changes, no double vision, nothing like that. Just… the usual getting older. Is that a good sign or a bad sign?
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you experience any difficulty with speaking?
PATIENT: Speaking? No, I don't think so. I'm talking to you just fine, aren’t I? Though sometimes... sometimes I stumble over my words, search for the right one. But that happens to everyone, doesn't it? It’s just a momentary lapse, nothing to worry about. My daughter keeps telling me I need to slow down, that I rush everything. She worries too much, that girl.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me years ago. I take a little pink pill every morning for it. And... I think I had a touch of diabetes, but it went away with diet. My husband, he had heart trouble, but I don't... well, I’ve had the usual aches and pains, but nothing serious. I try to stay active, you know? Gardening keeps me busy. Does that make a difference?
DOCTOR: Alright, so hypertension, controlled with medication, and a history of gestational diabetes. Do you recall any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries... Oh dear. Now that’s a tough one. I was a surgical tech for so long, I’ve seen all sorts of operations. But my operations… Let me see… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… and I think I had a hysterectomy, but honestly, it was so long ago, I barely remember. And… oh! I broke my wrist when I was a child, but that was… well, a very long time ago. Is that enough? I’m not very good at remembering things, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family... My husband passed away five years ago. We didn't have any children, sadly. Always wanted them, but... it just wasn't meant to be. I have a sister, she lives in California, but we don’t see each other much. She’s always been… independent. And... that’s about it, really. A few cousins, but we’re not close. It's just been me for a while now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies... hmm. Not that I know of, no. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to take a lot of over-the-counter remedies when I was younger, for headaches and such, and never had a problem. My daughter always asks me, and I always tell her the same thing. No allergies. Though… now that I think about it, sometimes my skin gets a little itchy after I use certain soaps. But that could just be dry skin, you know? I wouldn't say I have a real allergy.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... Just the pink pill, like I said. And... sometimes I take something for arthritis in my hands, when they’re really bothering me. It's a little white pill, I think. I get it at the drugstore. And… oh! I take a vitamin D supplement, my daughter makes me. She says I don't get enough sunshine. She worries so much. That’s about it, I think. I try not to take too many pills. Is that everything?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… please be gentle, my bones aren’t what they used to be. And don’t be alarmed if I wobble a little, like I said. Let’s get it over with, shall we? The sooner we figure things out, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just sit up here for me. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though breath sounds are slightly diminished in the bases. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 140/88. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, let’s take a look at your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished, but symmetrical. And finally, I'd like to do a brief cognitive assessment, just a few simple questions to get a better idea of your memory and thinking skills. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… thorough. As long as it doesn’t take too long. My mind isn’t always cooperating these days, you know. Just… try to be patient with me, Doctor. I’ll do my best. And please, don't make me do anything too complicated. I never was very good at puzzles or anything like that. Go ahead, then. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to ask you a few simple questions, and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Today’s date... hmm. Let me see... It’s… August? Yes, it’s definitely August. But the… the day? Oh, goodness. I… I think it’s the 2nd? Or maybe the 3rd? I always get them mixed up. Is that bad? I know it’s August, I just… the specific date escapes me. I had a calendar on the fridge, but my daughter took it down, said it was cluttering things up. Now I’m completely lost.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Calvery. It happens. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s another tricky one. Let me see… Is it… 2024? No, wait. It feels like it's later than that. Is it 2025? Yes, I think it’s 2025. But I could be wrong. I lost track of things after my husband passed. Everything just… blurred together. It’s just… hard to keep up, you know? So many years come and go, and they all start to sound the same.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words. Listen carefully, and I want you to repeat them back to me right after I say them. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Apple, table, penny... Apple… table… and… penny. Did I say them right? I always have trouble with remembering things like that. My mind just… slips. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you a different question. Can you tell me who the current President of the United States is?
PATIENT: Oh dear. The President? Oh, goodness. That's… that's a difficult one. Is it… is it still Mr. Biden? I think so. But I'm not very good with politics, you know. I never paid much attention. Is that wrong? Is that right? I heard something on the news, but I don't remember the details. It all just gets mixed up in my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery. That’s enough for now. I think we have enough information. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief cognitive assessment I just conducted, it appears you’re experiencing some cognitive decline, specifically affecting your memory and recall. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis at this point, but your symptoms are concerning enough that I recommend further evaluation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Cognitive decline? What… what does that mean? Is it… is it serious? Am I losing my mind? I knew something wasn’t right. I just… I didn’t want to admit it. My daughter will be so worried. This is… this is frightening. What happens now? What kind of evaluation? Will it hurt? Will I… will I have to go somewhere?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Calvery. Let's take this one step at a time. "Cognitive decline" simply means that your thinking skills are decreasing, and memory loss is often the first sign. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re “losing your mind,” as you put it. There are many possible causes, some of which are treatable, and some of which are simply part of the natural aging process. The evaluation I recommend is a series of tests performed by a neurologist – a doctor who specializes in the brain and nervous system. It’s not painful; it’s mostly just answering questions and performing simple tasks. It will help us determine the underlying cause of your memory loss and develop a plan to manage it. We’ll need to rule out other possibilities, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems, with some blood work. I’ll also order an MRI of your brain to get a more detailed look. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That… that sounds… manageable. As long as it’s not too painful. And as long as I don’t have to go too far. My daughter, she can drive me, I suppose. But… what if they find something serious? What if it is something… bad? I… I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. I just want to… be myself, you know? But I’m afraid… I’m afraid I’m losing that. Will the tests tell me… how bad it is? And is there… anything they can do?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be frightened, Ms. Calvery. And it's good that you're asking these questions. The tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on, and we'll discuss the results thoroughly. There are treatments available, depending on the cause of your cognitive decline. These might include medications to help improve memory, therapy to help with coping strategies, and lifestyle changes to support brain health. Even if we do find something serious, we'll work together to develop a plan to manage it and ensure you maintain the best possible quality of life. You're not alone in this, Ms. Calvery. I’ll be here to support you every step of the way, and so will your daughter. I'm going to refer you to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist at City Hospital. She’s excellent. I'll also order the blood work and the MRI. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results of the tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Yes, that… that sounds good. Dr. Sharma, you say? I’ll… I’ll write that down. And the tests… two weeks. It feels like a long time, but… I suppose I should get it over with. My daughter will be relieved, I think. She’s been worried about me for months. She'll handle the scheduling, I’m sure. I just… I hope it’s not too bad. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for… listening. And for not dismissing me. It’s… it’s a relief to finally know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. I suppose… I suppose we should get started then. The sooner it’s over with, the better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Calvery. It’s my job to listen and to help you find answers. And remember, you’ve taken the first step, and that’s the most important thing. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw the blood work now, and we'll get the MRI scheduled. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Sharma. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll face this together. .
