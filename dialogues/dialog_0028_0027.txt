DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Memmolo. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, no offense, but I haven’t got all day. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. Reflux, the nurse said. It’s just… unpleasant. Been happening a bit more lately, and my wife says I need to get it checked. Honestly, I don’t see what the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “a bit more lately” is rather vague. When did this start becoming more frequent?
PATIENT: Vague? Honestly! It’s been… oh, maybe three weeks, give or take. I don’t keep a diary of my stomach troubles, you know. It's not like it's a life-threatening illness. I eat, sometimes it comes back up. Simple as that. Is that good enough for your computer?
DOCTOR: Three weeks. And is it after every meal, or just certain ones?
PATIENT: Certain ones. Definitely certain ones. Rich foods, mostly. Steak, gravy... things a man should be eating, if you ask me. Not this rabbit food everyone's pushing these days. It's hardly a surprise when it comes back up, with all the… additives in everything. Though, honestly, it happens sometimes with just a sandwich, too. It's unpredictable. Really, it's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Do you experience any… burning in your chest?
PATIENT: Burning? Well, not burning exactly. More of a… warm discomfort. Sometimes. It’s not like a fire, if that’s what you’re getting at. More like… indigestion. A little bit of pressure. Look, are we going to get to the point of this, or are you going to ask me about every little twinge I’ve ever felt? My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does this discomfort radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate? Is that a medical term? Honestly, you doctors and your fancy words. It… goes up a bit, I suppose. Up my chest, towards my throat sometimes. But it's not painful. Just… there. Like something's not sitting right. And it tastes awful, when it does come up. Like… bile, I think. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Bile. Any nausea, besides when you’re actually vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea? Not… regularly. Sometimes, if it happens a lot, I feel a bit queasy afterwards. But I wouldn’t say I’m sick to my stomach, if that makes sense. More just… off. Like I need to lie down. It's not something I dwell on, mind you. I just… get on with things. I haven't got time for feeling sorry for myself. Are you writing all this down? I hope so, because I'm not repeating it.
DOCTOR: Any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Goodness, no. If anything, I could stand to lose a few pounds. My wife is always on my case about it. No, definitely no weight loss. I eat a good, hearty diet, as I said. Steak, potatoes… normal man’s food. It's just… this. The unfortunate consequence of enjoying life a little too much, maybe. Though I hardly think that's a crime.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just… a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor at home prescribed it. A small pill, every morning. Other than that, no. I don't believe in filling myself with chemicals unless I absolutely have to. And frankly, I didn't think this… regurgitation warranted a prescription. Honestly, I thought we were just talking about it. Are you going to actually do something, or just interrogate me?
DOCTOR: What's the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Look, are you serious? I don’t memorize every little thing. It’s a white pill. Small, round, white… That’s all I know! My wife handles the refills. She's very organized. Honestly, this is ridiculous. You're asking me to be a pharmacist now? I’m here because of this problem, not because I’m suddenly a medical expert. Can we please focus?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. Not to pills, not to food, not to anything. I’m a robust Polish man, Doctor. We don't get allergies. It's a weakness, if you ask me. Frankly, I'm starting to think this whole appointment is a waste of my time. I expect a quick solution, and I expect it now.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your chest, and then we can discuss a plan. Please lie back on the examination table. Lungs clear. Some mild wheezing, but likely unrelated. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Honestly, I've had more thorough examinations at the DMV. Is that all you’re going to do? Just poke and listen? I was hoping for some kind of actual diagnosis, not just a cursory check-up. And “mild wheezing”? What does that even mean? Is it serious? I need straight answers, Doctor, not medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Given your symptoms, and the brief examination, it sounds like you likely have gastroesophageal reflux disease - GERD. It’s common, particularly with rich foods. The wheezing is a minor finding, probably unrelated. We can try a proton pump inhibitor - a medication to reduce stomach acid. I’ll write you a prescription. Also, I recommend avoiding late-night meals, elevating the head of your bed, and limiting spicy or fatty foods.
PATIENT: Proton… what? Look, are you trying to confuse me again? Another pill? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a human guinea pig. And “avoid spicy foods”? What kind of life is that? I like a little flavor! I’ve been eating the way I eat for sixty years and I'm fine! Fine. Just write the prescription. I’ll try it. But if it doesn't work, I’m not coming back. And frankly, I expect a full refund.
DOCTOR: Here's your prescription. Follow the instructions carefully. If symptoms persist or worsen, then you should consider seeing a gastroenterologist. That's all. Have a good day. .
