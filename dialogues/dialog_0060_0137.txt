DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. I need… paper for the old people’s home. My husband, he need go there soon. They need to know I am okay, yes? To let him go.
DOCTOR: Right. Paperwork… for the facility. And you need me to… confirm your health status for them?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. They want to know… everything. If I am strong enough to take care of things if… if something happen to him. I have insurance, good insurance. Private. But they need the doctor to say. You understand?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, they need a general assessment of your health. Let’s start with that, then. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… the normal check-ups. Many years ago. I feel okay, mostly. A little tired, but who is not tired? My age, you know. But nothing… serious. I don’t take many pills. Just for my… water. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: "For your water"... do you mean you have trouble with your bladder?
PATIENT: Yes. A little. Old lady problem, you know? I go to the… place. Many times. It’s embarrassing. But it’s okay. I drink a lot of water. That’s why. It’s not so bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from that, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Maybe… I forget things sometimes. But who doesn’t? Old age, yes? I remember important things. My husband, my family. But… small things. Where I put my glasses. What I eat for breakfast. It’s normal, I think. Not so bad.
DOCTOR: And how about your appetite?
PATIENT: I eat. Yes. Not so much as before, maybe. But I like to eat. My husband, he makes very good food. Rice and beans, mostly. And chicken. I try to eat healthy. But sometimes, I want a little sweet thing. Chocolate. You know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you been experiencing any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. My knees, a little. When I walk too much. And my back. Old lady back. But it's not… bad bad pain. Just… ache. I take nothing for it. It comes and goes. Like the weather.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's just do a quick check of your vitals and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better sense of things. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your joints. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Okay. Whatever you need. I want to help. Just… be gentle with my old bones. They are very fragile, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Abdollahi. I will be very gentle. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Is it bad if it is… high? My husband, he sometimes gets very angry when my numbers are high. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: It's a little elevated, Ms. Abdollahi, but we'll discuss that. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious right now. We just need to keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Alright. Now, can you just try to stand up and walk a few steps for me, so I can see how your joints are doing?
PATIENT: Ow. A little. My knees… they complain. Is it bad? Is something broken?
DOCTOR: No, I don’t think anything is broken, Ms. Abdollahi. It seems you have some mild arthritis in your knees, which is very common at your age. There's some tenderness and a little bit of swelling. It explains the discomfort when you walk. We can discuss some options to help manage the pain. Now, just to finish up, could you tell me if you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I haven't taken much medicine in my life. A little pain pill sometimes, for my back. But nothing… serious. No, no allergies. I think. I would remember, yes? If I was allergic.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the pill for my water. Sometimes. When I need it. That's all. It is… small. White. I get it from the… place. The pharmacy. But not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Ms. Abdollahi, that gives me a good starting point. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam I’ve done, it seems you’re generally in fairly good health for your age. You have some mild arthritis in your knees and your blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing that needs immediate attention. I can write a letter to the facility confirming your health status, including these findings. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. That would be very good. My husband will be very happy. Thank you so much. You have been very kind. Is it much trouble? The letter?
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: Not at all, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s my job. I'll get that letter prepared and we can arrange for it to be sent to the facility. Do you have the address for them? And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
