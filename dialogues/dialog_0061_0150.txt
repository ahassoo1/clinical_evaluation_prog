DOCTOR: Bula! Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you, Angelle. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, honestly? I don’t have time for this, but my daughter insisted. She says I should “get checked out” before… well, before I try for another baby. I’m 51, you know. It’s not like things are easy at my age. I want to make sure everything’s… working, if you know what I mean, before I get my hopes up. And I certainly don't want any complications.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Angelle. It’s very responsible of you to think ahead, and your daughter is right to encourage you to get a check-up. It’s good to be prepared, especially when considering pregnancy at any age, but certainly as you get older. So, to start, can you tell me a little more about why you’re wanting to try for a baby now?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's… complicated. My divorce was final about a year ago. It wasn't a happy situation, and frankly, I want a… a do-over. A family of my own, properly done. I already have a grown son, but… he’s busy with his life. And I’m not getting any younger. I want a little one to… well, to love and to spoil. Is that so strange? Don't tell me about waiting too long, I've heard it all before. I just want to know if it’s even possible without… everything going wrong.
DOCTOR: Not strange at all, Angelle. That sounds perfectly reasonable, and it’s wonderful that you’re thinking about what would bring you happiness. It takes courage to consider starting a family later in life. Okay, let's focus on what we can do to see if it's possible and what steps we might need to take to make it as safe as possible. First, can you tell me a little about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh. Cycles. Honestly, they’re a mess. They've been… irregular for years. It’s not like when I was younger. Sometimes they come every few months, sometimes longer. Sometimes they're heavy, sometimes barely anything. I stopped keeping track ages ago, to be honest. It’s just… stressful. Is that important? I really don't understand why we need to know all these details. It just is. Does it matter if I don’t remember exactly when the last one was?
DOCTOR: I understand it can be stressful, and it's completely okay that you haven't been keeping track. Irregular cycles are very common as we get older, and it is important information. It helps us understand your hormone levels and assess if everything is functioning as it should. Roughly, can you give me an estimate of when your last period was?
PATIENT: Honestly? I'd have to think. Let me see… It was… sometime last autumn, I think. October, maybe? November? It was cold, definitely. I was preparing for the holidays. I really can’t be precise. I was busy with… things. Does it really matter that much? I keep telling you, I don’t have time for this minute-by-minute accounting.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly October or November. That’s helpful. It's okay if it’s not exact. We can also do some blood tests to get a clearer picture of your hormone levels, which will give us even more information. Now, have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I had my son, Thomas, nearly thirty years ago. It was… a normal pregnancy, as far as I recall. No complications, thankfully. A bit difficult at the end, but what pregnancy isn’t? I delivered him naturally, no trouble. That was… a long time ago, though. Things might be different now. I had… some trouble afterward, but nothing serious. Just… the usual, I suppose. Does it matter what happened then? It feels like a different life.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you had a previous, uncomplicated pregnancy. And yes, it does matter. It gives us a baseline to work with. You mentioned some trouble afterward – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Honestly, it was mostly… emotional. Postpartum depression, I think they called it. It wasn't anything physical, thankfully. Just… feeling very sad and overwhelmed. I didn’t want to talk about it much at the time. It was a difficult period. My mother helped out, mostly. I don’t remember the details, it was so long ago. I just want to ensure I won't experience that again if I… if I go through with this. It wasn’t pleasant. I don't need a repeat of that, believe me.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable you wouldn’t want to repeat that experience, and it's brave of you to share that with me. Postpartum depression is very common, and it’s important to be aware of the risk factors and have a plan in place should it happen again. We can definitely discuss that in more detail, and resources available to you. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Goodness, no! I'm perfectly healthy, for my age. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I walk every day, I eat reasonably well, I’m not a smoker. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was just… a nuisance. Otherwise, I’m fine. Perfectly fine. I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it's nothing serious. My doctor always says I’m in good shape. Honestly, I don’t understand why we're going through all this. I’m a healthy woman. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Angelle, and I appreciate you telling me you’re generally healthy. We’re just trying to get a complete picture to ensure your safety and the safety of a potential pregnancy. Even being generally healthy, certain conditions or medications can affect pregnancy, and it’s best to be thorough. Let's make a list. No gallbladder, some arthritis. Good. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not! I’ve told you, I’m healthy! I get my blood pressure checked at my annual physical, and it’s always perfectly normal. And diabetes? Don’t be ridiculous. My mother had it, but I did not inherit that. I eat too much chocolate, maybe, but that’s hardly diabetes. Honestly, this is wasting my time. I just want to know if it’s possible, not a detailed audit of my entire life!
DOCTOR: Okay, no high blood pressure, no diabetes. I understand your frustration, Angelle, and I apologize if it feels like a detailed audit. I want to assure you, we're getting closer to being able to give you an answer. Let’s move onto medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: Ugh. Just my arthritis medication, of course. A little something for the knees. It's a… a cream, mostly. And sometimes I take ibuprofen when it flares up, but that’s it. Nothing else. Definitely nothing for blood pressure or… anything else. Honestly, I try to avoid medications as much as possible. They just make me feel… sluggish. Is that important? You’re making this so complicated!
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis cream and ibuprofen as needed. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I get a little sniffly in the spring, but who doesn't? And I can't eat shellfish, but that's a dislike, not an allergy. It just… makes me sick. It's been that way since I was a child. Nothing serious. Really, I don't have any real allergies. Are we done yet? This is taking forever!
DOCTOR: Okay, sniffles in spring, dislike of shellfish. That’s helpful. Alright, Angelle, we’ve covered a lot. Now, to get a clearer picture of your hormone levels and overall health, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and order some blood tests. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to do tests? After all this questioning? Fine. Just get it over with. I have things to do, you know. And make it quick, please. I really don't have the patience for this. And please, tell me the results quickly. I don't want to be waiting around for weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand, and I’ll do my best to make it as quick and efficient as possible. I'll explain everything as we go. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll do a quick abdominal exam. After that, we’ll just need a small blood sample for the tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just… be gentle, alright? And don’t poke around too much. Honestly, I'm not looking forward to this at all. Just get it done. I need to know if this is even feasible, or if I’m wasting my time. The sooner you tell me, the better. And no unnecessary probing, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… good. Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any discomfort. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Everything seems normal so far, Angelle. Now, the blood tests will give us a more detailed picture. We’ll check your hormone levels, thyroid function, and some basic blood counts.
PATIENT: Good. That's… reassuring, I suppose. Just get the blood drawn, please. And tell me quickly, alright? I really don't want to sit around waiting for weeks for results. I have a life, you know. And I'm not getting any younger. The sooner I know, the better. Where do we go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. The lab is just down the hall, room 3. The phlebotomist is expecting you. They'll take about five vials of blood. Once the results are back – usually within 3-5 business days – my nurse, Sarah, will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Here's the requisition form. Just hand this to the phlebotomist. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that's all. Just… get it over with, alright? And make sure Sarah actually calls. I don’t have time to chase people down. Honestly, this whole thing has been a waste of time. Just… call when you have the results. And make it quick. .
DOCTOR: Alright. We will. Have a good day, Angelle. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
