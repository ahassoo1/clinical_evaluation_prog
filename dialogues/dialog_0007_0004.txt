DOCTOR: Hi Teah, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Hernandez, nice to meet you too. It’s just a routine check-up, really. Gotta keep up with my shots, you know? My husband always reminds me. He’s good about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear you're staying on top of things! Preventative care is really important. And it’s great your husband encourages that. Just to be thorough, even though it's a routine check-up, can you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling overall lately?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, pretty good! No complaints, really. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just part of getting older, I guess. I’ve been working quite a bit with the new building project down by the river, so that's probably it. Otherwise, I feel strong and healthy. No aches or pains or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear! Working on a building project sounds demanding though. Okay, so no new aches, pains, or major changes. Just some expected fatigue. Let’s just run through a quick review of systems – just a few questions to cover all the bases. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. I think my appetite's been… normal? Maybe a little smaller lately, but nothing drastic. And weight... honestly, I haven't weighed myself in a while. Probably haven't lost or gained much, though. I eat pretty much the same as always - lots of salmon, when we can get it, and whatever my husband cooks. He's a pretty good cook, so I don't usually complain!
DOCTOR: Okay, normal appetite, maybe slightly smaller, and stable weight. That’s helpful. Have you had any trouble with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… well, sometimes it takes me a little while to get to sleep, but once I'm out, I sleep pretty soundly. I don’t wake up a lot during the night. Maybe I toss and turn a bit more than I used to, but nothing that keeps me from getting a good few hours, you know? It’s not like I’m dragging myself around all day from lack of sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, some difficulty falling asleep, but generally good sleep quality. Good. Any changes in your bowel habits or bladder function?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, everything's pretty regular, if you know what I mean. No problems there! Nothing out of the ordinary, thankfully. Bladder's fine too. I drink plenty of water, so... yeah. All good on that front. I hope you don’t mind me talking about this. It feels a little personal.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Teah. It’s important to cover everything, and I appreciate you being open with me. It's all part of getting a complete picture of your health. Okay, let's move on to some medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Not really. I had a bit of trouble with my knees when I was younger, from dancing, but that’s all pretty much healed up now. And I had the usual childhood things, you know, chickenpox, measles… but nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing like that. My family is pretty healthy, all things considered. Oh! I did have a really bad flu a few years back, but I recovered fully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical diagnoses, some childhood illnesses, knee issues in the past that have resolved, and a previous case of the flu. That’s helpful. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No surgeries, thankfully. Never needed any of those. And I’ve only been in the hospital once, when I gave birth to my son. Everything went smoothly, though, so it wasn’t a long stay. That was… oh, goodness, over 30 years ago now! Time flies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, one hospitalization for childbirth over 30 years ago. And how about family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 85, and she was pretty healthy right up until the end. She had a little arthritis, but that’s about it. My father passed away when he was in his 70s, from a heart attack, I think. And my brother has high blood pressure, but he doesn’t take good care of himself, so I don’t really count that. Mostly, we're a pretty sturdy bunch, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother lived to 85 with arthritis, father passed away in his 70s from a heart attack, brother has high blood pressure. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of! I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven’t had any trouble with medications in the past. I might be a little sensitive to certain perfumes, sometimes they give me a headache, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? Just a bit of a bother.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, just sensitivity to perfumes. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. I try to stay away from those things if I can. I believe in letting my body do its own healing, you know? I take a little fish oil sometimes, for my joints, but that’s about it. And I stop taking that when I remember to. Not very consistent, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, occasional fish oil. Great. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit years ago. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a pretty simple woman, I like my peace and quiet. I spend most of my time with my family and working, that's enough excitement for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drugs. That's good to know. Alright, Teah, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to these things. My husband always gets a check-up too, so I know what to expect. Just let me know if you see anything concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 130/80… that’s a little elevated, but not dramatically so. It can fluctuate depending on stress and activity level. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs sound clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears are clear. Throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Overall, everything sounds and looks good, but we should keep an eye on that blood pressure.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. I do get a little stressed sometimes with work, so that blood pressure probably makes sense. What do you think we should do about it? Do I need to take medicine or something? I’d rather not, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference to avoid medication if possible. At this point, I wouldn’t immediately start you on medication. Let’s try some lifestyle modifications first. We can focus on stress reduction techniques, like deep breathing exercises or yoga. Also, making sure you’re getting regular exercise and maintaining a healthy diet – low in sodium and rich in fruits and vegetables – can make a big difference. I’d like to recheck your blood pressure in three months to see if it has improved. We can also discuss some over-the-counter options, if needed, but let's see how those lifestyle changes work first. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I can definitely try to do more to manage my stress. My daughter has been encouraging me to try yoga for years, maybe this is the push I needed! And I do try to eat healthy, mostly. Less salt is probably a good idea, I do like a bit of seasoning. Three months sounds good. And thank you for not jumping straight to medication, I appreciate that. Now, what about my shots? Are we up to date on everything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teah. I always prefer to start with the least invasive approach when possible. And that’s great your daughter is encouraging yoga! Now, let’s check your vaccination records. Okay, it looks like you’re due for a Tdap booster – that protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and your annual flu shot is coming up in the fall. Also, have you had a pneumococcal vaccine?
PATIENT: Oh dear, I always forget which shots are which! Tdap... that's the one with the whooping cough protection, right? And the flu shot I always get, usually in October. Pneumococcal… I honestly don’t remember. I think maybe I had one a long time ago, but I couldn't say for sure. My husband usually handles all the paperwork, so I just let him keep track. Maybe we should just go ahead and get the Tdap and see about the pneumococcal? Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly reasonable. Given your age and health history, I recommend getting the Tdap booster today. And we should go ahead and do the pneumococcal vaccine as well. There are two types, PCV20 and PPSV23. Given you haven't had it recently, let's do PCV20 today. It provides broader protection. We can schedule the flu shot for October when it becomes available. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds like a good plan, Doctor. PCV20 it is! And October for the flu shot is perfect. I'm glad we're getting everything sorted out. Just let me know when you're ready, and I'll roll up my sleeve. I don't mind the shots, I just don't like remembering all the names!
DOCTOR: Alright, Teah. Just a little pinch, and then we'll be all set. I'll give you the Tdap first… And now the PCV20… All done! Keep those bandages on for a few hours, and you might experience some mild soreness or fatigue for a day or two. That's perfectly normal. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn't so bad! A little pinch, just like you said. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not rushing things. I'll keep an eye on my arms and try to remember to do some yoga. Thank you again for everything!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teah. I’m glad I could help. And remember, stress reduction is key! I’ll see you back in three months to recheck your blood pressure. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms – like a high fever, severe headache, or difficulty breathing – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a summary of today’s visit and your follow-up instructions. Have a wonderful day, and please give your husband my best!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Hernandez, you too! I will, and I certainly will try to manage my stress. Have a good day, and thanks again for everything.
