DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re Carmaleta Villarreal, age 43. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let's just get right to it. I want to get pregnant. Simple as that. I lost my husband a few years back, and… well, I want a baby. Before it's too late, you know? I don't want any… problems getting pregnant. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Villarreal, that is a very good starting point. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to be proactive about this, and I commend you for taking this step. “Before it's too late,” as you say, is a valid concern, and we will certainly address that. To best understand your situation and ensure a smooth path forward, I’d like to gather a bit more information. If you don’t mind, we’ll go through some questions about your medical history, and I’ll likely want to do a physical exam as well. First, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Ugh, general health. Honestly? Fine. I guess. I don’t really go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. I eat okay, I think. Not a lot of junk food, mostly. And I try to walk a bit, when I can. I had the usual childhood stuff, measles and things, but nothing major. I don’t remember all the details, though. It was a long time ago. Is this important? I have a meeting later.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Villarreal, this is important, but I understand your time is valuable, and we will be as efficient as possible. Knowing your general health gives me a baseline. “Childhood stuff” is helpful – it gives us a starting point for immunity, though, as you say, details aren’t always crucial. To clarify, by “usual childhood stuff” do you recall ever having chickenpox?
PATIENT: Chicken…pox? Hmm. I think so? Maybe. Everyone had it, didn’t they? It was a long time ago, like I said. Little itchy bumps all over… or was that someone else? Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. It's all a bit of a blur, to be frank. I had a fever, I think. Is this really necessary? I'm sure it doesn’t matter.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall specific details, Ms. Villarreal. Knowing whether you had chickenpox is important because it can affect pregnancy. We’re simply gathering information to ensure everything goes smoothly. Let’s move on then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… no. Diabetes? Definitely not. Asthma… no, I don’t think so. I can’t really breathe that easily sometimes, but I just put that down to getting older. Thyroid… what is a thyroid, even? Look, I’m not a doctor. I just want to make sure I can have a baby without any… complications. Is this going to take much longer? I really should be going.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Villarreal, and I assure you we'll be as efficient as possible. The thyroid is a gland in your neck that controls your metabolism; it's often a routine check when considering pregnancy. We’re just covering all bases. Alright, let’s skip that for now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. And… oh! I broke my arm once, when I was maybe ten? I was climbing a tree. I was always a bit of a tomboy. That's about it, I think. Nothing major, like heart surgery or anything. I’ve never been seriously ill. I'm pretty tough, honestly. Just want a baby. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Villarreal, wanting a baby is not hard at all. And it sounds like you've had a relatively healthy life, which is excellent. Now, to get a clearer picture, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. That's a loaded question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my aunt… she had some kind of cancer, a long time ago. I don't really know the details, to be honest. We weren't very close. My father was healthy as a horse, but he died young, in an accident. That's about all I remember. Is this really going to help? I mean, people get pregnant all the time.
DOCTOR: You are right, Ms. Villarreal, people do get pregnant all the time. However, knowing family history can help us identify potential risks and prepare accordingly. Knowing about your mother’s high blood pressure is helpful, and any information about cancer, even if limited, is useful. Now, let's talk about you specifically. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I take a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember. And I take something for my joints, they get a bit creaky. It's… I can't remember the name. It's from the chemist, the little red bottle? And sometimes I take paracetamol for headaches, if I have them. That's about it, I think. I don’t really like taking pills. Why do you need to know all this? Is something wrong already?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Villarreal, nothing is wrong yet. We are simply gathering information to ensure the healthiest possible pregnancy. Some medications can affect fertility or pregnancy, so it’s important to know everything you are taking. The multivitamin is fine, and we'll get the name of the joint medication later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I mean, I get a bit of a stuffy nose sometimes, but that’s just hay fever, I think. And I can’t eat shellfish, makes me really sick. But that’s it. Honestly, I’m pretty hardy. I've never had a serious reaction to anything. Is this almost over? I really need to get going. I have a meeting with… well, never mind. Just tell me if there’s a problem and what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Villarreal. No known drug allergies, shellfish allergy noted. Now, just a few more questions. Could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that even mean? I work, I eat, I sleep. I try to get some exercise, but I'm busy. I don't smoke, never have. And I hardly ever drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine at Christmas. I'm not a party animal, if that's what you mean. I lead a pretty normal life, honestly. Is this about my weight? Because I don't think that's relevant. I'm perfectly healthy. Let's just get to the point, okay?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Villarreal, this isn't about your weight at all. You're right to ask me to get to the point. I simply want to have a comprehensive understanding of your health. It sounds like you lead a very healthy lifestyle, which is excellent. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I'd like to ask about your menstrual cycle. Could you tell me when your last period was?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You want to talk about that now? Look, I'm a grown woman. I know when my period is. It was… a few weeks ago, I think. Honestly, they're all a bit irregular. Sometimes they're early, sometimes they're late. It depends. I don't really keep track. Is this important? I'm getting a bit embarrassed now. Can we please just skip this part? I really need to go. My meeting… it's very important.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable, Ms. Villarreal. It is important information, but I understand your reluctance. We can skip the detailed questions about your cycle for now. However, before we proceed, could you please tell me if you are currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Look, are you fishing for something here? Yes, I am. What does that even matter? I'm trying to get pregnant, aren't I? This is ridiculous. I came here to see if there was a problem, not to be interrogated about my personal life. Can we please, please just get to the exam? I have a meeting, and I'm really late. I need answers, not questions. Is there something wrong already? Just tell me.
DOCTOR: You are right to feel frustrated, Ms. Villarreal. I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I assure you, I am simply trying to gather the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. We can move directly to the physical exam. It will involve a standard check-up, including blood pressure, weight, and a brief abdominal exam. If you are comfortable, we can also discuss some initial blood tests to assess your hormone levels and overall health. Would you like to proceed with the exam now?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But make it quick, okay? I really don’t have time for this. And please, no more questions. Just tell me if there’s a problem. Is there a room or something? I need to change.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Villarreal. I will let you have some privacy to change. There is a gown in the room, and a private changing area. The examination room is just this way. Please take your time, and I will be just outside when you are ready. I will knock before re-entering.
