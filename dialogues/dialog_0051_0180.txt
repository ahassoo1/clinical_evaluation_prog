DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, okay? Just… tired. Real tired. And… I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose on purpose, but… I crave it. It's dumb, I know. And it's getting worse. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. Tired and… a craving for dirt. That’s… certainly something we can explore. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: Explore? What’s to explore? I'm tired! Like, all the time. Even after sleeping. It’s… hard to explain. Everything feels heavy. Work is a struggle. I used to be able to… well, never mind. It doesn’t matter now. It just… is. How long? Honestly, I don’t remember exactly. A while. Months, maybe? A year? Time gets blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, months or a year of persistent fatigue, even with adequate sleep. And you mentioned everything feels heavy – is that physical heaviness, or more… emotional?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't get all… deep on me. Physical! It's my body that feels heavy, okay? Like I'm carrying a bunch of rocks around. Not my feelings. Though, honestly, everything is awful these days. My husband… well, he passed. A few years back. But that's not what this is about. It's the dirt, and being tired. Focus, please. You're the doctor.
DOCTOR: You're right to keep me focused, Ms. Cantoran. I apologize for getting… distracted. Let's talk about the dirt craving. When did that start?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know. It just… started. I noticed I was… picking at the garden. Little bits. It felt… good. I know, it's weird. It started small, like a little taste, and now... now I find myself, I don't know, looking for it. It's embarrassing. It's not like I'm eating it, not full handfuls or anything. But I crave the smell, the taste... I don't even know why! Just... leave me alone, okay? It's gross, I know. What are you going to do, tell me to stop eating dirt? That's helpful.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Cantoran, I'm not going to tell you to simply stop. It’s important to understand why you’re craving it. It could be a sign of something else going on. Could you describe where in the garden you're finding yourself picking at it?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? You need to know where in the garden? What does it matter? It’s just… the regular dirt. Under the roses, mostly. Sometimes near the tomatoes. It’s not like I’m digging up anything special! Just… earth. Normal, garden dirt. It's the kind I've always used. I don't buy fancy stuff. Look, is this going to take long? I have things to do. I really don’t understand why this is so important. Dirt is dirt, right? You’re a doctor, shouldn't you be asking about… I don’t know… my blood pressure? Not my gardening habits.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Ms. Cantoran. Blood pressure is important, and we will check that. But sometimes, unusual cravings can point to underlying deficiencies. The fact that you’re craving dirt specifically, near the roses and tomatoes, is what I'm trying to understand. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Ugh. Everything is awful, so… yes, probably. What kind of changes? I'm tired, like I said. And my hands… they've been hurting. Achy. And I've been… losing weight, I think. My clothes are a little loose. That's probably it. Everything is just… falling apart. I don't know what you want me to say? Look, I just want to stop being tired and stop craving dirt. Is that too much to ask? My husband used to take care of all this doctor stuff… I never had to deal with it. He knew what to ask. I just… show up and feel awful. It's not helpful, okay? It's just… awful. Can we just get this over with? Please?
DOCTOR: You're not alone in this, Ms. Cantoran. And you're right, we should try to figure this out. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It won't take long. Just relax, and I’ll tell you what I'm doing as I go. Okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. And don’t poke too much. My skin is sensitive. And please, no needles. I hate needles. Just… get it over with. I have appointments. Real appointments. This is just… a waste of time. I knew I shouldn't have come. He always knew what to do. Always.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. No needles, I promise. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’d like to take a look at your hands, and do a quick neurological exam. Just to assess the ache you mentioned. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Not alarmingly high, but something we’ll want to monitor. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me...
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay. Deep breath. Like this? It's probably just stress. Everything is stressful. Husband gone, tired all the time, eating dirt… what did you expect? Just get on with it. I have a hair appointment later. Don't want to be late. Is it cold in here? I'm always cold now. And my hands are achy. Especially in the mornings. Like arthritis. My mother had arthritis. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear. Your heartbeat is regular, but a little fast. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. I’m going to gently feel around the joints, just to check for any swelling or tenderness. There's some slight tenderness in the knuckles of both hands, especially when I apply pressure. No obvious swelling, but you’re right, they do feel achy. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes quickly.
PATIENT: Ugh. That does hurt. Stop poking! It's like little electric shocks. My hands are always cold, even when everything else isn't. And… and I think they're getting… bumpy? Like little… nodules. I haven't really looked closely, okay? I try not to. It's just… another thing. Another awful thing. And the tiredness! It’s… it’s like weights on my eyelids. I can barely keep my eyes open anymore. Can we just be done now? Please? My hair appointment… I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. We're done with the exam. I apologize if anything was uncomfortable. Based on what you've told me, and what I've observed, I want to order some blood work. It will help us check for several things, including iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, and inflammation. It could also point to other underlying conditions. I also want to order a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. These are just routine tests, but they'll give us a better overall picture. Would you prefer I order these tests at the hospital, or would a local lab be easier for you?
PATIENT: Hospital, I guess. It's closer. I don't… I don’t really have a preference. As long as I don’t have to wait all day. And… will this cost a lot of money? I don’t… I don’t have insurance. My husband had insurance, but… now I just have what’s left. It’s not much. Look, are you sure this is necessary? Maybe I’m just getting old. Maybe I just need more sleep. It’s probably just stress, okay? Everything is stressful. Just… don’t order a lot of tests, okay? I can’t afford a lot of tests. And… and don’t bother with anything fancy. Just the basics. Please?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cantoran. We'll keep the tests to the essentials. Complete blood count and metabolic panel, as we discussed. I'll also put in a request for iron studies, as iron deficiency can sometimes cause cravings like the one you’re experiencing. We can discuss potential financial assistance options at the hospital if needed. I’m also going to put in a referral to a rheumatologist. The aching hands and potential nodules suggest that we should rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. They’re the specialists in that area. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Rheumatol… what? What’s that even mean? Another doctor? More poking and prodding? Ugh. I really just want to be tired and eat dirt in peace. Is that too much to ask? Look, I don’t like going to doctors. Never have. My husband… he always went with me. He knew what to ask. He knew what to do. I just… I just feel awful. Can’t you just give me something for the tiredness? A pill, maybe? Something to make it stop? Please? I really, really need to go. My hair appointment… it’s important. It’s the one thing that makes me feel normal.
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling overwhelmed, Ms. Cantoran. And I appreciate your honesty. It’s perfectly alright to feel this way. I wish I could just give you a pill for the tiredness, but without knowing the underlying cause, it's difficult to say what would be safe or effective. We need to find out why you’re feeling so tired before we can address it properly. The lab work and the referral to the rheumatologist will help us do that. In the meantime, I can offer some suggestions for managing the tiredness, such as ensuring you're getting enough rest and staying hydrated. However, these are just temporary measures. I'll write down the lab order and the referral information for you. The hospital can schedule the appointments. If you’re concerned about the cost, please let me know, and we can explore financial assistance options. Would you like me to also write down some simple tips for managing your energy levels while we wait for the results?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I don't want to think about it. I don’t want to remember anything. Just give me the papers. I'll… I'll deal with it later. But no promises. I'm really tired, okay? Too tired to deal with anything. And… and don't bother calling me with the results. I don’t want to hear about it. Just… mail them. Please. I really need to go now. My hair appointment… I can’t be late. Thanks… I guess. But I really don’t like doctors. Never have. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cantoran. I understand you’re not fond of doctors, and I'll respect your wishes. The results will be mailed to you. If you do have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. I hope your hair appointment goes well. And please, try to get some rest. .
