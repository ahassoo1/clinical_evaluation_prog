DOCTOR: Right. Jimmi Genard, 73. Okay. Well, don’t waste my time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh. It’s… down there. Something’s… leaking. It’s not right. Never happened before. It's kinda gross, if you wanna know.
DOCTOR: "Leaking," you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like… stuff. Comes out. Not a lot, but… it's there. And it smells funny. Not a good funny. I don't know why it's happening. Old age, probably. Everything falls apart eventually, right?
DOCTOR: Old age… well, that could be it. But we need to be a bit more specific, don’t you think?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean specific? It's coming out of there. What more do you need to know? I ain't a doctor, I just know it's not normal! It's just… icky. And I don't like it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, is it… urine?
PATIENT: Urine…? Hmm. No, I don’t think so. I go pee just fine. It's… different. More… slimy. And kinda yellowish. Not clear like pee. Honestly, I'm not good with colors. But it ain't pee. I know that much.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discharge. And you're certain it's not related to urination?
PATIENT: Positive. I know what my pee looks like. This is… separate. It just… happens. Sometimes when I move around too much, or… or nothing at all. It's very strange. And it’s embarrassing. I don’t like talking about this.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Have you noticed any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: Burning… not really. It doesn't burn. It's more… uncomfortable. Like something's just… there. Itchy… sometimes. But not all the time. Mostly just… wet. And smelly, like I said. Honestly, I just want it to stop. It's very… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I feel fine, other than… this. Chills… no. Abdominal pain? No. My stomach's always a little noisy, but that's just old age again. Everything rattles around these days. I just want to know what's causing this mess. Is it serious? Is it gonna kill me? Don't beat around the bush, doctor.
DOCTOR: Kill you?
PATIENT: Well, you gotta ask, right? Everything's dangerous these days. You read the news. Everything causes cancer or something. I just want to know what I'm dealing with. Is it something I gotta worry about, or is it just… one of those things? Don't tell me it's nothing if it is something. I want the truth.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look, shall we?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But hurry it up. This is… unpleasant. And don’t poke around too much. Just a quick peek, alright? I'm a delicate flower, you know. Even if I don't look like it.
DOCTOR: Right. Please lie down on the examination table, feet in stirrups. And try to relax. This won't take long.
PATIENT: Stirrups? Really? I'm too old for stirrups. Fine, fine. But if I fall, it's on your head. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some mild redness and discharge. It doesn't appear acutely inflamed, but there's a distinct odor. It could be a vaginal infection, possibly bacterial vaginosis or yeast infection. But it’s difficult to say for sure without a sample.
PATIENT: Infection? What kind of infection? Is it… contagious? Will my clothes be ruined? And what about the sample? What are you gonna do with it? Don’t tell me you're gonna poke around even more. I swear, if you bring out any… instruments… I'm walking out of here. I don’t like this one bit. Not one bit.
DOCTOR: It’s not a sexually transmitted infection, if that's what you're worried about. We’ll just need a small swab sample to determine the cause. It’s a quick and painless procedure. As for your clothes, no, they won't be ruined. We have proper drapes and procedures. And yes, I’ll need to use a speculum. But it won’t be for long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… a speculum? You're gonna… open things up? Absolutely not! I told you, no poking around! I'm too old for this. This is just… humiliating. No, no, no. I don't need any tests. I just want something to make it stop. Can't you just give me some cream or something? Something simple? No tests, no speculums. I'm leaving. I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand your discomfort, but without a proper diagnosis, I can’t just prescribe something blindly. It could be something more serious, and we need to rule that out. I strongly advise a simple swab. If you refuse, I can’t provide adequate care. It's your decision, of course, but I won't be responsible for any complications. .
PATIENT: Fine! You win. But if it's painful, I'm blaming you. And if my clothes get ruined, you're paying for them. Just hurry up and get it over with. But be gentle! And don't expect me to be happy about this. Not one bit. This is a terrible experience. Absolutely terrible. .
