DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. Now, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…call me Gerardo, please. I got this cough. Been on me for a while now, and I'm always tired. Seems like I get sinus infections pretty often, too. I just want to get rid of it, honestly. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Of course, Gerardo. A cough and fatigue, and frequent sinus infections… I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say "a while now," could you give me a rough estimate of how long you’ve been dealing with the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It’s gotta be…at least three, maybe four months now. It comes and goes, but it always comes back. Worse in the winter, I think. Though it hasn't really gone away completely this summer either. It just…lingers.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months, comes and goes, worse in winter but still present this summer… I see. And would you describe the cough as… dry, productive – meaning do you cough anything up – or something else?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's…productive, I guess. I cough up stuff. Not a lot, but yeah, it's phlegm. Sometimes it's clear, sometimes it's a little…yellowish. Don't know if that matters. Honestly, I just try to get rid of it. Doesn't always work.
DOCTOR: It does matter, thank you for telling me. Clear or yellowish phlegm is good to know. And is there anything that seems to make the cough worse?
PATIENT: Well, being cold definitely makes it worse. And…dust. I work in a food processing plant, so there's always dust in the air. Can't really avoid it, unfortunately. Being around smoke doesn't help either, but I don’t smoke myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold air and dust at work seem to be triggers. Being around smoke also aggravates it. And when you say tired, is this just feeling generally run-down, or is it more like a significant lack of energy that interferes with your daily activities?
PATIENT: It's…more than just run-down. I get worn out easy. Like, I used to be able to work a full shift no problem, now I need to take breaks more often. Even things around the house, like…mowing the lawn, it wipes me out. It's just…tiring to do things, you know? I just want my energy back.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. A significant decrease in energy levels… that’s definitely something we need to look into. Now, have you had a fever at any point with this cough or fatigue?
PATIENT: Not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothing I've bothered to take my temperature for. Definitely no chills or anything like that. Mostly just tired and coughing. It’s just…persistent, that's the worst part. It's been going on so long.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or significant temperature changes. Persistent cough and fatigue… Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about other things just to get a better picture of your overall health. Have you noticed any shortness of breath or wheezing with the cough?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don't get out of breath easier than usual. And no, I haven't noticed any wheezing. It's just a…regular cough. Sometimes it feels a little tight in my chest, but not all the time. It's hard to explain. It's not painful, just…uncomfortable. I just want this gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, no shortness of breath or wheezing, just occasional chest tightness. I understand your frustration, and we'll work to get to the bottom of this. Now, have you had any recent changes in your weight, either loss or gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think I've lost a little weight. Not a lot, but my clothes don't fit quite as snug as they used to. Probably from not having much appetite when I'm feeling sick. I don’t keep track of it, though. I just know I'm not eating as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss with decreased appetite. Now, have you had any night sweats, or any swollen lymph nodes – you might notice these as lumps in your neck, armpits, or groin?
PATIENT: No night sweats. And no, I haven’t felt any lumps or anything like that. I check myself sometimes, just…you know, gotta stay aware. Everything feels normal except for the cough and the tiredness. Honestly, Doctor, can we just figure out what’s wrong and get me some medicine? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand, Gerardo. We will. Before we talk about treatment options, I’d like to get a little more information. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I take some over-the-counter cold medicine sometimes, but that’s about it. Just the usual stuff, decongestants, that kind of thing. No problems there. Is this going to take much longer? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Almost done with the questions, I promise. Just a few more things to cover. Are you currently taking any other medications, even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the cold medicine when I need it. I don’t really bother with vitamins or anything like that. Waste of money, usually. I just try to eat healthy when I can. It’s hard when I’m always tired and coughing. Can we just…skip the rest and get to the medicine now? I really appreciate you seeing me, Doctor. But I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Gerardo. I understand your desire to get back to work. However, to give you the best care, I do need to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, COPD, heart disease, diabetes, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Never been diagnosed with anything. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. Just this cough now. And the tiredness. My grandpa had some breathing problems when he got older, but that's about it. I don't know if that's relevant. Look, I really don't want to take up your time. Can we just…treat the symptoms? Maybe some cough syrup and something for the fatigue? I really need to get back to work. I got bills to pay.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns and your need to get back to work, Mr. Pithan. And I don't want to keep you any longer than necessary. However, given the persistent nature of your cough and fatigue, and the subtle weight loss you mentioned, I would like to do a brief physical exam and possibly order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying conditions. It's just to be thorough, and to make sure we're not missing anything. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't like going to the doctor. Never have. But…fine. Do what you gotta do. Just…make it quick, okay? I got a shift to get back to. A chest X-ray… alright. But I’m telling you, it’s just a cough. A really stubborn cough. And a little tiredness. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, I appreciate your cooperation, Gerardo. It won't take long. Let's start with listening to your lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in through your mouth for me… and exhale slowly?
PATIENT: There. Happy? Now can we just get this over with? I really don’t like being poked and prodded. I got a feeling this is going to take all day. And I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds regular, and I’m hearing some…wheezing in your lower lungs, particularly on the right side. It’s subtle, but it’s there. I also notice your breathing is a little rapid, but not significantly. Now, could you open your mouth and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: There. What now? Is something wrong? I told you it was just a cough. You're making me nervous now. I got bills to pay. This is gonna cost me a fortune just to come here.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks a little inflamed, but nothing significant. I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes in your neck. Given what I’m hearing in your lungs and the subtle inflammation in your throat, combined with your fatigue and weight loss, I'm concerned about a possible respiratory infection, potentially bronchitis or even pneumonia. It's important to rule out anything serious. I would like to order a chest X-ray and a blood test to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you think is best. X-ray and blood test. Just…get it over with. I really need to get back to work. I can’t afford to miss any more shifts. And honestly, I don’t like hospitals. They smell funny. Just…tell me what I need to do. Where do I go for the X-ray? And how long is all this going to take? I really need to get back to work. I appreciate you seeing me, Doctor, but this is taking way too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pithan. I understand your frustration. I’m going to have my nurse draw the blood while you’re here, and then I’ll give you a referral to the imaging center down the street for the X-ray. They should be able to get you in right away. The results from both tests should be back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an inhaler to help with the wheezing, and suggest you rest as much as possible. I'll also give you a prescription for a mild cough suppressant to help you sleep. I’ll call you as soon as the results come back to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. Inhaler, cough suppressant, blood test, X-ray… I got it. Just…please call me as soon as you know something. I really need to get back to work. I appreciate your help, Doctor. But this is…a lot. Just…call me. Okay? And tell me how much it’s all gonna cost. I need to know. I have bills to pay.
