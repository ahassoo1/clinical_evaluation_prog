DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. Well, it is… difficult to explain. The words… they don’t come so easy now. I have trouble… finding them. It has been happening for… some time now, I think. It makes talking… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be quite concerning when you notice changes in your ability to communicate. “Trouble finding the words” – that’s a very helpful way to describe it. When you say “some time now,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… a rough estimate… It is… difficult. Perhaps… six months? Or maybe… longer? Everything feels… a little blurry, you see. It wasn’t sudden. Just… slowly getting harder. I don’t remember exactly when it started, only that it is… a while. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Gyamfi. It's very common for these things to develop gradually. “Slowly getting harder” is a useful detail. And it’s alright that you can't pinpoint an exact date. Now, can you tell me a little more about how it’s affecting your daily life?
PATIENT: How it affects… daily life. Hmm. Well… I used to enjoy reading, but it is harder to follow now. Sometimes I… lose my place, or forget what I just read. And talking to people… It is embarrassing, Doctor. I pause… searching for the right word… I hesitate often. It takes… a long time to say simple things. My wife… she understood. But… she is gone now. It is just… more difficult alone.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s understandable that you’re finding this more challenging now, and it takes courage to discuss these difficulties. Losing someone you love always adds another layer of complexity. You mentioned difficulty following your reading. Are you experiencing any trouble with understanding conversations as well?
PATIENT: Yes… sometimes. Not always, you see. But when there is much noise… or people speak quickly… then it is difficult. I have to ask them to repeat themselves. And sometimes… even then I do not understand. It is not… every word, but enough to be… frustrating. It makes me… avoid talking to people, if I am honest. I do not want to… bother them.
DOCTOR: That's completely understandable, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s very common to want to avoid situations that cause frustration. And it takes strength to recognize and admit that. Avoiding social interaction is a natural response. Now, let's talk a little about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your memory, aside from the difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Changes in… memory. Hmm. Well, I sometimes forget… where I put things. Keys, glasses… things like that. Nothing… major. Just… everyday things. And sometimes I… struggle to remember names. Not always, but… it happens. It is… more the little things, I think. Nothing like… forgetting important events. I do not believe so.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Just everyday objects and occasional difficulty with names. Now, have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty with balance?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. Sometimes a little tension, but not… proper headaches. Vision… perhaps a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses. Weakness… no, I do not think so. Numbness… no. And balance… I have not noticed any problems with balance. No, Doctor. I do not believe so. Everything feels… slow, but not… weak or unbalanced.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, let’s briefly go over your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic… medical conditions. Hmm. I used to have high blood pressure, yes. But it was… controlled with medication. I stopped taking the medication… some time ago. The doctor said it was okay. And… I had a small stroke… many years ago. But it was… minor. I recovered fully, the doctor said. Apart from that… no, I do not believe so. Nothing major. Do you need… more information? I am not always… good with remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for telling me about both the high blood pressure and the stroke, Mr. Gyamfi. That’s very important information. Even though you recovered from the stroke, it’s something we need to consider. And knowing about the previous high blood pressure is helpful. Do you recall approximately when you had the stroke, and when you stopped taking the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: The stroke… hmm. It was… a long time ago. Perhaps… twenty years ago? Or maybe longer. It was… not severe. I remember being in the hospital for a few days, but I recovered quickly. And the medication… I think… about ten years ago? Or maybe five? Everything is… a little blurry, Doctor. I stopped taking it because the doctor said my blood pressure was fine. But… I am not certain of the dates. I am sorry. I wish I could remember more clearly.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Gyamfi. Dates can be difficult to recall, and we can look through your medical records to confirm. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any other allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I do not believe so. I do not have any allergies to medications. I have never… reacted badly to anything. And no… no other allergies either. I used to have hay fever as a child, but I grew out of that. No, Doctor. I am not allergic to anything, to my knowledge. I am a very… uncomplicated patient, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. No, Doctor. I am not taking any medications. Not currently. I used to take something for my knees… but that was… years ago. And I stopped taking that when… well, I can't remember exactly when. But nothing now. No pills, no creams… nothing. Just… a little vitamin D in the winter, perhaps. But that is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to perform a brief neurological exam. This will involve checking your reflexes, balance, coordination, and some basic cognitive function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A neurological… exam? Yes, Doctor. I suppose so. If it will… help. I am a little worried… but I trust your judgement. What… what does it involve exactly? Will it be… painful?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel a little apprehensive. It's not painful at all, Mr. Gyamfi. I'll just be testing some basic functions. We'll start with your reflexes – I’ll gently tap on your knees and ankles with a small hammer. Then I'll check your balance and coordination by asking you to walk a few steps and touch your finger to your nose. Finally, I’ll ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. It should take only a few minutes. Is that alright if we proceed?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that is alright. Reflexes… balance… questions… Just tell me if I need to do something… and I will try my best. It is… good to know it is not painful. Please… do not hesitate to tell me if I am doing something wrong. Let us… begin, then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your reflexes. Please relax your legs, and I'm just going to gently tap on the tendons below your knees. This is perfectly normal. Okay, good. That was a normal response on both sides. Now, let's check your ankle reflexes. Please let your legs dangle freely. And those were also normal. Now, let's move on to balance. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am standing. A little wobbly… but I am upright. Do you want me to… close my eyes? Or… what should I do? It is… difficult to stand still without something to hold onto.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. It's perfectly normal to feel a little unsteady without support. For now, just try to stand as still as possible with your feet together. If you feel like you’re going to fall, please let me know immediately. Okay, good. A little bit of sway, which is not uncommon, but no significant instability. Now, let's move on to coordination. Could you please extend your arms straight out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? It is… difficult to keep them still. They are shaking a little. Is that… bad? I am trying my best, but… they are not very steady.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Gyamfi. It is perfectly normal to have a little tremor, especially when you’re focusing on keeping your arms extended. The tremor is mild, but noticeable. Now, I’m going to ask you to touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger, then repeat. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes… like this? It is… difficult to be precise. I am trying my best, but my hand is a little shaky.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. That was helpful. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. Just answer to the best of your ability. First, what is today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. August… is it the second? Yes, I believe it is August the second. 2025, is it not? I… think so. It is… difficult to be certain.
DOCTOR: That's correct. August 2nd, 2025. Very good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: The city… hmm. This is… a rural area, is it not? I believe… it is a small town. I do not remember the name… I am sorry. It is… slipping away. It is… a small, quiet town. I do not recall the name. Is that… bad? I feel… confused.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Gyamfi. Don’t worry. We’re in \[Clinic Location]. Now, I’m going to ask you one more question. Can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? Yes, please. I will try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please remember those, and I'll ask you to repeat them in a few moments.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny… Yes, I think I remember. Is that… correct? I am trying my best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, can you repeat those three words for me, please?
PATIENT: Three words… hmm. Apple… um… something to eat… and… a place to put things… and… a small coin? I… I cannot remember the exact words. I am so sorry. They are… slipping away. I feel… lost. I know there was an apple… and a table… and… something small and round… but I cannot… I cannot remember.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Gyamfi. Don’t worry. It is perfectly normal to have difficulty remembering things. Based on the neurological examination, your reflexes are normal, but your balance is a little unsteady. Your coordination is slightly impaired, and you’re having some difficulty with recall. Given your history of a previous stroke, and these findings, I would like to order some imaging – an MRI of the brain – to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An… MRI? Imaging of the brain… Is that… serious? Will it… hurt? I do not like the sound of that. Is it… necessary? I just wanted to… find words, Doctor. I did not expect… this. If you think it is… important, then yes, I suppose so. But… I am worried. What are you… looking for? I feel… anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Gyamfi. It's natural to feel worried when we talk about things like this. An MRI is a very safe procedure. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It doesn’t involve any radiation, and it doesn’t hurt. You’ll be lying flat on a table inside a large machine, and it can be a little noisy, but we can provide you with earplugs or headphones. We’re looking for any evidence of new strokes, areas of damage, or other changes in the brain that might be contributing to your difficulties with language and memory. It will help us determine the best course of treatment. I’m going to arrange for you to have an MRI at \[Local Hospital]. I’ll also write you a prescription for a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in brain disorders – to help us interpret the results and develop a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist… a specialist… yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will… help to understand what is happening… then yes, I suppose so. The MRI… if it is truly safe… then I will do it. But please… make sure it is safe. I do not want… any harm. I trust your judgement, Doctor. When… when will I have these tests? And what will happen after? I feel… lost and confused. I just want… to find my words again. I want to… live a normal life. I just want… answers.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Gyamfi. We will get you the answers you need. I’ll arrange for you to have the MRI within the next few days – let’s aim for \[Date of MRI]. I’ll call you tomorrow with the exact time and location, and instructions on how to prepare. After the MRI, the radiologist will send the results to me and the neurologist. We’ll schedule an appointment with the neurologist as soon as possible – likely within a week – to discuss the findings and develop a plan. In the meantime, I would like to recommend some speech therapy exercises to help improve your language skills. I’ll write you a referral for that as well. Also, to rule out any other potential causes, I am going to order some blood work. I know this is a lot to take in, and I want you to know that I’m here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so. I… I just need some time to… process everything. MRI, neurologist, blood work… speech therapy… It is… a lot. Thank you, Doctor. For… listening. And for… trying to help. I suppose… I will wait for your call. And… I will try to stay positive. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. And you are right to focus on staying positive. We will work together to figure this out. I’ll be in touch tomorrow. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
