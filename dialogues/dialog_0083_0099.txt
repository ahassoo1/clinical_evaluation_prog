DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I received a letter about some results from a test… a GI Endo Test, it was called? And it wasn't quite right, apparently. I must admit, I'm not entirely certain what it is, but the letter suggested I come in for a discussion.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A GI Endoscopy – that’s a test where we look at the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum with a small camera. It’s a good idea we discuss the results. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me a little bit about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, for some time now – perhaps six months or so – I’ve been having… discomfort. Not pain, exactly. More of a… burning sensation, quite high up, and sometimes a feeling of fullness after only a small amount of food. It wasn’t constant, but frequent enough to be worrying. My previous doctor – Dr. Ramirez, a lovely man – thought it best to investigate, and that led to this endoscopy. He has since retired, which is why I’m with you now.
DOCTOR: I see. So, approximately six months of intermittent burning sensation and early satiety – feeling full after only a small amount of food. That’s helpful. And Dr. Ramirez suggested the endoscopy to investigate those symptoms. Before we get into the results, could you describe the burning sensation a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… difficult to pinpoint, really. It isn’t a sharp burn, more of a warmth that rises up in my chest. Sometimes it happens right after eating, other times it’s there even on an empty stomach, though it’s milder then. It doesn't radiate, it stays mostly in the upper chest, just below my breastbone. And it sometimes – not always – comes with a bit of… what’s the word… a sour taste in my mouth. Not unpleasant, just… noticeable. It's also worse when I lie down, I've found.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a warm sensation, localized to the upper chest, sometimes accompanied by a sour taste, and worsened when lying down. That does paint a clearer picture. Do you notice anything that specifically triggers the burning – certain foods, perhaps, or stress?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. I think spicy foods make it worse, certainly. And anything acidic – oranges, tomatoes, that sort of thing. But it's not consistent enough to be certain. As for stress… well, who doesn’t have stress in their life? I retired a few years ago, so it’s not work-related. Perhaps when I’m feeling anxious about my grandchildren, but I hesitate to say for sure. It's hard to connect the two, you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint those connections. And it's good you're thinking about potential triggers. Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this burning sensation – things like difficulty swallowing, unintentional weight loss, nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully nothing like that. No difficulty swallowing at all. My appetite is… normal, I suppose. Perhaps a little less than it used to be, but I put that down to my age, not illness. I haven't lost any weight intentionally, and my bowel habits are regular. No nausea or vomiting, either. Just this… discomfort. It’s really the main thing, and it's been worrying me, simply because I don’t know what it is.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. The absence of those other symptoms is certainly helpful. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve been quite fortunate, really. I had a touch of arthritis in my knees some years ago, but it’s well-managed with occasional medication. Otherwise, I’ve always been quite healthy. My husband… he had some heart trouble, but he passed away five years ago. I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of, either. I try to eat a balanced diet, though I do enjoy a good chocolate now and then.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No significant past medical history, and no known allergies. And you mentioned your husband – I’m sorry for your loss. Let's just quickly touch on medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was some time ago now. As for medications… just the occasional ibuprofen for my arthritis, when it flares up. Nothing regularly. And I take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one. My grandson, a very thoughtful boy, makes sure I have a supply. Other than that, nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable. Just occasional ibuprofen and a daily multivitamin. Now, before we discuss the results of your endoscopy, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I understand it’s part of the process. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment implicitly.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright, if you could please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the upper chest, just below your breastbone – the area you’ve been describing the discomfort. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is reassuring. Now, let’s talk about the results of your GI endoscopy. Have you received a copy of the report?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do have the report here with me. I confess, I didn't understand much of it, to be honest. It was filled with… medical terms I’m unfamiliar with. It mentioned something about… inflammation, and some small erosions. But the extent of it wasn’t entirely clear.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, you're right, it is quite technical. The report confirms mild inflammation of the esophagus and the presence of a few small erosions in the lining of your esophagus and the lower portion of your stomach. These findings are consistent with what we call erosive esophagitis. Essentially, the acid from your stomach is irritating the lining of your esophagus, causing these small areas of inflammation and erosion. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Erosive… esophagitis. Yes, I think so. So, the acid… is causing this irritation. And that’s what’s been causing the discomfort? Is it… serious, Doctor? And what can be done about it? I’m a little worried, I must admit.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ms. Minatra, but in most cases, erosive esophagitis is not serious, if it’s managed appropriately. Left untreated, it can lead to complications like strictures – narrowing of the esophagus – or Barrett’s esophagus, which is a change in the lining of the esophagus that can increase the risk of cancer. However, we're catching it early, and there are very effective treatments available. The most common cause is gastroesophageal reflux disease – GERD – where stomach acid frequently flows back up into the esophagus. Your symptoms – the burning sensation, sour taste, worsening when lying down – are very typical of GERD. The erosions are a result of that acid exposure. Now, to best determine the extent of the problem, and to plan your treatment, I would like to recommend a few things. First, we can start with lifestyle modifications. And secondly, I would like to prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. Have you heard of those before?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… modifications. And a proton pump… inhibitor. No, Doctor, I haven’t heard of either of those. Though I suppose I’m not surprised. What kind of lifestyle changes are we talking about? And what does this… inhibitor do? I’m happy to make changes, of course, if it will help. I just want to understand what’s involved. And if the medication has any side effects I should be aware of.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Lifestyle modifications are a good first step. These include things like elevating the head of your bed – about 6-8 inches – to help prevent acid from flowing back up while you sleep. Avoiding large meals, especially before bedtime. Avoiding foods that trigger your symptoms – spicy foods, acidic foods, caffeine, alcohol, chocolate. And losing weight if you are overweight. A proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, is a medication that reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces. This allows the esophagus to heal and reduces your symptoms. There are several different PPIs available, and we can choose one that's right for you. Common side effects are generally mild – things like headache, diarrhea, or nausea. More serious side effects are rare, but we’ll discuss those as well. I would like to start you on a low dose of omeprazole, once daily, for eight weeks. We will re-evaluate your symptoms after that time. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Omeprazole… once daily for eight weeks. Yes, that sounds… manageable. Elevating the bed, avoiding certain foods, and a medication. I can certainly try that. I will admit, I’m not thrilled about being on medication, but if it will alleviate the discomfort and prevent it from getting worse, I’m willing to give it a try. What about the foods I should avoid? Is there a list I can take with me? And what if the medication doesn't work? Or if the side effects are too bothersome?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Ms. Minatra. I completely understand your hesitation about medication. I’m happy to provide you with a handout listing foods to avoid or limit – those high in fat, spicy foods, citrus fruits, tomatoes, caffeine, alcohol, and chocolate. It’s not an exhaustive list, and everyone reacts differently, so it may take some trial and error to determine your triggers. If the medication doesn’t work, or if you experience bothersome side effects, please contact the office immediately. We can adjust the dose, try a different PPI, or consider other treatment options. We may also consider a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation if your symptoms don’t improve with initial treatment. Now, do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything for now. You’ve been very thorough and patient with my questions. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I suppose I’ll start with the lifestyle changes and the medication, and see how it goes. Thank you again, Doctor Alanes. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if you experience any concerning symptoms – difficulty swallowing, unintentional weight loss, black or tarry stools, or severe abdominal pain – seek immediate medical attention. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for eight weeks from today to re-evaluate your symptoms. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Minatra.
