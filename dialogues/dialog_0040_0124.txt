DOCTOR: Right, Nykisha Paes… 47 years old. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hi Doctor Osga. It’s… it’s my skin, mostly. It’s been getting darker, and I’m just so tired all the time. It’s not like a normal tired, you know? It feels… deep.
DOCTOR: Darker skin… and fatigue. Right. How long has your skin been getting darker?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… three or four months, I think? It started slowly, and I didn’t really pay attention at first. But now… my family has noticed, and they told me to come get it checked out. They worry a lot.
DOCTOR: Family noticed, good. People rarely notice changes in themselves, you know?
PATIENT: That's true! I guess I just… get used to things. It's not like a big, sudden change, it just… happened. It’s mostly on my arms and face, I think. And… has it been getting worse steadily, or does it come and go?
DOCTOR: Arms and face… steadily worsening. Okay. And aside from the skin changes and fatigue, anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I haven’t been sick, no fever or anything. Maybe… a little more thirsty than usual? But I live in the country, it gets hot, so I figured that was just the weather. And… my appetite hasn’t been great, but again, it's been hot. It's hard to want to eat when it's so warm.
DOCTOR: Thirst and decreased appetite. Alright. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… well, now that you mention it… things have been a little… loose. Not like diarrhea, but… softer than usual. And not as often, if that makes sense. I usually go every day, but lately it’s been every other day, or sometimes longer. It hasn't been a big deal, just… different.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss… I haven't really been weighing myself. But my clothes… maybe a little looser? I don't know for sure. I haven't been eating much, so I guess it’s possible. It's not like I've been trying to lose weight, though.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let’s have a quick look at your medical history. Hmm. Nothing significant noted here. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't had to take much medicine over the years. Maybe some over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches, but nothing regularly. And no reactions, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. My parents… they both passed away a long time ago. I didn’t really talk to them about medical stuff, you know? It wasn't really our thing. My mom… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he just… got old. No cancer or anything like that, as far as I know. My siblings are healthy, as far as I know too, but we don't see each other much.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright. Let’s have a quick look at your skin. Roll up your sleeves, please.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here you go. It’s probably not much to see, it’s just… darker. I'm not sure what you’re looking for.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. There’s some hyperpigmentation here. And it appears… slightly velvety. I’m going to check your lymph nodes now.
PATIENT: Okay. Lymph nodes? Is that… bad? I don't know much about any of this, doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. I feel tired all the time and I don’t want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure. A few are slightly enlarged, but not alarmingly so. Now, let's take a look at your face.
PATIENT: Okay. Is something wrong? You seem… serious. I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, the hyperpigmentation is also present here, particularly around the temples. Look, I’m going to be frank. Your symptoms, combined with the physical exam findings, are concerning. I suspect… Acanthosis Nigricans. Which could be a sign of underlying insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, or even something more serious. We need to run some blood tests – a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and HbA1c – to get a clearer picture. I'll order those now.
PATIENT: Acanthosis… what? Insulin… resistance? That sounds… scary. What does that mean? Is it… cancer? What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily cancer, let’s not jump to conclusions. Insulin resistance means your body isn’t responding properly to insulin, which can lead to pre-diabetes or diabetes. We need the blood tests to confirm. We’ll also want to check your thyroid function. I’m also going to give you a referral to an endocrinologist, just to be safe. They specialize in hormonal imbalances. Here. Take this to the lab first thing tomorrow. And schedule an appointment with the endocrinologist as soon as possible. Try not to worry too much, we’re just being thorough. Do you have any other questions before I leave?
PATIENT: An endocrinologist… that sounds… complicated. So, it could be diabetes? Or something else? What if it is something serious? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know… what’s happening to me.
DOCTOR: It could be diabetes, or it could be something else entirely. That’s why we’re running the tests. As for how long the results will take… a few days, usually. The lab will contact you when they’re ready. I don’t want to speculate or cause unnecessary anxiety before we have the data. I’ve ordered everything we need to get to the bottom of this. I have other patients waiting, so I need to move along. Follow the instructions, and you’ll be fine. If you experience any sudden changes in your condition—extreme fatigue, dizziness, vision changes—go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we’ll discuss the results when they come back. .
