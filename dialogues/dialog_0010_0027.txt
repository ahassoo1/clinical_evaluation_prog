DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get right to it. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. Food, mostly. Especially if I lie down too soon after eating. It’s really quite unpleasant, you know? And it’s been happening for… well, a while now. I haven’t bothered with it before, but my wife said I had to come. Women, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're experiencing something coming up – food, specifically – and it’s worse when you lie down after eating. And it’s been going on for some time. Your wife encouraged you to come in, which is good. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe exactly what this “stuff” is?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… food. Undigested food. It tastes like whatever I last ate, obviously. Sometimes it’s chunky, sometimes it’s more like… well, like soup. It’s not pleasant to think about, frankly. Look, I eat normal food. Steak, potatoes, you know. Not one of those fancy diets. And it just… comes back up. Not a violent heave, thankfully, just… regurgitation. Is that what you call it? My wife just calls it gross.
DOCTOR: Regurgitation is a good way to describe it, yes. Not violent, just coming back up. And it's undigested food, tasting like your last meal. You said it happens especially when you lie down after eating. Does it happen at other times?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. Though not as often. If I bend over, sometimes. Reaching for something on the floor is a bad idea, let me tell you. And occasionally just… randomly. Not a lot, but enough to be annoying. I try to stay upright as much as possible now, but it's hard. I like my garden, you know? Lots of bending and digging. It's just… a nuisance, really. A very unpleasant nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more common lying down, but also happens with bending over and occasionally randomly. You mentioned gardening – so activity seems to potentially trigger it as well. Now, aside from the unpleasantness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? Like… pain? No, not really. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, a burning feeling, but I get that from spicy food anyway. No trouble swallowing, no weight loss, no… I don't know… anything else. It’s just the regurgitation. And it's embarrassing. Don't need my wife making a fuss over it. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no trouble swallowing, no weight loss. Occasional heartburn, but you attribute that to spicy food. Alright. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. I had my prostate checked a few years back, everything was fine. High blood pressure, the doctor told me, but it's managed with a pill. Nothing else, really. I'm a pretty healthy guy for my age, you know? Always been active. I don't sit around all day. And I don’t go to doctors unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, currently managed with medication, and a normal prostate check a few years ago. What about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Appendectomy when I was a kid, that’s it. A long time ago. Nothing else. I’ve been lucky, haven't needed anything major done. I’m a practical man. Don’t go looking for trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, otherwise no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My father had… something with his stomach, I think. Ulcers, maybe. My mother was fine, lived to be 90. My wife’s mother had diabetes. That's about it, really. Not a particularly sickly bunch.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with possible stomach ulcers, mother healthy, wife’s mother with diabetes. <stage>I note “Father: ?
