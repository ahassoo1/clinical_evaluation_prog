DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. It's a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Though, frankly, I haven't much time for pleasantries. It's this… discoloration, you see. My skin. It’s darkening, and I tire so easily. My wife insisted I come. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine, other than the… aesthetic unpleasantness. Can we get this over with quickly?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I understand your time is valuable, and we’ll get right to it. The discoloration and fatigue are good things to check out, even if you feel otherwise well. Let me just pull up your record here… Okay, Pierce Drahota, age 85. Now, when you say "darkening," can you tell me where on your skin you’ve noticed this change?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor. It’s… all over. Hands, face… I suppose everywhere one can see skin. It’s not a sudden thing, mind you. It’s been… gradual. Weeks, perhaps? It's difficult to say. I don’t concern myself with such trivialities. Is this… is this going to require a great deal of prodding? Because frankly, my bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, “all over” is helpful to know. And gradual onset over weeks is good information too. No, we won't do anything that will cause you discomfort. A quick visual examination is all I'll need to start, and then we can talk about any other symptoms you might be having, or your medical history. I’m just taking a look now… Yes, I see what you mean. There is a generalized hyperpigmentation, meaning a darkening of the skin tone. It appears fairly uniform. Any areas more affected than others?
PATIENT: Uniform, yes. That's a good way to put it. Though, I wouldn’t know if one particular spot is more affected than another. I haven’t been meticulously cataloging the shade of my epidermis, Doctor. Honestly, this feels rather unnecessary. And frankly, the light in here is dreadful. It’s making my hands look even worse. Are you certain there’s nothing more… definitive we can do? A blood test, perhaps? Just to be certain?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I apologize if the examination feels intrusive. A blood test could be helpful, and we can certainly order one, but let's gather a bit more information first to help guide what we test for. Now, aside from the discoloration and fatigue, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? At my age, Doctor, everything changes. My knees ache, my memory… well, you’ve likely noticed. But specifically? No, not that I can recall. Appetite is normal, I suppose. Though my wife insists I haven't been eating enough. She worries over everything. And I haven't lost weight, if that's what you’re getting at. I maintain a… reasonable physique, considering my years. Truly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. It’s just… darker skin. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Okay, “reasonable physique” is good to hear, and normal appetite is helpful. And it’s good that you haven’t noticed any weight loss. It's understandable your wife worries, that’s natural. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, or been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Doctor, I haven’t been to a doctor in… decades. I pride myself on a robust constitution. A slight cold here and there, perhaps, but nothing that warrants a visit to a… facility such as this. No fever, no chills, certainly no… night sweats. I assure you, my bedding remains perfectly dry. This is becoming rather tiresome. I had hoped for a swift diagnosis and a… dismissal. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. And I appreciate you sharing that you’ve generally been quite healthy. Just a few more questions, and then we can discuss potential causes and next steps. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, or any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you quite finished with the… intimate inquiries? My digestive system functions perfectly adequately, thank you very much. I haven't experienced any… irregularities. And I certainly haven't been experiencing abdominal pain. Honestly, this is… undignified. I build things with iron and rebar, I don't spend my time cataloging the… contents of my waste. Can we please move on? I have appointments. Important appointments.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions are feeling intrusive, Mr. Drahota. I assure you, I'm only trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what might be causing these changes. It’s important to rule out anything serious. Okay. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies, and are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never. I’ve eaten everything imaginable, from street food in Shanghai to… well, it doesn't matter. Medications? Absolutely not. I detest pills. I believe in letting nature take its course. Supplements? My wife tries to foist them upon me, but I refuse. Vitamins, minerals… nonsense. Pure, utter nonsense. I have a perfectly balanced diet. Mostly. And I certainly don’t need to be poisoned by manufactured chemicals. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to regret this entire exercise. Is there anything… definitive you can tell me yet? Or are we simply going to continue with this… interrogation? .
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no medications. That’s helpful to know. Based on what you've told me, and the uniform hyperpigmentation I observed, there are several possibilities. One thing that can cause this is Addison’s disease, a condition where the adrenal glands don’t produce enough hormones. Another, though less likely given your lack of other symptoms, could be hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder. To rule these out, and to get a clearer picture of what's going on, I’d like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and an adrenal hormone level test. Would that be acceptable?
