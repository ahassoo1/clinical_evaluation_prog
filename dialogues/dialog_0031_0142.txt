DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning, Doc. It's good to meet you too. Right, well… headaches, mostly. They come on pretty strong, and I get all sweaty when they do. My heart kinda races, too. It's… happened a few times now. I don't really… remember exactly when they started, just that they're… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand. Headaches with sweating and a racing heart – that certainly sounds concerning. When you say “come on pretty strong,” could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Um… strong… it’s like, a really bad pressure, kinda all over my head? Not like, a sharp pain, more like… everything’s being squeezed. And it makes it hard to think. Sometimes it's on one side more than the other, I think… but honestly, it's all a bit of a blur when it's happening. It just… hurts a lot. Do you… need me to be more specific? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Lawther. You're doing just fine. “A bad pressure all over the head” is helpful. And it's good you mentioned it sometimes being more on one side. How long do these headaches typically last?
PATIENT: Ugh… that's the thing, I really don't remember. A few hours, maybe? It feels like forever when it's going on, so it's hard to tell. Sometimes I fall asleep, and then I wake up and it's… better. Or gone. I honestly couldn’t say for sure, Doc. It’s… patchy, my memory, you know? It's not the best.
DOCTOR: I see. Patchy memory is good to note. Let me just pull up your chart here… Okay, I see you've been seen here before, a few years ago. It looks like there's some mention of… frequent migraine headaches, but not much detail. Do you recall being diagnosed with migraines previously?
PATIENT: Migraines… maybe? I honestly don't remember a diagnosis. A few years ago… that was a while back. Things were… different then. I was… married. Yeah, I think I was. Look, I just know my head hurts really bad sometimes, and it freaks me out with the sweating and my heart going crazy. I don't really pay attention to labels, you know? Is it… bad that I don't remember stuff like that? Is that a sign of something?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to not remember details from past visits, Mr. Lawther, especially if things were different then, as you say. And no, it's not necessarily a sign of anything worrisome, but it is something we should be mindful of. We’ll try to get a clearer picture today. The sweating and racing heart, along with the headache, are what concern me, and we need to investigate those a bit further. Now, aside from the headache, sweating, and racing heart, have you noticed any other symptoms with these episodes?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Other symptoms… Sometimes I feel a bit dizzy. And… nauseous, I guess. Not like, throwing up nauseous, just… queasy. And I definitely get really sensitive to light when it's happening. Bright lights are awful. Everything just feels… worse. Oh, and I think I slur my words a little bit sometimes, but my ex-wife always said I talked funny anyway, so… I don't know if that’s new. Is that… helpful? I'm trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Lawther. The dizziness, nausea, light sensitivity, and potential slurring of speech are important details. We're building a clearer picture. Do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I was pretty healthy, I think. I mean, I used to play football in school, but that was ages ago. No asthma, no diabetes, nothing like that. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. I haven't really been to the doctor much, to be honest. Unless something hurts, I just… deal with it. Is that bad? My ex-wife always said I was stubborn. She was probably right.
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon to only see a doctor when something is bothering you, Mr. Lawther. And it sounds like you were quite active in school. Appendectomy as a child is good to note, but not immediately relevant here. Let's talk about family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has a history of headaches, neurological issues, heart problems, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Ugh… family history… That's tricky. My mom… she had really bad migraines, I think. Always complaining about them. And my dad… he had some heart trouble later in life, I think. Needed a stent or something. But honestly, we weren’t really close. I didn’t ask a lot of questions, you know? I have a brother, but I haven’t spoken to him in years. He lives out west somewhere. I don't know anything about his health. Sorry, I'm not much help. It’s… a bit of a mess, my family.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Lawther. You’ve given me helpful information. History of migraines in your mother and heart trouble in your father is good to know. Now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Umm… not really. Just… ibuprofen, sometimes. When the headaches are really bad. Just whatever's in the orange bottle. Nothing else. I don't really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I used to take something for… anxiety, a few years ago, but I stopped. Didn't really seem to help much. That was… when I was married. Sorry, I keep going back to that. It feels like a different life. Is it okay if I just… stop talking about it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lawther. You can stop talking about anything you're not comfortable with. Ibuprofen as needed is good to know. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes, coordination, and sensation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's… fine. Whatever you need to do. Blood pressure, heart, lungs… neurological… sounds… thorough. Just… try to be gentle, okay? I get nervous around doctors. And… needles. I really don't like needles. Is a blood test involved? I'm probably just being silly. Just let me know what's happening, okay? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lawther. I will explain everything as we go, and we’ll go at your pace. I understand your anxiety, and I will be as gentle as possible. We may need to draw some blood later, but we’ll discuss that before doing anything. Right now, let's start with your blood pressure and heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That's slightly elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Coordination is good. Sensation is intact. Cranial nerves appear intact. However, I do note some slight nystagmus – involuntary eye movement – when you look to the extreme right. It’s subtle, but worth noting. Everything appears generally normal, but the elevated blood pressure, heart murmur, and nystagmus warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Nystagmus… is that bad? Murmur… I knew my heart wasn’t right. My ex-wife always said I had a weird heartbeat. She was probably right. I just… ignored it. So, what does this mean? What do we do now? Am I… dying? Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. Just… tell me what’s happening. And… is it going to be expensive? I don't have insurance, so… that's a worry.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, let’s take things one step at a time. Nystagmus can have several causes, some more serious than others. It simply means involuntary eye movement, and we need to determine the cause. The heart murmur is also something we’ll investigate. It could be benign, but it's important to rule out any underlying heart condition. You are not dying. It’s understandable to be worried, but we’re doing this to be thorough and ensure you receive the appropriate care. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few tests: an EKG to assess your heart’s electrical activity, a blood test to check for any underlying inflammation or infection, and a CT scan of your brain to investigate the cause of the nystagmus. I understand your concern about the cost, and I want to be transparent. The costs will vary depending on the facility and the insurance coverage, or lack thereof. I can provide you with an estimate, and we can discuss options for financial assistance or payment plans. The clinic does offer a sliding scale fee based on income, which you may qualify for. We also have a financial counselor who can help you navigate the costs and explore available resources. Would you like me to connect you with them?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds expensive. And… scary. I don’t like being in small spaces. And blood tests… I hate needles. Is there… anything else we can do? Maybe just… monitor it? I’m not sure I can afford all that. And the thought of being in a machine… it makes me feel really anxious. I haven’t been to a hospital in years. The last time was… a bad experience. I'd rather just deal with the headaches, honestly. Maybe they'll just go away on their own. Can we… just wait and see? I'm really not good with doctors and hospitals. It all just feels too… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, I understand your anxiety and concerns. It’s perfectly valid to feel overwhelmed, and I want to respect your wishes. However, given your symptoms – the headaches with sweating, racing heart, and now the findings of elevated blood pressure, heart murmur, and nystagmus – simply waiting and seeing isn’t the safest approach. These could indicate a more serious underlying condition that requires prompt attention. While I completely understand your reluctance towards a CT scan and blood tests, they are crucial for accurate diagnosis. Let’s explore some alternative approaches. We could start with the blood tests, as they are less invasive. We can discuss strategies to manage your needle anxiety – breathing exercises, distraction techniques, or even a topical anesthetic cream to numb the area. As for the CT scan, we can explore alternatives, such as an MRI, which is less claustrophobic, though often more expensive. We can also discuss medication to help manage anxiety during the scan. However, it’s important to understand that these tests provide valuable information. Without them, it will be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. Given your symptoms and my examination findings, I strongly recommend at least the blood tests. We can proceed at your pace, and I’ll be here every step of the way to address your concerns and ensure your comfort. Would you be open to discussing a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion?
PATIENT: A neurologist… that sounds… complicated. More doctors, more tests… It's all just too much. Okay, fine. Blood tests. But only if you promise to be really gentle. And… can I bring someone with me? My ex-wife… she's actually a really good nurse. She's always been good with medical stuff. She might be able to calm me down. And… what exactly are we looking for in the blood tests? Are they going to be looking for… something bad? I just want to know what I’m getting into. And… if it’s really bad, can I just… say no to further tests? I need to have some control over this. This is making me really anxious. I think I need a glass of water.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lawther. I completely understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we'll proceed at your pace. Yes, you can absolutely bring someone with you for support. Having your ex-wife there sounds like a good idea – a familiar face can be very comforting. As for the blood tests, we’ll be looking for signs of inflammation, infection, and any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. We'll also check your electrolytes and complete blood count. It’s standard procedure, and doesn't necessarily mean we’re looking for something bad. And yes, you absolutely have control over this. You can always say no to further tests, and we’ll respect your decision. However, I strongly recommend proceeding with the tests to get a clear understanding of your condition. Let me get you a glass of water. I’ll also write you a lab requisition for the blood tests and schedule you for an appointment. We’ll then discuss the results and formulate a plan. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds… okay. As long as I don't have to make any decisions right away. And… can you explain the results to me in plain English? No medical jargon, please. I don't understand half of what doctors say. And… what if something is really wrong? What happens then? I'm starting to get really worried now. This is a lot to take in. I think I need to sit down. Is there somewhere I can just… wait? And… maybe take a deep breath? This is making my head hurt. Irony, I guess. Just… please don't rush me. I need a minute. Or ten. Just… slow down.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lawther. Slow down is exactly what we’ll do. There’s no rush. I completely understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that I will explain everything in plain English, no medical jargon. I promise. We have a waiting room just down the hall where you can sit and take a deep breath. Please, take as long as you need. And I will be here to explain the results thoroughly, regardless of what they may be. We’ll discuss all your options and formulate a plan together. Let me get the nurse to show you the way. She can also get you a comfortable chair and a blanket if you’d like. And I’ll be right here when you’re ready. Nurse, could you please escort Mr. Lawther to the waiting room and make sure he’s comfortable?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that sounds… good. Thank you. I think… I think I just need a minute. And maybe a blanket. And… just to sit down. This is… a lot. I appreciate you being patient. It's just… hard. Really hard.
