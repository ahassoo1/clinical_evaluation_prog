DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Solero, you say? Hmm. Well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, thought I should get a check-up. Said I've been…forgetful. It’s just…things slip my mind these days. Nothing serious, I’m sure. Just old age, probably.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to come in, and it’s perfectly normal to experience some memory changes as we get older. It's good to be proactive about these things. "Forgetting" can have many causes, and it’s always best to rule out anything that might be easily addressed. So, let's talk a little more about this forgetfulness. Can you give me some examples of what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, examples…let me see. It’s not like I forget everything. I remember my training, you know. Surgical tech for…oh, goodness, decades! But little things. Like…where I put my glasses. Or what I had for lunch yesterday. And names. People’s names…they just vanish! It’s embarrassing, really. I used to have a wonderful memory. Not anymore, apparently.
DOCTOR: It sounds frustrating, Mrs. Calvery, and it’s completely understandable why you'd be concerned. Losing recall for names and recent events is common, but it's good we're exploring it. To help me get a better picture, can you tell me how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It hasn’t been…sudden, you know? It’s crept up on me, slowly, over…years, I suppose. Maybe a couple of years? Or more? It’s hard to say, honestly. My husband…well, since he passed, things haven’t been quite the same. It could be that. He always remembered everything for me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can certainly have a significant impact on our cognitive function, and it’s not uncommon to experience memory changes during that time. It's good you acknowledge that. So, focusing on the memory concerns themselves, has it been getting progressively worse over these couple of years, or has it been fairly stable?
PATIENT: Oh, I think…worse, yes. Definitely worse. At first, it was just little things, like misplacing my keys. Now…now it’s…well, I sometimes have trouble following conversations. And I repeat myself, I think. My daughter keeps gently correcting me. It's mortifying. I don't like feeling…dimwitted. It wasn't like this before.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of this with me, Mrs. Calvery. It takes courage to talk about these things. It sounds like there has been a noticeable change, and it's understandable why you’re concerned. To get a broader understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… let me see. Well, I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And…arthritis, in my hands. That’s why I don't do as much sewing anymore. Used to love quilting. And…high blood pressure, I think. I take a pill for it, every day. Pink one. Can't remember the name of it, though. See? It’s always something! I've been generally healthy, though. Knock on wood. I haven't been in the hospital for anything serious in…well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, arthritis, and high blood pressure. That's helpful. And you take a pink pill for the blood pressure – we can definitely look that up to confirm the exact medication. Just so I have a complete picture, are there any other medical conditions you’re aware of, or any surgeries you’ve had besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My husband had a lot of health problems. I spent years taking him to appointments. Maybe I’m getting his history mixed up with my own? No… I think that’s it. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been so focused on taking care of others, I haven't paid much attention to my own health. I always figured I was strong as an ox. Maybe I was wrong.
DOCTOR: That’s very common, Mrs. Calvery. Many people prioritize the health of others, and it can be easy to neglect our own needs. It doesn't mean you're any less strong – it just means you're caring! Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the pink pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh…well, there's a little white one. For my bones, I think. Something about…getting brittle? My daughter keeps reminding me to take it. And sometimes, if my arthritis is really acting up, I take…an over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think it's called. Does that count? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely counts. So, a white pill for your bones, ibuprofen as needed, and the pink pill for blood pressure. We'll get those all clarified. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh! Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get hives as a child, but I haven’t had those in… decades! My husband was allergic to shellfish, but I always steered clear of that. No, I don't think so. Nothing major. I've been pretty lucky in that department, actually. Unless… does perfume count? Sometimes it makes my nose itch. But that’s not a real allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mrs. Calvery. It's helpful to rule out any significant allergies. And yes, a sensitivity to perfume can certainly be noted. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a tricky one. My parents… they're both gone now. My mother died young, from…something with her heart, I think. My father lived a long life, but he had…dementia, I think it was, towards the end. Very sad. He didn’t even recognize me sometimes. And my brother… he was always healthy as a horse. Never a sick day in his life. It doesn’t seem like there’s much of a pattern, honestly. Mostly just…old age catching up with everyone.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing both parents is difficult, and it can be hard to recall details about their medical history. And it’s true, sometimes there isn’t a clear pattern. Knowing about your father's dementia is helpful, though. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Social history…What does that even mean? Well, I was married, as I said. For…oh, goodness, over fifty years! Lovely man. Passed away a few years ago. I have a daughter, bless her heart. She visits me often, checks on me. I don’t really do much these days. I used to quilt, like I said, but my hands aren’t what they used to be. Mostly I just…watch television. And try to keep the house tidy. Not a very exciting life, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you had a wonderful marriage, and it's lovely that your daughter is so supportive. It's perfectly fine to have a quiet life, Mrs. Calvery. It sounds peaceful. Now, have you ever smoked cigarettes or used tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh no, never! Never smoked a day in my life. My husband tried it once, a long time ago, but I quickly put a stop to that! I always thought it was a dreadful habit. Horrible for your health. No, never touched the stuff. Not me.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A small one. Nothing heavy. My husband liked a beer now and then, but he wasn’t a big drinker either. We weren’t party people, you see. Just a quiet glass with dinner, every now and then. Nothing to write home about, really.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, is there anything else you think I should be aware of, anything at all that might be relevant to your health concerns?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit…down, lately. Since my husband passed, of course. It's just... lonely. And sometimes, I get a little… confused. More than usual, I mean. And my sleep...it's not very good. I wake up a lot during the night. And... oh, I don't know. It's just... things aren't quite right. I don't feel like myself anymore. That’s probably all. Just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Mrs. Calvery. It’s very important, and it helps me to get a better understanding of what's going on. It's completely normal to feel down and have changes in sleep after losing a loved one. And those feelings of confusion are something we definitely need to explore further. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. It will just involve checking your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature—and listening to your heart and lungs. It will also be helpful to check your reflexes and do a quick neurological assessment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh... well, alright. I suppose so. I don’t think I’ve had a proper physical in… years. It’s probably a good idea. Just don’t poke too much, dear. My bones are a bit… sensitive. And try to be quick, if you don't mind. I don’t like being fussed over too much. But yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible, and we’ll take things at your pace. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. It's a little tight, but it won't hurt. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. Your heart sounds regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh... 142 over 88? Is that bad? My husband always had good blood pressure. And a murmur? What does that mean? My stomach...well, it's a little tender, yes. I've been a bit… constipated, lately. That's probably it. It's embarrassing to talk about, but it's true. I don't eat as much fiber as I should, I suppose. Just a little tender, dear. Nothing serious. I think.
DOCTOR: 142 over 88 is slightly elevated, but not critically high. We'll want to keep an eye on it and discuss ways to manage it. A murmur is a sound your heart makes while it's pumping blood, and it's quite common. Most are harmless, but it’s good to note it. And constipation is very common, especially with changes in diet and activity. It’s good you’re aware of it. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Just relax your leg for me. And then the other one. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within the normal range. Your gait is slightly unsteady, but nothing too concerning.
PATIENT: Oh, my knees...they don't work as well as they used to. Arthritis, you know. And unsteady...well, I’m not as nimble as I used to be. I always tripped over things, even when I was young. It's just part of being old, dear. I'm not expecting to win any races. But is something wrong? Are you worried? I can feel you looking at me.
DOCTOR: I'm not worried, Mrs. Calvery, but your diminished reflexes and slightly unsteady gait, combined with your reports of forgetfulness and feelings of confusion, are things we need to investigate further. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes for these changes. To help us do that, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any infections or other abnormalities. I’d also like to order a brain scan, like an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your brain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests and a…brain scan? Goodness gracious. That sounds…serious. Are you sure it’s necessary? I told you, I'm just getting old! My memory isn't what it used to be, but I’m still perfectly functional. I can still cook and clean and… watch television! I don’t like the sound of a brain scan, dear. Is it painful? Will it show something terrible? I don’t want to know if something terrible is wrong. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Calvery, and I wouldn't recommend these tests if I didn't think they were necessary. The tests aren't meant to scare you, but rather to help us understand why you’re experiencing these changes and to rule out any treatable causes. The brain scan is completely painless. You’ll simply lie still inside a large machine while it takes pictures of your brain. It’s similar to getting an X-ray, but it doesn't involve any radiation. It’s true that the tests could reveal something that requires treatment, but it’s also possible they’ll come back normal. And even if something is discovered, knowing what’s going on allows us to manage it effectively and improve your quality of life. We don’t have to discuss the results if you’re not ready. We can take things one step at a time. But I strongly recommend getting these tests done, just to be on the safe side. What do you say?
PATIENT: Oh dear… one step at a time… that sounds… less frightening, I suppose. My daughter always says I worry too much. She'd want me to get the tests, I know. She's very practical. And you seem like a nice young doctor. Alright, alright. One step at a time. Order the tests, then. Blood tests and…the brain scan. But promise me you’ll explain everything clearly, if something is wrong. And don’t tell me anything I don’t need to know. It’s just… a lot to take in. When can I schedule them? And will my insurance cover it? Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Calvery. I promise to explain everything clearly and to only share information that’s necessary. We’ll take things at your pace and I’ll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. I’ll have the lab order for the blood tests sent electronically to the lab right away. You can go at your convenience. As for the brain scan, let me have my nurse schedule that for you. She’s very good at working with insurance. Medicare should cover both tests, but we’ll double-check to be sure. Now, while we’re waiting for those tests, I’d like to discuss some lifestyle changes that can help improve your cognitive function. Things like getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and staying socially active. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Exercise, diet, and… staying social? Oh, dear. I don’t know about exercise. My knees, you know. And I’m not much of a cook anymore. Mostly I just heat up soup. Staying social… well, my daughter visits when she can, but it’s not the same. I suppose I could try… but I don’t have much energy. It all sounds like a lot of work. But… alright. I’ll try. Maybe. What kind of exercise do you recommend? Something gentle, I hope. And what should I eat? I mostly just like toast.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to start small, Mrs. Calvery. We're not aiming for a complete overhaul, just small, manageable steps. For exercise, gentle activities like walking, swimming, or even chair yoga can be very beneficial. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week, but break it up into smaller chunks if needed. Even a 10-minute walk can make a difference. As for diet, we don’t need to eliminate all your favorite foods. Toast is fine in moderation! Focus on incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and lean protein into your meals. Eating a balanced diet provides your brain with the nutrients it needs to function properly. Here’s a handout with some ideas. It also has information about staying socially active. Now, before you leave, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s… a lot of information. Brain-healthy foods… and gentle exercise. I’ll have to read this over a few times. Um… questions? Let me see. Will the brain scan make me claustrophobic? I don't like small spaces. And… what if something is wrong? What are the… possibilities? And… will it hurt? I’m probably being silly, aren’t I? But I’m just so nervous.
DOCTOR: You're not being silly at all, Mrs. Calvery. These are very valid concerns, and I'm happy to address them. The brain scan machine is fairly large and open, so most people don’t feel claustrophobic. However, if you are prone to claustrophobia, we can discuss options like medication to help you relax, or even having the scan done in an open MRI machine, which is less enclosed. As for what if something is wrong… there are many possibilities, but it’s important not to jump to conclusions. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, or something more complex like early signs of dementia. But remember, we don’t know anything yet. That’s why we’re doing the tests. And no, the scan itself won't hurt at all. It’s a completely painless procedure. You'll just lie still for a while, and we'll monitor you throughout the process. Is there anything else I can clarify for you?
PATIENT: Dementia… oh dear. That’s what my husband had. It was… awful. He didn’t even know who I was sometimes. I don't want that. An open MRI… that sounds… better. Maybe. Well… I suppose not. No, I don’t think so. Just… please don’t tell me anything I don’t need to know. And please, make sure it’s a gentle scan. I don’t want to be poked and prodded. I think… I think that’s all for now. I need to go home and… think about all this. And maybe have a cup of tea. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Calvery. It was my pleasure. I understand this is a lot to process, and I want to assure you that we'll take things at your pace. My nurse will schedule the brain scan and make sure it's a gentle one, and we can discuss the open MRI option. She’ll also answer any questions you may have about the process. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions before your appointment. And yes, a cup of tea sounds like a very good idea. Take care, Mrs. Calvery. And please remember, you’re not alone in this.
PATIENT: .
