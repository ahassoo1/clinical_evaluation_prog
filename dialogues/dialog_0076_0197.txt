DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarotta, yes… seventy years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, well, to be perfectly frank, I need a card so I can drive people around. You know, for rides. I used to do it all the time, but the old card expired, and they said I needed to get checked out first. It's for… what do you call it… a commercial driver's license, I think? Or a medical card for ride-sharing. Something like that. I just want to get it over with, if we could.
DOCTOR: Right, a commercial driver’s license… or a medical card. Yes, yes. Look, I’m an internal medicine doctor. I can assess your general health, but I’m not specifically certifying you for… ride-sharing. But we can go through the motions. It’s mostly just a physical, really. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years now? And my knees aren’t what they used to be, but who’s knees are at my age? I also take a little pill for my blood pressure, a very small one. That’s… that’s about it, I think. Honestly, I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. Do you need names of the pills or anything? I don’t really keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal… knees… blood pressure medication. Okay. The medication name would be helpful, if you can recall it, just for documentation. But we can probably look it up later. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, pretty much. Shellfish, nuts, the whole nine yards. Never had a reaction. I remember my mother always worrying about it when I was little, but I always seemed to be alright. No, no allergies to report, I don’t think. Is this taking long?
DOCTOR: No, no allergies. Good. Alright. Let’s just do a quick physical. Blood pressure and pulse first. And then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Just standard stuff. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Just get it over with. I have errands to run, you know. My neighbor needs help with her groceries.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 142 over 88. Pulse is 72. Not terrible, but not ideal. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Do you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, none of those things. Not at all. I get a little winded climbing stairs, maybe, but that's just old age. And sometimes my knees ache when it rains, but that’s more of a weather thing than anything else. Honestly, I feel pretty good for my age, if you must know. I'm still very active.
DOCTOR: Alright. No shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness. Active. Good. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength. Just a quick test. Reflexes are… present, though a little diminished. Strength seems adequate. Any history of stroke, diabetes, or any neurological problems?
PATIENT: No, no stroke. Never been diabetic. And no neurological problems that I know of. I did bump my head once when I was a child, climbing a tree, but that was a long time ago, and I was fine. Just a little bruise, that's all. Is this all there is? It seems awfully quick.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… about it. Based on this brief examination, you don't appear to have any obvious medical conditions that would preclude you from… driving people around. However, I’m not a specialist in this area. I can write a note stating you’ve been evaluated and appear generally healthy. But ultimately, the decision rests with the licensing authority. Do you want me to send the results to a specific address?
PATIENT: Oh, good. So I can get the card? That’s all I wanted to know. Yes, please. Just send it to my home address. It's 123 Willow Street, Anytown, CA 91234. And could you make it… official-looking? You know, with a stamp or something? So they take it seriously.
DOCTOR: Here. This confirms you were evaluated today and appear generally healthy. It’s… official enough. I’ll also send a copy to your home address. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… adequate. No, that’s all. Thank you. I appreciate it. I really need to get going now. My neighbor… well, she’s expecting me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, have a good day. And drive safely.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, drive safely. As if I haven't been driving for seventy years… .
