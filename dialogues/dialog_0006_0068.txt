DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Gorga, yes? It’s… well, it’s my leg. It’s been swelling up. It’s after the cancer treatment, you see. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Right, right… cancer treatment. Okay. And when did you first notice the swelling, Sasha?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? A little after I finished the… the pills. It was just a little puffiness at first, but now… now it’s quite noticeable, especially at the end of the day. It’s my left leg mostly.
DOCTOR: A month ago, after finishing the pills… left leg mostly. Okay. Is it painful, Sasha?
PATIENT: Not really painful, no. More… heavy? And warm. It feels… tight, like my shoe is too small, even when it isn’t. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yeah, that makes sense. Heavy, warm, tight… Alright. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your leg?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… color? Hmm. I haven’t really looked closely, to be honest. I just noticed it was bigger. I’m not good at noticing those things. Maybe a little red sometimes? But I’m not sure. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It could be important. Okay. And have you had any fever, chills, or any chest pain along with this swelling?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no fever. Not that I know of. No chills either. And definitely no chest pain. I’ve been feeling alright, actually, just… bothered by this leg. It makes walking a bit hard, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any history of blood clots, Sasha?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Oh dear. I… I don’t think so. I’ve never been told I had one. I had a bad fall when I was younger, broke my wrist, but that’s all. No one ever mentioned… clots. Why do you ask? Is that bad? I get worried easily, you see.
DOCTOR: It's just standard procedure, Sasha, don't worry. We need to rule things out. Alright. Let's take a look at your leg. If you could just let me examine it, that would be great. Could you sit on the edge of the bed and put your feet down?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. This way? I'm not very flexible these days, you know. It's getting old, I suppose. Here we go. Is there anything special I need to do?
DOCTOR: No, just relax. I'm going to feel around your leg, check for tenderness and swelling. I’ll also check your pulses. Just let me know if anything is particularly uncomfortable. Okay… a little bit of warmth here. And yes, definitely some swelling around the calf and ankle. Pulses are present, but a bit diminished compared to your right leg. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little tender right… here. It’s not sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. And yes, the ankle feels a bit… funny. Is that bad? You’re making me nervous, Doctor. I don't like feeling things are wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just trying to get a clear picture. I do see some mild redness around the ankle. And your skin feels a little warm to the touch. This could be a few things, Sasha. Given your history of cancer treatment and the swelling, redness, and tenderness, we need to rule out a blood clot. It’s not necessarily a clot, but we can’t ignore the possibility. I’m going to order a D-dimer test, which is a blood test that can help us assess if there's recent clotting activity. We might also need an ultrasound to visualize the veins in your leg if the D-dimer comes back positive. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A… a D-dimer test? An ultrasound? Oh dear. Is that… is that serious? What if it is a clot? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t like hospitals. What does that even mean? And how long will this take? I have a lunch date with my friend, you see… I just want to know what's going on with my leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, deep breaths, Sasha. It could be nothing, alright?
