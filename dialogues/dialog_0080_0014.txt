DOCTOR: Hi Ronnald, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… right. My wife, she said something about… paperwork? Something to do with work… and needing a form? I get so mixed up these days. It’s… well, it’s about time off, I think. From… directing things. At the church. Yes, that's it. Something about needing papers for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you need some medical documentation for time off related to your work at the church. That’s perfectly alright, we can definitely get that sorted. To do that, I need to understand a little bit more about why you're needing time off. Is something currently bothering you, or is this for a planned leave?
PATIENT: Oh, bother is… a good word for it, yes. It's not… one thing, exactly. Just… everything feels a bit much lately. Tired, mostly. And… forgetful, like I said. It's getting harder to… focus on things. Harder to remember what I’m supposed to be doing, even during the services. My wife says it’s time to… slow down. I think she’s right, but… well, I’m not sure what’s causing it. Not like a pain, or anything. Just… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, it sounds like you're experiencing some increased fatigue, difficulty with concentration and memory, and a general feeling of being overwhelmed. That’s definitely worth looking into. And it’s good that your wife is encouraging you to address it. Let's start with the fatigue. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, fatigue. It’s… not like being sleepy, exactly. It’s more like… a weight. All the time. Even after a full night's sleep, I feel… drained. Like I haven’t rested at all. And it’s getting worse. It used to be just at the end of the day, but now… it’s there all day long. Makes it hard to… concentrate on the sermons, or even just… talk to people. I find myself… trailing off mid-sentence. Forget what I was saying. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a constant feeling of being drained, not relieved by sleep, and impacting your ability to focus and communicate. That's helpful to know. And you mentioned it’s been getting progressively worse. When would you say you first started noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… It's hard to pinpoint, exactly. Maybe… six months ago? It started… gradually. Just little things, at first. Forgetting where I put my glasses, things like that. Now… it’s much more noticeable, I suppose. My wife certainly notices. She’s always been good at… noticing things. It’s been getting worse over the last… three months, I think. Definitely. Yes, three months. That feels right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so approximately six months of symptoms, with noticeable worsening over the past three months. And it started with minor memory lapses and has progressed. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, not really. I still eat, yes. My wife makes wonderful meals. But… I don't enjoy them as much, I think. They just… don’t taste the same. And… I've lost a bit of weight, maybe? I haven't really been keeping track. My clothes feel a little looser, but… I wouldn't say it’s a dramatic change. Just… a little. Yes, a little looser.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased enjoyment of food and a slight unintentional weight loss. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you been experiencing any changes in your sleep patterns besides feeling unrefreshed?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep… hmm. I get sleep, yes. I fall asleep alright. But it’s… not restful. I wake up several times during the night. Not because of anything, exactly. Just… wake up. And then I have trouble getting back to sleep. I used to sleep straight through, like a log. Now… it’s all broken up. My wife says I toss and turn a lot. She’s a light sleeper, you see. Yes, broken sleep. That’s the best way to describe it.
DOCTOR: Okay, fragmented sleep, waking up multiple times during the night, and feeling unrefreshed even after sleeping. Have you noticed any mood changes, like feeling more irritable, anxious, or sad than usual?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a little. I don’t… snap at people, exactly. But I get… frustrated more easily, I think. Little things bother me. And I worry more. About the church, about my family, about… everything, really. It’s hard to explain. My wife says I seem… distracted. And… I don’t enjoy my hobbies as much anymore. Used to love gardening, but… it just feels like a chore now. Yes, a little more… on edge, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased irritability, worry, and a loss of interest in hobbies. This is all very helpful information, Ronnald. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, alright. That sounds… sensible. A check-up. Yes. I haven't had one in… well, it's been a while. It’s probably a good idea. Do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds normal, and your temperature is fine. I did notice your breath sounds were a little quiet at the bottom of your lungs. I'm also going to check your reflexes and a quick neurological assessment. After that, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying deficiencies or infections. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh, elevated blood pressure… that doesn’t sound good, does it? I suppose I shouldn't be eating so much salt. My wife keeps telling me… and yes, blood work. That sounds… thorough. Yes, go ahead with the blood work. Whatever you think is best. Is it going to be painful? I don’t like needles, you see. Not at all.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t be painful, Ronnald. Just a quick prick, and it's over before you know it. We’ll just take a small sample of blood to check a few things. It’s standard procedure, and it’ll give us a better idea of what’s going on. While we're waiting for the lab results, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… hmm. That’s… a long time ago. I haven’t been sick much, thankfully. I had… the flu, a few times, when I was a boy. And I broke my arm, playing rugby. But that was… ages ago. Nothing serious. My father… he had problems with his heart, I think. But that was when I was a young man. I don’t remember the details. I’ve never been hospitalized. No surgeries. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older. Yes, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant medical history, no hospitalizations or surgeries, and a family history of heart problems in your father. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. No, not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medication, you see. Just… painkillers, for my back, when it flares up. And… maybe some antibiotics, once or twice, for a chest infection. But I didn’t have any reaction to them. No, no allergies. I don’t think so. My wife would have told me, if I had. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, like vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, vitamins… Yes, my wife gives me a multivitamin every morning. Says it’s good for me. And… sometimes, she gives me fish oil. For my memory, she says. But that's it. Just the multivitamin and the fish oil. Nothing else. I try to eat a healthy diet, but… I suppose I could be better.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a daily multivitamin and fish oil supplements. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My father tried, but he gave it up when I was a boy. Said it was a terrible habit. I've always been careful with my health, you see. I try to stay active. Gardening, mostly. And… church activities. Lots of walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. And how much alcohol do you typically consume in a week?
PATIENT: Oh, not much, Doctor. Just a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. My wife and I enjoy a nice glass of red wine. But it's not… regular. No, not much at all. I don't drink to excess, you see. Very rarely more than one glass.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week. Finally, can you tell me a little about your social situation?
PATIENT: Oh, my social situation… Well, I’m married, as you know. To a wonderful woman. We’ve been married for… oh, goodness, over forty years. We have three grown children. They all live nearby, thankfully. And lots of friends at the church. I'm very active in the community, you see. Lots of meetings, lots of volunteer work. Yes, very active. I keep busy. It’s a good life.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's wonderful to hear. It sounds like you have a strong support system. Alright, Ronnald, that’s all the information I need for now. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and Vitamin D levels. I also want to rule out any infection, so I'll add a basic inflammatory marker. We'll also do a urinalysis. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those tests… it sounds rather serious, doesn't it? Inflammatory marker… that doesn't sound good at all. But… no, not really. I suppose you know best, Doctor. What about… the paperwork? The form for work? Will I be able to get that, once I have the results? That’s what I came in for, you see. I don’t want to lose my job.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ronnald. It’s standard procedure to run some tests to get a complete picture, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It's just ruling things out. And yes, absolutely, we can definitely complete the paperwork for work once we have the results. Depending on what we find, we can discuss what you’re able to do and document that for your employer. I can write a note detailing any limitations, if needed, and explaining the need for time off. It might be a few days before the results come back, though. The lab usually takes 2-3 business days. I will have my nurse call you as soon as they are available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, 2-3 business days… alright. That’s… acceptable. As long as I can get the paperwork sorted. My wife will be relieved. She worries a lot. And yes, a note explaining limitations… that would be very helpful. Yes, very helpful indeed. Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a little.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ronnald. I’m glad I could help. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We are here to help. My nurse will be in contact soon with the results. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your time. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. Yes. That’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ronnald. We’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on. I’ll see you back here once the results are available. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
