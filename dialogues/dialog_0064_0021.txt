DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascondola. Welcome to the clinic. It's good to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Smetak. Well, it’s my foot, see? It’s been swelling up. Not all the time, but mostly in the evenings. It's a bit uncomfortable, you know? Feels kinda tight.
DOCTOR: Alright, your foot swelling, mostly in the evenings, and it feels tight. I understand. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it started, oh, maybe a month ago? Around the end of June, I reckon. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little puffiness, but it’s gotten worse each week, I’d say. I didn’t pay it much mind at first, figured I was just on my feet too long at work. I’m a loan clerk, you see, lots of sitting and walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a month ago, gradually worsening, and seems related to being on your feet at work. That's helpful. Now, is the swelling in one foot, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. The right one is fine, as far as I can tell. I haven't noticed anything wrong with it at all. It's only my left foot that's giving me trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the left foot. And aside from the swelling and tightness, are you experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Well, not exactly pain, Doctor. It’s more like… a dull ache, sometimes. Especially if I’ve been walking a lot. Not sharp, you know? Just…uncomfortable. And it feels warm to the touch, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A dull ache, particularly after walking, and warmth. And is there any redness associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see... I think… maybe a little? It's not bright red, but it’s definitely a bit pinker than the other foot. Not a lot, though. Hard to say for sure, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’d like to take a quick look at your foot, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Go ahead, Doctor. I hope it's nothing too serious. I need my feet for work, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm feeling some warmth and slight tenderness here, and you're right, there is some redness present. The swelling is primarily around the ankle and top of the foot. No obvious signs of injury, no visible deformity. Skin is intact. Capillary refill is within normal limits. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin, like any sores or blisters?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. My skin's been fine. No sores, no blisters, nothing at all. I keep it clean, you know? Wash my feet every day. It’s just the swelling and the ache. And the warmth, I suppose. It doesn’t hurt all the time, just when I’ve been on my feet a lot, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a complete picture, have you had any fevers, chills, or any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I’ve been feeling fine, other than this foot. No fever, no chills, no coughs, no colds… I haven't been sick in ages, to be honest. Oh, wait… I had a bit of a headache last week, but that was just for an afternoon. It went away on its own. Nothing serious, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I don’t take any regular medications, so I haven’t really had much experience with them. I’ve taken ibuprofen for headaches now and then, but never had any problems with it. I'm not allergic to anything, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been diagnosed with any of those things. My blood pressure is usually fine when I get it checked at the pharmacy, and my heart feels alright. I walk a lot, you know? Good for the heart, I reckon. My family… well, my mother had some trouble with her joints when she got older, but I haven’t had any problems like that myself. Just this foot. It’s starting to bother me a little more now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascondola. Based on what you've told me and my examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing some early signs of edema, possibly related to venous insufficiency or a mild inflammatory process. The warmth and slight redness suggest some inflammation is present. However, to rule out other possibilities and get a more definitive diagnosis, I'd like to order a couple of tests. We’ll do a basic blood workup to check your overall health and rule out infection, and I think an ankle-brachial index – an ABI – would be helpful to assess blood flow in your legs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh. Well, I don’t like going to the hospital, Doctor. But if you think it’s necessary… alright, alright. I suppose I trust your judgment. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I need to get back to work, you know? What exactly do these tests involve? And will they hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Parascondola. The blood work is just a standard test – a small sample will be taken from your arm. It shouldn’t be painful, just a quick pinch. As for the ABI, it's a non-invasive test. We’ll use a small ultrasound device to measure blood pressure in your ankles and arms. It doesn't involve any needles or incisions, so it shouldn’t be painful either. It takes about 20-30 minutes, total. We can schedule those tests for tomorrow morning at the clinic. The results usually come back within a couple of days. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your foot whenever possible, wearing comfortable shoes with good support, and avoiding prolonged standing or walking. We can also try some over-the-counter compression socks to help with the swelling. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… alright. That sounds… okay. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my work too much. Compression socks, you say? I’ve seen those, I think. Alright, I can try that. Elevating my foot… I can do that when I’m at home. So, blood work and the thing with the pressure… and socks. And I need to make an appointment for tomorrow? Okay. What time? And will I need to fast for the blood work? I had a big breakfast.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood work, so no food or drinks besides water. We can schedule you for 9:00 AM tomorrow morning. That will give you plenty of time to fast overnight. The ABI test can be done right after the blood work. The nurse will give you instructions for the blood work when you come in tomorrow. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: 9:00 AM… alright. No food, just water. I can manage that, I suppose. Will the tests show me what’s wrong with my foot? Like, what’s causing the swelling? And will I need any medication? I don’t want to be on pills if I can help it. And… how much will all this cost? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Mr. Parascondola. The tests will help us determine the underlying cause of the swelling. It could be something simple like mild venous insufficiency, or it could be something else. The results will give us a clearer picture and guide our treatment plan. As for medication, we’ll only consider it if necessary. We’ll start with conservative measures like elevation, compression socks, and over-the-counter pain relief if needed. We'll see how you respond to those before discussing any prescriptions. Regarding the cost, I understand you don’t have insurance. The blood work will be around $75, and the ABI test is approximately $50. We do have a payment plan available if that would be helpful, and we can also discuss options for financial assistance programs. I'll have the billing department contact you after your appointment tomorrow to discuss the details. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: $75 and $50… alright. That's… manageable, I suppose. A payment plan would be good, yes. And you said we'll see how I respond to the socks and lifting my foot before talking about pills? That's good. I really don't like taking medication. Alright. So, tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM, no food, just water. And the tests… and the nurse. And you'll look at the results and tell me what's wrong? I think… I think that's all my questions. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Parascondola. Yes, that’s correct. Tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. No food, just water. The nurse will assist you with the blood work, and I’ll review the results with you and discuss the best course of action. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns before your appointment. We’re here to help. It was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll see you tomorrow morning then.
