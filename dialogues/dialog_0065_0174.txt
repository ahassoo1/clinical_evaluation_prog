DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been…myself lately. It's a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I just feel…down. Very down. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I haven’t much patience for lingering, if you don't mind a quick visit.
DOCTOR: "Down," you say. I understand you'd like to keep this brief, and I'll certainly try. However, "down" can mean many things. Can you elaborate a bit on what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Elaborate…yes. It’s just…not enjoying things. The things I used to enjoy. Ski patrol, even just a nice walk…it all feels like a chore now. A heavy chore. And I’m sleeping poorly, waking up tired, and frankly, irritable. My daughter suggested I come. She worries, you see. I don’t…care for worrying people, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, sleep disturbance, irritability…those are certainly things we need to explore. Now, Ms. Derasmo, has this been a gradual change, or did something specific trigger these feelings?
PATIENT: Gradual…mostly. Though, now that I think on it, the divorce…that was about two years ago. I thought I'd dealt with it. Really. But maybe…maybe it wasn’t as clean a break as I believed. It's been…weighing on me more lately. Is that what you're asking? I do find myself thinking about it, reliving things. It's unpleasant, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s precisely what I was asking. A significant life event like a divorce can absolutely have lasting effects, even years later. And revisiting those thoughts is not uncommon. Now, Ms. Derasmo, beyond the divorce, have there been any other recent stressors in your life?
PATIENT: Stressors…hmm. My grandson, Ade, is having some trouble in school. Not serious trouble, mind you, but enough to cause his mother – my daughter – a great deal of anxiety. And I try to be supportive, you see. But…it's exhausting. Honestly, everything feels exhausting these days. Is that something you need to know, or are we focusing on the divorce? I do wish we could expedite this process.
DOCTOR: Everything is relevant, Ms. Derasmo, though we will prioritize. Your grandson’s situation adds to the picture. And I assure you, I do want to be efficient with your time. Let's move on to a quick review of your physical health. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…Well, my blood pressure runs a little high, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a small pill for it every morning. Otherwise, I’m quite robust, actually. Considering my age, that is. I’ve always been active. Still am, when I have the energy. And I have private insurance, if that's relevant. I do try to stay on top of things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is relevant. And good for you for staying active. Now, what is the name of that blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear…That's a good question. Let me think… It’s a small white pill… I get it refilled at the pharmacy, of course. I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. I really should know these things. My daughter handles most of the paperwork, you see. I believe it starts with an ‘A’… or perhaps a ‘B’… I truly apologize. Is there a way to find this information more easily?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Derasmo. We can certainly access your medication list through the pharmacy records. Just give me a moment. Ah, here we are. You are currently prescribed Amlodipine 5mg daily. Now, have you experienced any side effects from the Amlodipine?
PATIENT: Amlodipine! Yes, that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. No, no side effects that I’ve noticed. Just the usual…nothing to complain about. Though, I suppose this tiredness could be from that…or everything else. I truly don’t know anymore. It's all rather…muddled. Are we getting closer to understanding things? I do have an appointment later this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: We are gathering information, Ms. Derasmo. Now, let's briefly discuss your family history. Are there any mental health conditions – such as depression or anxiety – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Mental health conditions…hmm. That’s a difficult question. My mother…she was a very stoic woman. Didn’t show much emotion, ever. My aunt…she was a bit…eccentric, perhaps. Spent a lot of time alone. But whether that was…a condition, I couldn’t say. No one really talked about these things, you see. Not openly. We just…dealt with things. Is that helpful? I'm afraid I don't have much to offer on that front.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for those topics to not have been openly discussed in the past. Now, Ms. Derasmo, before we proceed, I want to ensure we are covering all bases. Have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite…it comes and goes. Some days I eat very little, others I eat too much. And yes, I've lost a little weight, I suppose. Not much, but enough for my daughter to notice. She's very observant, that one. Frankly, I haven't been paying much attention to these things. It's all just…a blur, as I said. Is this going to take much longer, Doctor? I do have that appointment…
DOCTOR: Ms. Derasmo, I understand your concern about time. We are nearing the completion of the initial assessment. Just a few more questions. Are you experiencing any difficulty sleeping, beyond just feeling tired?
PATIENT: Difficulty sleeping…yes. Not falling asleep, necessarily, though sometimes that’s a struggle. It’s…staying asleep. I wake up several times during the night. Little things, mostly. A noise, a thought… and then I can’t get back to sleep. I lie there for hours, staring at the ceiling. It's very frustrating. I haven't been getting proper rest, at all. Is that what you wanted to know? I truly wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Derasmo, that is helpful. Now, one final question. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself, or feeling that life is not worth living?
PATIENT: Oh! Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. Never. I’ve… I’ve just been feeling down, as I said. Tired, and… lost. But harming myself? No, never. That’s… that’s a terrible thought. I assure you, Doctor, I would never do anything like that. My daughter would be devastated. No, never. Is that… is that what you were concerned about? I truly hope that wasn’t the case. I'm ready to finish now, if you are.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest, Ms. Derasmo. Based on the information you’ve provided, it sounds as though you are experiencing symptoms consistent with mild to moderate depression, potentially exacerbated by recent life stressors and the lingering effects of your divorce. It's important to remember that this is a treatable condition. I would like to start you on a trial of an antidepressant medication, in addition to recommending short-term psychotherapy. I'll also order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. Does this sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An antidepressant…and therapy… Yes. Yes, I suppose so. If you think it will help, I’m willing to try anything. Honestly, I just want to feel like myself again. My daughter has been suggesting therapy for years, but I always resisted. Perhaps she was right. Blood work…yes, that’s sensible. I suppose it’s best to rule everything out. Just… will the medication have side effects? I do have that appointment this afternoon, and I don't want to be… incapacitated. And how long will it take to see a difference? I really do need to be functional. This has been…a lot to take in. Is there anything I should be aware of, immediately?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible question, Ms. Derasmo. The antidepressant I’m prescribing – Sertraline – is generally well-tolerated, but common side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, and some initial sleep disturbance. These usually subside within a week or two. It can take 4-6 weeks to see a noticeable improvement in your symptoms, but some people experience a benefit sooner. We will monitor you closely, and I can adjust the dosage if needed. It's important to take the medication as prescribed, even if you don't feel an immediate effect. Regarding your appointment this afternoon, you should be perfectly functional, though I recommend avoiding any major decisions or strenuous activities until you’ve had a chance to see how you react to the medication. I'm also referring you to a local therapist, Dr. Anya Sharma. Her contact information is on this referral slip. You can schedule an initial consultation at your convenience. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Sertraline… Dr. Sharma… Yes. I suppose not, at the moment. This is… a lot to process, as I said. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. And for being…efficient. I truly do hate to take up people’s time. I believe that is all. Thank you again. I will schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma as soon as possible. And I will take the medication as prescribed. I just… I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Derasmo. And I am confident that with treatment, you will. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you for a follow-up appointment in four weeks. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have been most kind. I appreciate your time, and your… understanding. .
