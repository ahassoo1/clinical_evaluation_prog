DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's kinda strange, to be honest. Everything's just… brighter than it used to be. Like, really bright. It's been happening for a few weeks now, and it's making things uncomfortable. Especially outside.
DOCTOR: Brighter, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, brighter. It’s hard to explain. Not like things are blurry, just… more intense. Like the sun is always shining, even when it’s cloudy. And even lights inside, they seem really strong now. It’s not a headache, exactly, but it makes me squint a lot. It’s just… a lot. Does that make sense? I feel a bit silly trying to explain it.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good you’re describing it. “A lot” isn’t terribly helpful for a diagnosis, of course, but we'll get there. So, this increased brightness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty constant, actually. It's not like it suddenly appears, it just… is. But it's worse when I’m outside, definitely. Even on a cloudy day. And like, fluorescent lights in the store… those really bother me. It's been making me avoid going out much, if I'm being honest. I used to love taking walks, but now... not so much. It just feels uncomfortable on my eyes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything else changed with your vision?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No, not really. Everything looks the same, just brighter. No blurriness, no spots, no double vision, nothing like that. I can still see everything as clearly as before, I think. It’s just the… intensity of the light. It feels like my eyes are more sensitive, I guess. Oh! And maybe a little bit of trouble adjusting when I go from inside to outside. It takes a few seconds longer than it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any recent illnesses, head injuries, or changes in medication?
PATIENT: No illnesses, no. And definitely no head injuries! I'm pretty careful. As for medication... let me see. I take a vitamin D supplement, that’s about it. Nothing new, I’ve been taking that for years, Doctor. My wife – she passed away last year – she told me to, said it was good for my bones. I haven’t changed anything since then, honestly. Everything’s been pretty… stable, if you know what I mean. Except for this light thing, of course.
DOCTOR: Right. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a tricky one. My wife’s side, they had some eye problems, I think. Something about… glaucoma, maybe? Her mother had it. But on my side, I don't really know much. My parents passed away when I was young, and I didn’t keep in touch with a lot of relatives. I know my grandfather wore glasses, but that’s about it. It wasn't something we talked about much. Sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a quick look at your eyes, shall we?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me know what you’d like me to do. I'm a bit nervous about this, to be honest, but I'm hoping you can figure out what's going on. It's just… unsettling, you know? Having everything so bright.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable. Just sit comfortably and look straight ahead. I’m going to shine a light in each eye, one at a time. It won't take long. Now, can you tell me how old you are, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: I’m 32, Doctor. Thirty-two years old. And I appreciate you taking the time to look into this for me. It’s been a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation. No obvious lens abnormalities. Fundi appear normal, no evidence of glaucoma or macular degeneration… though it's difficult to say definitively without further testing. Your visual acuity seems normal as well. Now, I'm going to check your peripheral vision. I want you to focus on this point here, and tell me when you can see the lights in your side vision.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm focusing on that point. Let me know when you want me to say something. It's a little strange focusing so hard on one thing and trying to see things on the sides at the same time. But I can do it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Peripheral vision appears intact. No obvious deficits… This is… unusual. Everything seems structurally normal, but your complaint of increased brightness is certainly valid. It's not something I can diagnose with a quick examination. It could be a sensitivity issue, perhaps related to changes in the corneal nerves, but that’s just speculation at this point. I'm going to recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist for a more thorough evaluation. They can perform specialized tests to determine the exact cause of your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. If you think it's best, a specialist is definitely a good idea. I just want to figure out what's going on. It’s just… unsettling, you know? This feeling. I’m happy to go see a specialist. Do you have a recommendation for someone good? And will my Medicare cover the visit?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I have a colleague, Dr. Anya Okoro, she’s excellent. Very thorough and specializes in corneal disorders. Her number is right here. As for Medicare, yes, it should cover the visit, assuming she's in-network. It’s best to confirm with your insurance provider beforehand, just to be sure. They can give you specifics on your coverage and any potential co-pays. Now, while we’ve ruled out any immediate, serious concerns, I’d advise you to avoid prolonged exposure to bright light until you’ve seen Dr. Okoro. Wear sunglasses, even on cloudy days. And if you experience any other symptoms – headaches, blurred vision, eye pain – contact me or go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I will definitely call Dr. Okoro tomorrow and check with Medicare. And yes, I understand. Sunglasses, avoid bright light, and contact you if anything changes. I really appreciate you taking the time to look into this, even if you don’t have a definite answer yet. It’s good to know it’s not something immediately dangerous. I feel a bit better now, honestly.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s… reassuring. I’ll document our findings and the referral in your chart. Alright. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's all. Thank you again for everything. I think I have everything I need to get started. I’ll be sure to follow up with Dr. Okoro as soon as possible. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day. And do follow up.
