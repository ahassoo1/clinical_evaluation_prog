DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, honestly, I haven’t the time for this. It’s my vision, and my hearing. They’ve… diminished. Rather suddenly, I might add. It’s quite inconvenient. I simply need to know what can be done about it, and quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're concerned about changes in your vision and hearing, and that it’s happening quickly. That is concerning, and we’ll definitely look into it. It's good you came in. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, dates escape me. It was… recently. A week? Perhaps less. It’s all a bit of a blur, truthfully. I was driving, and things seemed… dimmer. And then, during a bridge game with friends, I simply couldn’t make out what they were saying. Very frustrating, I assure you. I don’t recall precisely when, but it was quite abrupt. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a starting point, thank you. “Abrupt onset” is helpful information. So, about a week or less… and it affected both your vision and hearing around the same time?
PATIENT: Yes, more or less. Though, the hearing is… the more bothersome of the two. I simply must be able to hear properly. It's essential for social engagements, you understand. And I do have a rather important luncheon planned next week. Honestly, Doctor, I do hope this won't interfere.
DOCTOR: I understand. Hearing is very important for staying connected, and we'll certainly address that. Let’s talk about the hearing first. Can you describe how it’s diminished?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… muffled. Everything sounds distant, like I’m underwater. And sometimes… a ringing. A rather irritating ringing, I might add. It’s not a constant thing, but it’s… disconcerting. It makes conversation difficult, and frankly, Doctor, I’ve always prided myself on my excellent conversational skills.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing with ringing… That’s good information. And is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Both ears. Really, must I spell everything out? It’s not as though I’m selectively losing my hearing, is it? Honestly, sometimes I wonder… the level of detail these doctors require. It’s simply… both.
DOCTOR: Right, both ears. Apologies, just trying to get a complete picture. And has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Well… loud noises, naturally. Though, everything seems rather loud these days, doesn't it? And… stress, perhaps? I had a rather trying visit with my daughter last week. She insists on meddling in my affairs. It was… exhausting. Though I doubt a visit from her is the root cause of my medical issues. Honestly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, loud noises and stress seem to exacerbate it. That’s helpful. Now, let’s switch gears back to your vision for a moment. You said things seemed dimmer while driving… can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s just… everything appears less vibrant, Doctor. The colours aren't as… distinct. And it’s as though there’s a slight… haze. It’s not a complete blackout, mind you. I can still see, but it requires… effort. And frankly, driving is becoming rather precarious. I simply must be able to see clearly. It’s a matter of safety, you understand. And my reputation.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. Less vibrant colours and a slight haze… And is this haze present in both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Both eyes. Honestly, are you even listening? I’ve already explained this. It's not a singular issue, affecting only one sense or one side of my body. It's… a general decline. And I haven’t got all day to repeat myself. I have a luncheon to prepare for, you know. Perhaps we should get straight to the tests?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to want to get to the bottom of this quickly, Ms. Julie. I apologize if my questions feel repetitive. I just want to be thorough. Before we proceed with tests, could you tell me about any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, what other symptoms could there be? I’ve told you about my vision and my hearing. I’m not prone to… ailments. Perhaps a slight headache occasionally, but that’s likely from the stress of dealing with… people. And a bit of fatigue, naturally. But who isn’t fatigued these days? It's hardly a cause for concern. I assure you, I am generally a very healthy woman. Are we finally going to begin the tests?
DOCTOR: Alright. A slight headache and fatigue. Thank you. Now, before we begin, just a few quick questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor. Really. Must we? I’ve always been rather… fortunate in terms of health. A bit of high blood pressure, perhaps, years ago. But that was managed with diet and… a change of scenery. Nothing significant. And a hysterectomy, naturally, decades ago. But that’s hardly relevant, is it? Honestly, I’m a very straightforward case. I simply need my vision and hearing restored, and quickly. Let’s not dwell on ancient history. Are we still questioning me, or are we commencing with the examination?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. High blood pressure in the past, managed with diet, and a hysterectomy. Thank you for letting me know. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a small dose of lorazepam, occasionally, for… nerves. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it. Oh, and a daily aspirin, to… prevent things. That's it, I believe. Nothing extensive. Honestly, I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Are we finally going to start? This is taking far too long. I have a perfectly good bridge game waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, lorazepam occasionally for nerves, vitamin D, and a daily aspirin. Good to know. Alright, Ms. Julie, let’s begin the examination. I’m going to start with a basic neurological exam, check your reflexes, and then we’ll do a visual and auditory assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But please, be quick about it. I haven’t got all day. And do try not to poke me too much. Honestly, the indignity of it all. Let’s just get it over with. I have a luncheon to attend, you know. And a bridge game. And I need to look presentable for both. Do hurry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears. This will help me rule out any obvious causes for your hearing loss. Just relax, and I’ll let you know if I see anything unusual. Alright… ears appear clear, no signs of infection or wax buildup. Now let's look at the left ear… Also clear. Good. Now, I’m going to do a quick cover test. I’ll cover one ear at a time and see if you notice a difference in how you hear my voice. Can you tell me "yes" when you hear me speaking?
PATIENT: Yes. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure what you're hoping to find. As I explained, it's simply a diminishment. A gradual decline. It’s not as though there’s a foreign object lodged in my ear. This is all rather… elementary. Do hurry, please. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's try covering your right ear... Can you hear me now?
PATIENT: Yes… barely. It’s muffled, as I’ve already stated. Honestly, Doctor, are you even listening to me? This is becoming rather tiresome. I’m beginning to suspect I should have gone to a different practice. Perhaps one with more… efficient practitioners. Do hurry. My bridge partners will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Julie, I am listening, and I appreciate your patience. It seems there's a symmetrical decrease in hearing, meaning it's affecting both ears equally. Now, let's move on to your vision. I’m going to have you read this eye chart. Can you tell me which line is the clearest?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is hardly necessary. My vision is perfectly adequate, albeit slightly dimmed. But if you insist… This one. Though it’s rather small, and straining my eyes. Honestly, this is all rather… beneath me. Can we please move on to something more conclusive? I have a luncheon reservation, you know. And a reputation to uphold.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Thank you. Your visual acuity is 20/30 in both eyes, which indicates mild vision impairment. Now, I’m going to shine a light into your eyes to check your pupils and retinal reflex. Just look straight ahead. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Retinal reflexes appear… slightly diminished, but no obvious abnormalities. Now, I’m going to test your peripheral vision. Can you tell me when you see my finger moving in your side vision?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… tedious. I see it. When you wave your finger. Is there a point to all this, or are you simply trying to prolong the inevitable? I have a perfectly good bridge game waiting for me. And a luncheon with… important people. Can we please get to the bottom of this and prescribe whatever medication is necessary? I haven't got all day, you know. And my time is valuable. Do hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Your peripheral vision appears slightly constricted, but within acceptable limits. Based on the examination findings – symmetrical hearing loss, mild vision impairment, slightly diminished retinal reflexes, and constricted peripheral vision – it appears you’re experiencing a gradual decline in both your auditory and visual function. However, the findings are not specific enough to pinpoint a definitive diagnosis at this time. It could be related to age-related changes, but we need to rule out other potential causes. I recommend a hearing test and a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist to get a more detailed assessment. Would you be willing to schedule those tests?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, more tests? Really? I’ve already wasted half the afternoon here, subjected to a battery of… examinations. But… fine. If it must be done. Schedule the tests. But I expect them to be efficient, and I expect the results to be prompt. I haven’t got all day, you know. And I must be able to attend my bridge game next week. And my luncheon. Are we finally finished here? I need to call my driver.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. I’ve scheduled you for a hearing test with Audiology for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM, and a comprehensive eye exam with Dr. Ramirez, the ophthalmologist, for next Thursday at 2:00 PM. I’ll have the receptionists send over the appointment confirmations. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a mild vitamin B12 supplement, as B12 deficiency can sometimes contribute to neurological symptoms. It's a relatively harmless addition, and could potentially offer some benefit. And I will send a note to your primary care physician outlining my findings and recommendations. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Vitamin B12. Whatever. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my luncheon. And do ensure this note to my primary care physician is… thorough. I don’t want any unnecessary questions. Honestly, the thought of having to explain all this to another doctor is… exhausting. Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must be going. I have a perfectly good bridge game waiting for me, and a luncheon with… important people. Do hurry with the paperwork. And thank you for… your time. Though, frankly, I suspect it was a waste of both our time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Julie. I'll have the receptionists prepare your paperwork. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this for you. Have a good day, and enjoy your luncheon and bridge game. .
