DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Minatra, yes… 67. Right. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Osga. It’s… well, it’s about a test I had done. A GI Endo Test, the paperwork said. The results weren’t quite what I expected, and my regular doctor thought I should come in to discuss them with a specialist. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A GI Endo Test… yes, yes. Frankly, people come in with paperwork all the time. Specialists… Honestly. What exactly is unsettling you?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor didn't explain what was abnormal, exactly. Just that it was. He said it could be a number of things, and that I needed someone who understood the results better to… to look closer. He was very kind, but not very specific. It's my stomach, you see, and I've always had a sensitive one. Is it something serious, Doctor? I'm a widow, living alone, and… well, I like to know what I’m facing.
DOCTOR: “A sensitive stomach.” That's what everyone says. Look, Mrs. Minatra, these tests… they pick up something all the time. Doesn't mean you're about to… well, never mind. Let’s just get to the results. I'll pull up the report here. Do you happen to know what they were looking for with this test?
PATIENT: To be perfectly honest, no, I don’t. The doctor just said it was a routine check, part of my yearly physical. He asked about some discomfort I’d been having – a bit of cramping, mostly, and feeling full rather quickly when I eat. He mentioned something about looking at the lining of my stomach and intestines, but I wasn’t really following all the details. It all happened so quickly! I just… I trust him, but he wasn't very clear about why he ordered it, or what the test actually does. Is that bad of me? I feel a bit foolish asking.
DOCTOR: Foolish?
PATIENT: No, not foolish, exactly. Just… unprepared, perhaps. I’ve never been one to question doctors. My husband always handled these things, and… well, it’s been five years since he passed. I’m still getting used to doing things on my own, I suppose. But please, Doctor, if you could explain what the test looks for, and what these results mean… I would be very grateful. It would put my mind at ease, even if it’s not good news.
DOCTOR: Right. An Endoscopy. They stick a camera down your throat. Looks at the esophagus, stomach, duodenum. Honestly, it’s not rocket science. The report here… indicates some mild inflammation in the stomach lining. And a small polyp in the duodenum. Not uncommon. It could be nothing, or it could be… something else. Do you have a history of ulcers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. My husband had some issues with his gallbladder, but nothing with his stomach. I’ve always been quite careful with my diet, avoiding spicy foods and things like that. Inflammation… is that serious? Is that why I've been feeling so full so quickly? And a polyp… that sounds… concerning. What does that even mean? I apologize for all the questions; I just want to understand.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Minatra, you’re getting worked up over nothing. Mild inflammation… happens. Your stomach lining is irritated. Could be stress, could be something you ate. The polyp… it's a small growth. Most are benign. But we need to look at it. I’ll need to schedule another endoscopy to take a biopsy. Just to be sure. It’s standard procedure. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, Doctor. And occasionally ibuprofen for a headache, but not very often. A biopsy… that sounds… invasive. Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I’m a bit anxious about going under anything, even if it's just a mild sedative. My husband… he wasn’t very good with hospitals, and I tend to worry, I suppose. Is it something I need to prepare for in any special way?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… right. The biopsy itself is quick. They take a tiny sample of tissue. You won’t feel a thing, you’ll be sedated. Mostly you’ll just be a little groggy afterwards. You’ll need someone to drive you home. And, honestly, Mrs. Minatra, the worrying isn’t going to help. It’s a routine procedure. You need to fast for eight hours beforehand, and let me know if you have any allergies to the sedative. Now, about this polyp… it’s small, but we need to rule out anything serious. Do you have any family history of stomach cancer?
PATIENT: To my knowledge, no. My mother passed away from a heart condition, and my father… well, he died in the war when I was very young. I don’t really know much about his side of the family. As for my siblings, they both passed away several years ago. One from a stroke, the other from pneumonia. So, no, no history of stomach cancer that I'm aware of. It’s just… all this talk of biopsies and growths is unsettling. Is there anything I can do to… to help my stomach feel better in the meantime? Perhaps a specific diet or something? I know you said it could be stress, and I suppose it is, with all this uncertainty.
DOCTOR: Stress, yes. That’s probably the biggest culprit. As for diet... bland foods. Avoid anything spicy, acidic, or fatty. Stick to things like toast, rice, chicken broth. And try to relax. Honestly, Mrs. Minatra, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. We'll get this sorted out. I'll have the nurse schedule the endoscopy. You'll need a driver, and you need to be prepared for a bit of discomfort afterwards, but it's nothing you can’t handle. Do you have any questions for me before I wrap this up?
PATIENT: Well… yes, actually. You mentioned discomfort afterwards. How long does that usually last? And is it… painful? I’ve always been rather sensitive to pain, and I don’t want to be caught unprepared. Also, if the biopsy does show something… what are the next steps? I suppose I’m just trying to understand what I’m facing, should the worst happen. I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Minatra. I have other patients waiting. Discomfort… a little sore throat, maybe some bloating. It usually subsides within a day or two. Pain?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. And if the results aren’t good… what happens then? Will I need surgery? Or… something else? I understand you’re busy, but just a general idea would be helpful. I have no close family to lean on, you see, and I like to be prepared for all eventualities. It's just me, and it's better to know, isn't it? Even if the news is bad.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Minatra, if the biopsy shows something concerning, we’ll discuss it. It could involve further testing, possibly surgery, but we’re not there yet. Worrying about all that now is pointless. I'll have the nurse schedule the endoscopy, and we'll go from there. Please, try to relax, and don't Google anything. It will only make you more anxious. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to see my next patient. The nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your time. I will try to remain calm, as you suggest. And I promise, I won’t Google anything. .
