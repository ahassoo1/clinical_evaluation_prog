DOCTOR: Hi Clide, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Just been gettin’ a fever on and off, see? It’s been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not fun, lemme tell ya.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fever on and off. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts in the evenin’, feels kinda chilly, then I get warm. Not real high, you know? Like, I don't get the shakes or nothin’. Just…warm. Then it’s gone by mornin’ most times. Happens maybe three, four times a month now. It's been goin' on for…oh, jeez, maybe six, seven months. Hard to keep track, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it comes and goes, mostly evenings, not super high, and you'd say it’s been happening for about six or seven months. Do you check your temperature when you feel feverish?
PATIENT: Nah, I don't bother with that. Never been one for thermometers. I just feel warm, and I know that ain't right. My wife, Elena, she checks sometimes, but she's usually asleep by the time it starts. She says it's around 100, 101 when she does. But I don't write it down or nothin’. Just tellin’ you what feels wrong, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so around 100-101 when your wife checks it, but you mostly go by how you feel. Besides the fever, are you having any other symptoms when it comes on?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Sometimes I get a little tired, kinda achy, like I pulled somethin’. But I'm always achy, to be honest. Old age, you know? No cough, no sniffles, no nothin’ like that. Just the warm feelin’ and the tiredness. Maybe a little bit of a headache, but not always. It’s mostly just…annoyin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, so tiredness, maybe some aches—you mentioned you're often achy anyway—and occasionally a headache along with the fever. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Not really, no. It just…happens. Seems random. I haven’t changed nothin’ in my routine, haven’t been travelin’ or nothin’. I eat the same stuff, go to bed at the same time. Elena says I should drink more water, but I always drink enough water. I don’t think anything makes it worse or better, honestly. It’s just…there.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ regular. I take a little somethin’ for my back sometimes, you know, bein’ a chiropractor and all, I tweak things and then need a little help with the soreness. But that's it. As for allergies… I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anythin'. Elena might know better, she remembers that kinda stuff. I'm pretty sure I'm good there, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I've had the usual, you know? Had the flu a few times, broke my wrist when I was a kid. Nothing major. High blood pressure for a while, but I watch my salt. Elena keeps me in line with that one. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy for my age. I mean, I'm a chiropractor, I take care of people's bodies for a livin’! I’ve never had any serious operations or nothin’ like that. Just…regular stuff, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother, she had some trouble with her heart when she got older. My father, he was pretty healthy, lived to be 85. Elena’s mother had diabetes, but her father was fine. Not much else I can tell ya, really. We didn't talk much about medical stuff, you know? It wasn't really our thing. Mostly just…people lived and people died. Nothing real dramatic.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, go ahead. Get it over with, eh? I got things to do, you know? But alright, do what you gotta do. Just try to be quick, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, your temperature is 100.3. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Ears look normal, a little wax buildup, but nothing concerning. Throat is a bit red, but no visible signs of infection. Blood pressure is 140/90, a little elevated, but not drastically so. Do you take it at home at all?
PATIENT: Nah, I don't mess with all that. Elena has one, she checks it sometimes, but I don't bother. 140, huh? Could be worse, I guess. I been stressin' a little lately with the practice, things been slow. Probably just that. But look, Doctor, what do you think it is? Am I gonna die or somethin’? Just tell me straight. I ain’t got time for fancy words.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. You’re not going to die. But your fever, along with the occasional headache and tiredness, could be a few things. It could be a mild viral infection, something you’re just fighting off. It could also be related to stress, like you mentioned. But with the slightly elevated blood pressure and the ongoing nature of the fever, I want to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some basic blood work. A complete blood count to check for infection, and a metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes. We’ll also check your thyroid levels, just to be safe. It's a pretty standard set of tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Fine, fine. Whatever you think is best. Just…how long is this gonna take? And where do I go? I got appointments to keep, you know. I ain’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, the lab is right down the hall, Room 203. It shouldn’t take too long, maybe 15-20 minutes. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Amussen sent you. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend getting some extra rest, drinking plenty of fluids, and trying to manage your stress. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Rest, fluids, stress... yeah, yeah, I know. No, I think that's it. Just get me those results, alright? I gotta get back to work. Where's the door? I appreciate you lookin' at me, Doctor. Hopefully, it’s nothin' serious. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. The nurse will give you the lab requisition form on your way out. Have a good day, Clide.
