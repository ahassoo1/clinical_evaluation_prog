DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Buoniconti. I am Dr. Blim. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Blim. It’s… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I believe I need some paperwork completed, regarding… what one does if they become unable to make decisions for themselves. A friend mentioned something called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I’m not entirely sure which, or even what the difference is, but I'd like to be prepared, if you understand. It’s all rather… hazy, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, very common these days. People wanting to “plan” for things. Though, frankly, most of it is unnecessary worry. Still, we accommodate. You’re referring to advance care planning documents. An Advance Directive is a broad term encompassing a Living Will and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is far more specific, for those with serious illness. Let’s clarify. Are you currently ill?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not… ill, precisely. I’m in good health, as far as I am aware. It’s just… things have been… unpredictable lately, and a former colleague suggested I have these documents completed. For peace of mind, she said. I don’t recall any specific incident that prompted it, but she was quite insistent. So, I suppose… perhaps the Advance Directive would be more appropriate? Though, truly, I’m not certain. It all feels rather… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: “Unpredictable.” Vague. Most concerning. And taking medical advice from colleagues… a dangerous practice. Very well. An Advance Directive it is, then. It consists of two parts, as I mentioned. The Living Will outlines your wishes regarding end-of-life care – resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, that sort of thing. The Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare designates someone to make those decisions for you, should you be unable to. Do you have someone specific in mind for the latter?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question, Doctor. My divorce was finalized not long ago, and… well, relations with my former spouse are… strained, to say the least. I have a sister, though. She lives in the countryside, and we’ve always been close. I believe she would be… capable. Her name is Naraa. Though, I haven't spoken to her in several months. It's… complicated. I suppose she would be the most suitable choice, if she is willing. Do you need her contact information at this time? I believe I have it somewhere…
DOCTOR: “Complicated.” Of course. People always have “complications.” It invariably leads to confusion and poor decision-making. We won't require her contact information immediately. However, she will need to be present to witness and sign the document, along with another adult witness. And, naturally, you must be of sound mind when signing. Before we proceed, let's establish your general health. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… No, I don’t believe so. I have regular check-ups, of course. My family physician is Dr. Sereen, though I haven't seen her in… well, it's been some time. I'm fairly active, despite my profession. Etching requires a steady hand and a great deal of focus, and that demands a certain… physical resilience. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything serious, if that is what you are asking. Just the usual childhood ailments, I suppose. Though my memory is… fragmented, so I may be overlooking something.
DOCTOR: “Fragmented memory.” Remarkable. And “etching”… a rather sedentary occupation, despite your claims. Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination, just to get a baseline. It's standard procedure. We'll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment. Please sit back and relax. If you’ll just remove your shoes and socks…
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I suppose that is… sensible. I apologize for my lack of… clarity. This is all rather unsettling, to be honest. I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of medical examinations. They always feel… intrusive. But I understand it’s necessary. Please, proceed at your own pace.
DOCTOR: 130 over 80. Acceptable, but trending upwards. Respiration is normal. Lungs are clear. Any history of allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… that is… I believe I had a mild reaction to some medication as a child, a rash, perhaps? But nothing significant. And I avoid certain pollens, if that counts. My eyes tend to water during the spring months. But it's more of an… irritation than a true allergy, I think. I’ve never required an EpiPen or anything of that nature. Honestly, Doctor, I’m rarely ill. It’s just… this paperwork weighs on my mind. Is this examination truly necessary for the Advance Directive?
DOCTOR: It is always necessary, Ms. Buoniconti. We must establish competency. Do you believe you are of sound mind?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor! I… I assure you, I am perfectly competent. It’s just… being asked such questions feels… accusatory. I am a professional woman, and I am quite capable of making my own decisions. I simply wish to ensure my wishes are respected, should… something unfortunate occur. I am not… unwell. This examination feels… unnecessary and, frankly, a little insulting. Is it standard practice to question a patient’s mental state simply because they are requesting an Advance Directive?
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, let me assure you, I am merely fulfilling my professional obligations. We live in litigious times. Establishing competency before documenting wishes is paramount. It protects you, as well as the healthcare team. Patellar reflexes are present and equal. Now, please follow my finger with your eyes. Do not move your head.
PATIENT: Is there… a particular reason you are focusing on my reflexes so intently, Doctor? It’s making me feel rather… uneasy. And, if I may ask, how much longer will this examination take? I have an appointment later this afternoon, and I am beginning to worry about being delayed. Perhaps we could simply discuss the paperwork now? I am quite capable of understanding the legal implications, and I am certain I can articulate my wishes clearly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, with all due respect, you are becoming increasingly… difficult. Your evasiveness and… sensitivity are concerning. A simple examination is not a personal affront. It is a necessary step to ensure you are fully capable of making informed healthcare decisions. I will conclude the neurological assessment, then we can discuss the paperwork. But I must warn you, if I have any doubts about your competency, I will be forced to recommend a psychological evaluation before proceeding. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A psychological evaluation? Doctor, that is outrageous! I came to you seeking a simple document, and now you are suggesting I am mentally unstable? I assure you, I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions. This is entirely unacceptable. I believe I will seek a second opinion. This consultation has been… deeply unsettling and, frankly, insulting. I do not appreciate being treated with such suspicion and… condescension. I will be contacting my insurance company regarding this… unfortunate experience.
