DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time. It's my breath. It smells bad. Really bad, apparently. My ex-husband… well, let's just say he made it very clear. It's embarrassing. Can we just figure out how to fix it?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's definitely good you're addressing this. It is something we can look into. When did you first notice this change in your breath?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really remember. It's probably been… a while. A few months, maybe? Look, I work outside all day, fixing roads. It's not like I'm sitting around smelling my own breath, okay? It just… escalated recently. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. So, a few months, and it's gotten worse recently. Besides your ex-husband mentioning it, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Well… people do kind of back away when I talk. And I guess I've been using a lot more gum. Like, a lot. But that's not solving the problem, obviously. It's… distracting. I just want it gone. Can we skip the whole life story and get to the solution?
DOCTOR: Alright. We can focus on getting to the cause and a solution. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bad breath?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… feeling sick? No. I mean, I'm tired, but that's from the job. I don’t have a cough or anything. Just… bad breath. Is it something serious? I really can't afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms. Let's talk about your oral hygiene. How often do you brush and floss?
PATIENT: Look, I brush. When I can. It's not like I have time for a whole routine, okay? I'm up before dawn most days. And floss? Sometimes. Honestly, probably not enough. Is that what you wanted to hear? I'm a highway worker, not a dentist!
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And do you have any dental appointments scheduled or have you been to the dentist recently?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Last time I went was… well, a long time ago. I don’t like dentists. They’re expensive, and frankly, I don’t see the point. If it doesn’t hurt, I don’t fix it. Is this going to be a whole lecture about brushing and flossing? Because I'm really not in the mood.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent dental visits. I understand your concerns about cost and time. We'll try to narrow down the possible causes without immediately jumping to a dental referral, although it may become necessary. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I'm around certain plants at work, but nothing serious. No medication allergies, no. I don’t take anything regularly. Just… painkillers occasionally if I pull something. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, occasional painkillers. What kind of painkillers do you take when you pull something?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen, usually. The generic kind. Over-the-counter stuff. Nothing fancy. Look, I'm starting to feel like I'm at a doctor's appointment for a cold. Can we get back to the breath? It's embarrassing, and I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll focus on the breath. Let me ask you about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Look, I work construction. It's not exactly a health food paradise, okay? I eat what I can, when I can. Usually sandwiches, chips, maybe a burger if we stop somewhere. Not a lot of fruits and vegetables. Definitely not enough water. Is that good enough? I don’t have time to make fancy meals.
DOCTOR: Okay. Not a lot of fruits, vegetables, or water. Let’s do a quick exam. Can you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your gums are a little red and swollen, and I see some tartar buildup. Your tongue looks normal. I don’t see any obvious sores or lesions. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No! Are you kidding? I work outside all day, inhaling dust and exhaust. I don’t need to add smoking to that. Absolutely not. Look, is this going to take much longer? I'm really losing daylight here.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking. Okay. Given your work environment, limited diet, infrequent dental care, and the findings on the quick exam, it's likely the bad breath is multifactorial. Dehydration, poor oral hygiene, and diet can contribute. Let's try a few things before jumping to more extensive testing. I’m going to recommend increased water intake, improving your oral hygiene – brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily – and focusing on a diet rich in fruits and vegetables if possible. Can you commit to that?
PATIENT: Fine. I can try. But don’t expect miracles. I’m a highway worker, not a beauty queen. And if this doesn’t work, I’m not coming back. What if it’s something serious? Do I need antibiotics or something?
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be something requiring antibiotics at this stage, but we’ll monitor. If the condition doesn’t improve after a week or two of diligent care, we can consider a referral to a dentist to rule out any underlying dental issues. And if you develop any other symptoms, like fever, pain, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Fine. Reasonable. Just… let me get back to work. I've wasted enough time here already. So, no follow-up appointment needed unless it gets worse? Just… drink more water and brush my teeth? Great. I’m going now. .
DOCTOR: Okay. That's right. Increased water intake and improved oral hygiene. If no improvement, or if you develop other symptoms, schedule an appointment. Have a good day, and be careful out there.
