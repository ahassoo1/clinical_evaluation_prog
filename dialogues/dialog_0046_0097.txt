DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. I received a…recommendation, shall we say, to come speak with you regarding these…advance directives. Honestly, I find the whole concept a bit morbid, but my husband insisted. He worries needlessly, as usual. I suppose I’m here to obtain the necessary forms, though I’m not entirely certain why I need them. It seems a waste of perfectly good time, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Marija. It can feel a bit unsettling to think about these things. However, advance directives are really about your wishes and ensuring they are respected if you are ever unable to communicate them yourself. It’s a proactive step, and a very important one. So, to be clear, you were referred to discuss a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare?
PATIENT: A…living will? Durable power of…what now? Honestly, Doctor, I simply asked for the forms. I was not expecting a lecture on legal terminology. My husband mentioned something about making decisions for me if…well, you understand. But I assure you, I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions. I simply want the paperwork completed, should it prove…necessary. Is that so difficult?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask for clarification, and I apologize if I jumped ahead with terminology. It is my job to make sure you understand everything clearly. Let's start with the simpler part. A durable power of attorney for healthcare is a document where you name someone – usually a family member or close friend – to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Think of it as having a trusted advocate. A living will, sometimes called an advance directive, outlines your wishes for medical treatment in specific situations – for example, if you have a serious illness and are unable to communicate. Would you like me to explain those in more detail, or would you prefer to just get the forms and we can go through them together later?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, the more you explain, the more convoluted this becomes. I’m a university professor, not a lawyer. I teach literature; I analyze texts, I don’t dissect legal jargon. My husband seems to think I need to specify every possible medical scenario. It’s rather…dramatic, if you ask me. Just give me the forms. Perhaps reading them will be more straightforward than attempting to decipher your explanations. And please, try to avoid using phrases like “trusted advocate.” It sounds…patronizing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I understand. Here are the forms for both a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare and a Living Will. They include explanations within the documents themselves, and I've highlighted the key sections. Take your time reviewing them. I'll be here if you have any specific questions as you go through them. Don't hesitate to ask, even if you feel the question is simple. We can go through each section together, and I'll do my best to explain everything in plain language. Would you like a pen and somewhere comfortable to sit while you review them?
PATIENT: A pen would be…helpful. And yes, a more comfortable chair would be preferable. This room is rather…sterile. I suppose I’ll have to make do. I’ll review these at my own pace, and then, if I have questions, I will let you know. Don’t expect me to be overly enthusiastic about this entire process.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. Please, take your time. There's absolutely no rush. I’ll be in the office if you need me. Feel free to call out if you have any questions at all.
PATIENT: Thank you. I expect this will take some time. These are…quite lengthy.
DOCTOR: Take all the time you need, Marija. I'm here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Doctor? This section on “life-sustaining treatment”…it seems rather…broad. What exactly constitutes “life-sustaining treatment”? Is a simple antibiotic considered “life-sustaining”? This is incredibly vague.
DOCTOR: That's an excellent question, Marija. You're right to point out the potential for ambiguity. "Life-sustaining treatment" generally refers to medical interventions that are essential to keep you alive, such as mechanical ventilation, dialysis, or artificial nutrition and hydration. An antibiotic, in most cases, wouldn't be considered life-sustaining, as it’s treating an infection rather than directly maintaining vital functions. However, in a severe case of sepsis where the infection is life-threatening and requires intensive care support, it could be part of a broader life-sustaining treatment plan. The intention of this section is to allow you to specify your wishes regarding those major interventions. We can certainly clarify that on the form – would you like me to add a note specifying that routine antibiotics are not included in your definition of life-sustaining treatment?
PATIENT: “Routine antibiotics”…that sounds rather…dismissive. As if a simple infection is nothing to be concerned about. Very well. Add a note specifying that any antibiotic requiring more than three days of treatment should be considered for discussion. And please, write legibly. I will not be deciphering your handwriting later on.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I've added a note specifying that any antibiotic treatment requiring more than three days of treatment should be considered for discussion. Is that more clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that is…acceptable. Now, this section on “artificial nutrition and hydration”…it mentions a feeding tube. Is that…pleasant? I’ve heard rather unpleasant things about feeding tubes.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Marija. Feeding tubes aren’t pleasant, no. They are generally considered when someone is unable to eat enough on their own to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. There are different types, and the process can vary. Typically, a feeding tube is inserted through the nose or directly into the stomach. It can be temporary, used for a short period while someone recovers from an illness, or long-term if someone has a chronic condition. There are potential complications, such as infection or discomfort, but these can usually be managed. We would only consider this if you were unable to eat or drink safely and were at risk of malnutrition or dehydration. It's something we would discuss thoroughly with you, your family, and other healthcare professionals before making any decisions. Do you want me to explain the different types of feeding tubes, or would you prefer to focus on the decision-making process itself?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I do not need a detailed description of the procedure. The very idea is…distressing. I suppose I simply need to indicate my wishes regarding this…option. I want it clearly stated that I do not want artificial nutrition or hydration under any circumstances. Unless…unless it’s temporary, and there is a very high probability of full recovery. Perhaps a week, maximum. Is that possible to specify?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. I've written that you do not want artificial nutrition or hydration under any circumstances, except in the case of a temporary need with a high probability of full recovery, and a maximum duration of one week. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that is…precise enough. Though, add "in consultation with my husband" after that phrase. He tends to…overthink these things, and I would prefer his input before any decisions are made. Even if I disagree with him, ultimately. It will simply…appease him.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I've added, “in consultation with my husband,” after the phrase regarding temporary artificial nutrition and hydration. So it now reads, “in consultation with my husband.” Is there anything else you would like me to add or clarify regarding this section?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is sufficient for now. It is all rather…exhausting, if I’m honest. This form is quite long. Is there much more of it?
DOCTOR: We're about halfway through now, Marija. The remaining sections cover things like pain management, resuscitation preferences, and organ donation. We can take it one section at a time, and I’m happy to pause whenever you need a break. Would you like to continue now, or would you prefer to stop for a moment?
PATIENT: Very well. Let’s proceed. The sooner this is finished, the better. Pain management…I assume that refers to…strong medication? I’m not particularly fond of strong medication. It makes me…groggy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct, Marija. This section allows you to specify your preferences regarding pain management, including whether you want to receive aggressive pain relief even if it might cause some drowsiness or other side effects. It also allows you to indicate your comfort level with different types of pain relief methods. We wouldn't administer any medication without your consent, or the consent of your husband if you're unable to communicate. This is simply a way to ensure your wishes are respected. Would you like me to explain the different options in more detail, or would you prefer to simply indicate your general preferences?
PATIENT: No, I do not need a detailed explanation of every possible analgesic. Simply write that I prefer the minimum dosage necessary to alleviate discomfort. I do not want to be…incapacitated. And no morphine, if possible. It makes me…nauseous. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very clear, Marija. I've written that you prefer the minimum dosage necessary to alleviate discomfort, and that you would like to avoid morphine if possible. Is there anything else you would like me to add regarding pain management?
PATIENT: Yes. Add that I want to remain…oriented, as much as possible. I do not want to lose my…faculties. I want to be aware of my surroundings, even if I am in pain. Is that…achievable?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. We would always prioritize maintaining your level of awareness as much as possible. I’ve written that you wish to remain oriented and aware of your surroundings, even while receiving pain management. We can adjust the medication and dosage to achieve that goal, and we would regularly assess your level of awareness. Is there anything else you would like to add regarding this?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is sufficient. Let’s proceed to the next section. Resuscitation preferences, you said? Is that regarding…CPR? I’ve seen rather…dramatic portrayals of CPR on television. It doesn’t seem particularly pleasant.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct, Marija. This section allows you to specify your preferences regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. It's a procedure used to attempt to revive someone whose heart has stopped beating or who has stopped breathing. You can indicate whether you want to receive CPR, and under what circumstances. You can also specify whether you want other life-sustaining measures, such as intubation or mechanical ventilation. It's a difficult decision, and there's no right or wrong answer. We're here to help you make the choice that's right for you. Do you want me to explain the different options in more detail, or would you prefer to simply indicate your general preferences?
PATIENT: No, I do not need a detailed explanation. Honestly, the thought of being…revived…it’s rather unappealing. Add that I do not want CPR under any circumstances. And no intubation, either. I prefer…natural processes. Is that clear enough? I want to be allowed to…pass peacefully, if my time comes. Without being…prolonged artificially.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very clear, Marija. I've written that you do not want CPR or intubation under any circumstances, and that you prefer to allow natural processes to take their course. I’ve also added that you wish to pass peacefully, without artificial prolongation. This is a very important decision, and I want to ensure you're comfortable with it. We would, of course, respect your wishes completely. Is there anything else you would like to add regarding resuscitation preferences?
PATIENT: No. Let us proceed to the final section. Organ donation, you said? I…I suppose that is a rather noble gesture, though I haven’t given it much thought. Is it…complicated?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct, Marija. This section allows you to specify your wishes regarding organ donation. It’s a process where your organs or tissues are used to help someone else who is in need of a transplant. It’s a very generous act, and it can save lives. It's not complicated, but it's important to understand the different options. You can choose to donate specific organs, or all of your organs. You can also choose to donate tissues, such as your corneas or skin. Do you want me to explain the different options in more detail, or would you prefer to simply indicate your general preferences?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I…I haven’t really considered it. I suppose…I suppose I am not opposed to it. It does seem…a worthwhile gesture. Add that I consent to organ donation, if my organs are deemed suitable. But…add a caveat. Add that my husband must be consulted before any donation takes place. He…he tends to worry, and I wouldn’t want to upset him unnecessarily. Is that…acceptable?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly acceptable, Marija. I’ve written that you consent to organ donation if your organs are deemed suitable, and that your husband must be consulted before any donation takes place. That completes the advance directives. Is there anything I can clarify or explain further?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all. It has been…a rather exhausting process, but I suppose it was necessary. Thank you, Doctor, for your patience. And thank you for not judging my…reservations. Will my husband need to sign this as well? Or is my consent sufficient?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marija. I’m glad we were able to get through it together. And no, your consent is sufficient. However, it’s always a good idea to discuss these wishes with your husband, so he’s aware of your preferences. I will have my assistant make copies for both of you, and we’ll keep the original on file here at the clinic. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all. Thank you again, Doctor. You have been…surprisingly accommodating. Perhaps this whole process wasn't as dreadful as I anticipated. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marija. It was my pleasure. And you have a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future.
