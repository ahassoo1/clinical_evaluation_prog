DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think. Oh, this cough. It’s been… a while now. Just a dry tickle, mostly. Doesn't really hurt, just… annoying. I forget how long exactly. A long time, though. Seems longer when you get older, you know?
DOCTOR: I do understand, sir. Time can certainly feel different as we get older. So, this cough has been going on for a while… a dry cough, not painful, just bothersome. Can you try to recall roughly when it started?
PATIENT: Roughly… hmm. That’s the hard part. Before… before my wife passed, maybe? Or after? It’s all… blurry. We used to go to the farmers market every Saturday… she loved the peaches. No, that doesn’t help, does it? It’s been a good year, at least. Maybe longer. I just… don’t keep track of things like that anymore. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that’s quite alright, Mr. Pavlovic. It's perfectly understandable. A year or longer… that gives us a starting point. And reminiscing is good. So, this cough—has it been constant for the past year, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Worse when it’s cold, or when I… well, when I’m moving around a lot. I used to fix cars, you see. Still do a little, but not like before. The dust… that probably doesn’t help. It’s better when I’m sitting, quiet. Just… sitting. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it’s worse with activity and exposure to dust, and better when you’re resting. Have you noticed anything else associated with the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… associated? Like… what do you mean? Sometimes I get… a little short of breath, maybe. But I’m an old man, Doctor. I get short of breath walking up the stairs, too! It’s hard to say what’s from the cough and what’s just… old age. And I… sometimes feel tired, but who doesn’t? Sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Mr. Pavlovic. It's good you're telling me all of this. It's important for me to get a clear picture. So, shortness of breath, particularly with exertion, and fatigue. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I remember. Chills… maybe sometimes, but I always have a little bit of a chill, you know? It gets cold in this old house. Night sweats… no. I don’t think so. I sleep pretty soundly, actually. Unless the dog starts barking at the mailman. He’s a little terrier. A real troublemaker. Sorry, rambling again.
DOCTOR: No, please, don't apologize. It's good to know these things. Alright, no fever, chills or night sweats. Now, have you had any other symptoms, like chest pain, wheezing, or coughing up any phlegm or mucus?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. Not really. Sometimes a little ache, but it’s just… old age, I think. Wheezing… I don’t know what that sounds like. And no… no phlegm or mucus. Just… dry. That's why it's so annoying. It just… tickles. Like something's stuck in my throat. Sometimes I have to clear it, but nothing comes up. It's a strange cough. A very strange cough.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dry cough with no phlegm, no chest pain, and no wheezing. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like heart disease, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a hard question. My wife… she handled all that paperwork. I just… went to the doctor when she told me to. I think… I think the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high, once. And my knees are bad, of course. Arthritis, I think. But… lung problems? No, not that I know of. Never smoked, never been around a lot of smoke. Just… old age, I suppose. Everything hurts when you get old. Is that helpful? I’m probably not making much sense.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Mr. Pavlovic. It's alright if you don't remember everything. High blood pressure and arthritis are good to know. And it's good you've never smoked. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. My wife… she had a hip replacement a few years back. I stayed with her, of course. But me? I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. And… I think I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. But that was… before the war, I think. Everything gets blurry, you know? It’s just… old age. I’m sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Pavlovic. It's perfectly alright. A broken arm as a child and pneumonia a long time ago are good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… just… just a little pill for my blood pressure, I think. A small white one. My wife used to fill the little pill organizer for me. I just take what she put in there. I don’t know the name of it. And… sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re really acting up. But I forget what that is too. Mostly just… white pills. Sorry, I really don’t keep track of these things. I should probably ask my daughter, shouldn't I? She’s good with all that paperwork.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s easy to get things mixed up. Knowing you take something for blood pressure and sometimes for your knees is good. We can always check with your daughter if you’d like. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Never had any trouble with food. My wife always made good food. And… I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Maybe… maybe a little bit of dust, when I'm fixing cars? It makes me sneeze sometimes. But that's not really an allergy, is it? Mostly, I just get tired when I'm around dust. Sorry, I’m probably not making much sense. It’s just… old age. Everything gets blurry, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re making perfect sense, Mr. Pavlovic. And you’re not bothering me at all. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. My wife always said I should listen to the doctor. She was a smart woman. Just… be gentle, okay? My old bones aren't what they used to be. And… don't mind if I fidget a little. It’s hard to sit still for too long, you know? It’s just… old age. But yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pavlovic. I'll be as gentle as possible. Just relax as best you can. Okay, your heart sounds good and regular. Your lungs sound a little quiet, but that's not uncommon with age. Your throat looks a bit dry. I don’t notice anything concerning right now. I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with a small clip on your finger, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Oxygen… oh dear. What’s that involve? Is it going to hurt? My wife… she always had so many questions for the doctors. I just… let her do the talking. I’m not very good with all these… gadgets. But alright. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, okay? And tell me if it’s going to be uncomfortable. It's just… old age. Everything feels a little more sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: It won't hurt at all, Mr. Pavlovic. It's just a small clip that measures the oxygen level in your blood. It doesn't do anything, it just reads a number. It might feel a little cool for a moment. Okay, your oxygen level is 92%, which is a little on the lower side of normal. Normal is typically between 95% and 100%. Given your cough, and the slightly diminished breath sounds, I'd like to get a chest X-ray just to rule out any underlying lung issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… oh dear. Is that… is that safe? I’ve heard… things. My wife… she always said I should ask a lot of questions. But I always just… trusted her judgment. A little worried about radiation, you know? And… is it going to be uncomfortable? I have trouble standing for long periods. It’s just… old age. Everything aches. But alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. But please… be gentle. And tell me everything beforehand, okay? I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Pavlovic, and it's important to be informed. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very low, much less than you receive from a cross-country flight, for example. It's considered very safe and the benefits of ruling out any potential lung problems outweigh the minimal risk. You will be standing still for a few moments, but a technician will help position you and make sure you’re comfortable. It shouldn't be painful at all. The technician will give you a lead apron to protect other parts of your body. It’s a quick procedure, maybe a minute or two. Would you like me to explain any further?
PATIENT: A minute or two… alright. That doesn't sound too bad. And the apron… that’s good. My wife always said it was important to protect yourself. And… it won’t make me sick, will it? I’ve heard stories. But alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. Just… tell the technician to be gentle, okay? And… can I sit down afterward? My knees are acting up. It's just… old age. Everything aches. And… can you explain the results to me afterward? I don’t understand a lot of the medical terms. I just want to know… is everything okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Pavlovic. I will personally speak to the technician to ensure you are comfortable and positioned gently. And yes, you can definitely sit down afterward, and we’ll take as much time as you need. I will explain the results to you in plain language, and we’ll go over everything together. I understand medical terms can be confusing, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have. Let me go ahead and get the order for the X-ray, and I’ll have the technician come in to get you set up. Just relax, and we’ll take things one step at a time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds… alright. One step at a time… yes, that’s good. My wife… she always said I should take things easy. Just… be gentle, okay? And explain everything beforehand. I don’t want any surprises. And… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with an old man. It’s just… old age. Everything gets blurry, you know? But yes, go ahead. I’ll just… sit here and try to relax.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s my pleasure. I’ll be right back with the technician. Just take a few deep breaths and relax. .
