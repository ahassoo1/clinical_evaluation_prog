DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste any time, shall we?
PATIENT: Morning. Mutnick, you say? Sounds… foreign. Anyway, look, I’m not one for beating around the bush. There was blood. In my stool. Not a good sign, is it? I’ve seen things, you know. Things a young fella like you wouldn’t believe. And blood… well, that's never good.
DOCTOR: “Foreign” is a rather… blunt assessment, Mr. Rowbottom. However, we will focus on the matter at hand. Blood in the stool is certainly not ideal. To properly assess the situation, I require a detailed account. When did you first notice this blood?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t get your feathers ruffled. Just stating a fact. And detailed? What’s to detail? It was red. Like… well, like blood. A few days ago, I reckon. Maybe three? Four? I don't keep a calendar for my… bathroom habits, Doctor. Honestly. It wasn't a Niagara Falls of it, if that’s what you’re getting at. Just… a bit. Enough to make me notice. And worry, naturally. A man my age doesn’t just… ignore these things.
DOCTOR: Right. “A bit” is… not particularly helpful, Mr. Rowbottom. Was it mixed in with the stool, or was it separate?
PATIENT: Separate, I think. Yes, separate. Like… a streak. A red streak. Not all mixed up, like some sort of… jam. Honestly, you’re asking a lot of questions about something a man doesn’t normally discuss with strangers. And I am a bit particular about my privacy, you know. I flew planes for forty years, seen a lot, done a lot, don't need a lecture about... bodily functions. Is this going to take long? I have a very nice garden to tend to. Rhododendrons, you know. Demanding things, rhododendrons.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, my questions are necessary for a proper evaluation. Your rhododendrons will have to wait. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, things change as a man gets older, don’t they? That's just… life. But specifically? Hmm. Maybe a little… looser than usual, I suppose. Not rock solid, if you catch my drift. More… pliable. And, now that you mention it, I've been going more often. Just a little bit at a time, mind you. Not a flood, like I said before. Is it something to do with the weather? It's been awfully humid, hasn't it? Everything’s a bit… soft, these days. Even my tomatoes are splitting.
DOCTOR: Right. So, looser stools, increased frequency. Any abdominal pain, cramping, or nausea accompanying these changes?
PATIENT: Now you're talking about things I really don't like to discuss. Look, I'm not a delicate flower, but… well, a man has his dignity. But alright, alright. A little bit of a rumble in my tummy, maybe. Nothing major. Like… indigestion, after a rich meal. And a bit… gassy, if I'm being honest. But nothing to write home about. Definitely no cramping, and I haven’t been… well, you know. Getting rid of my dinner. I’ve got a strong stomach, always have. Flew over the Himalayas, remember? A little tummy rumble isn't going to bother me. Though, I did have a rather questionable oyster last week… could it be that?
DOCTOR: An oyster… potentially. Now, regarding your medical history, Mr. Rowbottom, have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions, such as diverticulitis, hemorrhoids, or inflammatory bowel disease?
PATIENT: Hemorrhoids? At my age? Honestly, Doctor. You think I haven't heard of those? A man in my profession… well, let’s just say there were long hours spent in uncomfortable seats. But diagnosed? No. Never been diagnosed with anything, if you want to know the truth. I was a healthy man, always. Rugged. Didn’t bother much with doctors, to be honest. Bit of a waste of time, usually. A strong constitution. And I've never had anything… inflamed, if that's what you mean. I’m a Rowbottom, remember? We’re built tough. My grandfather fought in the Boer War! Doesn't sound like the sort of man to get… inflamed. Is this all necessary? I really should be getting back to the garden. The slugs are having a field day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on. Any family history of colon cancer, or any other gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: Colon cancer… now that’s a grim thought. My mother… she wasn’t well. A bit vague on the details, to be honest. It was a long time ago. Something about… “stomach troubles.” But they didn’t have the fancy tests you have these days. Just… “stomach troubles.” My father… now he was a strong one. Never a day sick in his life. A logger, you see. Hard work. No time for… troubles. So, no. Not that I recall. We weren’t a family that discussed… internal matters. You understand. Men of action, Rowbottoms are. Not men of… charts and discussions. Honestly, Doctor, you're making me feel quite unwell just talking about all this. Is a stool sample absolutely necessary? Because I really don’t relish the thought.
DOCTOR: A stool sample is necessary, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s a standard procedure to rule out any serious underlying causes. And frankly, your vague family history and description of symptoms warrant further investigation. We need to be thorough. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Thorough? Thorough feels like an invasion of privacy. Fine, fine. A stool sample. Honestly. But don’t expect any miracles from it. It's probably just that oyster. Medications… hmm. Let me think. I take a little something for my arthritis. Just when it flares up, you understand. Something the pharmacist recommended. And… a multivitamin, I suppose. Keeps me going. Old man’s trick. Oh, and sometimes a bit of… prune juice. Helps things along, if you catch my drift. A little boost. Everything else, I try to avoid. Don't trust those fancy pills. Nature is best. Though, I did try one of those “energy boosters” a few years back… made me feel awful. Gave it right back to the pharmacy. Now, are you thorough with your questions, Doctor? Or are you just trying to frighten an old man?
DOCTOR: Right. Arthritis medication, multivitamin, and prune juice. I will need the name of the arthritis medication, Mr. Rowbottom. And, to be clear, I am not attempting to frighten you. I am attempting to ascertain the cause of blood in your stool. Now, please. The medication name. It’s a simple request. We have wasted quite enough time already.
PATIENT: Wasted time? You're the one asking a million questions! Honestly. Alright, alright. The arthritis stuff… it's… let me see… Glucosamine, I think. And Chondroitin. Something like that. One of those fancy names. Came in a blue bottle. Got it at… Miller's Pharmacy, down on Main Street. Old Miller’s a good man. Knows his stuff. Though he did try to sell me some foot cream last time… Honestly, the things they try to push on you these days! And don’t look at me like I'm the one wasting time, Doctor. I came here because of the… unfortunate incident. And frankly, I'm starting to regret it. You're making me anxious! Is it possible it’s just… stress? I've been rather worried about the rhododendrons. The aphids are terrible this year. Awful, I tell you. Awful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Glucosamine and Chondroitin. Now, I’m going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with abdominal palpation and a rectal exam. I understand these procedures may be… unpleasant, but they are necessary. And please, try to relax. Or at least, pretend to. It will make things… easier.
PATIENT: Palpation? Rectal exam? Now that's what I call an invasion of privacy! Absolutely not! I came here to discuss a bit of blood, not to be… prodded and poked! I've lived a long life, Doctor, and I've never been subjected to such indignity. I'm a respectable man! I flew planes, remember? I faced down storms and turbulence, but this… this is too much. You can forget the palpation and the… other thing. Absolutely not. I think I've had enough of this "thoroughness." I'm leaving. I'll just… deal with the blood myself. And I suggest you find a more… gentle line of work. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. However, I must strongly advise against self-treating. Blood in the stool is a serious symptom that requires proper investigation. I understand your discomfort, but refusing a basic examination is… unwise. I will provide you with a requisition form for a stool sample. Please take it to the lab as soon as possible. And if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. I cannot stress enough the importance of following up. Do not dismiss this issue lightly. Good day, Mr. Rowbottom. I wish you the best of health. Although, frankly, I doubt you will heed my advice. .
