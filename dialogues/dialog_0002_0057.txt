DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, welcome! I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. My name is Chellsea Lucht. I… I am here because of the cancer.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. That sounds very frightening. “Because of the cancer…” Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. Um… my husband, he… he passed away last year, and it was… it was cancer. And now… I have been feeling very tired, and there’s… a lump. I found it myself, a few weeks ago. It’s… it’s on my neck.
DOCTOR: I am so very sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. Losing someone to cancer is incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable that this is bringing up a lot of worry for you. And you’re being very proactive in getting this checked out, which is good. Okay, so you’ve noticed a lump on your neck, and you’ve been feeling fatigued. When you say a few weeks ago, can you remember roughly when you first noticed the lump?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… after the Fourth of July. Maybe a week or so after? It felt small at first, and I thought it was just a swollen gland, maybe. But it hasn’t gone down, and… it feels harder now. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly around the second week of July. And you’re right to pay attention to it, especially with your husband’s history. It’s good you've noticed the change in size and firmness. Has the lump been painful at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. It doesn’t hurt. It’s… uncomfortable, sometimes, like pressure, but not really painful. And… it doesn’t feel hot, if that makes sense. Just… there.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Chellsea. No pain or warmth. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Like… what kind of changes? I have been… losing my appetite. Not eating much. And… I’ve been coughing a little bit more than usual. Just a small cough, but it sticks around. I thought it was just a cold, but… it won't go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so loss of appetite and a persistent cough in addition to the lump and fatigue. Have you had any fever, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever. And… I haven’t really weighed myself, so I don’t know about weight loss. I… I haven't been feeling very good, so I haven't been thinking about things like that. I don’t… I don’t think I’ve been sweating at night, no. Just… tired. Really tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you had any other serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that’s it. And… I get my yearly checkups, but the doctor never found anything wrong. I haven’t been sick much. Except now, I guess. And… I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And yes, having Medicare is important information, thank you. No major illnesses or surgeries, just the tonsillectomy as a child. What about family history?
PATIENT: Well… my husband’s mother, she had… I think it was breast cancer. A long time ago, though. And… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had… something with his lungs. But I don’t know much about it. Everyone on my mother’s side is… Apache. And we… don’t really talk about those things. If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Chellsea. Family history can be difficult to piece together. Knowing about your husband’s mother and your grandfather is helpful, though. And… are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t take any medications. And… I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I… I just take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your lungs, feel your neck, and check a few other things. It’ll just take a few minutes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best. I… I just want to know what’s going on. I’m a little scared.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chellsea. It's completely normal to be scared. We'll do our best to figure out what's going on, and we'll take things one step at a time. Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Now another deep breath… and exhale. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. Now, I'm going to feel around your neck. I noticed the lump you mentioned. It’s approximately… 1.5 centimeters in diameter, and feels firm, but not hard. It doesn’t appear to be particularly tender. There’s some slight swelling in a few other lymph nodes on this side as well, but they're quite small. Your thyroid feels normal. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. I'd like to order a few tests to help us understand what might be going on. A complete blood count, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and… I’m going to recommend a fine needle aspiration of the lump on your neck. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A… a fine needle aspiration? What does that involve? I’ve never had that before. I… I am a little nervous about needles.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable to be nervous about needles, Chellsea. It's a very reasonable concern. A fine needle aspiration, or FNA, is a procedure where we use a very thin needle to take a small sample of cells from the lump on your neck. It helps us determine what the lump is made of. We’ll use a local anesthetic to numb the area first, so you shouldn’t feel much discomfort. It's a quick procedure, usually takes just a few minutes. We'll send the sample to the lab, and a pathologist will examine it under a microscope to look for any abnormal cells. It's the best way to get a clear answer. Do you have any questions about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: So… you’ll numb my neck, and then… stick a needle in the lump? And then… they’ll look at the cells? What if… what if it’s bad news? I… I don’t want to think about that. It reminds me of my husband. I… I am getting upset.
DOCTOR: Chellsea, it’s okay. It’s perfectly understandable that you're getting upset. It’s completely natural, and I am so sorry to have brought up painful memories. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. We'll take things one step at a time, and we won’t rush into anything. The FNA will give us more information, and we'll discuss the results thoroughly when they come back. We will cross that bridge when we come to it. Before we order the tests, would you like me to explain the potential reasons why the lump might be there?
PATIENT: Yes… please. I… I just need to know. I need to be prepared. I don't want to be surprised. And… what if it is cancer? What happens then?
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. Let’s talk about the possibilities. The most common cause of a lump on the neck is an enlarged lymph node due to an infection – like a cold or the flu. Sometimes, they can get enlarged from something minor. Less commonly, it can be a reaction to an autoimmune condition. However, given your history and your concerns, we need to rule out the possibility of something more serious, such as cancer. There are different types of cancer that can cause lumps on the neck – lymphoma, thyroid cancer, and cancer that has spread from another part of the body. However, it’s important to remember that most lumps on the neck are not cancerous. If the FNA does show cancerous cells, the next step would be further testing – imaging scans like a CT scan or MRI – to see if the cancer has spread. Then, we would discuss treatment options with you – surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination of these. We would also refer you to an oncologist – a cancer specialist – to help guide you through the process. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes… it does. It’s a lot to take in, though. So… there are a lot of possibilities. And… if it is cancer, it’s not automatically a death sentence? My husband… it was very fast. And… painful.
DOCTOR: No, Chellsea, it absolutely is not an automatic death sentence. Cancer treatment has come a long way, and there are many effective treatments available, especially if it’s caught early. And not all cancers are fast-moving or painful – it really depends on the type of cancer, the stage, and your overall health. Your husband’s experience was unique to him, and it's understandable that it's causing you anxiety. But it’s important not to compare your situation to his. Let’s focus on getting the FNA done and finding out what we’re dealing with. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I will be here to support you every step of the way. Do you want me to order the blood tests and schedule the FNA now?
PATIENT: Yes… please. I want to know. I… I need to know. And… can I bring someone with me for the FNA? I don’t think I can do it alone.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. You can definitely bring someone with you for the FNA – in fact, I encourage it. Having a support person there can make a big difference. Okay, I’m ordering the complete blood count and the thyroid stimulating hormone test now. The results should be back within a few days. And I’ll have the nurse schedule the FNA for you. She’ll help you find a time that works and will discuss any preparation instructions. Before you leave, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Ranjan. You’ve been… very kind. I’m still scared, but… I feel a little bit better knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. And it’s perfectly okay to be scared – it’s a natural reaction. I’m glad I could help ease some of your anxiety. Remember, I’m here for you. We’ll face this together, one step at a time. If you have any questions or concerns between now and your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your FNA. Take care of yourself, Chellsea. .
