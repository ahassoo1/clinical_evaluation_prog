DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sachar. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, a social worker mentioned I should come in for… an assessment, she said? Something about seeing if I qualify for help at home. I'm Calin Sachar, by the way. It's nice to meet you.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sachar. The social worker likely referred you regarding potential assistance with activities of daily living. An assessment will help us determine what, if any, services might be beneficial. Just to confirm – and the chart doesn't seem to have much detail – you're 28 years old, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Twenty-eight. And… activities of daily living? What does that exactly mean, Doctor? I'm sorry, I don’t really know much about these things.
DOCTOR: It refers to things like bathing, dressing, cooking – basic self-care and maintaining your household. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me what specifically is making you feel you might need assistance?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… it's hard to explain. I work pressing clothes, you see? It's physical work, and lately I've been… very tired. And my hands ache a lot, even when I'm not working. It makes it difficult to do things around the house, like cooking proper meals, or even getting dressed sometimes. It’s not that I can't do them, just… it takes a long time and it’s exhausting. And I'm divorced, so it’s just me now, you know? No one to help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue and hand pain… and this started recently?
PATIENT: Not recently recently, no. It’s been building up for… maybe six months, I’d say? At first, I thought it was just from working too hard, but it's not getting better. If anything, it's worse. I tried resting, but that doesn’t seem to help much either. It's just… constant now.
DOCTOR: And you mentioned divorce. How long ago did that occur?
PATIENT: About a year and a half ago, Doctor. It wasn't… amicable, so I've been on my own since then. Trying to manage everything, working and taking care of myself, and it's… a lot. It's mostly just me, you know? I don't have family nearby, and my friends… they're busy with their own lives.
DOCTOR: Okay. And apart from the fatigue and hand pain, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my joints feel stiff, especially in the mornings. And… well, I’ve been feeling a bit down lately, to be honest. I just don't have the energy to do the things I used to enjoy. Not sure if that’s just from being tired all the time, though. Is that something you need to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Ms. Sachar. Joint stiffness and feeling “down” are important things to document. So, morning stiffness – how long does that typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, um… maybe half an hour, sometimes longer? It's worse on cold days. I have to… really work at getting moving, stretching things out. It feels like I’m eighty years old before I get going! It’s… embarrassing to admit, really. I’m only twenty-eight.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specifically made these symptoms worse?
PATIENT: Well, definitely the work. Standing for long periods, repeating the same motions… it just feels terrible. And… I’ve noticed it’s worse after a stressful day, if that makes sense. Worrying about bills, things like that. Does that count? I’m not sure what’s relevant, Doctor. I’m not a doctor, you know?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sachar, stress is relevant. Now, let’s go through a quick physical exam. I want to check your range of motion and assess the tenderness in your joints. Then we can discuss some potential blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on. It’s just… worrying, you know? I need to work. I have to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please lie down on the table, starting with your right hand. Let's see your range of motion, and I’ll gently palpate your joints. I'll start with your wrist. Does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, a little, actually. Right there… on the thumb side. It's not sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. And if you bend it… yeah, that hurts a bit too. Sorry, Doctor. I didn't mean to complain.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Sachar. I need to know. And how about these joints?
PATIENT: Okay, the middle finger… yeah, that’s tender. Not as bad as the thumb side, but definitely a little uncomfortable. The others… not so much, I think. It's mostly those two spots. It feels… stiff when I make a fist, too. Like it's going to crack. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Stiffness and tenderness in the wrist, particularly the thumb and middle finger… And now the left hand… Does this feel the same?
PATIENT: Yes, it does, actually. It’s not quite as bad as the right hand, but the same spots, definitely. The thumb side, and the middle finger. It’s just… everything feels achy, you know? It’s hard to describe. It’s not one specific pain, it’s just… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s quickly check your ankles and feet. Any pain or stiffness there?
PATIENT: Well… my ankles feel a little stiff in the mornings, like I said. Not terrible, just… not as flexible as they used to be. And if I squeeze here, on the outside of my foot… yes, that’s a little tender. It’s not constant pain, just when you press on it. Is that what you were looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, we have tenderness and limited range of motion in both wrists, ankles, and some stiffness in your feet. I’m going to order some blood tests. We need to rule out rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory conditions. Also, a complete blood count to check for any underlying infection or anemia. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye or any other medications?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I don’t think so. I haven’t had a lot of medical things done, to be honest. Just the usual checkups. I'm not allergic to any medications I know of, and I’ve never had any dye injections. I don’t think. I did have a bad reaction to a mosquito bite once, but that's it. Does that count? I’m sorry, I'm not very helpful.
DOCTOR: A mosquito bite is not relevant, Ms. Sachar. Alright, no known allergies. I will also have a urinalysis performed. The lab results should be back in a few days. I will call you with the results, and we can discuss treatment options at that time. In the meantime, I recommend taking ibuprofen or naproxen as needed for the pain and inflammation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Ibuprofen or naproxen for the pain. And wait for you to call with the results. That sounds… okay. Will that be all for today, Doctor? I do have to get back to work, unfortunately. It’s hard to take time off.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sachar, that will be all for today. I’ve sent the lab orders to the front desk. They will provide you with the necessary paperwork. If your symptoms worsen significantly – such as high fever, severe swelling, or inability to move your joints – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I hope we can figure out what's going on soon. And thank you for not laughing at me when I talked about the mosquito bite. I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: Very well. I expect you to contact me immediately if your condition deteriorates. Good day, Ms. Sachar.
PATIENT: .
