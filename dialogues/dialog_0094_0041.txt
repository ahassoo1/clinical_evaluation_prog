DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Gegan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s been getting worse, slowly. It’s in my legs mostly, but I feel it sometimes in my arms too. The doctor back home, he said it was something with… with the nerves, I think? Multiple… something? It’s hard to remember the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness in your legs and sometimes your arms, and it’s been gradually worsening. And you mentioned a possible nerve issue… multiple something?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Multiple… sclerosis, I believe the doctor said. It's been a few years now since he told me. It started with just a little trouble walking, like my feet were heavy. Now… well, now I need a cane some days. It’s not all the time, but more and more often.
DOCTOR: Multiple sclerosis, alright. And it’s been progressing over a few years, starting with some heaviness in your feet and now requiring a cane at times. That gives me a good starting point. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about when you notice the weakness the most?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It seems worse when I’ve been on my feet a lot. Like if I’m helping my wife in the garden, or after a walk with the grandkids. It’s not so bad when I’m resting, or sitting. But… it's hard to say exactly. It’s just… there. Most of the time.
DOCTOR: So, it's exacerbated by activity and improves with rest. That’s helpful. And you say it’s “just there” most of the time - is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. Not like a sudden thing, but… some days are better than others. Some days I feel almost normal, and I can walk around with hardly any trouble. Other days… it feels like I’m walking through mud. It’s not a sharp pain, just… tired. Very, very tired feeling in my legs.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluctuating weakness, better on some days than others, described as a tired feeling in your legs. That’s consistent with the possibility of multiple sclerosis. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, my vision gets blurry sometimes. Not all the time, but… when I’m tired, it’s worse. And… sometimes my hands tremble a little. Not a big shake, but… you notice it when I’m trying to write, or hold something steady. Oh! And I get… warm. Very warm, even when it’s not hot outside. My wife says my face gets flushed. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Astores. Blurry vision, especially with fatigue, tremors in your hands, and feeling warm with facial flushing. All of these can be associated with multiple sclerosis. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I have a little bit of… the pressure. The doctor said it was high blood pressure. I take a pill for that, every day. And… my knees, they bother me sometimes. Old sports injury, from when I was younger. But… that's about it, I think. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension, managed with medication, and some knee pain from a previous injury. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes. I had my appendix out when I was a young man. And… I had a small operation on my knee, a long time ago. Just to clean up some cartilage, the doctor said. Nothing major, and it was many years ago. I don’t even remember the year.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother, she had… something with her hands. They shook, a lot. The doctor said it was… essential tremor, I think. It wasn’t like my shaking, though. Hers was more… constant. And… my brother, he had trouble walking when he got older, but I don’t know what it was. He lived far away, and we didn’t talk much. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Essential tremor in your mother and difficulty walking in your brother. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well, I’m married, been married to my wife, Leilani, for… oh, goodness, almost sixty years now! We have three grown children, and five grandkids. I used to work as an athletic trainer, mostly with high school sports teams. I retired a few years ago. I enjoy gardening, spending time with my family, and… going to church. That's about it, I think. A simple life.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mr. Astores. And do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife, she doesn’t like it. And I always thought it was a bad habit.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: A little wine with dinner sometimes. Just a glass, or maybe two. Nothing more. It helps me relax. My wife and I, we enjoy it with our meal.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take my blood pressure medicine every day, and that's been fine. No allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astores. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. Now, I’d like to conduct a physical examination. I’ll start by checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll assess your neurological function - your strength, reflexes, coordination, and balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs, and your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let’s assess your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that good? It feels a little weak, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, strength is 4/5 in both hands, which is slightly reduced. Now, let’s test your legs. Can you push your foot against my hand like this?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… difficult. It feels weaker in this leg… the left one, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, your strength is 4/5 in your right leg and 3+/5 in your left leg. That does show some weakness on your left side. And I observed some slight difficulty with your gait - a little bit of shuffling and decreased arm swing on the left. Finally, I’m going to check your coordination. Can you touch your finger to my finger, and then touch your nose?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s a little shaky… not very steady.
DOCTOR: Okay, there’s some mild ataxia and tremor with finger-to-nose testing. Mr. Astores, based on your history and this physical exam, the findings are highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis. Your symptoms—weakness, blurry vision, tremors, fatigue—along with the neurological findings I observed—reduced strength, ataxia, and asymmetry—all support this diagnosis. However, to confirm this, I’d like to order an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. This will allow us to visualize any lesions or areas of inflammation that are characteristic of MS. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. Let’s do it. It’s good to know what we’re dealing with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astores. I’ll get the orders for the MRI sent to the radiology department. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. While we wait for the MRI results, I recommend continuing to manage your blood pressure with your current medication, and focusing on maintaining your strength and balance through gentle exercise, as tolerated. We can also discuss physical therapy if you’re interested. We’ll also want to monitor your symptoms closely. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. Just… what does this mean? What will happen now? Will I… end up in a wheelchair?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid and important questions, Mr. Astores. It’s natural to be concerned about the future. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, progressive disease, but the course of the illness varies significantly from person to person. There’s a wide range of possible outcomes. Some people experience mild symptoms with minimal disability, while others experience more significant challenges. The MRI will help us determine the extent and location of the lesions, which will give us a better understanding of your specific case and allow us to tailor a treatment plan to your needs. Treatment options for MS include disease-modifying therapies, which can help slow the progression of the illness and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. We’ll discuss those options in detail once we have the MRI results. We’ll also focus on managing your symptoms with medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. As for your concern about a wheelchair, it’s impossible to predict the future with certainty. Many people with MS live full and active lives without ever needing a wheelchair. We’ll do everything we can to help you maintain your independence and quality of life for as long as possible. We’ll work together as a team, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other concerns that I can address right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve… put my mind at ease, a little bit. It’s still scary, but… knowing what we’re dealing with, and knowing that you’ll be there to help… that makes a big difference. I guess I’ll just wait for the call about the MRI now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astores. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen while you're waiting for the MRI results. We'll get through this together. I'll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us once the results are available. In the meantime, please take care of yourself, and continue to focus on maintaining your strength and balance. Have a good day, Mr. Astores.
PATIENT: .
