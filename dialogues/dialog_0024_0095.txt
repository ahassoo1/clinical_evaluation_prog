DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s rather obvious, isn’t it? I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels… droopy. It’s quite alarming, really. I don’t understand why we need to spend so long on introductions when the problem is staring you in the face.
DOCTOR: “Obvious” is a subjective term, Ms. Nissenbaum. While your symptoms are… noticeable, a proper medical assessment requires a systematic approach. We need to determine why this has occurred. Now, tell me, when exactly did you first notice this hearing loss and facial weakness?
PATIENT: This morning. I just… woke up with it. Honestly, I don’t keep detailed logs of when my body decides to malfunction. Is that what you expect? It was… around 7 am, I suppose. I had my usual tea, then realized I couldn’t hear the news properly on the radio. Then I looked in the mirror… and well, you see it yourself. It's not exactly subtle.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you experienced any other symptoms since then?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No dizziness, thankfully. And no headache. Taste is normal, I believe. Oh, and my vision seems alright. Really, it’s just the ear and the face. I haven't been feeling unwell otherwise. Is this taking long? I have appointments.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Ms. Nissenbaum. I assure you, I am efficient. Now, have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’m very careful about avoiding germs. I haven’t been sick in… well, I can’t remember the last time, frankly. I maintain a healthy lifestyle. This isn't some common cold, Doctor. This feels…serious. And honestly, I'd appreciate it if you'd stop acting as though I'm being deliberately difficult.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on. Any family history of hearing loss, neurological issues, or facial paralysis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… My mother had high blood pressure, if that’s relevant. And my uncle, on my father's side, had something… a stroke, I believe, years ago. But that's about it. We weren’t a particularly chatty family about ailments, if you understand. It wasn’t considered polite. Are we going to get to why this is happening to me anytime soon? I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll get there. Now, I’m going to need to perform a brief neurological examination. It will involve some simple tests – following my finger, checking your reflexes. Please cooperate. It’s necessary. And I assure you, it will be relatively quick.
PATIENT: Tests? Really? I suppose I have no choice. Just… try to be efficient about it, please. I don’t enjoy having strangers poking around. And don’t expect me to have a detailed understanding of what you’re doing. Just… tell me what you need me to do. Preferably in simple terms.
DOCTOR: Very well. First, I will examine your ears. This may be slightly uncomfortable. Please remain still. There’s some mild cerumen buildup in both ears, but nothing significant. Now, I’m going to use this tuning fork to assess your hearing. I will tap it, then place the base against your forehead. Tell me when you can no longer hear the sound.
PATIENT: Really? Is that necessary? It's vibrating terribly. Yes, I… I can’t hear it anymore. It stopped… a moment ago, I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, you seem to be enjoying inflicting minor discomfort. Is this standard practice? And is it getting us any closer to a diagnosis? This feels awfully… inconclusive.
DOCTOR: It’s a necessary part of the evaluation, Ms. Nissenbaum. Now, I’m going to ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and close your eyes tightly. This is to assess facial muscle strength. There’s noticeable weakness on the left side of your face. And… Stick your tongue out, please.
PATIENT: Honestly! This is quite undignified. And what exactly are you looking for? It feels like I’m being subjected to a… a schoolyard game. It's slightly crooked, if you must know. More so on the left side, naturally. I trust you’ve gathered enough information by now to form some sort of opinion? This is rather disruptive to my schedule.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, based on your symptoms – the sudden onset of unilateral hearing loss, facial weakness, and the observed deviation of your tongue – I suspect you are experiencing Bell’s Palsy. However, given the possibility of other, more serious causes – stroke, tumor – further investigation is required. I would like to order an MRI to rule out any underlying structural abnormalities. I will also prescribe a short course of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.
PATIENT: Bell’s Palsy? Is that… serious? And an MRI? That sounds… unpleasant. Corticosteroids? I’ve heard those have side effects. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather alarming. Is this something I need to worry about? And how long will this MRI take? I have a luncheon appointment tomorrow, and I certainly don’t want to miss that. This is all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, Bell’s Palsy itself isn’t life-threatening, but it can cause significant discomfort and, in some cases, permanent facial weakness. The MRI is necessary to exclude more serious causes – we must rule out a stroke or tumor before proceeding with treatment. It’s a standard procedure. The MRI will take approximately 30-45 minutes. As for the corticosteroids, they can have side effects, but the benefits in your case – reducing inflammation and potentially restoring facial function – outweigh the risks. I strongly advise you to schedule the MRI as soon as possible. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist for a follow-up consultation. Do you have any further questions, or shall we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Honestly, this is snowballing. Very well. I suppose I have no choice. Thirty to forty-five minutes, you say? And the MRI facility… is it conveniently located? I don't drive, you see. And what about this luncheon tomorrow? Will this… condition be noticeable? I simply must maintain appearances. Really, Doctor, this is a complete disruption. I trust you've done everything possible to minimize the inconvenience? I suppose that will be all. .
