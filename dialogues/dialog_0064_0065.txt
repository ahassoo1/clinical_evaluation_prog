DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it simply, I’ve gained a… significant amount of weight, rather suddenly, and I haven’t changed anything about my diet or exercise. It’s quite troubling, really. I was hoping you could help me understand what might be going on.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. A significant weight gain with no changes to your diet or exercise… that is something we should look into. When you say “suddenly,” could you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me think… it started, I believe, around the beginning of March. Perhaps mid-March. And it hasn’t stopped. I weigh… well, I weighed myself just this morning, and it's considerably more than last time I checked. I don't recall the exact number from March, unfortunately, but it was a normal weight for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly five months of gradual weight gain. And you said it’s a considerable difference from what you’d normally weigh. Do you have any idea how much weight we’re talking about, even a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Around… fifteen kilograms, perhaps more. It’s difficult to be precise, I don’t weigh myself often. But it’s enough that my clothes don’t fit anymore, and I find myself becoming easily breathless. It’s concerning, naturally. And my husband has noticed, of course. He encouraged me to come in.
DOCTOR: Fifteen kilograms… that's a substantial amount over five months. And the breathlessness is something we need to pay attention to. Now, beyond the weight gain and the breathlessness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… … I've been feeling rather fatigued lately. More tired than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. And my skin… it seems a little drier, and I've had a few instances of feeling quite cold, even when it’s warm. Nothing dramatic, but noticeable. Oh, and I've been thirstier than usual, I suppose. I drink more water now, and still feel parched.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, dry skin, feeling cold, increased thirst... those are all things we should consider. Let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing significant. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, chickenpox – but nothing major. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, no serious injuries. I’ve always been quite healthy, really. This weight gain is entirely unexpected. I've never been one to have problems with my weight before.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she had diabetes, type 2, later in life. And my father had high blood pressure. That's about it, as far as I know. My siblings are both healthy, as far as I am aware, but we don't discuss our health in detail. It’s not really our custom.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes and hypertension… noted. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle a little bit. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve always been very careful about my health. And my husband doesn't smoke either. We both enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. We try to eat a balanced diet - mostly traditional Lithuanian fare, you know - potatoes, vegetables, some meat. Nothing overly processed.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, limited alcohol. Now, I'm going to ask about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not. I rarely get sick enough to require medication. I might take a pain reliever for a headache occasionally, but nothing regularly. I prefer to rest and drink plenty of fluids, usually. Actually... there was a herbal tea I tried a few months ago, for calming. But I stopped taking it after a week, it didn’t seem to do much. It was from a local shop. I don't recall the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, a brief trial of an herbal tea, and nothing else. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s just cover allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have no known allergies. None at all. I’ve always been able to eat and take whatever is offered without any issues. It’s another reason why this weight gain is so puzzling. It's as if my body is… malfunctioning.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. That’s helpful. Okay, Reneisha, I think it’s time to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your thyroid gland, and also check your skin for any changes. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Do you mind if I have you lie down on the table?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed. And no, I don’t mind lying down at all. I trust your judgement entirely. Please let me know if you require any further information from me during the examination.
DOCTOR: Alright, Reneisha. Your heartbeat is a little faster than I’d like, and your blood pressure is a bit elevated. Your thyroid feels a little enlarged, and your skin is dry. It’s nothing immediately alarming, but it does give us a few things to investigate further. Now, I'm going to order some blood tests. I want to check your thyroid hormone levels, your blood sugar, and a complete metabolic panel. This will give us a better idea of what’s going on internally. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Blood tests seem… thorough. Yes, please, go ahead. I would be grateful for any information you can gather. The sooner we can understand this, the better. I confess, I’m feeling rather anxious about it all.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your anxiety. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. I’m also going to order a urine sample to rule out any kidney issues. The lab is just down the hall; the nurse will provide you with the necessary containers and instructions. While we’re waiting for the results, I want to emphasize that these tests are just to gather information. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something seriously wrong. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while you wait?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… reassuring. Knowing that it’s just information gathering helps. No, I don’t believe so. Perhaps a glass of water would be appreciated? I seem to be constantly thirsty, as I mentioned. And if you could perhaps explain the procedure for the urine sample, just to be certain I understand correctly, that would be very kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The nurse will give you a cup, and you just need to collect a sample of your urine – about two ounces should be sufficient. Try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream. This gives us a cleaner result. There’s a restroom just down the hall, and I’ll ask the nurse to point you in the right direction. And yes, let me get you a glass of water right away. Nurse, could you please bring a glass of water to the examination room, and also provide Reneisha with the containers and instructions for a urine sample?
PATIENT: Thank you very much, Doctor. That is very thoughtful of you. I appreciate your kindness and your thoroughness. It’s a relief to know someone is taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Reneisha. That’s what I’m here for. It’s important to me that you feel heard and taken care of. Now, while we're waiting for the nurse, let me just ask one more question. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: … Yes, actually. I have been… rather constipated, lately. It’s not severe, but definitely more infrequent and… more difficult than usual. It started around the same time as the weight gain, I believe. I hadn’t thought to mention it, as it seemed a minor issue compared to everything else. Is that… significant?
DOCTOR: Yes, Reneisha, that is significant. Changes in bowel habits, along with the weight gain, fatigue, constipation, and increased thirst, certainly strengthen our suspicion. It’s starting to paint a more complete picture. We’ll have a much clearer idea once the lab results come back. The nurse should be with us shortly to collect the samples. In the meantime, try to relax and conserve your energy. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. I’m… apprehensive, naturally, but I trust your expertise. I will simply try to be patient and await the results. Thank you for your kindness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Reneisha. I understand your apprehension, and I appreciate your trust. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Ah, here's the nurse now. Nurse, could you please assist Reneisha with collecting the urine and blood samples?
PATIENT: .
