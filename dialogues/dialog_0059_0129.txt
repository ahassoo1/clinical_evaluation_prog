DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Don't bother with the "lovely" part, honestly. I haven't got all day. It's my stool, alright? It's… dark. Black. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking 'em for years. That's what I'm here for, if you must know. Now, are we going to figure this out or what?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Dawnetta. I understand you're concerned about the change in your stool color – specifically that it’s become dark and black – and you’re taking pain medication for your arthritis. We will absolutely figure this out. Black stool can have several causes, and it’s good you brought it to my attention. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the stool a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, “describe it more”? Honestly. It's black. Like… tar, almost. Not normal, obviously. And it's… well, it's solid, mostly. Sometimes a little… mushy, if I've eaten something that doesn't agree with me. But mostly solid and black. Is that enough detail for you? I don't usually spend this much time thinking about my… output, you know. It's embarrassing even talking about it. Now, is that the pills causing this? That's what I want to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dawnetta, that is helpful, thank you. I understand it's not a comfortable topic, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. It is important information. You’re right to ask about the pain pills. Some medications, including certain pain relievers, can cause dark stools. However, dark stools can also be a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract, so we need to investigate further to be certain. To get a better understanding of the situation, could you tell me what kind of pain pills you’re taking – the name of the medication, if you know it, and the dosage?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you're asking for the name? Honestly, my husband, Bohuslav, he handles all that. I just take the little white pills, two of them, twice a day. He gets them from the pharmacy, refills every month. I think... Naproxen? Is that right? He said something about Naproxen. Two pills, twice a day. That's all I know, honestly. Don't expect me to be a pharmacist, I'm a mechanic, not a doctor. And I don't see why what I take matters so much. It's the black stool, isn't it? Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Naproxen is very helpful information, thank you. And you are absolutely right to focus on the black stool. It is the most important thing right now. Knowing the medication just helps me understand the potential causes. To help me get a complete picture, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? Honestly, I don't spend all day scrutinizing everything that goes down the toilet. But… I suppose it's been a little… thinner, maybe? Not a huge difference, but not as… substantial as usual. And sometimes… sometimes there's a little bit of… well, I don't know how to say this… a little bit of red mixed in. Not a lot, mind you. Just a tiny bit. Does that matter? This is all very unpleasant, you know. I’d rather be fixing a truck.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dawnetta, that does matter, thank you for telling me. Both the thinner stool and the presence of red mixed in are important details. It’s good you’re sharing this, even though it’s unpleasant. To clarify, when you say "red," is it bright red, like fresh blood, or darker, almost black?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Bright red, I think. Not black, definitely not. More like… well, like a little bit of raspberry jam, maybe? Just a little streak on the surface, sometimes. Not every time, mind you. And it's not a lot. I'm not bleeding buckets, if that's what you're thinking. Honestly, I just want to know if these pain pills are doing something bad to my stomach. Is that too much to ask? And can we please hurry this along? Bohuslav is waiting for me.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Dawnetta. And we will figure this out. Bright red blood is different from the black stool and is also important information. Given the changes you've described – the black stool, the thinner consistency, and the occasional bright red blood – it's important we investigate further to determine the cause. There are several possibilities, including side effects from the Naproxen, but we need to rule out other potential issues. I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, including listening to your abdomen and checking for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful. More poking and prodding. Honestly. Fine, go ahead. But don't take all day. And please be gentle. I’ve got a bad back, you know. From years of working on those blasted trucks. Just get it over with. Bohuslav is going to be furious if I’m much longer. He made a special roast.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Dawnetta. I will be as gentle as possible. I understand you have a bad back, and I will take that into consideration. First, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope to check for any unusual sounds. Sounds are normal, no bruits or abnormal bowel noises detected. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. I’m noting some slight tenderness in the lower left quadrant, but no significant masses felt. Did that cause you any significant discomfort?
PATIENT: Ugh. A little bit, yes. Just in that… lower left part. It's always a bit tender there, honestly. Probably from twisting and turning under those trucks all these years. It's not new pain, if that makes a difference. Just… a bit more noticeable today, maybe. Honestly, I’ve got a higher pain tolerance than most people, I assure you. Just poking around won't find much. Are we done yet? This is ridiculous. I need to go.
DOCTOR: I understand, Dawnetta. The tenderness you’ve experienced for some time is helpful information. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, I recommend we order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of anemia, a stool test to look for blood and infection, and a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy is the most important test, as it allows us to directly visualize the entire colon and identify any potential sources of bleeding or abnormalities. I understand it’s not the most pleasant procedure, but it’s the best way to rule out any serious issues. Would you be comfortable scheduling a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: A… what-oscopy? Honestly. You're asking me to let you look inside my… you know. Absolutely not. No. No, no, no. I’ve heard stories. Bohuslav’s cousin had one, and it was… awful. No, I will not do that. I'm not putting a camera anywhere near there. I'll just stop taking the pills, alright? Maybe that'll fix it. I'm a mechanic, not a science experiment. No colonoscopy. Is there anything else you can do? And can we please hurry this up? Bohuslav is going to kill me. I swear.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Dawnetta. A colonoscopy can be concerning, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel apprehensive. I want to assure you that we would take every precaution to make you comfortable, and we can discuss sedation options. However, given your symptoms, and without a clear understanding of the cause of the bleeding, it's difficult to proceed safely. Stopping the Naproxen might help, but it doesn't address the underlying issue. Given your strong reluctance to undergo a colonoscopy at this time, I would recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist. They can further discuss your concerns and explore alternative diagnostic options, such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. Would you be comfortable with a referral to a specialist?
PATIENT: A specialist, huh? More doctors. Honestly. Fine. A specialist. As long as they don't want to stick anything… up there. Bohuslav will be thrilled. Another appointment. Another waiting room. Just… get me the referral, alright? And can we please be done now? I’m starting to feel faint. This whole thing has been terribly upsetting. Just the paper, alright? And quickly. My roast is getting cold.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Dawnetta. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I will prepare a referral to Dr. Eva Novotná, a highly respected gastroenterologist in the area. She's known for her compassionate care and thorough evaluations. Here is the referral form, along with Dr. Novotná’s contact information. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or significant bleeding – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I wish you all the best, Dawnetta. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. And I do hope your roast is still warm.
