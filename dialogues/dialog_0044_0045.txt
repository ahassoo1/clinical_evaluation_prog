DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, I've been getting...flushing. You know, my face gets very red. It started maybe a week ago, I think. Not every day, but enough that I noticed. It’s a little…worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing – redness of the face that comes and goes. Started about a week ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a week. Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to say exactly. It doesn't hurt, doesn't itch, just…red. Like when you’re very warm, but I'm not usually warm when it happens. Sometimes after I eat, but not always the same food. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Withycombe. It's helpful information. Flushing that isn’t linked to temperature or exertion can have a few different causes. You mentioned it sometimes happens after eating... can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, last Tuesday I had some spicy chicken, and it happened then. But then yesterday, I just had toast and it happened too. So it’s not just spicy food, I don't think. And it doesn't happen every time I eat, even the same foods. It's very strange. I'm sorry, I'm probably not being very clear. I just…feel a little confused by it.
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly clear, Mr. Withycombe. It is confusing when things don’t follow a predictable pattern. The fact that it happens with different foods, and not every time, is definitely something to explore. Besides happening after eating, have you noticed anything else that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I haven't been doing anything different. I walk a little in the park most days, but I’ve been doing that for years. I haven’t been stressed or anything… well, not more stressed than usual. My wife… she passed away last year. That’s still… hard, of course. But this flushing feels… separate from that, if that makes sense. It’s a physical thing, not… a sad thing, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Withycombe. Grief can manifest in many ways, and it's entirely possible this is a separate issue. It’s good you’re able to distinguish between the two. And thank you for sharing that with me. Let’s talk a little more broadly now. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the flushing?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No, not really. No fever, no headache, no dizziness. I haven't felt sick, just…red. Sometimes my heart feels a little fast when it happens, but I don't know if it’s the flushing or just me being a little worried. And… maybe a little tired, but I’m always a little tired, to be honest. I haven't been sleeping very well since… you know. But I don’t think the flushing is causing that. It just…happens. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Withycombe. The occasional fast heartbeat alongside the flushing is good to know. It’s important to rule out anything cardiac, just to be safe. Let’s move on to your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but the doctor said it was fine after I started taking a little pill. I stopped taking it a long time ago, and he said I didn’t need it anymore. And… I had a little trouble with my back once, but that’s all. Nothing serious. I haven't been to a doctor much, if I'm honest. I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that’s now controlled is good to know. And back trouble is also helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications – even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no pills at all now. Just…tea. I drink a lot of tea. Black tea, usually. Sometimes ginger tea when my stomach feels bad. But that's it. No vitamins, no supplements. My wife used to tell me to take vitamins, but I never really did. Sorry. I'm not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Withycombe. Tea is fine. And don't apologize; you're doing great. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife was allergic to shellfish, but I'm not. I can eat anything, as far as I know. I don't go out to eat much though. I mostly cook for myself. It’s easier that way. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies is helpful. And no, whether you eat out or cook at home doesn’t directly impact this, but it’s helpful information overall. Now, I'd like to ask a bit about your family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, or children—who have experienced similar symptoms like flushing, or any other medical conditions like heart problems, high blood pressure, or skin disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my mother had high blood pressure, like me. She took pills for it her whole life, I think. And my father… he had a weak heart when he was older. He mostly stayed in bed towards the end. As for flushing… no, not that I know of. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. She lives in India and we don't talk very often. And I never had children. Sorry, I'm not very good at family history. It's been a long time since I thought about it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Withycombe. Knowing about your mother's high blood pressure and your father’s heart condition is helpful. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I don't mind. I’m ready when you are. Just…try to be quick, if you can. I get a little nervous around doctors.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular now, but I will listen again when you’re experiencing the flushing, if possible. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130/80 – a little elevated, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to take a look at your skin. I notice some mild redness, particularly on your cheeks and nose, but no rash or other abnormalities. And your pulse is 72 and regular. I'm going to check your reflexes as well. Reflexes are normal. Overall, everything seems within normal limits at this moment. However, it would be very helpful to see what happens during an episode of flushing. Do you have any idea what might trigger an episode?
PATIENT: That’s…good to hear, I think. It’s just…frustrating, you know? Not knowing what’s causing it. As for triggers… not really. Sometimes it just happens. I haven't noticed anything specific. Maybe… maybe if I get a little upset? Like, if someone is rude to me. But I try not to get upset, so it’s hard to say. And it doesn’t happen every time. Honestly, Doctor, it just…feels random. I’m sorry I can't be more helpful. I just… wish it would stop.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Withycombe. It’s good you’re able to articulate what you’re experiencing, even if it feels random. The fact that it might be linked to emotional upset is worth exploring. Given what you’ve told me—the flushing without other symptoms, the occasional fast heartbeat, and the possible link to emotional upset—I suspect we could be dealing with something called rosacea or possibly a vasomotor condition. However, it's too early to say definitively. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help rule out any underlying medical conditions and give us more information. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… okay. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like needles, but…if it will help, then yes. That’s alright. What kind of tests are they? And will they take a long time? I have an appointment with the handyman on Thursday…I don't want to miss that. He’s fixing my porch. It’s been falling apart for months.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Mr. Withycombe. We’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. The tests I’m ordering are a complete blood count , a basic metabolic panel , and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. The CBC will check your overall blood health, the BMP will assess your kidney and electrolyte levels, and the TSH will rule out any thyroid issues. They’re fairly standard tests. They shouldn’t take a long time at all – just a few minutes for the blood draw. The results usually come back within 3-5 business days. So you should have them well before your appointment with the handyman on Thursday. Here’s the lab order. You can take this to the lab across the street. They’re open until 5 PM today. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, good. 3-5 days is fine. Across the street… I can manage that. A CBC, BMP, and TSH… I’ll try to remember that. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening to me, and for trying to figure out what’s going on. I really appreciate it. It's just… nice to talk to someone who doesn't tell me to just calm down. My sister always says that. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I'm glad I could help, and you are right – sometimes just being heard is a good start. And your sister probably means well! Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. I’ll also give you a call once they're in to discuss the next steps. For now, try to keep a log of your flushing episodes—when they happen, what you were doing, and any potential triggers you notice. It will be helpful information when we talk again. Have a good day, Mr. Withycombe, and I hope your handyman gets your porch fixed quickly!
