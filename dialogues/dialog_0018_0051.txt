DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Lovely clinic you have here. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me see... It’s about my blood, I think. My… grandson, yes, my grandson, he said I should find out what type it is. Something about… emergencies. Old age, you know. Things slip my mind. I just want to be prepared, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Nini. Knowing your blood type is a very sensible precaution, especially as we get older. It is helpful information to have on hand for emergencies. Let me just access your chart here… Alright, I see you've been a patient with us for some time. To clarify, your grandson suggested this specifically because he’s concerned about needing a blood transfusion someday?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s right. A transfusion. That sounds… serious. He’s a very thoughtful boy, my grandson, always looking out for me. He said it was good to know, just in case. He’s studying to be… a something important, I forget exactly what, but very clever. He said something about matching, that’s it! Matching blood. Is that right, dear? I get so muddled these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Knowing your blood type allows for proper “matching” in the event of a transfusion, to ensure compatibility. It's a very practical thing to have checked. Before we proceed with ordering a blood type test, I’d like to ask a few general questions, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. Ask away. I'll do my best to remember… though don’t mind me if I wander a bit! It’s not the sharpest mind these days, you know. But I'll try. What sort of questions?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mrs. Nini. We'll take things at your pace. No need to worry about wandering. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… let me see. I used to have… terrible headaches, years ago. The doctor gave me some pills, and they went away. And my hips, yes! I had my hips replaced, a long time ago. Both of them, one after the other. That was… painful, but much better now. Apart from that… I can’t rightly recall anything major, dear. I had the usual colds and flus, of course, but nothing serious. Oh! And I broke my wrist once, falling in the garden. But that healed up fine. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. So, we have a history of headaches, both hips replaced, and a past wrist fracture. Did you have any complications from any of those procedures or injuries?
PATIENT: Complications… The hips… no, I don’t think so. It was painful afterwards, recovering, of course, but the doctor said that was normal. They were good doctors, I remember. The wrist… maybe a little bit of stiffness, but nothing lasting. The headaches… well, I just took the pills and they went away, so I can’t say I had any problems with those. Honestly, dear, I was always a bit of a worrier, so I probably imagined more complications than there actually were! Is it important if I can’t remember exactly?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright if you can’t recall precise details, Mrs. Nini. We are simply gathering information to get a full picture of your health. It's more important to understand the overall course of things. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I have these pills for my… for my waterworks, you know. They help me sleep at night, my grandson says I shouldn’t take so many but… I do. And sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re acting up. But that’s just when they bother me, you see. And I take a vitamin D tablet, the doctor told me to. Something about the sun… or lack of it. I forget. That’s all, I think. Just those few. Do you need to know what they’re called? I can probably find the boxes… somewhere.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you could, that would be very helpful, Mrs. Nini. Knowing the names of the medications allows me to check for any potential interactions. No rush, take your time. While you're looking, let me ask: do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see… I think I was allergic to penicillin when I was younger, but that was so long ago. My mother always said I had sensitive skin, but it wasn’t a proper allergy, just a bit of a rash sometimes. Food… no, I don’t think so. I eat most things, though I don’t have much of an appetite these days. My grandson makes me lovely soups, though. He’s a good cook. I can't recall any serious allergies, dear. Just sensitive skin, perhaps. Wait! Bees! I was stung by a bee once, as a little girl, and I swelled up terribly. But I haven’t been stung in years, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of penicillin sensitivity, sensitive skin, and a bee sting reaction. That's good to know. Thank you. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… That's a difficult one, dear. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She died when I was quite young, so I don't remember much. My father was a strong man, a fisherman, and he lived to a good age, but I don't recall any specific illnesses. My brother… he had problems with his… his memory, towards the end. It was very sad. And my sister… she had cancer, many years ago. It was a very aggressive type, they said. Apart from that… I don't really know. We weren't a family who talked much about illnesses, you see. It was considered… impolite, perhaps. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have a general idea, Mrs. Nini, even if the information is limited. It can sometimes provide clues about your own risk factors. Don't worry if you don’t have a lot of details. Now, one last question for now. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, these days it’s not very exciting, dear. I live quietly, in my little cottage. I enjoy gardening when the weather is nice, but I can’t do as much as I used to. I like to read, mostly detective stories, and I enjoy a cup of tea in the afternoon. I don’t go out much anymore, but my grandson visits regularly, and that brightens my days. I used to travel a lot with my husband, years ago, but that was a long time ago. We went to Spain, mostly, because… well, because I’m Spanish, you see! I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with my dinner occasionally. Is that helpful? A quiet life, mostly.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mrs. Nini. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a much clearer picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, dear. Whatever you think best. A physical exam… I haven't had one of those in a while! I hope I'm not too… rickety! Just let me know what you need me to do. And don't mind me if I ask silly questions, my mind isn't what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mrs. Nini. I assure you, there are no silly questions. We’ll take things slowly and at your pace. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart rate is a little fast, but that could be due to anxiety, or just your natural rhythm. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the exam table if you haven’t already. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, finally, let’s take a look at your hands and feet. No swelling or deformities noted. Everything appears to be in good condition.
PATIENT: Oh dear, that was… a lot! I hope I didn’t wriggle too much. Old bones aren't as cooperative as they used to be, you know! Everything feels a bit… poked and prodded, but not in a bad way. You've been very gentle. I just hope you didn’t find anything… worrying! What did you find, dear? Is everything alright? I always worry, you see. It's just my nature. I'm sure you're used to that! Is the blood test still necessary, after all that?
DOCTOR: You were a perfect patient, Mrs. Nini, no wiggling at all. And yes, everything appears to be within normal limits for your age. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, as I mentioned, but that could be due to a number of factors. The diminished reflexes are also not a cause for concern. And yes, I still recommend getting a blood test, not because I'm worried about anything specific, but simply to establish a baseline and have a better understanding of your overall health. It will also confirm your blood type, as your grandson requested. It's a simple procedure, and it will give us valuable information. We can also check your vitamin D levels, since you’re taking a supplement. Shall we proceed with ordering the blood test?
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. If you think it’s best, dear. A baseline, you say? That sounds sensible. And checking the vitamin D… yes, that’s a good idea. I forget if I’m taking enough, you see! Very well. Order the blood test, please. And let me know if it involves much poking and prodding, you know. I don't mind a little discomfort, but I'm not as spry as I used to be. Do I need to do anything special beforehand? Fasting, perhaps? Or… avoiding anything? I always forget these things!
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your concern, Mrs. Nini. The blood test itself is quite quick, and involves only a small prick in the arm. The phlebotomist is very skilled. And, yes, you do need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, just water. We’ll schedule the test for tomorrow morning. Here’s the requisition form and a set of detailed instructions regarding the fasting requirement. The lab is just down the hall, and they are expecting you. Do you have any questions about the instructions?
PATIENT: Eight hours… Eight hours! Oh dear. That means no breakfast, or… tea? Even with sugar? That will be difficult. But if it’s important, I suppose I can manage. Let me see… no food, no tea, just water… is it alright if I have a tiny biscuit with my water? Just a little one? Or is that cheating? And what time should I go tomorrow? I don't want to arrive too early, or too late. Oh, this is all so complicated! I'm getting confused again. Perhaps my grandson should come with me, just to make sure I don't forget everything. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask, Mrs. Nini. No, even a tiny biscuit is considered cheating when fasting for a blood test, unfortunately. It can affect the results. And yes, your grandson is more than welcome to accompany you to the lab tomorrow; that’s a very good idea. The lab opens at 7:30 am. I recommend arriving no later than 8:00 am to allow plenty of time before they close. We’ve scheduled you for 8:15 am. I’ve made a note on your chart that your grandson will be accompanying you. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Eight fifteen, yes. That’s good. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very patient with my… forgetfulness. My grandson will be relieved to hear he can come with me. He always worries, you see. No, I think that’s all for today. Just the blood test, and a quiet evening. Perhaps I'll read a detective story… if I can remember what it’s about! Thank you again, Dr. Stilaire. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mrs. Nini. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And enjoy your detective story! Have a lovely evening.
