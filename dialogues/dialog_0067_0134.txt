DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Well, it’s… it’s been my stomach, mostly. It just hasn’t been right for a little while now. I get sick to it pretty easy, and I don't get hungry like I used to. I fill up with just a little bit of food, and it’s just…not good. It's been going on for…oh, goodness, I can't rightly say how long. A few weeks, maybe? Longer? It all blurs together these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks or longer with stomach upset, feeling full easily, and a decreased appetite. I understand. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. When you say “sick to it,” do you mean nausea, vomiting, or both?
PATIENT: Hmm… both, I think. Mostly the queasy feeling, like something’s just…off. But I have thrown up a couple of times, yes. Not a lot, but enough to be worrying me. It doesn't happen every time I feel sick, but it has happened. It’s just… unpleasant, you know? Makes me not want to eat anything, and then I get weak.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Nausea and occasional vomiting, leading to decreased appetite and weakness. Okay. And can you describe what the vomit looks like when you do throw up?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I don’t much like talking about this. It’s… well, it’s mostly just whatever I ate, I suppose. Sometimes it’s a little…yellowish. Not always, but sometimes. And it doesn’t smell very nice, if that makes any difference. I haven’t noticed anything… strange, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… food. Bad food, mostly. I try not to look at it. It makes me feel worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly undigested food with occasional yellowish tinge, and an unpleasant odor. That’s helpful. Now, besides the nausea, vomiting, and feeling full quickly, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I’ve been a bit tired lately. More tired than usual, even for an old woman like me. And… my stomach has been hurting, on and off. It’s not a sharp pain, just a dull ache, mostly in the middle. It comes and goes. Oh! And I haven't been going to the bathroom as regularly. That's been…different. Does that make sense? It's hard to remember all of it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Tiredness, a dull ache in the middle of your abdomen, and changes in your bowel habits. Thank you for sharing all of that. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was a long time ago. I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. And… I was told I had high blood pressure, but I take a pill for that, so it's under control, I think. The doctor always said it was good. And… well, I was diagnosed with cancer a few years back. It was… breast cancer. I had treatment, and they said it was all gone. But… sometimes I wonder. I don’t always remember what the doctors told me, you know. It all happened so fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've had your gallbladder removed, a history of high blood pressure managed with medication, and a past diagnosis of breast cancer that was treated successfully. Thank you for letting me know. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with the breast cancer, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. It was… after my husband passed. He died in… 2018, I think. So, sometime after that. Maybe 2019? Or 2020? It was during… the sickness, you know, when everyone was staying home. I had a lot of appointments then, but I don't remember the exact dates. It feels like a lifetime ago, and everything’s so jumbled up in my head. It was a lumpectomy, I think. And… radiation. Yes, radiation. That was… tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately 2019 or 2020 with a lumpectomy and radiation treatment for breast cancer. That's helpful. And have you had any other surgeries or hospitalizations that you can recall?
PATIENT: Not that I can remember, dear. My gallbladder, of course, and the breast surgery… but nothing else springs to mind. I broke my wrist once, a long time ago when I was a child, but that was so long ago it doesn’t really count, does it? I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Mostly just the usual old age aches and pains. Nothing serious. I don't think so, anyway. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a hard one. My mother… she had heart trouble, I think. And my sister… she had diabetes. But other than that… I don’t really know. My family wasn't one for talking about such things, you know. We kept to ourselves mostly. And a lot of my relatives… I didn’t see them much. We were scattered all over. So, it’s hard to say if there’s anything that runs in the family. I wish I knew more, but it’s just not something we talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your sister. That's good to know. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, dear! I wouldn’t dream of it. I never smoked a day in my life. And alcohol… well, I had a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, a long time ago with my husband. But I haven’t touched a drop in years. And drugs? Heavens no! I’m an old woman, not a…well, you know. I spend my time with my animals, tending to them. That’s my life. A simple life. A good life.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don’t smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs. And you spend your time caring for your animals. That's wonderful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of, dear. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take my blood pressure pill every day, and I’ve never had any trouble with it. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a child, but I haven't been stung in years. I've never had any food allergies either. I eat just about anything, though I don't have much appetite these days, as we've discussed. I suppose you could say I'm pretty lucky, all things considered. No allergies to speak of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're currently taking medication for your blood pressure. Now, can you tell me the name and dosage of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a tricky one. My granddaughter usually handles my pills for me. She fills the little boxes every week. I just take what she gives me. It's a little white pill, I think. And… I think it's 10 milligrams? Or maybe 20? I honestly can't remember. I’m so sorry, dear. It's just… my memory isn’t what it used to be. I really should ask my granddaughter, but she’s busy with her children. I feel terrible not knowing.
DOCTOR: Okay, you take a little white pill for your blood pressure, possibly 10 or 20 milligrams. We can try to verify that with your pharmacy later. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your current symptoms. You mentioned feeling sick to your stomach and not having much of an appetite. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no nausea and 10 being the worst nausea you can imagine, how would you rate your nausea right now?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Right now? It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely there. I’d say… a 4, maybe? It’s a constant queasiness, not like a sharp sickness. More of a dull, unsettled feeling. It’s enough to make me not want to eat, but I haven’t actually thrown up today. So… a 4, I think. It fluctuates, you know. Sometimes it’s worse than others. But right now… a 4.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 4 out of 10 for nausea. And you mentioned feeling tired. Is that fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it's mostly constant, dear. I used to have plenty of energy, tending to my animals and working in the garden. But now… I get tired just walking to the mailbox. It's not like a sudden crash, more of a… dragging feeling. It's there all the time, but it's worse in the afternoons. I find myself needing to rest a lot more than I used to. It's just… wearing me down. So, mostly constant, but worse some days than others. It's been going on for a while now, too. Not just a recent thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your bowel movements. Have you noticed any changes in your stool—for example, is it more frequent, less frequent, harder, softer, or a different color than usual?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s not a very polite question, is it? Well… yes, I have noticed a change. I haven’t been going as often as I used to. And… it’s harder. It’s a bit of a struggle, if I’m honest. And… darker, I think. Not a lot different, but… darker. It hasn’t been bleeding or anything, thank goodness. Just… less frequent and harder. It worries me a little, because… well, you know. It's not normal for me. I used to be very regular, but now... not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, less frequent and harder stools, and darker in color. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that's alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven't been feeling myself lately, so I'm happy to let you take a look. Just… be gentle, if you would. My stomach is a little tender, as we've discussed. But yes, go ahead. I’ll try to be still.
DOCTOR: <stage>I begin the exam, starting with listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart rate is a little slow at 68 beats per minute, but the rhythm is regular. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Do you feel any particular tenderness anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, right in the middle. Just below my breastbone. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. It’s been there for a while now, as I said. It hurts a little when you press on it. Not terrible, but noticeable. And… maybe a little bit on the right side, too, but not as bad as the middle. It's hard to say exactly. It just feels… uncomfortable. A little swollen, maybe? But I'm not sure. I haven’t really been paying attention.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your bowel sounds are a little quiet, and I'm feeling some tenderness in the middle and upper right part of your abdomen, but it doesn't seem like anything acutely concerning. Your abdomen is mildly distended. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please extend your legs.
PATIENT: There we go… a little stiff, if I'm honest. I haven't been very active lately, as you know. I hope I'm not too much trouble. My old bones aren’t as flexible as they used to be. Go ahead, dear. I’ll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are a little slow, but that’s not uncommon with age. All right, that completes the physical exam. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I’d like to order some blood work and a stool test. The blood work will help us check your overall health, and the stool test will check for any signs of infection or bleeding. I’m also going to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. It’s just to rule out anything serious. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… that sounds… serious, doesn’t it? But yes, dear, if you think it’s best, then let’s do it. I want to know what’s going on with me. I haven't been feeling myself, and I'm worried about what it could be. Blood work and a stool test… okay. And the ultrasound. I hope it’s not anything too bad. When will I know the results? And… will it hurt? I get anxious about these things, you know. Old habits. But yes, please, do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Raymonde. It's good we're getting this checked out. The ultrasound is non-invasive; it doesn't involve any needles or radiation. It uses sound waves to create pictures of your organs. It shouldn’t hurt at all, though a gel will be applied to your skin to help with the image. The lab work usually takes 24-48 hours, and the ultrasound results typically take a few days. The clinic will contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals and staying hydrated. We'll discuss the results in detail when we have them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Smaller meals and staying hydrated… I can do that. I suppose it’s better to know, even if it’s not good news. 24-48 hours for the blood work, a few days for the ultrasound… okay. I’ll try not to worry too much in the meantime. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. It's good to know someone is listening. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better now, just knowing what's going to happen. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or any warning signs I should look out for before my appointment? I'm always afraid of forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. For now, focus on those smaller meals and staying hydrated. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, high fever, vomiting blood, or black, tarry stools, please go to the emergency room immediately. Those would be signs of something more urgent. Otherwise, just try to rest and take it easy. I'll have the lab orders and ultrasound referral sent to the front desk. They'll schedule everything for you. We’ll follow up once the results are available. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, dear, I think that’s everything. You’ve answered all my questions, and explained everything so clearly. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I appreciate it more than you know. I'm going to trust you and hope for the best. I suppose I should go home and try to rest now. Thank you again. .
