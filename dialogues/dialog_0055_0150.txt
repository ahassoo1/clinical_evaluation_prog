DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s…pleasant to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s Angelle, please. And frankly, I don’t have time for pleasantries. I’m here because… I want to be sure, if I decide to… pursue this, that it happens without any… complications. I’m 51, not… decrepit. I want a baby, and I want it to be easy. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Yes, Angelle, perfectly understood. Though, as you may appreciate, the process of conception is rarely… “easy,” regardless of one’s age. But we can certainly discuss your options and assess your overall health to determine the most suitable path. First, let's establish a baseline. Have you consulted with any other physicians regarding this matter?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Why would I? It’s… obvious what needs to be done. I’m a perfectly healthy woman. I ride my bicycle every day. I don't need someone to tell me I should eat more vegetables. And frankly, I find the implication… insulting. Just tell me what you can do to make this happen. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well. While I appreciate your… enthusiasm, a comprehensive evaluation is still necessary to ensure both your health and the potential health of the pregnancy. It's standard procedure, Angelle. To begin, could you describe your typical menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting somewhere. Look, it's… irregular. Has been for years. Stress, mostly. Divorces aren't exactly calming. But it happens. Usually every… I don’t know, 30-40 days? Sometimes longer. I don't keep a calendar, Doctor. Do I look like the type? Is that what you need? A detailed chart of my… womanly cycles? Honestly.
DOCTOR: Irregular cycles, noted. Thirty to forty days, sometimes longer… We will need to investigate the cause of that irregularity. It's vital information. Do you experience any unusual bleeding – heavier than usual, spotting between periods, or pain associated with your cycle?
PATIENT: Pain? Occasionally. Like… normal cramps. I’ve had children, Doctor. I know what cramps are. It's not… debilitating. The bleeding is… normal, I suppose. Though it’s not heavy heavy, if that makes sense. More… sparse. And it’s been less frequent lately. Which, frankly, is part of why I’m here. I don't want to wait another year for this to… sort itself out. Honestly, I just want to know what you can do.
DOCTOR: Sparse bleeding, less frequent cycles… Very well. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, or changes in your libido?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Are you implying I'm… old? Look, I haven’t exactly been… actively pursuing a social life lately, if that’s what you mean. My libido is… irrelevant. And no, I don’t have hot flashes. I live in Florida, Doctor, it’s always hot. As for… dryness? That’s… personal. And frankly, a bit rude to ask. Just focus on making this happen, please. Are you able to, or are we wasting my time?
DOCTOR: Angelle, I assure you I am not implying anything. These questions are part of a standard medical evaluation to assess your hormonal status and overall reproductive health. I am attempting to gather necessary information. Before we proceed further, I do need a more complete history. Have you had any significant medical conditions, surgeries, or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Fine. Hospitalizations… I had my tonsils out as a child. Appendectomy when I was… oh, I don’t know, twenty. A rather nasty bicycle accident a few years ago, broke my wrist. Aside from that, nothing major. I’m very careful. I eat well. I exercise. I do not smoke. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Is that acceptable? And the divorce… well, that was emotionally draining, but not a medical condition. Are we getting anywhere, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, appendectomy, fractured wrist… noted. No smoking, occasional wine… acceptable. And yes, we are gathering information. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Penicillin. I’m severely allergic. Broke out in hives, almost went into anaphylactic shock. It’s… quite serious. And dust mites, I suppose. But that's just… annoying, not life-threatening. Honestly, I doubt that’s relevant. Just the penicillin. Very, very important you remember that. Do you have that written down somewhere? I shouldn't have to repeat myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the penicillin allergy documented in your record. Thank you for confirming. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes ibuprofen, when my wrist acts up. The bicycle accident, remember? It flares up with the humidity. Nothing else. I prefer to… manage things naturally. Honestly, I don't want to be drugged up if I do manage to… conceive. I want to be… functional. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen… noted. And yes, you are entitled to your preferences. Now, regarding your family history… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or infertility?
PATIENT: Oh, my mother had… well, she had everything, frankly. Heart disease, diabetes, some kind of cancer I don’t remember. My father was fine, mostly. He broke a lot of bones, was very clumsy. And… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… difficulty conceiving, I believe. She had several miscarriages. Honestly, it’s not a very cheerful topic. Is that relevant? Are you just trying to find reasons why this won't work?
DOCTOR: Family history of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and difficulty conceiving… noted. It is relevant, Angelle, as it helps us assess potential risks. Now, before we proceed to a physical examination, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. What do you want to know, if I enjoy knitting? I told you, I don't have much of a social life. I ride my bicycle. I read. I… contemplate. I live alone. I'm divorced. Is that what you need to know? I'm not a party animal, if that’s what you’re getting at. Frankly, I find these questions… intrusive. Are you going to examine me soon, or are you just trying to catalog my entire existence?
DOCTOR: Angelle, I understand your frustration. I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, but they are necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of your health status. Your social history can provide valuable information. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination to assess your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I have a bicycle to maintain, you know. And frankly, I’m wasting valuable daylight. Just… be quick. And try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds… regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80. Normal. Your abdomen is soft. No masses or tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Strength is normal. Overall, your physical examination is unremarkable, but your slightly rapid heart rate and family history warrant further investigation. I recommend some blood tests to assess your hormonal levels, thyroid function, and overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. Whatever it takes. But I want the results quickly. And I expect a clear explanation of everything. No medical jargon, please. Just tell me what it all means. And if it turns out I'm not a suitable candidate, just tell me straight. I don't have time for beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll order the necessary blood tests immediately. The results should be available within a few days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail, and I assure you, I will explain everything in clear, understandable language. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss the potential risks associated with pregnancy at your age, and we can review some lifestyle modifications that might improve your chances of success. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? What, you’re going to tell me to stop riding my bicycle? Honestly. I suppose I can listen, but don’t expect me to change my entire life. And as for risks… I understand there are some. But I’m a healthy woman. I’m willing to take calculated risks. Just… don’t sugarcoat it. Tell me everything, and then let me decide. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well. As you know, the risk of chromosomal abnormalities increases with age, and that can lead to complications during pregnancy. There’s also an increased risk of gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and preterm labor. We can discuss screening options, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, to assess the risk of chromosomal abnormalities. Would you like me to explain those options in detail?
PATIENT: Amni… what-now? And something about a villus? Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. Are you trying to scare me off? Look, I’m not interested in poking around in my… parts. I understand there are risks. I’m willing to accept them. But I’m not going to subject myself to a lot of invasive procedures just to… appease your anxieties. Just tell me what I need to do, and what the chances are. In simple terms. Please.
DOCTOR: Very well. Those are screening tests to check the baby for genetic problems. They do carry a small risk of miscarriage. However, they are not required. In terms of your chances, it's difficult to give an exact percentage without knowing the results of your blood tests. But generally, the success rate of pregnancy with natural conception decreases with age. We can discuss alternative options, such as in vitro fertilization , which can increase your chances of success. Would you like me to explain what that involves?
PATIENT: IVF? Oh, good heavens. Is that the thing with the… eggs? Honestly, I've heard enough. Look, I came here because I thought I might be able to conceive naturally. I'm not interested in… complicated procedures and a lot of expense. If the chances are slim, just tell me. And if they're not, then I suppose I'll consider it. But not yet. Not after all this. What are the chances, Doctor? Straight answer. No beating around the bush. Please. Just the numbers.
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on your age and assuming you are otherwise healthy, the chance of conceiving naturally in any given month is approximately 1-5%. However, that is just an average, and it can vary depending on individual factors. With IVF, the success rate is higher, approximately 30-40% per cycle, but it is also more expensive and time-consuming. I understand you're hesitant about complicated procedures. We can discuss less invasive options, such as ovulation induction with intrauterine insemination, but those also have lower success rates. Do you have any questions about these options, or would you like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them further after your blood test results are available?
PATIENT: One to five percent? Honestly. That’s… discouraging. Fine. Schedule a follow-up. After the tests. And… make it quick. I have a bicycle to maintain, remember? And frankly, I need some time to… contemplate. Don't call me unless it's absolutely necessary. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. I’ll schedule the follow-up appointment and will contact you as soon as the blood test results are available. Have a good day.
