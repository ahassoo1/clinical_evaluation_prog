DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… a check-up, I think? Something about needing to be cleared for… performances? My daughter, she signed me up for something. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. It’s all a bit of a blur. I just want to get it over with, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. A check-up is a good idea. And don’t worry about the details, we’ll take our time. Just tell me whatever you do remember about why you need to be cleared for performances. Is this a new thing, or have you been performing for a while?
PATIENT: Performing… hmm. New, I think. Very new. My daughter, Lily, she’s always been… enthusiastic. She said it’s good for me, keeps me active. Something about a theatre group? Or maybe a… film? Honestly, it all happened so fast. I mostly just show up where she tells me to. I haven't really performed anything in… well, a very long time. Mostly just… ushering, you know? Ticket taking. Things like that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. It sounds like Lily is looking out for you. So, this is a new venture, potentially some acting or being on camera?
PATIENT: Potentially… yes, that sounds right. Lily said something about a small role. Not a big role, thankfully. I don’t have the energy for a big role. Mostly just… standing around, I think? Or maybe a few lines? It's all a bit vague. I just hope it doesn’t involve too much running. My knees… aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll definitely take that into consideration. Before we get started with the exam, let me just take a look at your medical history here… Ah, okay. It says you haven't been to our clinic before. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything Lily puts in front of me, to be honest. She’s a good cook. Nothing comes to mind, no. I’ve never had a… reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway. It’s possible I did when I was younger, but… that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Lily keeps telling me I should take something for my… joints, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet. Just a bit of tea in the mornings, that’s it. Nothing special. I try to stay away from too many pills, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Alright, Mr. Krahn, just to get a better picture of your overall health, let's do a quick physical exam. We'll start with your height and weight, and then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I have… things to do later. And my knees, remember? Standing for too long isn't ideal.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll keep it as brief as possible. First, let’s get your height and weight. If you could step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright, here we go. Lily always says I’m too thin… she worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, 199 centimeters and 68 kilograms. Thank you. Now, if you could just have a seat on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: There we go. A little creaky, but I’m here. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little fast, actually… around 98 beats per minute. It's not drastically high, but we should keep that in mind. Lungs sound clear, though. Any shortness of breath or coughing lately?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Not really. Maybe a little when I climb the stairs, but Lily says that’s just because I’m old. Coughing… no, not really. Just the usual little tickle in my throat sometimes. Nothing to worry about, I wouldn’t think. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit… oh, must be forty years ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of smoking, but quit forty years ago. That's good. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax, please. Your abdomen is soft. No tenderness. Everything feels normal there. Now, let’s take a look at your reflexes. Could you extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Alright, here you go. Not as flexible as I used to be, mind you. Lily says I need to do more stretching… she’s always telling me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, which can be normal with age. And just to finish up, could you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright… here we go. A little wobbly, as you can see. Knees aren’t what they used to be. Lily says I need to build up my strength… she’s a good daughter, she really is.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. Your gait is a bit unsteady, and you do seem to have some weakness in your legs. Given your history and the exam findings, I think it's important to do some further investigation. I'd like to order a blood test to check your overall health, and I think an X-ray of your knees would be a good idea to see what's going on there. Do you have any concerns about that?
PATIENT: Blood test… X-ray… oh dear. Sounds… complicated. Lily will probably want me to get all sorts of things done. Complicated and expensive, I imagine. I don't have insurance, you see. But… if you think it’s necessary. I just want to get cleared for this… performance thing, and get it over with. Is it absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Krahn. It’s not necessarily absolutely necessary to get cleared for something minor, but given your age, your history of smoking, your reported weakness and unsteady gait, and the diminished reflexes, it would give us a better understanding of what might be causing these issues. The blood test will give us a general overview of your health, and the X-ray will help rule out any significant problems with your knees. We can start with the blood test and see what that reveals. We can discuss the X-ray afterward. There are some lower-cost options available at the clinic, and we can also explore some community resources that might be able to help with the cost. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Lower cost… community resources… yes, that would be good. Very good. Blood test first, then we’ll see. Lily will be happy I'm being sensible. She worries so much. Alright, let’s do the blood test. Where do I go? And how long will it take? I have… things to do, remember?
DOCTOR: Of course. The lab is just down the hall, room 3. They’re expecting you. It shouldn’t take too long, maybe fifteen to twenty minutes for the blood draw. The results usually come back within three to five business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results to discuss them and determine the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Three to five business days. Room 3. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ll go and get this blood test done. Hopefully, it won’t be too painful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. We'll do our best to make it as quick and painless as possible. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions. Here’s a requisition form for the lab. Good luck, and we’ll see you in a few days. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye. .
