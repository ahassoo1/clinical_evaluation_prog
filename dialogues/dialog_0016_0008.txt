DOCTOR: Hi Leander, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, hello Doctor. Right. My ear… it feels full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? It’s been… a while now, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me. Just feels plugged, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a plugged feeling in your ear. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More… how? Is it painful? Not really. Just… annoying. Like when you’re on a plane, that pressure? Sort of like that, but… not as bad. And it hasn't gone away. I don’t… I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A few weeks, maybe? Or longer. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's more of a pressure sensation than pain, and it's been going on for a few weeks, at least. Has anything specific made it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm. Worse… no, not really. Nothing I’ve noticed. Better… well, sometimes it feels a little less full when I… swallow, maybe? Or when I yawn. But it always comes back. I don't… I don't really do much these days, to be honest. Mostly just around the farm.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it fluctuates a little with swallowing or yawning. And you said you're mostly around the farm – any recent exposure to loud noises, or anything that might have gotten in your ear?
PATIENT: Loud noises… the tractors, I suppose. They’re… tractors. Always loud. And… oh! There was that time I was checking the irrigation pipes and… bumped my head on something. But that was… a long time ago. Didn’t think much of it then, and I certainly don’t remember anything getting in my ear. Honestly, I'm not the most careful person.
DOCTOR: Alright, tractors and a bump to the head. Good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. Maybe… a little bit of ringing sometimes? Very faint. I just thought it was… the quiet. You know, when things are too quiet you start to hear things. I don’t know if that’s connected. My hearing isn't what it used to be, either. But that's just… getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some faint ringing and a general sense of hearing loss. Have you experienced any dizziness, nausea, or any drainage from your ear?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no. Not really. I'm a bit clumsy, always have been, but that's just me. Nausea, no. And no, nothing coming out of my ear. Just… full. That’s it. I really just want this fixed, if that's possible. It's… distracting.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness or drainage, just the fullness and some ringing. Let's take a quick look at your ear. I'll use an otoscope to see if I can see anything obvious. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't hurt. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… quick, if you could? I have things to get back to on the farm. I don’t want to keep you all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm looking now... Hmm. Your ear canal is a little narrow, which makes it harder to see, but I do see some cerumen – that's earwax – built up. It looks like a fairly significant impaction. That could definitely be causing the fullness and some of the ringing. The eardrum itself appears intact, which is good. No signs of infection. I'm going to verbalize these findings for the chart: "Patient presents with fullness in left ear, associated with tinnitus. Otoscopic exam reveals significant cerumen impaction, tympanic membrane intact." Do you have any history of ear infections, or have you ever had earwax removed before?
PATIENT: Ear infections… when I was a child, maybe? A long time ago. I don’t really remember. And no, I’ve never had earwax removed before. Never thought I needed to. It just… felt like part of getting old, you know? Everything stops working properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of earwax removal. Given what I'm seeing, I think the most likely cause of your symptoms is the cerumen impaction. We can try to remove it. There are a few ways to do this. We can try earwax softening drops at home for a few days and then come back to have it flushed, or I can attempt to remove it manually in the office today. The manual removal can be a little uncomfortable. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Hmm. Today, if possible. I really don’t want to have to come back again. If it’s just a little uncomfortable… I can handle it. I’ve worked on farms my whole life. A little discomfort isn’t going to bother me. Just get it done, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's go ahead and try manual removal then. I'm going to use a small instrument to gently loosen and remove the wax. It might feel like pressure, and you might hear some slight noises. Let me know immediately if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… hurry, please. And… yes, that feels a little… strange. Like something’s being poked. But not painful. Yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, almost done… just a little more… There! I think I got the bulk of it. Let me take another look. Alright, that looks much better. The ear canal is clear now, and the eardrum is visible. I'm going to add to the chart: "Cerumen impaction removed manually. Tympanic membrane visualized." Can you tell me if that feels any different already?
PATIENT: Yes! Actually… yes, it does. It feels… lighter. Not so plugged. I can hear you a little clearer, I think. It’s… amazing. I didn’t realize how much it was blocking everything. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s great to hear! I'm glad we were able to help. I recommend avoiding getting water in your ear for a few days, just to give everything a chance to settle. And if you're prone to earwax buildup, you might consider using over-the-counter earwax removal drops periodically as a preventative measure. I'm going to give you a discharge instruction sheet on ear care, and a work note excusing you from heavy lifting for the next 24 hours, just to be cautious. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate you getting it done quickly. Just… glad to have that over with.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Leander. Glad we could help. If the fullness returns, or if you experience any pain, ringing, or hearing loss, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. Have a good day, and be careful out there on the farm!
PATIENT: .
