DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're here today for a consultation. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, it’s about this ringing in my ears. It’s been… annoying, to say the least. It started a few weeks back, I think? Honestly, I just figured it would go away on its own, but it hasn't.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ringing in the ears, or tinnitus, as we call it. And you said it started a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few weeks. Maybe… four or five? It’s hard to say exactly. It comes and goes, but it’s definitely still there, especially at night when it’s quiet. Makes it hard to sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine. And is it constant when it is present, or does it fluctuate in intensity?
PATIENT: It kind of… changes. Sometimes it's just a little buzz, like a really quiet fridge. Other times it’s louder, more like a high-pitched whine. It's usually worse when I’m stressed, I think. Work's been a bit hectic lately. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Well, stress can exacerbate many things. But we need to determine the cause of the ringing, not simply attribute it to your workload. Have you been exposed to any loud noises recently – concerts, machinery, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really, not that I can think of. I work at a restaurant, so it is noisy, but it’s just normal restaurant chatter, you know? Nothing super loud, like a club or anything. I went to a wedding a month ago, but the music wasn't blasting or anything. I don't really go to concerts. Honestly, I mostly just listen to music with headphones, if that matters?
DOCTOR: Headphones, alright. And at what volume do you typically listen to your music?
PATIENT: Uh... pretty loud, I guess? Not maxed out, but… enough to block out other noises. I like to really hear it, you know? I usually have them on during my commute. It's a bit noisy on the bus. Is that bad? I didn’t know it could cause this.
DOCTOR: It can be a contributing factor, Mr. Dhanoa. Prolonged exposure to loud noises, even through headphones, is a common cause of tinnitus. Now, let's get a bit more detail. Have you noticed any hearing loss alongside the ringing?
PATIENT: Hearing loss? Not that I’ve noticed, no. Everything sounds… normal. Maybe a little muffled sometimes, but I figured that was just from being tired. I haven’t really paid that much attention. It’s just the ringing that bothers me. Is it serious? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's good you're seeking medical attention, but honestly, it’s often the insidious things that are most concerning. While it may not be “serious” in the life-threatening sense, untreated tinnitus can significantly impact your quality of life. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Let’s do a quick examination. I’ll need to check your ears, and I’d also like to perform a brief neurological assessment. Then, we will need to conduct an audiometry to assess your hearing. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want it to stop, you know? It’s really distracting. Let’s get it checked out. Ears first, yeah?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit forward. I’m going to use an otoscope to examine your ear canals and tympanic membranes. It might be a little uncomfortable if there’s any wax build-up, but it shouldn’t be painful. Hmm. Some cerumen present in both ears, but nothing significant. Tympanic membranes appear intact. Now, I'd like you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head... Cranial nerves II and VIII appear intact. Now, we will proceed to the audiology department for a hearing test. They’re just down the hall. The technician will explain the procedure. I’ll review the results when they are available.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Just… tell me how long the hearing test will take, roughly? I have to get back to work this afternoon. And… will they tell me anything right away, or do I have to wait for you? It’s just… I really need to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: The hearing test should take approximately 30-45 minutes. The technician will provide you with a preliminary overview of the results, but they are not qualified to provide a diagnosis. I will need to review the full report before I can determine the cause of your tinnitus and recommend a course of action. I expect to have the results by the end of the day. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions before I excuse you to the audiology department?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results. I really appreciate you seeing me today, Doctor. I’ll go find the audiology department. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. The department is just through those doors, to your left. The receptionist will assist you. I expect a prompt return of the audiometry report. .
