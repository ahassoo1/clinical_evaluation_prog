DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day to recount my life story. It's quite simple, really. I woke up this morning and I can't hear out of one ear, and half my face feels… droopy. Is that enough detail for you, Doctor? It's rather alarming, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is quite concerning, Stephane, and definitely enough detail to start with. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are things we need to investigate quickly. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me when exactly you first noticed these symptoms this morning?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specifics… Let me think. It was… around 7:15, I believe. Yes, 7:15. I was getting ready for my day, brushing my teeth, and that's when I realized everything sounded… muffled. And then I looked in the mirror and, well, you see it, don't you? It's not subtle. Honestly, you doctors are always asking for these precise times. As if I’m keeping a log of my medical emergencies. It’s quite disruptive.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane. It's never easy to recall details when you're experiencing something alarming. 7:15 this morning is helpful. And yes, you're right to be concerned. To get a clearer picture, could you describe what "muffled" sounds like?
PATIENT: Honestly? Like someone turned the volume way down. And there's a ringing. A constant, irritating ringing in that ear. It’s… difficult to explain. Like being underwater, perhaps? Though I haven’t been swimming in years. It’s just… quiet. And then this… weakness. It feels like half my face is paralyzed. It’s very unsettling. Are you going to actually do something, or just keep asking questions? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I apologize if it feels like I'm asking a lot of questions. I am going to do something, Stephane, but I need to gather as much information as possible first to ensure I'm taking the right steps. The muffled hearing and ringing are important clues, as is the facial weakness. Now, regarding the facial weakness, is it affecting your ability to smile, close your eye, or feel anything on that side of your face?
PATIENT: Well, obviously I can’t smile properly. Look at me! And closing my eye is… difficult. It feels loose. Like it won’t stay shut all the way. And yes, feeling… it’s… numb-ish. Not completely, but definitely not the same as the other side. It’s all very… asymmetrical. Honestly, Doctor, I was a radiologist for thirty years. I understand anatomy. I don't need a detailed description of what not being able to move half my face feels like. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to point that out, Stephane. My apologies – I shouldn’t assume anything. Thirty years as a radiologist gives you a very informed perspective. Given your history and the sudden onset of these symptoms – the hearing loss, ringing, and facial weakness – this raises a concern for something called Bell’s Palsy, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to do a quick neurological exam to assess the extent of the weakness and check your reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Bell’s Palsy? Honestly, I've heard of it. Usually affects people who are… well, not me. I’ve always been very healthy. Fine, examine me. Get it over with. But please be quick. I really don't have time for this. And try not to poke too much. It’s rather unnerving. Is there any chance this is… serious? You aren’t going to tell me it’s just stress, are you? Because I assure you, my life isn't that stressful. It’s just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Stephane, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. And no, I wouldn’t dismiss this as simply stress. While stress can sometimes contribute to neurological symptoms, the sudden onset and specific presentation here warrant a thorough investigation. We need to rule out other, more serious causes. The exam will involve checking your facial movements, testing your reflexes, and a few simple sensory tests. First, can you close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. As you can see, it’s not exactly a tight seal. It feels… floppy. Honestly, it’s quite obvious. Do you need me to do anything else, or are you just documenting the obvious at this point? I have a perfectly good mirror at home, you know. This is rather… humiliating.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it’s very clear there’s weakness on that side, Stephane. And I appreciate you pointing that out. It helps me understand what you’re experiencing. Now, can you try to raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: See? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Are you writing all this down? It’s rather depressing to watch myself fail at basic facial expressions. Honestly, I feel like I’m having a stroke. Though I’m far too young for a stroke, aren’t I? This is ridiculous. Can we please get to the bottom of this and figure out a solution? I don’t have time for a prolonged medical drama.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to want answers, Stephane. I understand your frustration, and I assure you I’m taking this very seriously. The asymmetry with the eyebrow raise is significant. Now, can you try to smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It looks… ghastly. Honestly, I resemble a Picasso painting. This is not a good look. Can we please stop with the facial contortions? It’s mortifying. Are you going to order some tests, or just continue documenting my decline? I’m starting to feel quite faint. Is there any chance this is… contagious? My housekeeper comes on Thursdays…
DOCTOR: You’re right, we’ve gathered enough information for now, Stephane. And no, this is not contagious. We can stop the exam. I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable, but these tests are important to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Based on your symptoms and the neurological exam, Bell’s Palsy is still the most likely diagnosis, but to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a blood test to check for any underlying infections, and I recommend an MRI to assess for any structural issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: MRI? Honestly, that sounds… dreadful. Claustrophobia, the noise… But fine. Do whatever tests you deem necessary. As long as it gets me a definitive answer. And quickly. I have commitments, you know. Though I suppose I’ll have to cancel them. This is incredibly inconvenient. And what about treatment? Is there anything you can do about this? Or am I just supposed to walk around looking like this indefinitely? This is… unacceptable. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the MRI, Stephane. We can discuss options to make you more comfortable if you’re feeling claustrophobic – medication to help you relax, or an open MRI if one is available nearby. Regarding treatment, the good news is that most cases of Bell’s Palsy resolve on their own within a few weeks to months, even without treatment. However, we can prescribe a course of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and improve your chances of a full recovery. Physical therapy can also help to strengthen the facial muscles and prevent long-term weakness. I’ll order the blood test and the MRI right away. The lab is just down the hall, and we can schedule the MRI for tomorrow morning. Let’s focus on getting those tests done first, and then we can discuss a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Do you have any questions for me right now?
