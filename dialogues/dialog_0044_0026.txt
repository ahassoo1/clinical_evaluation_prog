DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Asami, you said? Well, it's this… tiredness. Just awful tiredness. Comes on suddenly, and knocks me right flat. My husband says I'm no fun when it happens. He worries, of course. Always does. It's just...weakness, really. Like all the strength just drains out of me.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and weakness that comes on suddenly… that’s good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about when this tiredness happens?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? That's the tricky part. It doesn't seem to be after anything in particular. Not after I exert myself, not after eating… Honestly, it just… happens. Sometimes it’s in the mornings, sometimes after lunch… I really can't put my finger on it. It’s not like I can predict it, you see. It's very frustrating. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being asked to recall such… nebulous details.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ardelle. It is frustrating when things don’t follow a pattern. It's helpful to know it’s not tied to any specific activity. So, it just…overtakes you?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Overtakes me is a good way to put it. Like a wave. A very unwelcome wave. And then… I just have to lie down. My husband, Pem, brings me tea. Earl Grey, always. He's a good man, Pem. But it's… debilitating. I can’t do anything when it hits. Not even watch my stories. And honestly, at my age, what is there to do but watch stories?
DOCTOR: It sounds very disruptive, Ardelle. And it's good to have Pem there to support you. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. When you say it “hits,” can you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not pain, exactly. It’s more like… everything just gets heavy. My limbs, my eyelids… everything. And I feel… cold, even if I'm not. And weak. Terribly, terribly weak. It's not like being tired after a long day of work, you understand. It’s… a deeper kind of weakness. It’s… unpleasant. I don't know what else to tell you. I'm not a doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ardelle. You’re doing wonderfully, and you don’t need to be a doctor to describe what you’re feeling. “Heavy limbs, coldness, and a deeper kind of weakness” – that's very helpful. Does anything make it better when you're experiencing this?
PATIENT: Well, Pem’s tea, of course. Earl Grey. And… lying down. Absolutely lying down. That's the only thing that really helps. It doesn't make it go away immediately, mind you. It just… lessens it. And time, I suppose. It eventually fades. It just… takes its own sweet time. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite tired just talking about it. It’s exhausting reliving these episodes.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It is tiring to go over these things, and I apologize for pushing you to recall so much detail. Let’s take a step back. Besides the tiredness and weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… Let me think. My muscles ache sometimes, but that’s just my age, isn't it? And I've been a bit… forgetful lately. But I’m eighty-one! What do you expect? It's not like I'm expecting to have the memory of a twenty-year-old. Honestly, sometimes I forget what I had for breakfast. It's terribly embarrassing. I wouldn’t bother you with such trivialities if it weren’t for this… fatigue.
DOCTOR: It’s not trivial at all, Ardelle. It's important for me to get a complete picture, and any changes you've noticed, even if they seem small, are helpful. Muscle aches and increased forgetfulness… okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is… normal, I suppose. I eat when Pem puts food in front of me. He’s a good cook. As for weight… I haven't stepped on a scale in ages. Honestly, I don’t concern myself with such things. It's not like I'm going anywhere, is it? And frankly, I’m not interested in discussing my weight with a doctor. It's a rather personal matter, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ardelle. It is a personal matter, and I apologize for asking. We don’t need to discuss it further. Now, have you experienced any dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain at any time?
PATIENT: Dizziness… sometimes, yes. But only when I stand up too quickly. I’ve always been a bit prone to that. Shortness of breath… not really. Perhaps a little when I'm climbing the stairs, but that's to be expected, isn’t it? And chest pain… no. Never any chest pain. Honestly, Doctor, are you looking for something serious? Because if you are, you should just say so. My husband is a worrier, and I don't need to add to his anxieties.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Ardelle. I always ask a comprehensive set of questions to get a full picture, and it doesn't necessarily mean I'm looking for something serious. However, given your symptoms – the sudden fatigue, weakness, and occasional dizziness – it's important to rule out any potential underlying causes. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a few basic neurological checks. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well… a physical exam. I suppose so. But please be gentle. My bones aren't what they used to be. And don’t poke and prod too much. Honestly, I've never been a fan of doctors. All that poking and prodding. It’s undignified. But if it will put Pem’s mind at ease… fine. Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ardelle. I will be as gentle as possible, and we’ll go at your pace. I promise no unnecessary poking and prodding. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Fine. But don't pull it too tight. My circulation isn’t the best. And honestly, Doctor, I hope you washed your hands. I read something about infections in the paper… Very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I always wash my hands thoroughly before and after seeing each patient. And I’ll make sure the cuff isn’t too tight. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Okay, all done. Your pulse is regular, reflexes are a little slow, which is common at your age, and your neurological function appears normal. I did notice a slight crackling sound in your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup.
PATIENT: Fluid buildup? In my lungs? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it pneumonia? My neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, had pneumonia last winter. She was terribly sick. Is that what's happening to me? Honestly, Doctor, you’re scaring me now. Pem is going to be beside himself.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ardelle. It is good that we’re investigating this. It's too early to say definitively if it's pneumonia, but the crackling sound could indicate some fluid buildup, or it could be something else. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a blood test. The blood test will help us check for infection and other potential causes of your fatigue and weakness. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… and more blood tests. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like you're trying to find something wrong with me! But… I suppose if it will put Pem’s mind at ease, then yes. Do whatever you think is best. But please, be quick about it. I don't like spending time in hospitals. They smell dreadful. And all those… young people running around. It's unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ardelle. We'll get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible. I’ll write the orders for the X-ray and blood tests now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and then we’ll schedule the X-ray for you. It should be a fairly quick procedure. In the meantime, I’d like to review your medications and medical history. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications. Let me think. Just my blood pressure pills, I suppose. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a little something for my arthritis, but Pem handles that. He’s very good with remembering those things. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to what I’m taking. As long as it keeps me functioning, I don’t ask questions. As for my medical history… I had my gallbladder removed years ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling in the garden. Nothing serious, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, arthritis medication managed by Pem, gallbladder removal, and a broken wrist. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or insects?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I eat everything. And I've never been stung by a bee, thankfully. I've always been very careful around them. They're rather frightening creatures, bees. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure you need to know all this? It feels like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like an interrogation, Ardelle. I’m just trying to get a complete picture of your health so I can provide you with the best possible care. Knowing about allergies is important to avoid any potential reactions. Now, just one more question before the nurse comes in. Can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh dear. That's a long story. My father had heart trouble, I think. And my mother… she had some sort of ailment, but I don't remember exactly what it was. We didn't talk about those things much in my family. It was considered… impolite. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good at remembering family history. It's all rather hazy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ardelle. It’s common for family history to be hazy. If you happen to remember anything else later, feel free to let me know. Okay, I think we have enough information for now. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and then we’ll schedule the chest X-ray. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – especially shortness of breath or chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… please hurry. And tell Pem I said hello. He’s probably beside himself with worry. And please, be gentle with the blood draw. I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: I will certainly let Pem know you said hello, and I'll make sure the nurse is gentle with the blood draw. I’ll leave you to rest now, and I’ll be back as soon as we have the results. Please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all.
