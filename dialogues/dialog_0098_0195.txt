DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… alright. Honestly, it’s a bit silly, but my daughter, she said I had to come. She worries too much. I just… well, I was hoping you could write me one of those cards. You know, a “Get Well” or something encouraging. I'm perfectly fine, really. Just a little down, if you must know. Nothing a nice card from a proper doctor wouldn't fix.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good of your daughter to be so attentive. While I don’t typically write “get well” cards as such, I’m happy to document your visit and discuss what might be causing you to feel down. Sometimes, just talking about it can help. So, when did you start feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t bother with all that “documenting.” Honestly, it’s a waste of time. And talking… well, I’ve talked to plenty of people. Doesn’t change anything. It started… hmm. Probably around when the weather turned. Always gets to me, the grey skies. Makes everything feel… dull. It's just a mood, you know? Not like I'm sick sick. But my daughter... she insisted. She said a doctor's note would make it official. Honestly, all this fuss.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the change in weather seems to be a significant factor. And your daughter is concerned about a change in your overall mood. It’s good she’s looking out for you. Just to be thorough – and to document things as accurately as possible – can you tell me a little more about what "feeling down" means for you?
PATIENT: Oh, thorough. Always with the thorough. Look, it means I don't feel like doing much, alright? I used to enjoy my garden, my little vegetables... now, I just... sit. And I don't sleep well. Keep waking up thinking about… things. Stupid things, really. Old memories. My neighbor's dog barking. It’s not like I'm crying all day or anything dramatic. It's just… a weight. A general… blahness. Is that good enough documentation for you? Honestly, it’s not a complicated case. It's the weather. And old age. Mostly the weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased interest in activities you usually enjoy – like gardening – and some difficulty sleeping with intrusive thoughts. You describe it as a general “blahness” and attribute it to the weather and, potentially, aging. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm. Not really. I still eat. Maybe not as much. But who needs a huge plate of dal bhat these days? I make it anyway, habit mostly. My husband, he eats plenty. He never complains. But I don’t always finish mine. It just… doesn’t taste the same, you know? Everything seems a bit… faded. Like looking at a photograph that’s been in the sun too long. Does that make sense? It’s not that I’m not hungry, just… not interested. It's the little things, Doctor. The little things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A loss of enjoyment in things you previously enjoyed – even something like a meal – can be a significant indicator. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh, probably a little. My clothes feel a bit looser, if that’s what you mean. But honestly, I’m not one to fuss over numbers. I’ve always been… slender. My husband says I’m too thin, but he always says that. He worries too much too, just like my daughter. He likes a bit of padding, he says it keeps me warm. I just… haven’t bothered to check. It's not like I'm disappearing or anything. A little less weight probably isn't a bad thing. I'm not eating as much, so it figures, doesn't it? Really, I just want the card. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not. But I do feel it’s important to understand what's going on. A small amount of weight loss, combined with the decreased appetite, changes in sleep, and loss of enjoyment in activities, could indicate a few different things. Just to rule out anything physical, would you mind if I did a quick examination?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Honestly, Doctor, I told you, it's the weather. And old age. A quick examination for this? It’s utterly ridiculous. I haven't been properly ill in years. I’ve lived a long life, I know my body. It's just a bit… tired. A card would be much more helpful than all this fussing. Are you refusing to write a card until you’ve poked and prodded me? Because that seems… very rude. Honestly. It's a simple request. A little encouragement. Is that too much to ask of a doctor? .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Janeth. I don't want to dismiss your feelings. And I apologize if I’m coming across as dismissive. It’s not about refusing to write anything; it's about ensuring I've considered all possibilities. A quick exam isn’t about "poking and prodding" unnecessarily; it's simply a responsible step in evaluating your overall well-being. However, I respect your wishes. If you are strongly opposed to a physical exam, I will document your visit and your reported symptoms. But I would like to strongly recommend that you discuss this with a specialist. I can refer you to a psychiatrist or a therapist who might be better equipped to help you address these feelings. Would you like me to do that?
