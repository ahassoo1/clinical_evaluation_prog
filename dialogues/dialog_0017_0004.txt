DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I am Dr. Blim. Please, have a seat. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Blim. It's nice to meet you. Well, it's just a routine check-up, really. Gotta keep up with my shots, you know? My husband always reminds me! He's good about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: A "routine check-up," you say. While I appreciate preventative care, Ms. Fornes, simply stating a need for “shots” is… imprecise. Are you referring to vaccinations?
PATIENT: Oh, you're right, you're right! Vaccinations, yes. That's what I meant. Sometimes I just say "shots" 'cause that's what my grandma used to call 'em. Old habits, I guess. I just want to make sure I'm all up-to-date, you know? Is there a schedule I should be following, or...?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a schedule. A rather complex one, actually. It depends on your age, medical history, and... lifestyle. I see here you are 53 years of age. Have you had a tetanus booster in the last ten years?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… ten years… gosh. I honestly can’t remember. I think so, maybe? I had one after I scraped my arm pretty bad helping with a building project last year, but I don't know if it was a booster or just a regular tetanus shot. We were fixing up the community hall, and things got a little hectic. It all feels like a blur, to be honest. Do you have a record of what I’ve had before?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Ms. Fornes, our records are… incomplete. Particularly for patients who haven’t consistently utilized this clinic’s services. It appears there are gaps in your vaccination history. Honestly, relying on memory is… suboptimal. We'll need to proceed as if certain vaccinations are not current. Now, let's move on to something more concrete. Do you have any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, that’s alright, I suppose. I haven't been super consistent, no. Mostly just when something’s really bothering me. As for chronic conditions… not really. I've always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. A little bit of arthritis in my hands, probably from all the building work, but nothing a good soak and some stretching can’t fix. And my blood pressure sometimes runs a little high when I’m stressed, but it usually goes back down. Other than that, I'm good!
DOCTOR: “A little bit of arthritis” and “sometimes runs a little high” are… vague descriptions, Ms. Fornes. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis by a physician?
PATIENT: No, I haven't been officially diagnosed. I just told my sister about it and she said it sounds like arthritis, 'cause she has it. And she knows a lot about these things! I figured she was right. I haven't bothered going to the doctor for it, though. It's not that bad, and I don’t like going to doctors unless I have to. And my blood pressure, I check it at the pharmacy sometimes when I pick up prescriptions, and it’s usually fine. Really, I’m okay, Dr. Blim! I just don’t want to bother you with little things.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, with all due respect, self-diagnosis and infrequent pharmacy blood pressure readings are not a substitute for proper medical evaluation. This clinic operates on a foundation of thoroughness, not… convenience. Now, let’s get a proper baseline. I'm going to need to take your blood pressure now. Please, extend your arm. And while I'm doing that, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Okay, okay, you’re right. I should be more thorough. Sorry for being difficult. Um… let me think. For medications… I take an aspirin every other day, just for my heart, and sometimes ibuprofen for when my hands really ache. And I take a Vitamin D supplement in the winter, 'cause it gets so dark here. That’s about it, I think. Oh! And I use a topical cream for my hands sometimes, the kind with menthol in it. It smells nice. Does that count? Should I write these down for you? I could grab a pen...
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Fornes, do not bother. An aspirin "every other day" and "topical cream" are insufficient details. What dosage of aspirin are you taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dosage... um... It’s the little white pill. 81 milligrams, I think? It says it on the bottle… somewhere. I’ll have to check when I get home. Honestly, I just take one when I remember. And the cream… I don’t even know, it’s just… hand cream. It came in a blue tube. I’m really not good with this sort of thing, Dr. Blim. It feels like a quiz! I just try to keep moving and take care of myself the best I can.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, a complete and accurate medical history is paramount. The fact that you cannot provide basic dosage information is… concerning. We’ll proceed, but I must emphasize the importance of accurate record-keeping. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of! Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I've tried all sorts of things, even those weird pickled herring my husband's aunt sends us every Christmas. No problems! Though I don't like the herring, but that's not an allergy. Honestly, I’m a pretty sturdy person. I’ve been around a lot of dust and chemicals from building, and I haven't gotten sick or anything.
DOCTOR: "No reactions that you know of” is not an acceptable answer, Ms. Fornes. We require specifics. Have you ever experienced hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or any other unusual symptoms after ingesting a medication or food?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing like that ever. Never. I mean, sometimes I get a little heartburn if I eat spicy food, but that's just heartburn, you know? And sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I’ve been working with cedar, but that's probably just the wood. I've never had a serious reaction to anything, Dr. Blim. Honestly, I think you’re starting to worry too much! I’m a healthy 53-year-old woman. I just need my shots!
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, I assure you, I am not "worrying too much." I am attempting to gather a comprehensive medical history, which, frankly, you are making exceedingly difficult. Now, let us move on to your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mom passed away a few years ago, but my dad is still kicking! He’s 85 and still tends to his garden. He’s a tough one. He had a heart attack a long time ago, but he recovered really well. And my mom… she had arthritis, pretty bad, in her hands and knees. And she had high blood pressure too, towards the end. That’s about all I know. My grandma on my mom’s side… she lived to be 98, but I don’t remember much about her health. She was Tlingit, and they didn’t really talk about those things much back then. It was a different time.
DOCTOR: Heart attack and arthritis. Noted. We'll need to document the approximate age of onset for both conditions, but I suspect that will prove challenging. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband tried it once when he was younger, but he didn't like it. We might have a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. And definitely no drugs! I’m a law-abiding citizen, Dr. Blim. I spend my days building things, not… well, you know. I need a clear head for construction work! It's dangerous enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Very well. One final question before we proceed to the physical examination. What is the reason for this visit beyond wanting to be up to date with your vaccinations?
PATIENT: Well… … to be honest, I've been feeling a little tired lately. Just… more tired than usual. And I’ve had a few headaches. Not bad headaches, just… nagging ones. And my hands have been aching more, even for someone with arthritis. I just figured it was the change in the weather, or maybe too much work. But I thought it wouldn’t hurt to get checked out, just in case. I didn't want to bother you unless it was something, you know?
DOCTOR: “Tired lately,” “nagging headaches,” and “aching hands.” These are exceedingly vague complaints, Ms. Fornes. Very well. We shall proceed with a physical examination. Please, lie down on the examination table. I will begin with your vital signs.
PATIENT: Okay. I’ll try to be still. It's probably just nothing, but I guess it’s better to be safe than sorry. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Now, deep breaths, please. In… and out… 140 over 90. Elevated, as expected. Pulse is 78, regular. Respiratory rate 16. Temperature 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are normal, though a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I will palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, nothing there. It doesn't hurt when you press. Just feels… normal, I guess. My stomach sometimes feels a little bloated after I eat, but that's probably just… gas. I eat a lot of beans. Delicious beans, though. Is that murmur bad, Dr. Blim? My grandpa had a heart murmur, and I think he had to take medicine for it.
DOCTOR: A slight murmur is often benign, Ms. Fornes, but it warrants further investigation. Your joints exhibit mild tenderness, consistent with your reported arthritis. No significant swelling or redness is observed at this time. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Extend your legs. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Now, let's move on to a neurological exam.
PATIENT: Okay. A neurological exam? Is something wrong, Dr. Blim? You're starting to worry me. I just wanted my shots! I hope it's not anything serious. I've got a community hall to finish building, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, it is my professional obligation to conduct a thorough evaluation. A “thorough evaluation” encompasses more than simply administering vaccinations. We are ruling out potential causes for your reported fatigue and headaches. Now, please follow my finger with your eyes. Do not move your head. Follow the movement… keep your gaze fixed on my finger. Any double vision or blurring of your vision?
PATIENT: No, everything looks clear. No double vision or blurring. Just… following your finger. It’s a little dizzying, actually. Is this going to take much longer, Dr. Blim? I’m starting to feel a little anxious. And I haven’t had my shots yet!
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, your anxiety is understandable. However, I must complete this assessment. Now, I’d like to check your cranial nerves. I will shine a light in each of your eyes. Please, look straight ahead. Any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No pain or discomfort. Just… bright light. It’s a little uncomfortable, actually. Is everything okay? Are my eyes okay? My grandma always said her eyes were getting weaker as she got older. I hope I’m not going blind!
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, I have completed the physical examination. Your vital signs are slightly elevated, and you exhibit mild tenderness in your joints. Your neurological exam is grossly intact, though some cranial nerve responses are somewhat sluggish. Given your symptoms – fatigue, headaches, joint tenderness – and your somewhat vague medical history, I recommend a comprehensive blood workup, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and inflammatory markers. And, given the murmur, an electrocardiogram is warranted to assess your cardiac function. We will also need to rule out any underlying infection. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds like a lot of tests. What… what does all that mean, Dr. Blim? Is something seriously wrong? I just wanted my shots… Will I have to come back a lot? And… how much will all of this cost? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, I understand your concerns. These tests are necessary to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. I am not prepared to offer a diagnosis at this time. As for the cost, I am aware that you are uninsured. My office will work with you to establish a payment plan. However, delaying these tests could have serious consequences. I will provide you with a list of recommended laboratories and an order form for the blood work. As for the electrocardiogram, I will refer you to a cardiologist at Suburban General Hospital. Do not delay scheduling these appointments. Here is the order form and a list of laboratories. And here is the referral to the cardiologist. Do you have any further questions before we conclude this appointment?
PATIENT: … Okay. So, I have to go to a lot of places, and it’s going to cost a lot of money. Will they tell me what’s wrong right away? And… what if it’s something bad? I have a community hall to finish building, you know. People are counting on me. Could… could it just be stress? Maybe I just need a vacation? I just wanted my shots.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, I understand your anxiety, but I cannot offer any assurances at this time. The results of the tests will determine the course of action. As for whether it is “just stress,” that is a possibility. However, given your symptoms, it is prudent to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I will review the test results as soon as they are available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Until then, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: … No. I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Blim. I guess I'll go schedule some tests. I hope it’s nothing bad.
DOCTOR: Very well. .
