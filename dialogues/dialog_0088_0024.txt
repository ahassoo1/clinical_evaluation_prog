DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I need a letter confirming I'm able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated. My husband passed away last year, and we had a trip planned. The airline is asking for a note from a doctor before they’ll let me use the ticket, since it's been so long.
DOCTOR: I see. I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must be incredibly difficult. Okay, a fitness-to-fly letter. To give you the most accurate note, I'll need to ask a few questions. It's standard procedure, and helps ensure your safety while traveling. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and I wear glasses, but that’s it. I’m generally healthy. I haven’t been to a doctor in a few years, honestly, since… well, since everything happened with my husband. Is that okay? Should I have brought records?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright that you haven't been to a doctor recently. Many people put things off during difficult times, and it’s understandable. No, you didn't need to bring records for this, but it’s good to know. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any new symptoms recently – anything at all – since your husband passed away?
PATIENT: No, nothing new. I've been… tired, of course. Grief does that to you. But no new physical symptoms. No chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, nothing like that. Just… sadness, mostly. I eat okay, sleep okay… as okay as can be expected, anyway. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Kiante. Grief can manifest in many ways, and fatigue is very common. Alright. Just a few more quick questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t really take anything. I tried some melatonin for a while to help with sleep, but it didn’t really do much, so I stopped. That was a few months ago, though. Is there a reason you're asking specifically about supplements? I'm just trying to understand why you need to know all this, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question. Certain medications and supplements can interact with changes in air pressure during flight, or potentially worsen underlying conditions. We just want to be sure everything is safe for you. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or insect stings?
PATIENT: No allergies. None at all. I can eat anything, I've never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I’m pretty boring medically speaking. I wish I had more interesting things to tell you. Is this taking long? I have a bit of a schedule today, and I just want to get this letter sorted out so I can finally book the trip.
DOCTOR: No, this isn’t taking long. You’re right, your medical history seems quite straightforward, which is a good thing! Just one last area, briefly. Have there been any significant medical conditions in your family – things like heart disease, blood clots, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had high blood pressure, but he lived to be 85. My mother was healthy as a horse, really. No heart problems or lung issues on either side of the family that I’m aware of. No history of blood clots either. I always say we were a lucky family, health-wise. So, can we just get the letter now? I really appreciate you taking the time to see me.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good picture. Based on what you’ve told me, and with no significant medical history or current concerns, I have no medical contraindications to you flying. I’ll write up a quick note confirming your fitness to fly. Just so you know, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms during the flight – chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness – please alert the flight crew immediately. Is there an email address I can send the letter to?
PATIENT: That’s wonderful, thank you so much, Doctor. kiante.sayar@email.com is perfect. And yes, I will definitely let the crew know if anything feels off. I just… I want to do this trip. It was my husband's dream, and I want to honor that. Thank you again for making this so easy.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I understand completely. Here you go. It also includes my contact information if the airline requests further clarification. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns after the flight as well. I hope you have a peaceful and meaningful trip. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Piet. You've been incredibly kind. I appreciate your time and help more than you know. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. Take care of yourself. .
