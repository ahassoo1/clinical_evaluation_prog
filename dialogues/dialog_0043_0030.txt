DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It's… different than usual. I can't quite put my finger on it, and it's making me a little self-conscious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Purtee. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about such a change, and you’ve done the right thing by bringing it to my attention. It’s good you’re addressing it. Now, can you describe this “different” odor a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s tricky. It's not… stronger, exactly. Just different. It’s almost… sweeter, maybe? And it seems to come and go, not constant. I usually don’t smell anything at all, but now, sometimes… well, I notice it, especially after I’ve been working. I do pretty physical work, you know, laying floors. It's not carpet, but the other kinds.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that description, Ms. Purtee. That’s helpful. The intermittent nature and the sweeter scent are good details. And you mentioned it's more noticeable after physical work. Now, has this change been sudden, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: It was pretty sudden, actually. Maybe a couple of weeks ago, I noticed it first. Before that, nothing. I mean, I sweat, of course, that’s just part of the job, but it never smelled like this before. It’s not a bad smell, just… unusual. Does that make sense? I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Purtee, and I appreciate you clarifying. A sudden change is certainly more notable. Let's explore this a bit further. Besides the odor, have you noticed any other changes—perhaps in your skin, any unusual sweating patterns, any weight loss or gain, or any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: Let me think… No weight loss, definitely not. I’ve probably gained a little if anything, but nothing significant. Energy levels are okay, I get tired at the end of the day, but that’s just the work. Skin… hmm. No rashes, no itching, nothing like that. I do feel a bit warmer sometimes than usual, but it's been hot lately, so I figured it was just the weather. Oh! And maybe I've been a little more thirsty than normal. Is that… could that be something?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. That’s all very useful information. The increased thirst is potentially relevant. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any known medical conditions—like diabetes, thyroid problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time, honestly. Just for check-ups, nothing serious. I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, because the winters are long, but that's it. I had a pretty normal childhood, no major illnesses, and I don't have any allergies that I know of. My mom had high blood pressure, but that was later in life. I'm divorced, and I don't have any close family nearby, so it’s just me, really. Medicare is my insurance. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Purtee, that’s very helpful. The information confirms no prior diagnoses and your Medicare coverage. And your mother’s history of high blood pressure is noted. Now, to get a better understanding of your current situation, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then listen to your heart and lungs. I also want to briefly examine your skin and check for any obvious signs of infection or other abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I'm a bit worried, but I'm glad I came in. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. Just a funny thing with my body, maybe. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. I appreciate your trust. Let's start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Please have a seat here on the exam table. Alright, your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 – all within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your skin appears normal; no rashes, lesions, or obvious abnormalities. I don’t detect any unusual odor at this time, but that doesn't rule anything out. Now, I’d like to check your blood sugar levels just to be safe, given the increased thirst you mentioned. It’s a quick finger prick, if you don't mind.
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds good. A quick prick is no problem at all. I drink a lot of water anyway, so maybe it is just that. It's better to be safe, though. Go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee, your blood sugar level is 115. That is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. It could be due to recent food intake, but it does warrant further investigation. I also want to order a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count . These tests will give us a more detailed look at your overall health, including kidney function, liver function, and electrolyte levels. They will also help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the change in your body odor. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. I'm comfortable with that, yes. If that's what you think is best. What exactly does it involve? Do I need to fast beforehand? I usually eat breakfast pretty early before work. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Purtee. The comprehensive metabolic panel is a blood test that checks various chemical levels in your blood, giving us information about your kidney and liver function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar levels. The complete blood count checks the different types of cells in your blood, which can help identify infections, anemia, or other blood disorders. Yes, for the most accurate results, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks – except for water – before your appointment. Since you usually eat breakfast early, you would need to schedule the blood draw for later in the morning or even the afternoon. We can get that scheduled for you right now if you’d like. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay, 8-12 hours, no problem. I can definitely do that. Afternoon is better, I suppose. I usually start work pretty early, so I wouldn’t want to try and do it before. Yes, please, let’s schedule it for the afternoon. What day would be best? And… how long does it take to get the results back? I’m a little anxious, to be honest. But I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Purtee. It's understandable to be anxious, and we’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. We have an opening on Thursday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Thursday at 2:00 PM is perfect. That gives me plenty of time to fast. Okay, great. So, Thursday at 2:00. And… do I need to do anything special before the appointment, besides not eating? Any specific instructions for the blood draw itself? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Thursday at 2:00 PM it is. Besides fasting, there are just a couple of things. Please bring a list of any medications or supplements you are currently taking, even if they are over-the-counter. And drink plenty of water in the days leading up to the appointment – that will make the blood draw easier. As for the blood draw itself, it's a fairly routine procedure. A phlebotomist will clean the area on your arm, then insert a needle to collect a small sample of blood. You might feel a brief pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. After the draw, they’ll apply pressure to the site to stop any bleeding. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back from the lab. Once we have them, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms – such as fever, severe fatigue, or unexplained weight loss – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Does that cover everything for now?
PATIENT: Yes, that covers everything perfectly, Doctor. Thank you so much for explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel a lot better knowing what to expect. List of meds, drink water, and Thursday at 2:00. Got it. I appreciate your patience and understanding. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. We’ll get these tests done and figure out what’s going on. And please, don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you on Thursday.
