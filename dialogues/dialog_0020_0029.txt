DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… eating thing. I just don’t seem to be able to get much down anymore. Feel full after just a little bit, you know? It’s been going on for a while now, but it's getting a bit bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're having trouble eating, feeling full quickly, and it’s been going on for some time now, and is now more bothersome. Can you tell me roughly how long this has been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started… oh, maybe six months ago? Started gradual-like, just not as hungry as I used to be. Then it got to where a small plate was enough, and now… well, now I mostly just pick at things. It’s hard to say exactly, time kinda blurs when you get to be my age, you know? But definitely over half a year.
DOCTOR: Yes, time does seem to move differently as we get older. Over six months, okay. And has there been any weight loss associated with this decreased appetite and feeling full quickly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My wife, bless her heart, she’s been keeping track. Says I’ve lost… let me see… about ten, maybe fifteen pounds? I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my pants are looser, that’s for sure. Not comfortable loose, mind you, just… loose.
DOCTOR: Okay, ten to fifteen pounds of weight loss over six months. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… sometimes I get a bit of a stomach ache, kinda a dull ache, after I do manage to eat something. Not bad, just… uncomfortable. And, oh! I’ve been a little tired lately, more tired than usual. I chalked that up to getting older, mostly. But maybe it’s connected?
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach ache after eating and increased fatigue. Let's try to get a more complete picture. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting at all. And not much nausea either. Maybe a little queasy sometimes, but nothing that would send me running to the bathroom. Mostly just… not wanting to eat, 'cause I know it’ll probably just make my stomach feel funny.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Hmm… they’re… regular enough, I suppose. Not as… solid as they used to be, if you get my meaning. More… loose. And not as often, either. I used to go every day like clockwork, but now it’s more like every other day. Sometimes even longer. I haven't really thought much about it, to be honest, until now. Old age, I figured. Everything slows down, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, changes in bowel habits can happen with age. Okay, so decreased appetite, early fullness, weight loss, stomach aches, fatigue, and looser, less frequent bowel movements. Now, let me ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be forty years now. And I had a touch of pneumonia once, but that was a long time ago too. Other than that… not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I've never been much for doctors, so I haven't really had many problems to report, you know? I try to stay active, eat reasonably well… well, used to eat well, anyway. My wife keeps me in check.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal forty years ago and a bout of pneumonia. No other significant medical history. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little bit of ibuprofen now and then for my arthritis, mostly in my hands. Nothing regularly, though. My wife has a whole cupboard full of vitamins, but I don't bother with 'em. Never really seen the point, to be honest. I prefer a good piece of salmon and a walk on the beach, if you get my meaning.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, no regular medications or vitamins. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always asks when we go out to eat, and I always say no. She worries, you see. A good woman, my wife. Always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had diabetes, later in life. And my father, he had heart trouble. That’s about all I can think of, to be honest. My siblings… they were pretty healthy, mostly. Lived good lives, both of 'em. It’s not something we talked about much, to be honest. Just tried to live each day as it came.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with diabetes, father with heart trouble. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve been married to my wife, Elsie, for sixty years now. That’s the biggest part of my story, I reckon. We live here in town, always have. I used to work at the radio station, did a little bit of everything – news, music, you name it. Retired now, of course. Mostly just potter around the garden, go for walks, and spend time with Elsie. Never been much of a drinker or smoker, thankfully. Always figured it wasn't worth it. Quiet life, but a good one.
DOCTOR: Alright, sixty years of marriage, retired from the radio station, no history of smoking or alcohol use. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mr. Obarr. It's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It'll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking a few reflexes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go right ahead. I might be a bit cold, though. Always get chilly easily these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I have a gown here if you'd like one, but we can proceed with your clothes on if you prefer. And I’ll make sure the room stays comfortable. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are a bit diminished, but regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. There’s some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, but no guarding or rigidity. Abdomen is soft overall. Reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. Okay. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. Your symptoms – weight loss, decreased appetite, early fullness, stomach aches, changes in bowel habits – could be due to a number of things. Given your age and family history, I’m concerned about the possibility of something like stomach cancer, although it could also be something more benign like gastritis or a digestive issue. We need to rule out anything serious. I recommend we start with some blood work to check your overall health and a stool test to look for any abnormalities. I also think a CT scan of your abdomen would be helpful to get a better look at your stomach and other organs. Do that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds… a bit scary, to be honest. Stomach cancer… that’s not something you want to hear. But I trust your judgement, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best, then I’m willing to do it. Blood work and a… a CT scan. I just hope it’s not too serious. Is it going to be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m not good with waiting, you see. Makes my anxiety go right up.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Obarr. It’s natural to feel anxious when you hear about potential tests and diagnoses. We're not diagnosing anything at this point – we’re simply gathering information to figure out what’s going on. The blood work is a simple procedure, just a few vials of blood drawn from your arm. It shouldn’t be painful, just a quick pinch. The CT scan is a bit more involved, but it’s still relatively painless. You’ll lie on a table and a machine will take images of your abdomen. You may be asked to drink a contrast dye beforehand, which can have a slightly metallic taste, but it's generally well-tolerated. As for the results, it usually takes a few days to a week to get them back from the lab. I'll let you know as soon as I have them and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I’d like to recommend that you continue to eat small, frequent meals, even if you don’t feel very hungry. Try to avoid foods that seem to upset your stomach. And if you’re experiencing any nausea or vomiting, let me know immediately. I’m going to write up an order for the blood work and the CT scan. My nurse will come in shortly to explain the process and schedule the appointments for you. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Just… small meals, avoid upsettin’ my stomach, let you know if anything changes. And wait for the results. It’s a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explainin’ it all so clearly. You've put my mind at ease a little, at least. Thank you. I suppose I'll just sit here and wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’re doing this to get to the bottom of things and ensure you’re as healthy as possible. Don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns at any time. I’ll check in with you after the nurse has been in. Take care.
