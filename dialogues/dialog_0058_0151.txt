DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my hands, mostly. They’ve been… tingling. It’s a strange feeling, like pins and needles, you know? I just want to figure out what’s going on, if it’s anything serious. I don’t have time for a lot of… fuss, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, tingling. Okay. And how long have your hands been tingling, Ms. Uzarski?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a few weeks, I think? Maybe a month? It comes and goes. Some days it’s worse than others. It woke me up a couple nights, actually, with the… buzzing. It’s hard to say exactly, time just slips away these days. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful, yes. “A few weeks to a month, intermittent.” And where exactly are you feeling this tingling?
PATIENT: Well… mostly in my fingers. All of them, really. And sometimes it goes up my wrists a little. Not my whole arm, thankfully. It's mostly just… the hands. Like I said, the fingers are the worst. It feels… numb sometimes, too, not just tingly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, tingling and numbness in all of your fingers, extending up to your wrists, intermittent. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t know if anything makes it worse, exactly. Sometimes it seems worse when I’ve been carrying a heavy mailbag, but then again, I always have heavy mailbags. It's my job, you know? I'm a postal worker. Maybe it’s just from that? I don’t know… honestly, it’s just… there. It doesn't really feel like anything specific causes it.
DOCTOR: A postal worker, right. And how long have you been doing that, Ms. Uzarski?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… almost 40 years now. Started right out of high school. It’s… it’s all I’ve ever known, really. Though, it's getting harder, of course. The bags get heavier every year, it seems! But I need the money, you know? And… what else would I do? I don’t want to think about that. Is that relevant, Doctor? I’m sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright. It's relevant. Now, have you experienced any weakness in your hands?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Not exactly weakness, but… sometimes things slip out of my hands. Not often, but more than usual, I think. Like… dropping a letter or two, maybe. It's not like I can’t hold things, it’s just… less secure, you know? My grip feels… a little off. It’s hard to explain. I don’t want to make a big deal out of nothing, Doctor. I just want to make sure it's not something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any pain associated with this tingling, numbness, or difficulty gripping?
PATIENT: No, no pain. That's the thing! It's just… uncomfortable. Annoying, mostly. Not painful. If it hurt, I’d be here sooner! Just this buzzing and the feeling like my hands might fall off sometimes, you know? It’s strange. It doesn’t ache, or throb, or anything like that. Just… weird. And I’m trying to be quick, Doctor. I have a route to finish. I hope you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Uzarski, I do not mind, but I need to ask specific questions to determine what’s going on. Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, no diabetes. My mother had it, but I haven’t. And arthritis… the doctor said something about my knuckles being a little bumpy when I was younger, but he didn't say I had arthritis, exactly. Just said to… watch it, I think? I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. That's why this is so strange! I don't usually bother doctors.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. And… oh! I broke my wrist, a long time ago. Maybe 20 years ago? Fell on the ice. They set it in a cast, and it healed fine. No problems with it since. That’s it, I think. Really. I'm not a hospital person. I avoid them whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just… ibuprofen sometimes, if my back aches after a long day. But that’s it. I try to avoid medication as much as possible. I believe in… toughing things out, you know? I don’t like putting things in my body if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination of your hands and wrists. Please extend your arms, palms up.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Can we make this quick, Doctor? I really need to get back to my route. The mail… it waits for no one, you know? And I don’t want to hold up the neighborhood.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'll be as efficient as possible. Okay. I'm noticing some mild tenderness on the radial side of both wrists. And your grip strength is… slightly reduced. Reflexes appear normal. Do you feel any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! Just a little there, on both sides. Not a bad pain, but… noticeable. Like a dull ache, you know? It's not something I usually pay attention to, honestly. But… yes, there’s something there. And my grip… well, I have been carrying heavy mailbags for 40 years. I suppose it wouldn’t be surprising if it was a little weak.
DOCTOR: Alright. There is no visible swelling or deformity. It’s possible you are experiencing early symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, or perhaps tendonitis related to repetitive use. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some nerve conduction studies and electromyography, or EMG, of your hands and wrists. This will help us determine if there is any nerve compression. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Nerve… what? Electromy… oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And expensive, probably. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, it's just a little tingling, and some weakness. Couldn’t it just be… from the mail? I really don’t want to have a lot of tests, if I can avoid it. I'm not insured, you know. And I have to get back to my route.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, I understand your concerns. However, it's important to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms to prevent them from worsening. Without proper testing, we can't rule out more serious conditions. The EMG and nerve conduction studies are the most accurate way to assess nerve function. As for cost, I can have our billing department explore options for financial assistance or a payment plan. However, I strongly recommend proceeding with these tests. If it is carpal tunnel syndrome, early intervention can significantly improve your symptoms and prevent permanent nerve damage. We can also discuss a trial of wrist splints and over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication, but these are often less effective without a definitive diagnosis. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Wrist splints… I suppose that wouldn't be too bad. But those tests… they sound awful. And expensive. Alright. Look, Doctor, I’ll try the splints. If they don't help… if the tingling gets worse… then I suppose I’ll talk to the billing department about those tests. But I really, really don’t want to, if I can avoid it. And please, could you write down the instructions for the splints? I’m not good with remembering things. And… is there anything else I should be doing? Like… stretching or something? I need to get back to work, you know. The mail…
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll write out detailed instructions on how to wear and care for the wrist splints, including how often to wear them and what activities to avoid. I'll also provide some simple stretching exercises you can do throughout the day to help alleviate discomfort. For now, try to avoid repetitive hand movements as much as possible, and if you experience increased pain or numbness, stop using the splints and contact my office immediately. Here you are. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. I also want you to follow up with me in one month to assess your progress. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you not making me do all those… tests right away. And thank you for being quick. The mail… it really does wait for no one. I guess I’ll see you in a month. Have a good day, Doctor. And… thank you again.
