DOCTOR: Hi Mitchell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is... is Rosanova, yes? Nice to meet you too. I have... a bad headache. In the back of my head. It started... maybe two days ago? Not sure exactly. It hurts a lot sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. A headache that started about two days ago, concentrated in the back of your head. And you said it hurts a lot sometimes – can you describe what “a lot” feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm... like... someone is hitting with a small hammer, but inside my head. Not all the time, just... comes and goes. And sometimes it feels... tight. Like a band around my head, very tight. Is that... does that make sense? I don’t know all the words, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mitchell. A hammering sensation and a tight band around your head – those are very descriptive. Is it constant, or does it come and go throughout the day?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Not always there. I can be… doing something, and it's okay. Then, I move my head… or I bend over… and bam. It hurts. Then maybe it goes away for a little while. It's hard to say... but it's worse when I try to do things. Like... working in the yard.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s triggered by movement, especially bending or working, and then it subsides. Has anything specific helped relieve the pain at all – like lying down, taking anything for it, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... lying down… sometimes. Not always. My wife... she used to give me… a little bottle. White pills. They helped a little, but… she is gone now. I don’t… I don’t remember what they were called. I haven't taken anything for it lately. Just trying to rest. It's not… easy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mitchell. Losing your wife must be incredibly difficult, and remembering medications can be hard in times like these. Let's try to figure out what's going on with your headache. Do you have any other symptoms along with it – like nausea, vomiting, dizziness, vision changes, or any numbness or weakness?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. No dizziness. My eyes… maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I always have trouble with my eyes. Old age, I think. No… nothing else. Just the headache. And… sometimes I feel tired. Very tired. But I am 90 years old, Doctor. I am supposed to be tired.
DOCTOR: That’s fair, Mitchell. It's good you’re aware of what’s typical for you. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. The doctor… a long time ago, he told me. He gave me… pills. Orange pills. I took them for a long time, but… I stopped. Too many pills, you know? And… sometimes I get… pains in my legs when I walk. Not always, but sometimes. The doctor said… something about the blood flow. I forget. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past, and some leg pain when you walk. Do you remember what the doctor said about the blood flow – was it something like cramping, or a different kind of pain?
PATIENT: It’s… a heavy feeling. Like weights on my legs. Not a sharp pain, more… a tired pain. And it hurts more when I walk uphill. Or walk for a long time. I have to stop and rest. It's… not so bad now, but… it used to be worse. I try not to walk too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy, tired feeling in your legs, worse with walking uphill or for long distances. And you used to take orange pills for your blood pressure, but stopped. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. My appendix, when I was young. That's all I remember. Just the appendix. And… when I broke my arm, a long time ago, working on the railroad. But that was… a long, long time ago. No… no other hospital stays. Just the appendix and the arm.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a broken arm in the past. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any trouble with allergies. I can eat anything. My wife… she was allergic to… cats. But I am not. No, no allergies. I eat everything she makes, even the spicy things!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mitchell. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Not even vitamins. I stopped taking everything after… after my wife passed. Too many pills. They didn't… help much anyway. Just rest. That's what I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. You seem like a very nice doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mitchell. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/85. Not critically high, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Your heart sounds a bit regular, though there's a slight murmur. Nothing immediately concerning, but we'll note it. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's not so strong anymore, you know? Old age. But I can squeeze.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell, that's good. It's understandable your grip isn't as strong as it used to be. Now, can you push down on my hands with your feet, like you're pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? It's a little hard... my legs are not so strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. I can see that. Your strength is a little reduced in both legs, as expected. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Can you stand up slowly for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whoa... careful now. It's a little hard to stand.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell, it’s good you have the chair for support. Your balance is a bit unsteady. Alright, Mitchell. That completes the basic exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, the headache could be related to a few things. It’s possible it’s a tension headache, which can be common with stress and age. The leg pain and reduced balance could be related to reduced blood flow, and we'll want to investigate that further. I recommend a couple of things. First, we should get a blood test to check your overall health and rule out any other causes for the headache and leg pain. Second, I want to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. Finally, I’d like you to see a vascular specialist – a doctor who specializes in blood vessels – to evaluate the blood flow in your legs. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… a lot, Doctor. Blood tests, MRI, a special doctor… It’s a bit overwhelming. But… if it will help, then okay. I trust you. But… will it be expensive? I don't have much money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mitchell. It does sound like a lot, and the cost is definitely something to consider. I’ll do my best to work with you to find affordable options. We can explore financial assistance programs and see if the hospital has any discounts available. I will also speak to the billing department and see what the estimated costs will be upfront, so there are no surprises. The blood tests are relatively inexpensive, and the MRI may have some financial assistance options. I’ll make sure to get you all the information you need before we proceed. We'll start with the blood tests, and then schedule the MRI and referral to the vascular specialist. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… better. Start with the blood tests, yes. And you will help with the money part? That would be very good. I don’t want to cause trouble. What do I need to do for the blood tests? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mitchell. I’ll help you with the financial aspects as much as I can. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, contact you tomorrow morning to schedule the blood tests. She’ll also provide you with information about the lab location, any necessary preparations , and the cost estimate. The lab is located just down the street, inside the hospital. You don't need to do anything special right now, just answer Maria’s call tomorrow. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you for listening. And thank you for helping with the money. You are a very kind doctor. I will wait for Maria’s call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mitchell. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before Maria calls. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
