DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I’m not one for wasting time, Doctor. I want a baby. A healthy baby. And I’m… not getting any younger. I want to know what I need to do to make sure everything goes smoothly. No complications, understand? I’ve read things, you know. Things can go wrong. I’d prefer to avoid that.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. That’s a very sensible approach, and I understand your concerns completely. Planning for a healthy pregnancy is excellent. To get a clear picture of your current health and what steps we should take, I'm going to ask you a number of questions. It may seem thorough, but it’s important to ensure the best possible outcome. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been seen by a physician regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly? Doctor, I run a bicycle repair shop. I fix things. People fix me when I break something. I haven’t exactly had time for… check-ups. Honestly, it's been years. Decades, probably. But I’m a strong woman. I eat well enough. And I don't drink. Unless it’s a good Tokaji, of course. That doesn't count. Now, is this relevant, or are you just trying to fill up your time?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Shteynberg. It is relevant, as a lack of prior medical history does impact our approach to planning for a pregnancy. While your strength and healthy lifestyle are certainly positive factors, it’s important to establish a baseline understanding of your current health status. To that end, could you tell me if you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I'm Hungarian, Doctor, we are the allergies. Dust, pollen, cats… I’ve built up a resistance. It’s a survival skill, really. I might sneeze a bit, but I don't react to things. Honestly, I think you’re asking a lot of unnecessary questions. Is there a test I can take? A scan? Something to actually do?
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for immediate action, Ms. Shteynberg. However, some foundational information is crucial before proceeding with any tests. Skipping steps could lead to inaccurate results or missed concerns. Let’s move on to current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting somewhere. Just a multivitamin. Something I picked up at the grocery store. And sometimes, when my back aches from bending over bicycles all day, I take ibuprofen. The regular kind. Nothing fancy. Do you really need a list of brands? This is ridiculous. Are you a doctor, or an inquisitor?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. Knowing about the multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen use is helpful. It’s important to consider even seemingly minor medications when planning for pregnancy. Now, let's talk about your past medical history a bit further. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Once. A very long time ago. When I was a child. Appendicitis. It was… unpleasant. They removed it. That’s all you need to know. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m back in school, reciting my life story. I thought doctors diagnosed things, not interrogated people. Are we getting any closer to actually doing something, or are you planning to ask about my childhood pets next?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Shteynberg. Knowing about the appendectomy is important. And you are right to expect a proactive approach. We will get to the testing phase shortly. However, understanding your family history is also crucial, as certain conditions can be hereditary. Do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or any genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Family history? My grandmother lived to be ninety-two, smoking unfiltered cigarettes and eating lard. My grandfather drank pálinka every day of his life and still rode a horse until he was eighty. They were… robust people. Beyond that? Honestly, no. A few aches and pains. The usual. They weren't exactly running to doctors every five minutes. This is getting absurd. Are you trying to find something wrong with me? Because frankly, I feel perfectly healthy. A little tired, perhaps, but that’s all. .
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. That is certainly a testament to your family's resilience. While a history of longevity is encouraging, it doesn't negate the need for a thorough assessment. Given your desire to conceive, and your limited medical history, I'd like to conduct a physical examination and order some baseline blood work. This will allow us to evaluate your overall health, check for any potential underlying issues, and ensure you're in the best possible condition for a healthy pregnancy. Would that be acceptable to you?
