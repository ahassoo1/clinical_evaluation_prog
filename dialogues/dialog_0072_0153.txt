DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 69 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, 69… feels older some days, I suppose. Well, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure why I'm here. Something about…a check-up? For…work? I do a lot of ushering, ticket-taking, that sort of thing. They said I needed something… a clearance, I think? It's all a bit fuzzy, you see.
DOCTOR: A work clearance, alright. It sounds like your employer requires a medical evaluation to ensure you're fit to perform your duties. That's quite responsible of them. Regardless, we can certainly perform a comprehensive assessment. To start, can you tell me about any specific health concerns you have?
PATIENT: Concerns… Hmm. Not really, not that I can recall. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so things slip my mind. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I suppose my knees ache a bit after standing for long periods…but that's just old age, isn't it? Nothing a little rub doesn't fix. I don’t… I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Honestly, I don’t even remember the last time.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no significant complaints at this time, but some general fatigue and knee discomfort. And you haven't been to a doctor regularly for quite some time. We'll need to gather a thorough history to get a clearer picture. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… that sounds serious. Let me think… I… I don't believe so. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, all my life. Maybe a bad cold now and then, the usual things. My ex-wife, bless her soul, she always handled the doctor’s appointments. She was very organized. I never really had to worry about it. I think I had… the measles as a kid? But that was a long, long time ago. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Alright. No major medical diagnoses that you're aware of. Measles as a child is relevant history, though not a current concern. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. I… I broke my arm once when I was a teenager, climbing a tree. But it wasn't serious. They just put it in a cast. Didn’t need to go into the hospital, just the emergency room for a bit. Other than that… nothing. I’m a very careful man, you see. I avoid risks.
DOCTOR: No surgeries or hospitalizations, just a broken arm as a teenager. Good. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke—anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… that’s a difficult question. I… I wasn’t very close to my family. My parents passed away a long time ago, and I don't really know much about their medical history. I had some cousins, but we didn’t see each other often. I believe my mother… she had high blood pressure, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I don't recall the details. And my father… I’m afraid I don’t know. It’s all very vague, you see. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Limited family history, then. It’s unfortunate, but we'll proceed as best we can. Let's move on to your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, no, nothing at all. I don’t believe in taking pills unless absolutely necessary. I try to stay healthy through diet and exercise, you know? Well, moderate exercise. Mostly walking. And I eat my vegetables. No, I don’t take anything regularly. Just… sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take an aspirin. But that’s it. I pride myself on avoiding medication.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, occasional aspirin for headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. I mean, I don't like shellfish, but that's a preference, not an allergy. And I've never had a problem with bee stings or pollen or anything like that. I seem to be pretty fortunate in that regard, too. Maybe I just have a strong constitution.
DOCTOR: Very well. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed, I need to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh… my. Well, Doctor, I used to smoke, a long time ago. When I was younger. But I quit… oh, must be thirty years ago. It wasn't good for my health, you see. As for alcohol… I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner. A small glass, mind you. And… No, I don’t… I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. Never have. I'm a respectable man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Former smoker, occasional glass of wine, no recreational drug use. Now, Mr. Krahn, we've covered a lot of ground. Before I conduct a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about your health?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well… my ex-wife used to say I worried too much. Maybe that's a health problem. It's a family trait, you see. And… I sometimes have trouble sleeping. But it's nothing serious. Just… a bit of insomnia now and then. Nothing a warm glass of milk doesn’t fix. Honestly, Doctor, I think that’s it. I’m really just a very… ordinary man. I just want to be sure I’m healthy enough to keep doing my job.
DOCTOR: Alright. Anxiety and occasional insomnia. Mr. Krahn, while I appreciate you sharing this information, it's important to note that these symptoms can sometimes indicate underlying medical conditions. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health. Please lie down on the table. We’ll start with your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Oh dear. Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. But please be gentle. My knees aren't what they used to be. And… I don't like doctors poking around. But, alright. Let's get it over with.
