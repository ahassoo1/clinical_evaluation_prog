DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Frankly, I don't have a great deal of time for this. It’s…a bit embarrassing, really. Something’s going on with my mouth. It’s white, and uncomfortable. I haven’t been sleeping well because of it.
DOCTOR: "Embarrassing" or not, Mr. Schieber, your health is the priority. I assure you, I’ve seen it all. “Uncomfortable” is rather vague, though. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Well, it hurts to eat, especially anything sweet. And it feels… rough, like sandpaper, almost. Honestly, it’s just… irritating. Look, I’m a faller, you know? I need to be on my feet, working. I don't have time for mouth problems. Is it something serious? Because if it isn’t, I'd like to know now so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: "A faller," right. And you need to be 'on your feet.' I understand the importance of your work, Mr. Schieber. But rushing a diagnosis is rarely helpful, and could potentially cause more downtime. It sounds like you’re describing some discomfort with eating, particularly sweets, and a rough texture in your mouth. Is this a recent development, or has this been going on for a while?
PATIENT: It’s… recent, I suppose. Maybe a week? I hadn't really paid much attention until it started getting worse. My wife kept telling me I should see someone, but, well, you know how it is. Men don’t usually bother with these things unless they have to. She's a worrier, that one. But now it’s interfering with my appetite, so… here I am. Is it contagious? I don't want to be passing anything around on the job.
DOCTOR: Contagious is a legitimate concern, certainly. It’s unlikely, but we need to rule things out. A week is fairly recent. Has anything changed in your diet lately?
PATIENT: Changed in my diet? No, not really. Same as always, more or less. Lots of protein, you know. Need the energy for the work. I do… occasionally have a little sweet treat with my coffee, if that’s what you mean. My wife brings me pastries sometimes. But nothing excessive. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if this is something I need to worry about, and if I can just… take something for it and get back to work. I'm not one for prolonged medical visits.
DOCTOR: “Not one for prolonged medical visits…” I understand, Mr. Schieber. But a proper assessment is necessary. The pastries could be relevant. Alright. I’m going to need to take a look inside your mouth. Please open wide for me.
PATIENT: Just… try to be quick, please. And try not to poke too much. It's rather sensitive. Honestly, this is all a waste of time, probably. It's just some irritation. I've dealt with worse injuries on the job.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see the white patches you’re referring to. They appear somewhat raised, and there's some redness around the edges. It could be a mild case of oral thrush, or possibly a form of lichen planus. However, given your recent history, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to need to take a swab from the affected area for a lab analysis. It will help us identify the cause definitively. It's a quick, painless procedure. And while we're waiting for the results, I would advise you to avoid sugary foods and drinks, as they can exacerbate the irritation.
PATIENT: A swab? More waiting? Look, Doctor, I appreciate your… thoroughness, but honestly, is a swab absolutely necessary? I mean, can't you just prescribe something for it? Some kind of mouthwash, perhaps? I really don't have the time for lab analyses and waiting for results. I have a job to do. Is there anything… quicker?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis is irresponsible and potentially harmful. You may be dealing with something more serious than a simple irritation, and treating it incorrectly could lead to complications. While I understand your concerns about time, your health is the priority. The swab is a relatively quick procedure, and the results will give us the information we need to determine the best course of action. Furthermore, without knowing the exact cause, I cannot recommend any specific treatment. I'm not going to prescribe something "just in case" – that's not how medicine works. Do you consent to the swab, or would you prefer I refer you to a specialist for further evaluation?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Do the swab. Just… get it over with. But if this takes more than a couple of days, I’m going to be very unhappy. And frankly, if it turns out to be nothing, I’m expecting a full refund for this… inconvenience. Honestly, this is ridiculous. But my wife would kill me if I didn't get it checked out. Just hurry up, please. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab should have results back within 48-72 hours. I will have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, continue to avoid sugary foods and drinks. And maintain good oral hygiene. I've documented everything in your chart, including your concerns about lost work time. Once we have the results, we can discuss your options and formulate a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s enough questions for now. Just… get it over with, please. I appreciate your… efforts, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schieber. You’ll receive a call as soon as the lab results are available. Have a… productive day. .
