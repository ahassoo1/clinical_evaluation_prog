DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Belan, let's get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? My wife thought it was a good idea. She worries too much. I wanted to get tested for, you know… the HIV thing. Just to keep the peace, really. Everything's fine, I assure you. I just… she reads a lot of things online.
DOCTOR: Online, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! All sorts of nonsense. Articles about… well, everything. It’s a bit much, if you ask me. I mean, I’m careful. Very careful. I don’t need to be tested, but here we are. Do you need a list of her favourite websites or something? It might save us both some time.
DOCTOR: No, that won’t be necessary. Look, Mr. Belan, even if you feel perfectly healthy – and you say you do – routine testing is… sensible. It's good practice. Let’s just get it done, alright?
PATIENT: Sensible for who? Honestly. Fine, get it done. But don't tell me it’s because I need it. It’s just… to humour her. What exactly does it involve? Is it going to take all day? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: It involves a blood draw. Standard procedure. And no, it won’t take all day. Five minutes, maybe. We'll send it off to the lab. Now, have you ever been tested before?
PATIENT: No. Never. And frankly, I doubt I will again after this. It feels a bit… unnecessary, if you ask me. But, to answer your question directly, no. First time. Hopefully last. Will it hurt? I’m not a fan of needles.
DOCTOR: A little pinch. Most people barely feel it. We use a small needle. Honestly, it’s less painful than a mosquito bite. Alright, let’s move on. Any allergies to latex or anything like that?
PATIENT: Latex? Goodness, no. I work with my hands, you know. Builds up a tolerance, I suppose. No allergies of any kind, actually. I'm quite robust, thank you very much. Are you going to ask me about… risky behaviour now? Because that’s just… unnecessary. My wife already interrogated me enough on that topic.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Belan, this is a medical consultation. It’s standard questioning. I need to get a complete history. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Must you? Really? Yes, I'm married. That should be enough information, shouldn't it? I mean, it’s not like I'm running around… well, you know. It’s a bit insulting, frankly, to even ask. My wife’s anxieties are bad enough, I don't need a doctor poking around in my personal life. Can we just get this test done? I assure you, my blood is perfectly clean.
DOCTOR: Fine. Any current medications?
PATIENT: Just the usual. A little something for my blood pressure, nothing serious. Doctor Sharma prescribed it last year. Small dose. And… occasionally some paracetamol for a headache. That's it. Honestly, I’m a very healthy man. It’s just… she worries. Is this going to be a long list of questions, or can we finally proceed to the actual test? I have a garden to tend, you know. Things don't grow themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No surgical history?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've avoided hospitals my entire life, and I intend to keep it that way. Not a fan of germs, you see. And… the waiting rooms. Dreadful. So, no surgery. Ever. Can we please get this over with? I'm starting to feel quite lightheaded just from answering all these questions. It’s the stress, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Nurse will be in shortly to take a blood sample. She’s very good. Just relax. And try not to faint. We have things to do, too, you know.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… please tell her to be quick about it. And gentle. Honestly, the whole thing is rather… demeaning. I suppose I should be grateful it’s not a full physical. I’m going to sit over there, out of the way. Don't expect pleasant conversation. I'm not much for small talk, especially after an interrogation. Just... let me know when it's over. .
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Don't wander off.
