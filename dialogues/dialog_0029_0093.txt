DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, uh, right. Sleep, mostly. And… feeling a bit run down, I suppose. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur these days. Not sure where to even begin, to be frank. It's just...not great.
DOCTOR: Okay, "not great" is a good place to start. Let’s try to untangle things a bit. When did you start noticing these sleep issues and feeling run down?
PATIENT: Ugh, dates… always with the dates. Honestly? A while. Months, definitely. Maybe… since last winter? Everything feels kind of smushed together, you know? It's not like a sudden thing, just… gradually worse. After… well, you can probably see on the paperwork. It's all a bit of a mess, that whole situation.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see some notes here. It seems you experienced a rather… stressful event recently. And you’re saying the sleep issues and fatigue began around that time?
PATIENT: Stressful is… putting it mildly. Look, I don’t really do talking about it. It’s… done. Best left alone, if you don’t mind. But yeah, probably. Everything felt off after… after it happened. Not sleeping properly, can’t be bothered with much, you know? Just… existing, really. Is that enough information? I'm not sure what you need to know.
DOCTOR: I understand. You don't have to go into detail about anything you're not comfortable with. So, focusing on the symptoms then. When you say "not sleeping properly," can you tell me a bit more about how you're not sleeping?
PATIENT: Right, good. Symptoms. Easier. Well… I wake up a lot. Like, a lot. Not just getting up to use the loo or anything. Just… awake. Staring at the ceiling. Thinking. And then I can't get back to sleep. And when I do sleep, it doesn't feel… restorative, you know? Like I haven't actually rested. I just feel… tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent awakenings and non-restorative sleep. Do you have any trouble falling asleep initially, or is it mostly staying asleep that's the issue?
PATIENT: Falling asleep isn't too bad, usually. I'm pretty knackered by the end of the day, so I tend to drift off alright. It's the middle of the night that’s the killer. I'll be out for a few hours, maybe four, and then… just wide awake. And then I’m tossing and turning for ages, trying to get back to sleep, but it never really happens properly. It’s… frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the sleep issues and fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Not really. I mean, I'm a bit… irritable, I suppose. Snappy with people. My apprentice, poor lad, gets the worst of it. But I’ve always been a bit… particular. Nothing major, really. Appetite's alright. No aches and pains. Just… tired. And not sleeping. Is that enough? I'm not much for complaining, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, irritability, but otherwise generally feeling okay physically. No fever, no chills, no weight loss?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Definitely no chills or fever. Weight… I haven't really noticed a change, to be honest. I eat when I'm hungry, don't really pay much attention to it. I'm tall, so… I need to eat, right? Look, I fix instruments, I don't weigh myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never really been one for pills, if I can avoid it. Just the occasional painkiller if I get a bad back from bending over instruments all day, but that’s it. Otherwise, no. I prefer a good strong tea, if that counts. Does that make me a bad patient?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. A good strong tea is perfectly acceptable. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s it. Nothing serious. And no, I don’t react badly to any food that I know of. Honestly, I'm pretty robust. I spend all day in a dusty workshop, breathing in wood shavings and varnish. If I was allergic to something, I'd know about it by now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Redfern. Given your history and symptoms, it sounds like you're likely experiencing some degree of insomnia, potentially related to stress. To rule out any other underlying causes, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, that sort of thing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Insomnia, huh? Sounds… fancy. A physical exam? Fine, I suppose. As long as it doesn't involve needles. And no prodding. I'm a bit sensitive, you see. Instruments are fine, bodies… not so much.
DOCTOR: No needles, I promise. And I’ll be gentle. If you could just sit here for me. First, I'll check your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, let's check your reflexes. Good. Those are normal as well. And finally, I'll just take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Overall, everything seems physically normal.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Probably just the stress. I get a bit worked up sometimes, especially when dealing with difficult customers. Instruments are one thing, people… another. So, what does all this mean then? Am I dying?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Redfern, you are not dying. Your blood pressure is only mildly elevated, and as you said, likely related to stress. And the physical exam was normal, which is good. Given your history and the exam findings, I believe your sleep issues are likely due to stress and anxiety. It's very common, especially after a traumatic event. We can try a few things. I recommend we start with sleep hygiene – things like a regular sleep schedule, a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed. We can also explore some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises or meditation.
PATIENT: Sleep hygiene? Sounds… complicated. And meditation? I can barely sit still for five minutes, let alone clear my head. Deep breathing… I suppose I can try. But honestly, doctor, I'm a practical man. I fix things with my hands. All this… thinking and relaxing… it doesn't come naturally. Is there… anything else? A pill, perhaps? Just to get me through?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Redfern. It's not always easy to change habits, and it's perfectly normal to want a quick fix. However, I generally prefer to start with non-pharmacological options whenever possible, as they have fewer side effects. We could discuss medication, but I would prefer to try the sleep hygiene and relaxation techniques for a couple of weeks first. If those aren't effective, we can revisit the possibility of a short course of a sleep aid. Would you be willing to try that approach?
PATIENT: Fine. A couple of weeks. But if I'm still staring at the ceiling, I'm expecting something stronger. You've got my word. Now, what does this "sleep hygiene" involve exactly? And don’t tell me to count sheep. I tried that once. Didn't work.
DOCTOR: No sheep counting, I promise. Here's a handout outlining some basic sleep hygiene principles. It includes things like maintaining a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends; creating a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath or reading a book; making sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool; and avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed. Also, try to avoid screen time for at least an hour before bed. It sounds like a lot, but it’s about creating a consistent environment for sleep. We can also discuss some relaxation techniques during your next appointment. Perhaps some deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation. Are you comfortable with this plan?
PATIENT: Regular schedule… dark, quiet… I can manage that, I suppose. The bedroom is already pretty quiet. The workshop's louder, to be honest. No screens before bed… that’ll be difficult. I like to catch up on the news. But alright. I’ll try. Two weeks. And then… we talk about the pills again?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Two weeks, and then we'll reassess. If you're not seeing any improvement, we can discuss medication options. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I think that covers it. Just… try not to make me come back. I’m not a fan of hospitals, or… whatever this place is. And please, no more prodding. Alright then. I’ll see myself out.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Redfern. Thank you for coming in. I wish you all the best, and please, do take care of yourself. Don’t hesitate to call if you need anything.
