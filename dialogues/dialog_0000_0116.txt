DOCTOR: Right, Genette Bilstein, 84 years old. Hello, Ms. Bilstein. I’m Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my legs. They bother me at night. Cramps, mostly. Quite painful, they are. I don’t rightly recall when it started started, just that it’s been going on for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Leg cramps at night, you say. “For a bit now” isn’t terribly specific, is it?
PATIENT: No, dear, it isn’t. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Months, maybe? Or… longer? I truly can’t say for certain. It feels like a long time, that’s all. They just… tighten up. Real bad.
DOCTOR: Right. And where exactly do you feel these cramps?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… mostly in my calves, I think. The back of my legs. Sometimes it feels like it’s higher up, towards my knees, but mostly the calves. Both legs, usually. Not always at the same time, but both. Is that helpful? I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate. Do they wake you up from sleep, these cramps?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, they do. Quite often. I’ll be sleeping soundly, and then… whoosh, a terrible tightening. I have to get up and… well, just try to walk it off, mostly. Or stretch, if I can. It’s difficult, sometimes. It takes a bit for them to go away.
DOCTOR: And when you say "stretch," what kind of stretching do you find helps, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, just… pointing my toes. Or trying to, anyway. It's hard to explain. I try to straighten my leg out and pull my toes back towards my shin. That sometimes helps a little. And… walking, like I said. Just pacing around the room. I don't know if that does anything, but it feels better than sitting still.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these cramps?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a good question. I haven’t… not that I recall, no. I haven’t been doing anything different. I mostly stay in the house, you see. Read, watch a little television… things like that. I don't do much heavy lifting or anything. It just seems to happen… randomly. Perhaps it's the weather? It's been a bit warm lately.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And are you currently taking anything for these cramps?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Nothing at all. I haven’t been to a doctor about this before, so… no medicines. I used to have a little bottle of something for my arthritis, but I don't take that anymore either. It didn't seem to help much anyway. I mostly just… suffer through it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s go through some other things, just to rule things out. Do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had a bit of trouble with my heart, years ago. They put a little… thing in it, I think. A pacemaker, maybe? It’s been a long time. And… I have arthritis, in my hands mostly. And my knees. Like I mentioned. Oh, and I used to have trouble with my blood pressure, but it seems alright now. Is that enough? I’m afraid I’m not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Right. A pacemaker, arthritis, and a history of high blood pressure. Good. And are you taking any medications now for any of those conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. For my heart, I take a little white pill. Just one, every morning. And sometimes, if my arthritis is really bothering me, I’ll take something over-the-counter… ibuprofen, I think it is? But not very often. Honestly, Doctor, I try not to take too many pills. They never seem to do much good anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not that I know of, no. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I used to be able to take anything, but my daughter always warned me to be careful. She was a nurse, you see. Always very cautious. I don’t think I’ve ever had an allergy, though. No, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s move on to your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has similar problems with leg cramps?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a hard question. My family… we didn’t talk much about those things, you see. Not really. I had a brother, but he passed away a long time ago. And a sister, but I haven’t seen her in years. I don’t recall anyone ever mentioning leg cramps, no. But that doesn’t mean they didn’t have them, does it? My memory is just… not what it used to be. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s… sufficient. Now, I’m going to take a quick look at your legs, if that’s alright. Just to see if there’s anything obvious going on. Could you lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That's perfectly alright. Just tell me what you want me to do. I’ll try my best. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with this leg. Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, I can feel that. A little bit cold, perhaps? It's alright, though. Not painful, just… cool. Is that what you're checking for? I don’t feel anything… unusual. Just my old bones, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your pulses are a bit weak, but present. And your reflexes are… diminished, as expected for your age. Muscle tone is also reduced. No swelling or obvious signs of injury. Skin is a little dry, though. Similar findings on this side. Pulses are weak, reflexes diminished, and dry skin. It doesn't appear to be anything overtly structural causing the cramps.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That doesn't sound very good, does it? Weak pulses… that sounds worrying. Is that serious, Doctor? Should I be concerned? I don't want to be a bother, but… is my heart alright? It's been a long time since anyone checked it properly.
DOCTOR: It’s… not necessarily alarming at this point, Ms. Bilstein, but it does warrant further investigation. Weak pulses can indicate peripheral artery disease, which is common in people with a history of heart problems. The reduced reflexes and muscle tone are also expected with age, but we need to rule out other causes. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your electrolytes and kidney function. Those can sometimes contribute to cramping. I’d also like to order an ankle-brachial index, or ABI, which will measure the blood flow in your legs. And, given your history, a follow-up with your cardiologist is advisable.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So many tests. My daughter always said I worry too much. A cardiologist… that sounds expensive. I don’t have insurance, you see. I don’t want to be a burden. Are these tests very important, Doctor? Can’t we just… try something else? Perhaps a different pill? Or a cream? I’m just afraid of all the fuss and… the cost.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Bilstein. And yes, the cost is a valid worry. The blood tests aren't overly expensive, but the ABI and cardiologist visit… they can be. The blood tests will help rule out some of the simpler causes of your cramping. Without knowing the cause, I can't prescribe something that will effectively address the problem. We need to establish what’s going on first. I can write you a prescription for a potassium supplement in the meantime. Sometimes, a low potassium level can contribute to muscle cramps. But it's not a long-term solution, and it won’t address underlying issues. As for the cardiologist, I can refer you to a cardiologist who offers a sliding fee scale, if that's an option. We'll do our best to find something affordable. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that sounds a bit better, Doctor. A sliding fee scale… that would be a blessing. And potassium… I suppose I can try that. My daughter always said bananas were good for potassium, but I haven't had a banana in ages. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. Perhaps we can start with the blood tests and potassium, and see how that goes. I don't want to rush into anything… expensive. Can you tell me where I need to go for the tests? And how long it will take? I have to arrange for someone to take me, you see.
DOCTOR: Here's the requisition for the blood tests. You can go to the lab at St. Luke's Hospital on Elm Street. They're open Monday through Friday, 8 AM to 5 PM. It shouldn’t take more than an hour, including the wait time. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. And I'll have the nurse give you a list of local cardiologists who offer sliding fee scales, and the contact information for the scheduler. We'll take it one step at a time, Ms. Bilstein. Don't worry. Once we have the blood test results, we’ll have a better understanding of what’s going on, and we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's all. You've been very helpful. I appreciate your patience. I’ll make an appointment for the blood tests tomorrow. And I’ll ask the nurse for the cardiologist list. Thank you again, Doctor Batara. It's a relief to finally be doing something about this.
