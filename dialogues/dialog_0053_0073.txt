DOCTOR: Right, Ms. Woodring. Welcome. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s been…a mess. Diarrhea. Non-stop. And nothing the usual stuff seems to do anything. I’ve tried…well, a lot of things. It's embarrassing to even talk about, but here we are. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: “A mess,” you say. Well, that’s…helpful. “A lot of things” isn’t a diagnosis, unfortunately. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not a doctor, okay? I just know what works…or doesn't work. I've taken…pepto, I guess. And some herbal tea my aunt gave me. It's been going on for…a week? Maybe longer? I lost track. It's just...watery. And frequent. Is that good enough for you? I really don't have time for this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. “Watery and frequent.” A week or longer. And you've self-treated. Okay. Before we dismiss anything, we need to establish a baseline. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Definitely not. I would notice that. Look, I'm a painter, I'm used to dealing with…things. This is just…my stomach acting up. It's probably something I ate. Honestly, I think it's just stress, too. Being widowed isn't exactly relaxing, you know? It's probably just nerves.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly contribute, Ms. Woodring, but we still need to rule out other possibilities. Have you had any fever, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting along with this diarrhea?
PATIENT: No fever. Maybe a little tummy ache now and then, but nothing serious. I wouldn’t call it pain, exactly. And no, I haven’t thrown up. I just…feel weak. And exhausted. It's hard to get anything done when you’re constantly running to the bathroom. It’s ridiculous. I'm losing weight, too, I think. But honestly, who’s counting?
DOCTOR: “Who’s counting?
PATIENT: Look, it's not like I’m deliberately not keeping track. It's just… not my priority right now. I have jobs to finish, paintings to deliver. This whole thing is just a huge inconvenience, to be perfectly frank. Can we just…get a prescription or something? I really need to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, with all due respect, “sorting it out” requires more than simply handing out a prescription. You're losing weight and experiencing prolonged diarrhea. We need to understand the cause. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Traveled? No. Not been anywhere except between jobsites, and all within the state. Look, I paint houses, okay? Not exactly jet-setting around the world. I eat mostly sandwiches and coffee. That's about it. Honestly, I'm starting to think you’re just trying to waste my time. I should have just stayed home and tried some more tea.
DOCTOR: So, sandwiches and coffee. No travel. And prolonged diarrhea. Very well. Let's do a quick examination, then. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and check for dehydration. It's a standard procedure, Ms. Woodring, and it will help me determine the best course of action. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Look, I really don't have time for that. I’m perfectly fine. I just need something to stop it, okay? This whole thing is…demeaning. I haven’t even had breakfast yet, and now you want me to…lie down? No thank you. I think I’ll just go. I’m sure it will pass. Honestly. It always does. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration, but I cannot simply prescribe medication without a proper assessment. Ignoring this could lead to complications, such as severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. I strongly advise you to reconsider. If you refuse the examination, I recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. I'll write you a note for that. However, I must document your refusal of examination in your chart. Would you like me to write the referral now?
