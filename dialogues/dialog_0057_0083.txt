DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a… pleasure, I suppose. Look, it’s not a problem problem, you understand? Just… a little something to lift the spirits. My niece, she thinks I need a… a card. A “get well” card. From a doctor. Seems silly, but she’s very insistent.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, we certainly can document a visit if that will help your niece feel better. Sometimes, peace of mind is important. So, even though it's not a specific medical issue, we can still go through a general check-up to make sure everything is as it should be. That way, I can confidently say everything looks good. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A check-up? Hmm. I don’t see why not, I suppose. I feel fine, mostly. Old, of course, but that’s just… life, you know? But if it makes the card official, then yes. A check-up sounds… acceptable. I just don’t want a lot of poking and prodding. I’m not a fan of that.
DOCTOR: Of course. We can definitely tailor the check-up to your comfort level. We’ll start with some basic questions about your overall health, then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and maybe a quick look in your ears and throat. We can skip anything you’re really uncomfortable with. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, I worked with boilers my whole life. Stationary engineer, you see? Hot, loud, dirty work. Never had much trouble, though. A few aches and pains, what you’d expect. Divorced, years ago. Doesn’t really factor in, does it? Medicare takes care of things now. Nothing major, I haven’t been sick sick. Just… getting older. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. The boiler work is good to know – we’ll want to keep that in mind. And no major illnesses, that’s excellent. We’ll definitely make a note of the Medicare coverage. To clarify, have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Now you’re starting to sound like my niece. All these questions. No. No high blood pressure. No sugar sickness. My heart’s fine, always been strong. Arthritis… maybe a little stiffness in the mornings, but that's just old age, I tell you. Not a condition. I worked hard my whole life, Doctor, I don’t need a list of things wrong with me. You're making me nervous.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Kammer. I don’t mean to make you nervous. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your health, and those questions are standard procedure. I promise, I’m not trying to find anything wrong, just ruling things out. Let's try a different approach. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… once. A long time ago. Broke my arm when I was a young man. Foolish accident. Fell off a ladder. They set it, and I was fine. That was… maybe forty years ago? No surgeries. Never needed ‘em. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I fix things, I don’t need fixing. Honestly, this is a bit much for a “get well” card, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. And you’re right, it may be a bit extensive for this situation. We can certainly keep this brief. Just a few more quick questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam, and I can document everything. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. I ate everything put in front of me, especially growing up. Dust, dirt, hard work - those never bothered me. Fancy pills and powders? No, thank you. I prefer to keep things simple. Strong constitution, you see? Doesn’t need coddling. Is this finally getting to the end?
DOCTOR: Yes, we’re almost there. Just one last question, and then the quick exam. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No. None. Never have. Never needed ‘em. I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's it. I believe in letting the body heal itself. All this talk of pills and conditions... It's making my head ache now, actually. Let’s just get this over with, Doctor. The card, the exam… whatever you need to do. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. No medications, that’s good to know. Let’s do a quick exam, and then I can document everything and you’ll have your note for your niece. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? I always had good lungs. Spent my whole life yelling over the noise of the boilers, you see. Good practice. Now, hurry up, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular and strong, and your lungs are clear. I'm not hearing any wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 130/80 – that’s a little elevated, but not concerning given your age and a bit of stress during the questions. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Open wide and say “ah.”
PATIENT: Ah. There. Get it over with. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’ve never had so much attention paid to me in my life, and most of it involves finding things wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Your ears are clear, and your throat looks healthy. Everything appears normal. Alright, Mr. Kammer, everything checks out. Heart and lungs sound good, ears and throat are clear, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated but not concerning. Given your history and the exam findings, I wouldn’t be concerned about any specific medical issues. I can certainly write a note stating that you’ve had a check-up today and everything appears healthy, which should satisfy your niece. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes! Please, Doctor. That would be… wonderful. A note. A proper, official note. Then maybe she’ll leave me alone. All this fuss over a little card… Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… thorough. Perhaps a little too thorough, but thorough nonetheless. Let’s get that note, and then I can be on my way.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I’m glad we could address your niece's concerns. Here you go. This states that you had a comprehensive check-up today, August 2nd, 2025, and that your examination was within normal limits. I’ve also noted the slightly elevated blood pressure and recommended maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Perfect. Official, proper, and… reassuring. Yes, this will do nicely. No, Doctor, nothing else. Just… thank you. For everything. And tell your niece, if you see her, that I appreciate her concern, even if it is a little… much. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a garden to tend to. And maybe a nap to take.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. Enjoy your garden and your nap. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day. .
