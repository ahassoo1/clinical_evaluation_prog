DOCTOR: Good morning, Keoni. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been… going to the bathroom rather frequently lately. It’s just… more often than usual, I suppose. I’m not entirely sure why, and it’s starting to become a bit disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, Keoni, no need to be embarrassed at all. It's good you're addressing it. Frequent urination can have a number of causes, and we'll figure out what's going on. When you say "more often than usual," could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Let me see… it’s difficult to quantify, exactly. I… don’t really keep track of these things. But, I’d say… perhaps every hour or two during the day? Maybe even a little more frequently than that if I’m drinking a lot of water. At night… thankfully, it’s not too bad, usually only once. But during the day, it feels… constant. I’m sorry, this is very vague, isn't it? I don't have a good memory for specifics.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, Keoni, you’re doing perfectly fine. Every hour or two is definitely more frequent than average. And it's helpful to know it's better at night. Now, besides the increased frequency, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Well, no pain, thankfully. And no fever. I have been feeling a bit… tired lately, but I just assumed that was from… well, life, I suppose. I haven’t noticed any blood in my urine, or any discomfort while I’m… you know. Just the constant need to go. And, perhaps a little… urgency sometimes? It’s not always a comfortable feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or fever is good. Fatigue can be a symptom of many things, so we'll keep that in mind. And the urgency you describe is also helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant medical problems… That’s a difficult question. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, if that counts. And… I broke my arm once, badly. But in terms of ongoing health issues… I don’t really recall anything major. I had a rather unpleasant divorce a few years ago, but I don’t think that qualifies as a medical problem. I’ve always considered myself to be quite healthy, generally. Perhaps a bit run down lately, but…
DOCTOR: No, a broken arm and tonsil removal don’t count as ongoing medical problems. And I understand that a divorce can be incredibly stressful, but you’re right, that’s not a medical issue. Alright. And how about your family?
PATIENT: My family… That’s… complicated. My mother passed away several years ago. She… well, she had some heart trouble, I believe. And my father… we aren’t very close. He lives quite far away, and I haven’t seen him in years. As for any family history of… urinary problems, or anything similar? I honestly couldn’t say. We didn’t really discuss those things. I don’t… I don't really know much about their medical backgrounds.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That's alright, it's common for families not to discuss medical history openly. Heart trouble in your mother is good to know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, certainly not. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And I most definitely do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a very… quiet life, generally. Mostly work, and a bit of gardening. I try to stay healthy, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Keoni. A quiet and healthy lifestyle is a great foundation. Now, one last question before we move on to a physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, I don’t believe so. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about it. I try to avoid taking any pills if I can. I haven't needed anything regularly for quite some time. I don't have any allergies to medications that I'm aware of either. I... I really try to be mindful of what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No regular medications or allergies is helpful information. Alright, Keoni. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll just listen to your abdomen, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’ll do my best to be still.
DOCTOR: Okay, Keoni. Your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual sounds. Your reflexes are within normal limits, and your blood pressure is 120/80, which is excellent. I’m going to perform a quick neurological exam just to be thorough. This just involves testing some basic things, like your coordination and balance. Then, I’d like to collect a urine sample. That will help us rule out a urinary tract infection or other problems. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A neurological exam and a urine sample… absolutely. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary to figure out what’s going on. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Keoni, everything looks good neurologically. Now, if you could please collect a urine sample for me. There's a restroom just down the hall. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup mid-stream. Please be careful. I'll be right here when you’re finished. Let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A mid-stream sample… I believe I remember instructions from a previous visit, but thank you for the reminder. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Keoni. I’ll send this off to the lab for analysis. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, based on your history and the exam, I suspect we’re dealing with either an overactive bladder, or possibly a urinary tract infection, although your lack of fever makes that less likely. To be on the safe side, I’m going to start you on a course of cranberry supplements. They can help prevent bacterial growth and may alleviate some of your symptoms. I also recommend increasing your fluid intake – aim for at least eight glasses of water a day – but avoid drinking anything caffeinated or alcoholic. We’ll follow up once the lab results come back, and if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Cranberry supplements… that sounds… sensible. And increasing my water intake, yes, I can certainly do that. No fever is reassuring, and I appreciate you considering both possibilities. Um… one question, if you don’t mind. Will the cranberry supplements interact with anything? I don’t take any regular medications, but… I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, as I mentioned. And… are there any side effects I should be aware of? I don't want to inadvertently cause any problems.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Keoni. It's always wise to be cautious. Cranberry supplements can interact with warfarin, a blood thinner, but since you're not taking any medications, that's not a concern. As for side effects, they are generally mild. Some people experience mild stomach upset or diarrhea, but that's uncommon. The main thing is to start with a lower dose and see how you tolerate it. I recommend starting with one capsule a day, and if you don’t experience any side effects, you can increase it to two. I'm also going to give you a handout with more information about overactive bladder, including lifestyle changes and other potential treatment options. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Keoni?
PATIENT: That's very reassuring, Doctor. Starting with a lower dose… that sounds prudent. And the handout is much appreciated. No, I think that covers everything, actually. You’ve been very thorough, and I feel much more at ease now. Thank you for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I truly appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Keoni. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, please contact the office immediately. We’ll follow up once the lab results are back. Here are the handouts. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Vodzak. You have a good day as well. I will be in touch if anything changes.
