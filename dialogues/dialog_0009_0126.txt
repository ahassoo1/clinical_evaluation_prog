DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, to be frank, I’ve been feeling… unusually thirsty, and hungry, lately. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to become quite bothersome. I just feel like I can’t seem to quench either, no matter how much I drink or eat.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds concerning, Christen. A few weeks of increased thirst and hunger – that’s definitely something we should investigate. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about how much more thirsty and hungry you are?
PATIENT: Well, it's… difficult to quantify, to be honest. I find myself drinking a significantly larger bottle of water each day – easily double what I used to. And I'm eating… larger portions, and still feeling peckish shortly after. I wouldn’t say I’m constantly eating, but I’m thinking about food a lot more. It's a bit disruptive, if I’m being truthful.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you’re noticing these changes and that you’re being truthful about how it's affecting you. Disruptive is a good way to put it. Have you noticed any other changes along with the increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been going to the bathroom a bit more often, if that counts. And, now that you mention it, I’ve been a little more tired than usual. Not debilitatingly so, but… just lacking energy, I suppose. I don’t know if that’s connected, or just… life, you know?
DOCTOR: It absolutely could be connected, Christen. Increased urination and fatigue alongside the thirst and hunger are all things we'll want to explore. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I don’t really have a lot of history, thankfully. I broke my arm as a child – a rather clumsy incident involving a tree – but nothing major. No serious illnesses, no surgeries. I had the usual childhood vaccinations, I believe. I'm divorced, if that's relevant. Otherwise… fairly healthy, all things considered. I do have private insurance, if that’s needed for any tests.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Christen. No significant medical history is helpful. Divorce isn’t directly relevant to your current symptoms, but thank you for sharing. And yes, knowing you have private insurance is good information. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… well, he wasn’t one for doctors, so I don’t really know much about his medical history, to be honest. He passed away several years ago. No siblings, unfortunately. I don’t believe anyone else in the family had any particularly notable health issues, but again, information is scarce. Is that… useful? I feel rather inadequate in this regard.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Christen. You’ve provided what you know, and that’s what's important. Knowing your mother had high blood pressure is helpful. We don’t need a complete family medical history to start, and it’s common for people to have limited information. Let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’ve never been a smoker. Never had the inclination. I do enjoy a… moderate amount of alcohol on occasion – a glass of whisky with dinner, perhaps, or a pint with friends. But nothing excessive, I assure you. I wouldn’t describe myself as a heavy drinker. Otherwise, I work a fairly sedentary job – shipping and receiving, mostly office work – so I don’t get a great deal of exercise, I’m afraid. I try to walk the dog when I can, but… life gets in the way.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overview of your habits. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I’m not one for taking pills, if I can avoid it. I used to take a multivitamin, a few years back, but I stopped. I prefer to get my nutrients from food, when possible. I haven’t been feeling ill enough to warrant any prescribed medication, until recently, of course. This thirst and hunger… this is something new.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. No medications or supplements. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve always been fairly lucky in that regard. I can eat pretty much anything, and I've never had a reaction to any medication I’ve been given in the past – which, admittedly, isn’t much. So, no known allergies to report. Is there anything else you require, Doctor? I'm hoping we can get to the bottom of this soon.
DOCTOR: No, Christen, that's excellent. Thank you for being so thorough. Okay, based on what you’ve told me – the increased thirst and hunger, the frequent urination, the fatigue, and the lack of significant medical history – we need to investigate a few possibilities. The most common things that come to mind are diabetes, although there are other less common possibilities as well. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and electrolyte balance. We'll also do a urine analysis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests and a urine analysis. Yes, absolutely. Whatever it takes to find out what’s going on. I’m quite willing. When can we do these tests? I'm eager to get this sorted, if that's permissible. And… will it be painful? I'm not particularly fond of needles.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Christen. We can do them right here in the clinic today. The blood draw will involve a small needle prick, but it’s usually very quick, and most people don't find it particularly painful. There might be a slight stinging sensation, but it's brief. The urine analysis just involves providing a sample. I’ve just put in the orders. The lab technician will be in shortly to collect a blood sample, and I’ll give you a container for the urine sample. It’s best if you can provide a first morning sample, if possible. While we wait for the lab technician, let me do a brief physical exam to get a better baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A brief physical exam sounds perfectly acceptable. I understand the need for a baseline, and I’m happy to cooperate. I’m… not particularly fond of being poked and prodded, but I trust your judgment. And yes, I suppose I can attempt a first morning sample, although I can’t guarantee it. I do tend to drink a fair amount of water, even before bed. But I’ll do my best. Please, proceed when you are ready. I'm keen to get this process underway.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Christen. Thank you for your understanding. If you could just have a seat here, please. I’m going to start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. It’s fairly routine. Your blood pressure is 130/85, pulse is 72, temperature is 98.6, and respiratory rate is 16. Everything appears within normal limits so far. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Everything feels normal during the physical exam, which is reassuring, but we still need the blood work to confirm. Do you have any pain anywhere at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain anywhere at all. As I mentioned, I feel… generally unwell, tired and thirsty, but no localized pain. I’m glad to hear everything feels normal during the exam, but I understand the blood work is crucial. I’m… trying to remain optimistic, although I confess to being somewhat apprehensive. This thirst is quite debilitating, and the thought of it being something serious… well, it’s unsettling. Is there anything else you need to examine at this stage? I'm prepared to cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly natural to be apprehensive, Christen. We’re just gathering information at this point, and it’s often better to be thorough. Your peripheral pulses are normal and strong, and there’s no edema in your extremities. I’ll also quickly check your neurological function – reflexes and sensation. Your reflexes are normal and symmetric, and sensation is intact. Neurologically, everything appears normal as well. Given everything feels normal during the physical exam, we’ll need to await the blood work results. The lab technician should be here momentarily. Do you have any questions for me at this stage?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No further questions at present. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your… calm demeanor. It’s reassuring, to be frank. I’m… eager to receive the results, although I understand these things take time. I suppose I shall just remain as comfortable as possible until the lab technician arrives. Thank you for your attention thus far, Doctor Petrimoulx. I trust your judgment implicitly. Please, proceed when you are ready. I'll await the technician.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Christen. I understand your anxiety, and we’ll get the results back as quickly as possible. It’s good to hear you trust my judgment; I assure you, we’ll work together to figure out what's going on. "Could the lab technician come in, please?
