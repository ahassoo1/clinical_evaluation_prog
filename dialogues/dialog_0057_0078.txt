DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, or maybe a jumpstart. I’m not really sure how to explain it beyond that. I just haven’t been feeling myself lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, “not feeling yourself” is a good place to start. Can you tell me more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: It's…difficult to pinpoint. Not exactly sick, you understand? More like…low energy, all the time. And a bit…gray, if that makes sense. I used to have so much more…spark. I find myself not wanting to do the things I enjoy. Even spending time with my husband feels…effortful, sometimes. It's not him, of course. It’s me. I just feel…drained.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some significant changes in how you feel, both physically and emotionally. “Drained” and a lack of enjoyment are important things to discuss. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. When did you start noticing these feelings?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It wasn’t a sudden thing, not really. It sort of…crept up on me, I suppose. If I had to put a time on it…maybe six months ago? Perhaps a little longer. Around the holidays, I think. Everything felt a bit…muted then. I just assumed it was the stress of everything, but it hasn’t really lifted since. It’s just…persisted.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about six months, starting around the holidays. Has anything particularly stressful been happening during those six months, besides the usual holiday bustle?
PATIENT: Not…overtly stressful, no. My husband, Ricardo, has been having some issues with his back, which is worrying, of course, but we're managing. My daughter, Sofia, is doing well in university, which is a relief. No major life changes, no big losses… Honestly, that’s what’s so frustrating about it! It’s not like I can point to something and say, “That’s why I feel this way.” It's just…this persistent feeling of being…off. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense. Sometimes these things don’t have a clear trigger, and that can be really frustrating. Let’s talk about how this is affecting your daily life. You mentioned finding it harder to enjoy things. Can you give me some examples of activities you used to enjoy that you're now finding difficult?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I used to love gardening. I had a beautiful rose garden, spent hours out there. Now… I look at it, and it just feels like…work. I used to bake, too – elaborate cakes for birthdays, little treats for the grandchildren. I haven’t made anything in months. And I enjoy walking, but even that feels…exhausting. I force myself sometimes, but it doesn’t bring me the same joy. It's little things, really. Things I should be enjoying, but…don't. I feel guilty, honestly, that I’m not…present, you know? For my family, for the things I love.
DOCTOR: That sounds really difficult, Ms. Pitzel. It’s completely understandable to feel guilty when you’re not enjoying things you used to, especially when it impacts your family. Let's move on to some other things that might be contributing. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s not that I can’t fall asleep, necessarily, but I wake up…a lot. Several times during the night. And then I have trouble getting back to sleep. I lie there, just…thinking. Or not thinking, really, just…staring at the ceiling. It’s very frustrating. I used to sleep like a log, honestly. Now, I feel…restless, even when I’ve been in bed for eight hours. It's not every night, but it’s happening more and more frequently. It leaves me feeling…foggy, during the day, of course. Which, I suppose, adds to the…drained feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, disrupted sleep is definitely something we need to consider. And it certainly explains some of the "foggy" feeling you’re describing. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, either eating more or less than usual?
PATIENT: That’s an interesting question. I think…less, perhaps? It’s not that I’m actively losing my appetite, but I don’t have the same…enthusiasm for food. Ricardo makes wonderful meals, and I try to eat, for him, and to keep my strength up…but it feels like…an effort. I don't crave anything, really. Which is unusual for me. I used to enjoy cooking and eating, a good Colombian meal, with lots of flavor. Now…it just feels…bland. Everything feels a little bland, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, decreased appetite, loss of enjoyment in food, restless sleep, and a generally “drained” feeling. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms, like headaches, muscle aches, or stomach problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… occasional headaches, yes. Not severe, more like…a dull ache, at the back of my head. And my muscles feel…tense, almost always. I just assumed it was from gardening, to be honest, but I haven’t been gardening much lately. And…sometimes, yes, my stomach feels a little unsettled. Not pain, exactly, just…queasy, on occasion. It comes and goes. I haven't taken anything for it, because it's not really bothersome. Just…uncomfortable. It’s hard to explain. Everything is just… off. A little bit wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it came down with diet and exercise. I’ve been very careful to keep an eye on it since then. I had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago, but otherwise… I’m generally healthy, as far as I know. I see my primary care doctor regularly for check-ups. Ricardo worries about me sometimes, but he’s always been a worrier. I’ve never been one to complain of illness, truthfully. I just… feel unlike myself. It’s hard to describe to someone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure that’s now well-controlled, and a hysterectomy fifteen years ago. Have you ever been diagnosed with any mental health conditions, like depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question. My primary care doctor suggested I might be a little…down, after my mother passed away, about ten years ago. He suggested I talk to someone, but I…didn’t. I just tried to keep busy, and focus on my family. I don't know if it was depression, exactly. I just felt…sad, for a while. But it passed. This feels…different. It’s not sadness, exactly. It’s…emptiness. A lack of…spark. Like something is missing. I haven’t ever been officially diagnosed with anything, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a period of sadness after your mother's passing, but no formal diagnosis of any mental health condition. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, honestly. And occasionally, ibuprofen for a headache, when needed. Ricardo gives me glucosamine for my joints, but I don’t take it regularly. That’s it. I try to avoid medications as much as possible. I prefer to…manage things naturally, if I can. I don't like the idea of putting things into my body that I don't need. It's probably a silly habit, but... that's it. Just the multivitamin and the occasional ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not silly at all. Okay, so a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. And you mentioned your husband, Ricardo. Do you have any other family members with a history of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. My aunt, on my mother's side, was…difficult. She was often very sad, and withdrawn. She spent a lot of time in bed, and didn't really participate in family events. My mother always said she had a “fragile temperament.” I don't know if it was depression, exactly. Things were different back then. People didn't talk about these things. And Ricardo's brother, he's a bit… anxious, always worrying about everything. He's seen a doctor for it, I think. But other than that...not that I'm aware of, no. It’s not something we talk about much in my family, to be honest. It’s a little… taboo.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of sadness in your aunt and anxiety in your husband’s brother. I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam. Just to rule out any obvious physical causes for how you’re feeling. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need to rule things out. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. Please, go ahead. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your reflexes are normal, and you're tracking my finger well. I'm also going to gently feel your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels normal. There’s no tenderness or enlargement. Everything seems physically normal, at this point. That makes it less likely that this is due to a physical cause, and more likely to be something else. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with depression. It's not a definitive diagnosis, but it’s certainly something we need to consider. Do you have any objections to exploring that possibility further?
PATIENT: Depression… Well, it’s not what I expected. I just thought I was…tired, or stressed. It’s a little frightening, to be honest. I don’t feel sad, exactly. Just…empty. And unlike myself. I suppose… no, I don’t have any objections to exploring it further. I just… I don’t want to be put on medication, if I can avoid it. I’ve always prided myself on being strong, on managing things myself. But… if that’s what it takes to feel like myself again… then I suppose I’m willing to consider it. What would exploring it further involve?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, Ms. Pitzel. And it's good you’re being honest about your reluctance to start medication. Exploring it further would involve a more in-depth conversation about your symptoms, your past experiences, and your current life situation. I can also give you a questionnaire, called a PHQ-9, which is a standard tool for assessing depression. Based on the results of that, and our conversation, we can discuss different treatment options. Those options include psychotherapy – talking to a therapist – and, if necessary, medication. But we wouldn’t jump straight to medication. We would start with the least invasive options, and see how you respond. Would you be open to discussing psychotherapy?
PATIENT: Psychotherapy… Talking to someone… I suppose so. It’s not what I would have chosen, but… I’m willing to try. I’ve always been a private person, but… I suppose I need to do something to feel better. Is it…confidential? I wouldn’t want my family knowing, at least not yet. And… what kind of therapist would you recommend? Are there different types? This is all very new to me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Everything we discuss is completely confidential, Ms. Pitzel. I am legally and ethically obligated to protect your privacy. And yes, there are different types of therapists. For what you’re describing, I would recommend a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist, or a CBT therapist. They focus on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to depression. Or, a psychodynamic therapist would explore past experiences that may be contributing to your current feelings. It really depends on your preferences. I can provide you with a list of qualified therapists in the area, and you can choose someone you feel comfortable with. I’m also going to order some blood work, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, like a thyroid problem or vitamin deficiency. And, I'll give you that PHQ-9 questionnaire to fill out before you leave today. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. I appreciate that. Blood work and the questionnaire… and a list of therapists. Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I suppose I should start with the questionnaire, then. And the blood work, of course. I don't want to leave anything unexamined. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little less…lost, knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I'm glad you feel a little less lost. It takes courage to acknowledge you need help, and you've taken a big step today. Here's the questionnaire, and the requisition for the blood work. You can schedule the blood work at any lab that accepts your insurance. Once you've completed the questionnaire, feel free to bring it back to the office, or you can scan and email it to me. I'll review the results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your treatment options. In the meantime, if you start to experience any thoughts of harming yourself, please seek help immediately. You can call 911, or go to the nearest emergency room. There’s also a suicide hotline you can call at 988. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. 988… I’ll remember that number. I appreciate you giving me that information. I suppose I’ll just… go home and fill out the questionnaire. And schedule the blood work. Thank you again, Doctor Sieh. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
