DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let's get right to it. It's this… heartburn. And stuff coming back up. Really unpleasant. Been happening for a few weeks now, and frankly, it’s getting old. I’m a busy man, you know. Emergency Management doesn’t run itself.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. When you say “a few weeks,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, who keeps track of days when you're dealing with… well, everything I deal with? Maybe three weeks? Four? It started around the time of that heatwave, I think. Yes, definitely after the heatwave. It’s not exactly a priority to write down when my stomach decides to act up.
DOCTOR: Alright, approximately three to four weeks. And you mentioned “stuff coming back up.” Could you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Look, I don't want to get graphic, alright? It’s… food. Undigested food. Sometimes it's liquid, sometimes… not so much. It tastes awful, obviously. And it happens usually after I eat, but sometimes even just bending over! It’s embarrassing, frankly. A man in my position shouldn’t have to worry about this.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, regurgitation of undigested food, sometimes liquid, sometimes solid, occurring after meals and occasionally with bending over. Does this happen with every meal, or are there certain foods that seem to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Oh, don't get me started on foods. Everything seems to set it off these days! But… maybe spicy things are worse. And anything acidic. Tomatoes, oranges… you know, healthy stuff! It's ridiculous. I try to eat right, but then my stomach revolts. It's a losing battle. And don’t even get me started on coffee. I need my coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright, spicy and acidic foods seem to be exacerbating it, and coffee is a potential trigger. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – like bloating, nausea, any pain in your chest or abdomen, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Pain? Yes, a little. A burning sensation, right here… It’s not terrible, but it’s there. And sometimes I feel… full, even if I haven’t eaten much. Like something’s stuck. No nausea, though. And I can swallow just fine. Look, I'm not falling apart here, just… annoyed. And uncomfortable. Is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Altine, that’s helpful. And the location of the chest burning is…?
PATIENT: Right behind the breastbone. It's not a sharp pain, just… a discomfort. Like something's pressing on me. Honestly, it could be stress. I have a lot on my plate. But this is happening even when I'm not stressed, which is rare, believe me. Are we getting anywhere with this? I have a meeting in an hour.
DOCTOR: We are, Mr. Altine. To clarify, this burning sensation is present even when you aren’t experiencing stress?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. Look, I deal with emergencies all day. A little stress isn't going to cause this. It’s just… there. It's a constant irritation. And it's making it hard to concentrate. Which, as you can imagine, isn't ideal in my line of work. So, yes. It’s there, regardless of my stress level. Can we talk about fixing it now? I’m not here to discuss the metaphysics of heartburn.
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we discuss treatment options, I’d like to quickly perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, and palpating your abdomen. It will only take a moment. Then we can talk about potential causes and a plan to address this. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But make it quick. I really do have things to do. And please don't poke too much. I'm a busy man, and I don't have time for a lengthy examination. Just the essentials.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. Just a quick listen and palpation. Please lie back on the examination table. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. Okay. I’m noticing some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, but nothing concerning. No significant rigidity or pain with deep palpation.
PATIENT: Tenderness? Well, no wonder. Everything hurts! It's my stomach, isn't it? Honestly, what else could it be? Look, I'm not a doctor, but it seems pretty obvious. This whole thing is a waste of my time. Can we just get some medication or something? I'm sure there's something that will fix this. A pill, a shot, whatever it takes. Just make it stop.
DOCTOR: It certainly could be related to your stomach, Mr. Altine. However, several conditions can cause similar symptoms, so it’s important to consider all possibilities. Based on what you've described, and my brief exam, the most likely possibility is gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, possibly with some esophagitis. But to confirm this, and rule out other issues, I'd recommend an upper endoscopy. However, before we go that route, we can try a trial of medication. I'm going to prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, to reduce stomach acid. This often provides significant relief. But if your symptoms don't improve within a couple of weeks, or if they worsen, we’ll need to consider further investigation with the endoscopy. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? Absolutely not. Look, I'm not sticking any cameras down my throat. That sounds… unpleasant. And frankly, unnecessary. A pill is fine. Yes, a pill. Just give me a pill and let's be done with this. I have a job to do. I don't have time for invasive procedures. And I’m not paying for any fancy tests. A pill. That’s all I want. And make sure it’s a strong one. I need something that actually works. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I understand. I’m prescribing omeprazole, 20mg daily, for eight weeks. It’s a commonly used PPI, and often effective. Please take it as directed, and let me know if you experience any side effects. It’s important to note that if your symptoms persist or worsen despite the medication, or if you develop new symptoms – such as difficulty swallowing, unexplained weight loss, or blood in your stool – you must contact me immediately. Here’s a prescription for the omeprazole, and a handout with information about GERD and potential side effects. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. None. Just… take a pill, don't die. That's my medical philosophy. Look, I appreciate your time, but I really need to get going. I have a city to run, practically. Just… thank you. And goodbye.
