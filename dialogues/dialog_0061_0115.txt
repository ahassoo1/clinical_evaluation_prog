DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Annelle. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I suppose. Well, to be frank, I haven't been feeling quite myself. My skin… it’s turned rather yellow, hasn’t it? And I believe the younger doctor mentioned something about my liver? It’s all a bit… fuzzy, honestly. I apologize for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Annelle, no need to apologize at all. It can be fuzzy trying to remember everything. Yellowing of the skin – that’s called jaundice – and the mention of your liver definitely gives us a place to start. I see Dr. Sharma saw you recently. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed the yellowing?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… yes, that rings a bell. A very kind man. When did I first notice… Goodness. It feels like weeks, perhaps months. It started subtly, I think. I just thought it was the lighting in the house, perhaps. Then my daughter pointed it out. She has a very keen eye, that one. I truly haven't been keeping track of the exact date, I'm afraid. It all feels rather… distant.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. "Weeks to months" gives us a timeframe. And it's good your daughter noticed – family often picks these things up. Besides the yellowing of your skin, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… Let me think. I’ve been… rather tired lately. More tired than usual, and I always was a bit of a napper. And my appetite… it’s been off. Food doesn't seem to have much flavor. Oh, and sometimes my stomach… it feels a bit swollen, if I eat too much. But, really, those could be anything, couldn't they?
DOCTOR: They could be, Annelle, but it's good you're telling me. Tiredness, loss of appetite, and a swollen stomach... those can be related. Have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Such personal questions! Well… I suppose my urine has been… darker than usual. A sort of tea color, perhaps? And my stool… lighter. Almost clay-colored. Is that… normal? I really don’t pay much attention to such things, I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. These are important things to know, and I appreciate you being so open with me. Dark urine and pale stools are things we need to investigate further. Now, have you had any itching?
PATIENT: Itching… Now that you mention it, yes. A bit. Not constantly, but especially at night. It’s quite bothersome, actually. I thought it was just my skin being dry, so I’ve been using lotion, but it hasn't seemed to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Itching, especially at night, can also be a sign. Annelle, based on what you've told me – the yellowing of your skin, the tiredness, loss of appetite, darker urine, lighter stools, and the itching – it sounds like we need to run some tests to check your liver function. We'll also want to do a full blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, I suppose that’s sensible. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not particularly fond of tests. But if you think it's necessary… then please do what you must. I just want to feel better. Are they… painful? I've never had many medical procedures, you see.
DOCTOR: No, Annelle, they won't be painful. We'll just need to draw some blood – a quick pinch, that's all. And the lab will do some other tests on the sample. Before we proceed, let me ask about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… That’s a good question. I don’t think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I haven't taken many medications over the years, thankfully. Perhaps a pain reliever here or there, but nothing regularly. I do get a bit… queasy with strong smells, but I wouldn’t call that an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, that’s good. And you haven't been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I pride myself on staying away from pills as much as possible. A bit of herbal tea now and then, that’s all. Mostly chamomile, for sleep. But that’s hardly a medication, is it?
DOCTOR: No, chamomile tea wouldn't be considered a medication. Now, have you ever had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… Let me see… I had the measles as a child, of course. And I broke my arm once, when I was quite young. But nothing… major. No surgeries, no long hospital stays. I’ve always been… rather lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she passed away many years ago. Heart trouble, I believe. My father… he lived a long life, thankfully. But he had… some problems with his stomach, later in life. Nothing specific, just… unwellness. My sister… she’s still alive, but we don't speak much anymore. I don't really know about her health.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Heart trouble in your mother and some stomach problems in your father. That's helpful to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your current condition, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll gently feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Well… I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t involve anything… invasive. I'm not a fan of being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind my saying so. But if it’s necessary… very well. Proceed, Doctor. But please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, in and out. Okay… your heart sounds regular, but slightly muffled. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, a little. Right there. It’s not sharp, just… uncomfortable. A dull ache, perhaps. It’s been like that for a few days, now. But I thought it was just indigestion.
DOCTOR: Okay, Annelle. That tenderness in your upper right abdomen is noted. And what about here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, that’s… more tender. It feels a bit swollen, doesn't it? I hadn't really paid attention, but now that you're pressing… it definitely feels different than usual. It's not terribly painful, but it’s certainly… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Annelle. I do feel some slight swelling. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I'm concerned about your liver. The tenderness, swelling, and the changes in your urine and stool, along with the jaundice, strongly suggest a liver issue. We need to run some tests to confirm this. I’m going to order a complete blood panel, including liver function tests, a bilirubin level, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We’ll also need a urine analysis. Would you like me to explain what those tests are for?
PATIENT: Tests… so many tests. Yes, please. Explain them to me. I don’t understand all the medical jargon, you see. I just want to know what you're looking for, and what it all means. I suppose if it’s necessary… but I'd prefer to know what I'm signing up for.
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. That’s perfectly reasonable. The complete blood panel gives us a general overview of your health. It checks your red and white blood cells, and platelets. The liver function tests specifically measure the levels of different enzymes and proteins in your blood. These levels can indicate if your liver is damaged or inflamed. The bilirubin level will tell us how much of a substance called bilirubin is in your blood. Bilirubin is a waste product that the liver helps to remove, and a high level can cause jaundice. The comprehensive metabolic panel checks things like your electrolytes, kidney function, and blood sugar. The urine analysis checks for things like blood, protein, and bilirubin in your urine. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: I… think so. So, you're looking to see if my liver is working properly, and if there's anything unusual in my blood or urine? It all sounds rather… complicated. And a bit frightening, if I'm honest. But I understand you need to do these tests to figure out what's wrong. When will I get the results? And what happens next, if… if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is complicated, and it's understandable to be frightened. We’re looking to see if your liver is functioning properly, and if there are any signs of damage or inflammation. The lab usually takes about 24 to 48 hours to process the results. I will call you as soon as they are available. If the results are abnormal, it means we need to investigate further to find the cause of the problem. This might involve additional tests, such as an ultrasound or CT scan of your liver. Depending on the cause, treatment options can range from lifestyle changes and medication to more specialized interventions. I want to assure you that we'll take things one step at a time. We’ll discuss all the options with you and make a plan that’s right for you. For now, I’m going to write an order for these blood tests and a urine analysis. The nurse will give you the instructions for how to collect the urine sample, and she’ll schedule you for a blood draw. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that covers everything for now. It’s a lot to take in, but I appreciate you being so thorough. And patient. I'm just… anxious, I suppose. The nurse will let me know when and where to go for the tests? And you’ll call me with the results? Perhaps… perhaps you could explain the ultrasound and CT scan a little more, when I see you again? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Annelle. The nurse will give you all the details for scheduling your blood work and urine sample collection. And yes, I will call you as soon as the results are available. And I’m happy to explain the ultrasound and CT scan in more detail when we talk again. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of your liver. It’s painless and non-invasive. A CT scan uses X-rays to create more detailed images. It does involve a small amount of radiation, but it’s generally safe. We’ll discuss the risks and benefits of each test if we need to consider them. For now, try not to worry too much. We’ll take things one step at a time. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other medical conditions or take any herbal supplements that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Herbal supplements… Well, I occasionally drink chamomile tea, as I mentioned before. For sleep. And sometimes, when my joints are aching, I'll take a little ginger tea. My daughter brought it back from a trip. But that's about it. No other medications, no other supplements. I generally try to stay away from anything artificial, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, chamomile and ginger tea. That's good to know. Neither of those should interfere with the tests we're ordering. Alright, Annelle. I think we’ve covered everything for now. I’m going to have the nurse come in and take your vital signs and give you the instructions for the tests. Again, if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the nurse, then.
