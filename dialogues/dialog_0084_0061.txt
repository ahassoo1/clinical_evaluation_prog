DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. I'm Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, my son, he… he signed me up for somethin’. A tryout. For… sports? I think. Old man wants me to… show 'em what I got. I don’t really remember all the details, to be honest. Just gotta get checked out first, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. A tryout… right. And how old are you, Mr. Murph, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Seventy. Seventy years. Feels like yesterday, and feels like a hundred, if you know what I mean. My wife keeps tellin' me I gotta slow down. But, uh, this tryout... my son, he said it was important.
DOCTOR: Seventy. Alright. And is this tryout for a specific sport, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that's a good question. I wanna say… ball? Round ball. Maybe basketball? Or… baseball? Oh, jeez, I get so mixed up these days. It involves runnin' though, I think. And throwin'. Definitely throwin'. My son, he’s the sporty one, not me. He probably knows.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, regardless of the exact sport, a physical exam is a good idea before starting anything new, especially at your age. We want to make sure you’re safe. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… Well, let me think. My wife keeps track of all that. I… I get a little tired sometimes, yeah. And my knees, they bother me when it rains. High blood pressure… maybe? I take a pill, a little white one, every mornin'. I think it’s for that. Doctor told me to, a long time ago. Honestly, it all blurs together, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, knees bothering you, and a white pill for possible high blood pressure. That's a good start. Do you remember the name of that pill, or perhaps the doctor who prescribed it?
PATIENT: Oh, the name…no, not a chance. Old Doctor Ramirez, I think? He retired years ago. Nice man. Gave me good lollipops as a kid... wait, no, that was the dentist. See? This is why I let my wife handle these things. She’s got a little notebook with everything written down. I just…show up. And try not to fall.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Murph. We can sort through this. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never been much of a shellfish person, but that's a preference, not an allergy. My wife makes a lovely paella, but I just stick to the chicken. Don't think I've ever had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. Though, dust makes me sneeze. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: Dust is a pretty common allergy, Mr. Murph. Okay, good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… oh, uh, years ago, I had my tonsils out. When I was a boy. And… I broke my arm once, fallin' outta a tree. That needed a cast, a big white one. Hospitalized? Not really. Just stayed overnight for the arm, I think. Nothing major. Mostly just bumps and bruises over the years. I was a bit of a wild one when I was younger. My wife…she’ll tell ya all about it. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsils out as a child, broken arm with a cast. Nothing else major. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… oh, my wife, Maria, bless her heart. She's everything. We've been married… a long time. Got two sons, like I said, the one who signed me up for this… thing. They're both healthy, as far as I know. And… grandkids! A few of 'em. They keep me young… or at least, they try to. My brother, he lives down south, a little bit sick these days, but holdin' on. That's about it, really. A pretty simple family. We stick close.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. That’s helpful. Last few quick questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh no, not me. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Maria wouldn't allow it. And… I used to enjoy a little glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Red wine, usually. But I haven’t had a drink in… well, a long time. Doctor told me to cut back, and Maria agreed. She's a good woman, that Maria. Always lookin' out for me. Now, what did you say this exam was for again? Is it somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Murph. Your son signed you up for a tryout, and this is just a routine checkup to make sure you’re physically able to participate safely. Now, before we move on, do you currently take any medications besides the white pill you mentioned for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, right, the tryout... It's all so foggy. Let me think… um, sometimes I take somethin' for my knees, when they're really botherin' me. A little orange pill, I think? And… oh, and a vitamin, a gummy one. Maria says I need it. She's always tellin' me to take my vitamins. She keeps 'em all organized, in a little pill box. Every day. It's just… a lot to keep track of, you know? Old age is somethin' else. Now, what kind of tryout is it again? Are we talkin' runnin', or… weight liftin'? I'm not sure my knees can handle much runnin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Murph, let’s take a step back. It sounds like you have a lot going on, and it’s perfectly understandable to be a little confused. We'll figure this out together. It sounds like you take a white pill for possible high blood pressure, an orange pill for your knees when they hurt, and a gummy vitamin. Do you know the names of the orange pill or the vitamin?
PATIENT: Oh, you are a patient woman, Doctor. Bless you. The names…no, not a chance. Maria handles all that. She keeps a list, in her little notebook. I just…pop 'em. She gets mad at me when I don't. She says I need to be responsible. Orange pill… maybe somethin' with an "N" in it? I dunno. Everything looks the same to me these days. Just little colored pills. She labels everything, though. Always. I shoulda brought her with me. She'd know everything. This tryout… it feels like a bad idea, now that I think about it. Are you sure I need to do this? My knees are achin' just thinkin' about it.
DOCTOR: Alright Mr. Murph. Let’s see if we can at least get a list of your current medications on file. Can you tell me your date of birth, please?
PATIENT: Oh, my date of birth… um, let me think… It's... August 12th. 1955. Yes, August 12th, 1955. I always forget. My wife always says I'm losin' it. I think she's right. Is that right? I hope that's right. It's been a long time since anyone asked me my birthday.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Murph, according to the records, you are taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for high blood pressure, and Naproxen 500mg as needed for knee pain. You also have a record of a multivitamin gummy. And it says here... you had a full cardiac work-up in 2018 with no significant findings. But… it also says you reported experiencing shortness of breath with exertion six months ago. Did you discuss this with a doctor?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… now that sounds familiar. Yes… I think my wife made an appointment for me. Dr. Chen, down the street. He said somethin' about… my lungs? It wasn't serious, he said. Just told me to take it easy. That was… a while ago. I probably shoulda told you about that. See? This is why I need Maria with me. She remembers everything. So, I've been to doctors, I have been to doctors. Just… I forget what they tell me. It all blurs together. Are you sure this tryout is a good idea? I'm gettin' worried now. Maybe I should just sit down.
DOCTOR: Mr. Murph, you're absolutely right to be worried, and frankly, I'm a little concerned too. Given your reported shortness of breath and knee pain, and the fact that you're starting a new physical activity, I think it would be very wise to do a quick examination and get a clearer picture of what’s going on before you participate in this tryout. How about we listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and knees, and then we can decide on the best course of action?
PATIENT: That… that sounds good. Yes, that sounds very good. Listening… checking… that's a good idea. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Maria always says I'm too trusting. Maybe she’s right. But I feel better just talkin' to you. Just… don't make me run, okay? My knees are already achin' just thinkin' about it. Where do we start? I’ll just sit here and try not to worry too much. Oh, and thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listenin'.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Murph. We’ll take it slow and easy. First, let's listen to your heart. Please take a deep breath in and out… and relax. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Deep breath in… and out… and again… Lungs are clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing on exhale. We should monitor that as well. Now I’m going to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, breathin’ and listenin’… I can do that. A little wheezin’… I sometimes feel a little tight in the chest, yeah. Especially when it’s cold. And the murmur… is that bad? Maria says I worry too much. She’s probably right. Checkin’ the blood pressure… that little cuff always squeezes so tight. I try not to think about it. Just…breathe, I guess. Is this tryout really worth all this worry? I’m startin’ to think my son is tryin’ to kill me.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. That’s a little elevated, but not critically high. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Can you point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: 140 over 90… Is that bad? My wife keeps tellin’ me to watch my salt intake. She makes me laugh, sometimes. She worries too much. As for my knees…oh, it’s mostly right here…… and here…… It gets stiff when I walk for too long, and aches when it rains. Feels kinda…grindy, sometimes. Like bones rubbin’ together. Old age, I guess. I shoulda been a swimmer. Or maybe a librarian.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Murph. There's some tenderness on the inside of your right knee, and a mild crepitus – that grinding feeling you described – in both knees. Your range of motion is a little limited, but not severely so. Your gait is slightly antalgic – meaning you’re favoring one leg to avoid pain. Based on this quick exam, it seems like you have some mild osteoarthritis in both knees. This is common for someone your age, but it’s important to manage it carefully. Given your shortness of breath, elevated blood pressure, and osteoarthritis, I strongly recommend against participating in this tryout at this time. It could put you at risk for injury or other complications.
PATIENT: No tryout? Oh, dear. My son is gonna be disappointed. He… he really wanted me to do this. He said it was a chance to… prove myself, I think. But you're right, aren't you? It's not worth riskin' my health. Shortness of breath… achin' knees… I'm not a young man anymore. Maybe I should just stick to readin’ and gardenin’. My wife will be happy. She always worries about me. What do you recommend I do? Should I see a specialist? A lung doctor? Or maybe just take it easy and keep takin’ those little pills? Oh, this is a mess. A real mess.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to be concerned, Mr. Murph, and I think you’ve made a very wise decision. Given your shortness of breath, I do recommend seeing a pulmonologist – a lung specialist – for a more thorough evaluation. They can determine the cause of your breathing difficulties and recommend appropriate treatment. We can write a referral for you today. In the meantime, continue taking your medications as prescribed, and avoid any strenuous activity that makes your breathing worse or aggravates your knee pain. We can also discuss some gentle exercises to help strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion. We can also consider a short course of physical therapy. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A lung doctor… physical therapy… Okay. That sounds… good, I guess. Better than breakin’ a hip, anyway. My wife will be happy I’m listenin’ to you. She's always tellin' me to go to the doctor. Gentle exercises… I can probably manage that. Maybe some light gardenin’. As long as I don’t overdo it. And a referral… Yes, please. Write that referral for me. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease. Maybe I can just tell my son I sprained my ankle.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Murph. I’m glad I could help. And yes, a sprained ankle sounds like a perfectly reasonable excuse! I’m sending the referral electronically to Dr. Ramirez – she’s an excellent pulmonologist. I’m also going to print out a handout with some gentle exercises you can start at home. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything, really. Just…thank you again, Doctor. You’re a good woman. I’m goin’ to go home now, tell my wife I’m okay, and avoid any strenuous activity. Maybe I’ll take a nap. That sounds like a good plan. And…tell my son I sprained my ankle. Yes, that's the plan. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. You take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Here's the referral and the handout with the exercises. And remember, rest is important! Have a good day, and enjoy your nap.
