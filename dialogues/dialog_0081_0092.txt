DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Paulino, huh? Sounds…foreign. Anyway. I’m here 'cause…well, I get outta breath, see? Just walkin' a little bit. And my mouth feels like the desert. Eyes too, kinda scratchy. It's been happenin' for a while now, I guess. Don't remember exactly when it started. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: "Foreign," you say. Yes, Ukrainian, actually. And while old age can contribute to these symptoms, we shouldn't simply dismiss it as such. Let's try to be a bit more precise. You mentioned shortness of breath and a dry mouth and eyes. Can you describe the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Ukrainian…right. Never met one of those before. Look, I ain't a doctor, alright? Just tellin' you what's wrong with me. It's…like I gotta work to breathe. Not a sharp pain, nothin' like that. Just…harder. Especially if I try to do somethin'. Walkin', even talkin' sometimes. And this dryness…it's constant. Feels like cotton in my mouth. Like I haven't had a good drink in days, even when I just did.
DOCTOR: I understand you're not a doctor, Mr. Guilds, and I appreciate you explaining it to me. But details are important. "Harder" is subjective. Does it happen with exertion only?
PATIENT: Exertion? Is that…when I do somethin'? Yeah, mostly. Walkin' up a hill, that's for sure. Even bendin' over to tie my shoes. But sometimes…sometimes it feels a little short even when I'm just sittin' here. Not bad, just…there. Like I gotta remind myself to breathe, you know? It's gettin' old, I tell ya. Everything's gettin' old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this sensation of being “short of breath” even at rest…has that been worsening recently?
PATIENT: Worsenin’? Hmm. That’s…hard to say. Things kinda blur together when you get to my age. But I think…yeah. I think it's a little worse. Used to be just when I was doin’ somethin’. Now it's…more often. I find myself thinkin' about breathin' all the time. It's annoyin', really. I used to not even notice breathin'.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Now why would my feet be swellin’? You askin’ a lot of questions, Doc. Never had no problems with my feet. They're a little wide, always have been, but not…swollen. No. They feel fine. What does that have to do with breathin’ anyway? You lookin' for somethin’ specific?
DOCTOR: It's important to consider all possibilities, Mr. Guilds. Swelling can be a sign of fluid retention, which can sometimes contribute to shortness of breath. Now, have you noticed any chest pain or palpitations—that is, a racing or fluttering in your chest?
PATIENT: Racing…fluttering…? Look, I ain’t a delicate flower, alright? I used to work on the roads, fixin’ traffic lights. Tough job. No, no chest pain. And my heart feels…normal. Beats, I guess. Never felt it jumpin' around or nothin'. I get a little winded, that’s all. Like I told ya. You’re makin’ this sound a lot more complicated than it is.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Guilds, I’m simply being thorough. Now, let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. I used to take somethin’ for my blood pressure, years ago. But the Doc took me off it. Said I was feelin' too weak. Now…I take a little somethin' for my arthritis in my hands, keeps 'em from gettin' too stiff. Little white pill. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little somethin’ for that too. But that’s it. Just the arthritis pill and sometimes the sleepin' pill. I get 'em from the drugstore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you recall the names of these medications?
PATIENT: Names…? Oh boy. You’re askin' too much now, Doc. I just ask the pharmacist for 'em. They know what I need. Little white pill for the hands…the sleepin' pill is…blue, I think. Small one. I don’t bother with names. They’re just pills. I ain’t a chemist.
DOCTOR: It’s important to know what medications you’re taking, Mr. Guilds, even if it’s just to ensure there aren’t any interactions. We'll need to get the names from the pharmacy records. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, such as food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Well, I get a little itchy when the mosquitoes bite me, if that’s what you mean. And pollen…makes me sneeze sometimes. But allergies? No, not really. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’. I eat just about anythin’ put in front of me. I'm Cuban, we eat everything! Look, you’re makin’ me nervous with all these questions. Is somethin’ seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I'm simply gathering information to assess your condition properly. Now, let's proceed with a physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your extremities. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Examination table…? Fine. But don’t go pokin’ and proddin’ too much. I'm an old man, my bones ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Guilds… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Now, I'm listening to your heart. I hear a slight murmur, which is not uncommon at your age, but we'll need to keep an eye on it. Your breathing sounds a little…diminished on both sides, but no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 140/90, a bit elevated. Slight edema in both ankles, as I suspected. No significant discoloration or tenderness.
PATIENT: Elevated…edema…murmur…? What’s that mean? Is it bad? You're usin' a lot of fancy words, Doc. Just tell me straight. Am I gonna be alright? I just wanna be able to walk to the store without gettin’ outta breath.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, it means your blood pressure is a little high, and there's some fluid retention in your ankles. The murmur is a common heart sound in individuals your age. These findings, combined with your shortness of breath, suggest possible early signs of congestive heart failure, although further testing is needed to confirm. It doesn't necessarily mean you aren't going to be alright, but it does require attention. I’m ordering some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture. We'll also schedule an echocardiogram to assess your heart function. I’m going to prescribe a low-sodium diet and a mild diuretic to help reduce fluid retention.
PATIENT: Diuretic…? Low…sodium…? What am I gonna eat, Doc? Air? And a…echo…gram…? Sounds expensive. Look, I'm on Medicare. I don’t have money for fancy tests. And what’s wrong with my heart? Is it breakin’? You’re scaring me now. Just tell me what’s gonna happen, plain and simple.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, a diuretic is a medication that helps your body eliminate excess fluid, reducing swelling and shortness of breath. A low-sodium diet simply means reducing your intake of salt. It doesn’t mean you’ll be eating air. And Medicare will cover the necessary tests. An echocardiogram is a non-invasive ultrasound of your heart. It will show us how well your heart is functioning, but it is not a guarantee of a definitive diagnosis. We're not saying your heart is "breaking," but it appears to be working harder than it should. I will submit the orders for the blood work, chest X-ray, and echocardiogram immediately. We will have the results within a week. In the meantime, please follow the low-sodium diet and take the diuretic as prescribed. I will also give you a referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation. Now, do you have any questions about that, or am I being too complicated for you?
PATIENT: Cardi…whatsit…? Look, I don't understand none of this. You're talkin' a language I ain't never heard before. All I know is I get outta breath walkin’ to the store, and my mouth feels like a desert. I don't want no fancy tests, no cardi…people, just somethin' to make me feel better. Is there a pill for that? Just a simple pill.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your frustration, but there is no "simple pill" for a complex condition. You require a comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. A cardiologist is a specialist in heart conditions, and their expertise is necessary to provide appropriate treatment. I am ordering the tests and the referral. It is in your best interest to follow through with them. I'll also provide you with a pamphlet outlining a low-sodium diet and the importance of fluid restriction. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you say, Doc. Just…don’t expect me to remember all these fancy names. And make sure that cardiologist is…nice. I don't need no one talkin’ down to me. I guess I’ll go wait for these…tests. And try to eat less salt, or somethin’.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will schedule your appointments before you leave. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience any chest pain, go to the emergency room immediately. .
PATIENT: .
