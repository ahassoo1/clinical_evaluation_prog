DOCTOR: Hi Jeannemarie, welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you as well. Um, well… I have been coughing up some blood. It… it scared me, so I thought I should come see someone. Just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jeannemarie, that is concerning, and you absolutely did the right thing coming in. Coughing up blood – we call that hemoptysis – needs to be checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, um… hemop-what-sis? Sorry. I don’t… I don’t know those words. Just… blood when I cough. It happened maybe three times now. Not a lot each time, but enough to worry me. It is… bright red. And it usually happens in the morning.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jeannemarie. Hemoptysis just means coughing up blood – it’s a medical term, and it’s perfectly okay not to know it. We can always use plain language. Bright red blood, three times in the morning… Okay. Is it mixed with mucus, or is it separate?
PATIENT: Um… it is mixed with mucus, yes. A little bit. Not a lot of mucus, but some. And… it doesn’t really hurt when I cough. Just… surprising. And a little scary, of course. I have been a little tired lately too, but I thought that was just… life. You know?
DOCTOR: I understand. “Surprising” and “scary” are good ways to describe it. And being a little tired on top of that… Okay. Has anything changed recently that might be contributing?
PATIENT: Um… not really. My husband… he passed away about a year ago. So, things have been… quiet. I am trying to get back to my routines, but it is slow. I have been doing more walking, trying to stay healthy, but… no, nothing really changed recently. Except for the blood, of course. I don’t smoke, if that matters. And I haven’t been sick with a cold or anything.
DOCTOR: I’m so sorry for your loss, Jeannemarie. That’s a huge change, and it takes time to adjust. And yes, the fact that you don’t smoke and haven’t been sick is helpful information. Alright, let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like asthma, bronchitis, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I have always been very healthy. Maybe a little high blood pressure, the doctor said a few years ago, but it was not very bad. I take a small pill for it, that is all. Otherwise, nothing. Just… normal. I see my regular doctor for checkups every year. And I had all the usual childhood things, but nothing serious. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, high blood pressure, managed with medication… good. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… no, no surgeries. Never had any. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. Other than that, nothing. I try to avoid hospitals, if I can. They… they are not my favorite place. Does that sound silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Jeannemarie. Many people feel that way about hospitals. Okay, so no surgeries other than tonsils as a child. And you're taking medication for high blood pressure… Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. I can eat anything. And I haven’t had a reaction to any medicine that I know of. I have a pretty strong stomach, usually. My husband always said I could eat anything. But that was a long time ago. Sorry. I am okay. Just… sometimes it is hard to talk about.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to feel that way, Jeannemarie. It's completely understandable. You don’t need to apologize, and you can stop me anytime if it's too much. Alright, let’s move on. Before we do a physical exam, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… my mother had… I think it was diabetes, yes. And my father… he had some heart problems when he was older. He smoked a lot, I think. My older brother is healthy, as far as I know. And my sister… she had some trouble with her lungs when she was a child, but she is fine now. Does that help? It is a little hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Jeannemarie, thank you. Diabetes in your mother, heart problems and smoking in your father, and some childhood lung trouble in your sister… Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and oxygen levels. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please let me know if anything feels… strange. Or uncomfortable. I just want to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Perfect. I will explain everything as I go, and please do let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, I'm going to listen to your heart. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are normal, regular rate and rhythm. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Take some deep breaths in and out… Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but I do hear some mild wheezing on exhale… It's subtle. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not significantly. And your oxygen saturation is 97%, which is good. Everything seems relatively normal so far, but the mild wheezing and the fact that you’re coughing up blood still needs to be investigated. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a sputum sample analysis. The X-ray will help us look for any abnormalities in your lungs, and the sputum analysis will check for infection or other causes of the bleeding. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An X-ray and the… spu-tum thing. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what is going on. Is the X-ray… scary? I have never had one before. And will the spu-tum thing be… difficult? I am not very good at spitting. Sorry. That sounds silly.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Jeannemarie. It’s perfectly natural to be nervous about new tests. An X-ray is very quick and painless. You’ll just stand or sit in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture. There's no pain involved. As for the sputum sample, it just means coughing up some mucus from your lungs. We’ll have you cough into a sterile container. The nurse will show you how to do it – it doesn't require a lot of force, and we can help you if you're having trouble. It’s usually easiest first thing in the morning. We’ll get the results back within a day or two. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for an albuterol inhaler. It’s a bronchodilator, which will help open up your airways and relieve any wheezing. It can also help with the cough. I want you to use it twice a day, and as needed if you feel short of breath. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. An inhaler, twice a day. And I will try to do the spu-tum thing in the morning. I just… I hope it is nothing serious, Doctor. I am a little worried. Being alone is… hard. But I am trying to be strong. My husband always said I was a fighter. Sorry. I didn’t mean to… get emotional.
DOCTOR: Please don’t apologize at all, Jeannemarie. It’s perfectly understandable to feel emotional, especially with everything you've been through. And it’s good that you have that fighting spirit – that will help a lot. We’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. While we wait for the X-ray results, if you experience any significant chest pain, difficulty breathing, or a large amount of bleeding, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Chest pain, trouble breathing… emergency room. I will remember. I think… I think that is everything? I have been a little nervous, so I probably forgot something. But thank you. You have been very kind. And… patient. I appreciate that very much. Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? Or should I just wait for the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. It's my job. And no, don't worry about forgetting something. We'll review everything carefully. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for three days from now, to discuss the X-ray and sputum results. That will give the lab enough time to process everything. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Three days from now… yes, that sounds perfect. August 5th? Is that right? I have some… volunteer work that day, but I can rearrange things. It is important to get this sorted out. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we have a plan. .
