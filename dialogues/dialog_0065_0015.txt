DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… my nose. It’s been… bothering me. Like a pressure, you know? It’s hard to explain, but it feels… full. For a little while now. I don't remember exactly when it started, but a few weeks, maybe?
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. And is it constant, this pressure, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Sometimes it’s worse when I… when I lay down, maybe? Or when it’s cold. But it’s… not always bad. Just… there. It's hard to say. My head feels funny too, sometimes. Not a bad pain, just… full. Like my nose is stopping up my whole head, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, so pressure in your nose, comes and goes, worse when lying down or in the cold. And a feeling of fullness in your head. Do you have any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… I don’t know. Maybe a little tired? But I work long hours, so… I don’t know if that’s just from that. I don't get a fever, I think. No cough, no… nothing like that. Just… the nose and the head. I don't really remember much else being different. Do you… need me to think harder? It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright for now. Fatigue is a non-specific symptom, so we won’t focus on that right now. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with allergies, sinusitis, or any other nasal problems before?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies? I… I don't think so. I don't really… get sick much. Maybe a little cold sometimes, but nothing bad. Sinus… what was that? Sinus… I don't remember the doctor ever saying that to me. I’ve been to doctors before, you know, for check-ups… but I don’t… I just don’t remember what they told me. I work with the… the drill, a lot of dust, maybe? Could that be it?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or history of sinusitis. You work with a drill and are exposed to dust. That’s relevant. Have you had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I think… when I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out. A long time ago. And… maybe my appendix? But it was so long ago, I don't remember very well. Other than that, no. Nothing else that I can recall. I had babies, you know, but… that’s not surgery, is it? Just… babies. Two of them.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and possible appendectomy. Two pregnancies. Good. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had problems with his heart, I think. But they both lived a long time, you know? They’re both… gone now. And my husband… he's healthy. Very healthy. Doesn't get sick much. I don't think anyone in my family had… problems with their nose, though. Or… sinuses. I don't remember. It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Maternal history of hypertension, paternal history of heart problems. No known family history of nasal or sinus issues. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… no, I don't think so. I don't take much. Sometimes a little something for a headache, but nothing regularly. I don't remember ever being allergic to anything the doctor gave me. No, I don’t think I do. I try to stay away from medicine if I can. It makes me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known medication allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your nose, ears, and throat. I’ll also listen to your lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to feel better, you know? It’s just been… a little uncomfortable. My head is feeling a bit full right now. If it’s okay, maybe you can do it quick? I don’t like feeling… poked and prodded. But I understand you need to do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please sit back and relax. First, let’s take a look at your ears… Ears look clear bilaterally. Normal cerumen present. Now, let’s check your nose. Hmm. There is some mild swelling of the nasal turbinates and some clear nasal discharge. No obvious masses or polyps. The nasal mucosa appears slightly inflamed. Sinuses are tender to palpation over the frontal and maxillary regions. And finally, I'll listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Alright, Ms. Boham. Exam complete. Your ears and lungs are clear, but your nose shows some inflammation and tenderness. The sinus exam is also tender.
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… bad. Is it something serious, Doctor? My head is feeling pretty full now. I don't like the sound of “inflammation.” Does that mean… infection? I have to go back to work tomorrow, you know. The drill… it's important. Is there something you can give me to make it better? Something quick?
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean infection, Ms. Boham. Inflammation can be caused by many things, including allergies or irritation. Based on your symptoms and the exam, it’s likely you’re experiencing sinusitis, probably triggered by the dust exposure at work. It could be a bacterial infection, but we don't have enough information to say for sure at this point. Given your symptoms and the fact you need to return to work tomorrow, I'm going to recommend a course of symptomatic treatment first. I'll prescribe a nasal saline rinse to help clear the passages and a decongestant to help with the congestion and pressure. I strongly advise you to avoid further dust exposure as much as possible. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve after a week, we'll need to consider further investigation, perhaps a CT scan to rule out a more serious infection. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh… that sounds expensive. And… scary. Is it really necessary? I… I don’t have insurance, you know. The dust… I try to wear a mask, but it’s hard when I’m working. It gets in everywhere. What if the mask isn't enough? Will I have to stop working? That’s… not possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Boham. A CT scan is not something I'm recommending right now. It's simply a precaution we would take if your symptoms don’t respond to treatment. It’s a tool to get more information, not a guaranteed procedure. As for the mask, you are correct. A simple dust mask may not be sufficient. We can discuss options for a more effective respirator. There are N95 masks available that offer better protection, but proper fit is crucial. We should also consider whether your workplace can provide better ventilation or other protective measures. We can document your concerns and possibly refer you to an occupational health specialist who can assess your work environment. For now, let's focus on the saline rinse and decongestant. I will write you a prescription for both. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe headache, facial pain, or vision changes – you need to seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. A respirator… that sounds good. Maybe I can ask my boss about that. And the saline rinse… is that easy to use? I don't want to make things worse. My head is still… full. This prescription… will it help me get back to work? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Boham. The saline rinse is very easy to use. It comes with instructions, but basically, you just dissolve a packet in warm water and use a bulb syringe or neti pot to flush out your nasal passages. It can feel a little strange at first, but it’s safe and effective. As for getting back to work, the decongestant should help relieve the pressure and congestion, allowing you to function more comfortably. However, it's important to avoid further dust exposure as much as possible. If your symptoms persist despite treatment, we'll need to consider other options. Remember, if you develop any new or worsening symptoms, especially fever, severe headache, or vision changes, seek immediate medical attention. I’m providing you with a referral to an occupational health specialist as well, should you wish to further assess your workplace conditions. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Duplichan. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your help. I will try the rinse and the medicine, and I’ll talk to my boss about the mask. Hopefully, it will get better. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Boham. I hope you feel better soon. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns.
