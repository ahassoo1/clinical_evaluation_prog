DOCTOR: Well, hello Tarin. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Fourney. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ve been experiencing some…well, numbness in my leg, and it’s become frequent enough that I thought it best to get it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though occasionally I feel it in my right as well.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Numbness, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Dr. Fourney. It’s not a complete loss of feeling, more like… pins and needles, and a sort of… dullness. It comes and goes, and I haven’t been able to pinpoint anything that consistently triggers it, or makes it stop, to be perfectly honest. It’s a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Let me see… if I’m recalling correctly, it started—very mildly—around late March, perhaps early April. It was so faint then that I initially dismissed it as simply sitting awkwardly. But it’s been progressively more noticeable since then, and more frequent, as I mentioned. It’s definitely not something I can ignore anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, roughly four months now. Has anything specific worsened it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I’ve tried to pay attention to that. Nothing immediately springs to mind. I do a fair amount of work sitting at a computer, of course—I’m a special effects artist and animator—and prolonged periods in that position might aggravate it slightly, but it’s difficult to say definitively. It seems to happen regardless of my activity level, or posture, really. I’ve tried different chairs, standing desks, and so on, with little change.
DOCTOR: Special effects, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Mostly digital, these days, though I do have some experience with practical effects as well. It’s… a demanding field, involving long hours and a lot of focused attention. But I enjoy it immensely. Is that relevant to the numbness, perhaps? I’m not entirely sure what would be, honestly. I’m happy to elaborate on my work if you think it might be helpful.
DOCTOR: Well, it's good to know what you do, but I doubt the artistry itself is to blame. Let's move on. Have you noticed any weakness in that leg at all?
PATIENT: Weakness… that’s something I haven’t specifically noticed, no. I walk normally, and I haven’t had any trouble with balance, or lifting things. I do occasionally feel a slight…tightness in my calf, on that same leg—the left one—but I chalked that up to general muscle fatigue from being on my feet, or sitting for extended periods. It’s not a debilitating weakness, or anything, just… a subtle sensation of constriction.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any pain accompanying this numbness or tightness?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no sharp pain. It's never been painful, just… disconcerting. It’s more of an unpleasant sensation, a kind of… buzzing, almost, along with the dullness I described earlier. The tightness isn’t painful either, just… noticeable. It doesn’t radiate anywhere, as far as I can tell; it’s localized to the calf muscle itself. I suppose if the numbness continues, it might become uncomfortable, but it hasn’t progressed to pain yet.
DOCTOR: Do you have any history of back problems?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Fourney. No history of back problems at all. I’ve always had a fairly strong back, and I’m generally quite careful about maintaining good posture. I did have a minor sprain in my shoulder a few years back—from lifting something too heavy—but that was treated promptly and resolved fully. I haven’t experienced any issues with my back, or neck, or spine. I do stretch regularly, though, if that’s of relevance.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get a quick physical exam, then. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Just let me know if you need me to adjust in any way.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in both legs. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. First, I’m going to tap these areas with a reflex hammer. This is perfectly normal, and shouldn’t hurt. Taps various points on Tarin’s knees and ankles with a reflex hammer. Okay. Both reflexes seem normal there. Now, I need you to try and resist as I push against your legs. Just a little resistance is fine. Tests Tarin’s leg strength, pushing against his limbs in different directions. Alright. Strength seems good as well. Now, I’m going to use this to test sensation. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Yes, I feel that. Right there. And now? That one felt… a little muted, actually. Not absent, but… less sharp than the other one. It’s subtle, but noticeable. It’s on the outer side of my left calf, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about this area?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one too. It feels… similar to the first one – a little less distinct than the sensation on my right leg. It's hard to explain. Like a dampened signal. Not painful, just… reduced. It’s the same area, I think - outer left calf. Is this what you expected, Doctor? I'm not attempting to lead you in any way - just trying to be as descriptive as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that is interesting. It sounds like we may have some diminished sensation on the left leg, as you've described. I'm going to do a quick neurological exam now, just to get a more complete picture. Can you close your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I'm ready when you are, Doctor. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, stand up slowly. Can you walk a few steps for me, heel-to-toe?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels… slightly off, actually. Not dramatically, but I seem to be compensating a bit with my right leg to maintain balance. It's subtle, though. Not something I would have noticed on a casual walk, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Now, can you try to touch your nose with your finger, alternating hands?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels… slightly less coordinated on my left side, again. Not terribly so, but I definitely have to concentrate a bit more to achieve the same precision as with my right hand. My left hand feels… a bit heavier, perhaps? It’s a subtle sensation, but noticeable when I focus on it. I hope that's helpful, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam I've done, it sounds like we might be dealing with some nerve compression in your left leg. It could be a number of things – a pinched nerve in your back, or even something a little more peripheral. But I'm not going to jump to conclusions just yet. We need some imaging to get a better look. I'm going to order an MRI of your lower back. That will help us rule out anything serious. Also, I want to do some blood work to check for any underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate your thoroughness, and I'm happy to do whatever is necessary to get a clear diagnosis. An MRI and blood work seem like a sensible next step. Do you need any information from me regarding insurance, or scheduling? I'm ready to proceed whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Let me just get your insurance information verified... Pauses, typing. Okay, that checks out. I'm going to have the nurse schedule you for an MRI at the imaging center downtown. They'll call you within 24 hours to set up an appointment. And the lab order for the blood work is already sent. You can go there anytime. I will review the results as soon as they're available, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, avoid any strenuous activity that might aggravate the symptoms, and if the numbness worsens, or you experience any weakness, or pain, come back immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and have answered all of my questions. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I’ll follow your instructions regarding activity, and I’ll be sure to contact you immediately if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, good. The nurse will be in shortly to go over discharge instructions. And please, don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Fourney. You have my word. Have a good day as well.
