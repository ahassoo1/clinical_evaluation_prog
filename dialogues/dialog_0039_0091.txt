DOCTOR: Hello Bianca, welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Kamahele. It good to meet you too. Well, lately I does be feeling awful thirsty, all the time. And hungry too! Even after I eat a good plate of food, I feel like I could eat again right away. It not making sense, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm, that does sound a little unusual. Feeling excessively thirsty and hungry, even after eating… alright. Let me just make a quick note of that. Bianca, just to clarify, how long have you been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Let me think now... it start maybe, oh, about two months ago? Not too bad at first, just a little more thirsty than usual. But it get worse and worse each week. The hunger come after, maybe a month ago. I does try to drink plenty water, but it don't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, two months… gradually worsening thirst, then the hunger joined in about a month ago. And drinking plenty of water isn’t really helping, is that right?
PATIENT: No, doctor. Plenty water, but I still feel dry as dust. And the hunger… it a strange hunger. Not like I haven't eat. Is like my body just… wanting more and more all the time. Is very uncomfortable, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Bianca, that sounds very frustrating. Okay. Now, besides the thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Let me see. I does feel tired a lot more than usual, yes. And I have to go to the bathroom more often too. Especially at night. Waking me up and everything. Is not good for my sleep! But besides that… I can't think of much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst, increased hunger, fatigue, and more frequent urination, especially at night. Alright, let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I never been a sickly person, really. Just the usual little colds and things. I does try to keep myself healthy, you know? Eat my greens, take walks… nothing serious ever. My husband, he does take me to the doctor for check-ups sometimes, but they always say I'm alright. I never had any problems before this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior major medical diagnoses. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Never been in the hospital, thank goodness! And no surgeries either. I does try to stay away from doctors as much as possible, you know? Only go when I really have to. So this… this is a bit worrying for me, to be honest. It not like me to be feeling this way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. No prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have diabetes, or any similar health issues?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Hmm. Let me think. My mother, she used to be very sick when she get old. I don't know what she had exactly, the doctors never really say much. But she used to drink plenty water all the time, and go to the bathroom a lot. And she lose a lot of weight. My husband, he says she might have had the sugar, but I don't know for sure. My father, he was always healthy as a horse, never sick a day in his life. As for my siblings… they all seem alright. But we don't see each other much, so I don’t know everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some symptoms that could point to diabetes, but you’re not certain. And your father was healthy, siblings unknown. We'll keep that in mind. Now, do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, doctor, I don't take any pills. I don't like taking medicine if I don't have to. And allergies… not really. I does get bitten by mosquitoes sometimes, but that’s all. Nothing serious. I eat everything, I don't have any food problems. My husband, he does have a bit of trouble with dust, but that’s him, not me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or known allergies. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a few other quick things. Then we can talk about what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds alright. Go ahead. I hope you find out what is wrong with me. This thirst and hunger is really bothering me, and waking up all night is not good. I need to be strong for my husband, you know? He depends on me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Bianca. We'll do our best. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Not terribly high, but something we’ll want to monitor. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look at your feet and legs… No swelling or obvious sores, that's good. I’m also going to check your skin turgor. Your skin seems a little dry, and it doesn’t spring back as quickly as it should. This can be a sign of dehydration. Now, let’s get a blood sugar test to rule a few things out. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. A blood sugar test sounds good. I am glad you are checking everything. My skin does feel dry, you are right. I does put lotion on it, but it don't seem to help much. And I drink plenty water, like I say. I just want to know what is wrong, so I can get it fixed. Is it serious, doctor? Is it the sugar?
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions just yet, Bianca. We need the test results first. It could be related to your blood sugar, but there are other possibilities too. Just a little pinch… Okay, we'll have the results in a few minutes. While we wait, let me ask you one more question. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision? Let me think… Now that you mention it… I does have to hold the newspaper a little closer now than I used to. And sometimes, things seem a little blurry, especially at night. I thought it was just my eyes getting old, you know? I never told my husband, he would just tell me to get glasses. But it is getting a little worse lately. Now that you ask, I does notice it. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, changes in vision, needing to hold things closer, some blurry vision, especially at night. That's something we need to take into account. Hmm… Your blood sugar is 220. That is significantly elevated. A normal reading is usually under 100, and even readings over 140 could indicate a problem. Bianca, based on your symptoms and this blood sugar reading, it is highly likely you have diabetes. I want to explain what that means and what we need to do next. It's manageable, but we need to get it under control. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Diabetes…? Oh dear. My mother… maybe that's what she had. I don't… I don't know anything about it. Manageable, you say? What does that mean? Will I be sick all the time? What about my husband? I need to be strong for him… Will I have to take pills? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca, take a deep breath. It is a lot to take in, but we’ll go through this together. Yes, it’s likely you have diabetes, and the good news is, it’s very manageable with proper care. It doesn’t mean you’ll be sick all the time, not at all. Many people live long, healthy lives with diabetes. What it means is that your body isn't making enough insulin, or isn’t using insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps sugar get from your blood into your cells for energy. When sugar builds up in your blood, it causes the symptoms you've been experiencing – the thirst, hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, and blurry vision. We’ll need to start with some lifestyle changes – diet and exercise. We’ll also need to monitor your blood sugar regularly to see how well things are working. You may need medication eventually, possibly pills, but we'll start with lifestyle changes and see how those go. It’s not always painful, but you may have to poke your finger a few times a day to check your sugar. We’ll also need to get you referred to a diabetes educator who can teach you more about managing the condition and a nutritionist to help with your diet. Your husband can support you, but you’ll be the one in control. The important thing is to get started. Do you have any questions right now?
PATIENT: Oh dear, so much to take in... A diabetes educator and a nutritionist... Will they be nice? I don't like strangers poking around, you know? And pills… I really don't like pills. You think I can still live a normal life? Still cook for my husband, still go to church…? Is it contagious? Will he get it too? I worry so much… Is it my fault? Did I do something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be worried, Bianca. It’s completely natural to feel overwhelmed. And you are absolutely right to ask all these questions. Let me reassure you: the diabetes educator and nutritionist are lovely people. They are there to help you, not to poke around. They’ll explain everything clearly and patiently. They won’t do anything without explaining it first. And yes, absolutely, you can still live a normal life! You can still cook for your husband, still go to church, still do all the things you enjoy. It just means making a few adjustments. No, it’s not your fault, and you didn’t do anything wrong. Diabetes can happen to anyone, often due to genetics or lifestyle factors. It's not contagious, so your husband won't get it from you. The important thing is to take it one step at a time. We'll start with the lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – and see how that goes. If those aren't enough, we can discuss medication options. I'm going to write you a referral to a diabetes educator and a nutritionist. I’ll also give you some information pamphlets about diabetes. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you're doing. Do you feel up to discussing some initial dietary changes now, or would you prefer to wait until you see the nutritionist?
PATIENT: I think… I think I can try to talk about the diet now. Just a little. I don't want to overwhelm my head too much. I do love to cook, but my husband, he loves his doubles and roti. It will be hard to change things. He not a man who likes change, you know? And I does bake him cake every week… is his favorite thing. Will I have to stop baking?
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. We'll take it slow. You absolutely don't have to stop baking altogether! Completely restricting everything you enjoy is not the goal. It’s about making healthier choices and finding a balance. We’ll talk about portion control, swapping out some ingredients for healthier options, and maybe baking less frequently. For example, you could reduce the amount of sugar in the cake, or use whole-wheat flour instead of white flour. We’ll work on finding recipes that are both delicious and good for your health. And your husband… it's good that you're thinking about him. It’s important to involve him in this process. Maybe he’d be willing to try some healthier versions of his favorite dishes with you?
PATIENT: He might… he does love me. Maybe I can make him a doubles with less oil. And a roti with more vegetables. He does eat a lot of potatoes, though… is that bad? What about the potatoes? And the mangoes? I love my mangoes. Will I have to give up my mangoes too? It not a life if I can't eat my mangoes!
DOCTOR: Okay, no, you don’t have to give up your mangoes! Everything in moderation, Bianca. Potatoes and mangoes are perfectly fine as part of a healthy diet. We just need to be mindful of portion sizes and how often you're having them. Potatoes are a source of carbohydrates, and too many carbs can raise your blood sugar. So, maybe instead of having a large portion of mashed potatoes, you could have a smaller portion with some steamed vegetables. And mangoes are delicious and full of vitamins, but they are also high in sugar. So, maybe you could enjoy a smaller portion as a treat, instead of having a large portion every day. The goal is not to deprive yourself, but to make healthier choices and find a balance that works for you. It's about small changes, adding more vegetables, reducing portion sizes, and being mindful of what you're eating. I’ll give you some information on carbohydrate counting, and the nutritionist can help you create a meal plan that includes all your favorite foods in a healthy way. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable. Carbohydrate counting… I will have to remember that. It sounds complicated, but I am a quick learner, I think. And the nutritionist, she will help me, yes? She will make it easier? You have been very kind, Doctor. I feel a little less scared now. Thank you. I think… I think I can do this. Maybe.
DOCTOR: You absolutely can, Bianca. And yes, the nutritionist will make it much easier. She’s an expert at creating meal plans and teaching people how to manage their diets. She’ll work with you to find recipes you enjoy and help you understand carbohydrate counting. I’m glad I could reassure you. It takes courage to face a new diagnosis, and you’re doing a fantastic job already. Alright, let's wrap things up for today. I'm going to write you the referrals to the diabetes educator and nutritionist. I'll also give you some information pamphlets about diabetes and carbohydrate counting. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you're doing. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, doctor, I think that is everything. You explain things very well. I will read the pamphlets tonight and try to remember everything. And I will call the office if I get confused. Thank you again, Doctor Kamahele. You are a good doctor. I feel much better now, even though it is a lot to take in. I will try my best to make my husband proud and to stay healthy. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. I’m glad I could help. And you’ve already taken the first step by acknowledging the diagnosis and wanting to make a change. That’s fantastic. Remember, it’s a journey, and there will be ups and downs. But you’re not alone, and we’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Take care, Bianca. And please, don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
