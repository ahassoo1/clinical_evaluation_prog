DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Dr. Sham, is it? Yes, well, truthfully, I haven’t the slightest idea why I’m here. My husband insisted. Something about… a check-up? I’ve just moved to the area, you see, and he wants me to establish care. Honestly, the fuss. It's all very… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Right, establishing care. That’s perfectly reasonable, even if you don’t feel particularly unwell. It’s good your husband is thinking ahead. Let's just go through a few things, then. Just to get a baseline, you understand. Do you have any current medical problems – anything that bothers you regularly?
PATIENT: Bothers me? Goodness. At my age, everything bothers me, dear. But I suppose… no, nothing specific. A little stiffness in the mornings, but that’s just age. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, naturally. But I have glasses. Really, I don't go to doctors for… aches and pains. It's a waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Stiffness… eyesight. Alright. And have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes. Now you're asking me to remember things from… decades ago. Let me see. I believe… something with my blood pressure, years ago. But it was nothing serious. They gave me a little pill, and that was that. Honestly, I can't recall the details. It was a long time ago, and I’ve had a very full life, you understand. A very full life.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure… okay. Do you remember what kind of pill you were on, or for how long?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear, absolutely not. A small white one, I think? Or perhaps it was pink? They all look the same after a while, don't they? And I stopped taking it… well, a long time ago. The doctor said I didn’t need it anymore. I simply don’t concern myself with such trivial things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Yes, I believe so. Something with my… gallbladder, perhaps? It was quite a while ago, and rather unpleasant, if I recall correctly. And… oh dear, I’m getting terribly confused. It was in a hospital, naturally. A very large hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder surgery. Do you remember roughly when that was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Decades ago, certainly. Before… before my granddaughter was born, I think. And she’s… well, she’s a grown woman now, with children of her own. It was a very long time ago. Really, I don’t see why we’re dwelling on all this. It’s history, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright, a long time ago. And, if you don’t mind me asking, does anyone in your family have any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… a complicated bunch, they were. My mother had… something with her heart, I believe. And my brother… he had a touch of diabetes, but he didn’t take care of himself, you see. A very stubborn man. Really, most of them didn't live long enough to have significant medical problems. It's hardly relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don't believe in filling myself with all sorts of… potions and pills. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, perhaps. But that’s it. I prefer to rely on a healthy diet and… common sense, you understand. All these medications… they just cause more problems than they solve.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, dear. Let me see… I believe I had a bit of a reaction to some sort of… lotion, years ago. Made my skin itch terribly. But I can’t recall what it was. Really, I don’t bother with those fancy creams and lotions anymore. Simple soap and water are perfectly adequate.
DOCTOR: Alright. A possible skin reaction, years ago. Now, before we move on, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Honestly, dear, at my age, my lifestyle is rather… limited. I enjoy reading, and spending time with my family, when they visit. I don't go out much anymore. It’s all rather… quiet. And I certainly don't partake in any… strenuous activities. Really, I’m just trying to maintain some semblance of dignity.
DOCTOR: Alright. Quiet lifestyle. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a general sense of things. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your eyes, ears, nose and throat. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Really? All that poking and prodding? I must say, I find it rather… unnecessary. But if you insist. Just… be gentle, please. And don’t take too long. I have a luncheon planned with my granddaughter later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could just have a seat here, we'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I do hope this doesn't take too long. Honestly, all this fuss… it's simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ear canals clear, some cerumen present. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling noted. Fundi appear normal, some mild lens changes consistent with age. Thyroid is normal in size and consistency, no nodules felt. Alright, everything seems generally within normal limits for your age. I would like to order some routine blood work, just to get a baseline. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a specimen. But… if you insist. A complete… what was it? As long as it doesn't involve needles, I suppose. My husband will be pleased you’re being thorough, at least. Though I still maintain this is all quite unnecessary.
DOCTOR: The blood work does require a small blood draw, I’m afraid. It’s a standard procedure, and we’ll be as gentle as possible. We can schedule that for you at the lab downstairs. Do you have any concerns about the procedure?
PATIENT: Oh, needles! Of course. Honestly, I detest needles. I faint, you know. Or at least, I used to. I haven't tried it in years. But it's… unpleasant. Very unpleasant. Is there absolutely no alternative? I simply cannot abide needles.
DOCTOR: Well, while there aren’t alternatives to blood work for a comprehensive assessment, we can take things slowly. We can have a phlebotomist who is experienced with anxious patients. They can talk you through the process, and we can have you lie down during the draw. We can even use a smaller gauge needle. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A smaller needle… that sounds marginally better, I suppose. And lying down… yes, that might be wise. And someone… experienced? I certainly don't want a novice poking around in my veins. Very well. As long as they are gentle, and it doesn’t take too long. I have my luncheon, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve scheduled you for blood work at the lab downstairs. They’ve been notified about your anxiety and will have an experienced phlebotomist ready for you. They’ll be expecting you. It should take about 30 minutes, including the wait. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I suppose that’s all. Honestly, I’m rather relieved it’s almost over. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long at that lab. And tell that phlebotomist to be very gentle. Really, all this fuss… it's simply dreadful. Thank you, Doctor. I think.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Engelhaupt. We’ll do our best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. The lab is just down the hall, and the receptionist will be happy to assist you. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Have a pleasant luncheon. I think that concludes our visit for today.
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Thank you. I do hope my granddaughter enjoys the tea sandwiches. Good day. .
