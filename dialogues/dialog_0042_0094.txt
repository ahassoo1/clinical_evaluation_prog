DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Yes. I… the paper said something about learning? About… things? My husband, he said I should come. He worries too much, always. I work with metal, you see. Sheet metal. It’s… a job.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like this appointment was suggested to discuss some concerns related to your work with sheet metal. Just to be clear, are you experiencing any specific health issues because of your job, or is your husband concerned about potential issues arising from it down the line?
PATIENT: Down the line? Hmm. Not… not really issues. My hands get cuts sometimes. Small cuts. Bandaids fix them. And it’s dusty, yes. Very dusty. I wear a mask, mostly. He just… he reads things. On the computer. About… everything being bad for you. He worries about my lungs, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so small cuts to your hands that you manage with bandages, and dust exposure at work, which you try to mitigate with a mask. That's helpful to know. Has the amount of dust exposure changed recently, or has it been consistent over time?
PATIENT: Consistent. Always the same. Metal is… metal. It makes dust when you cut it. It's just… a fact. I don't know about 'exposure'. Is that a bad word? He uses lots of words I don't understand.
DOCTOR: No, “exposure” isn’t a bad word at all, Ms. Fontanazza. It just means being around something – in this case, the metal dust. Your husband is right to be thoughtful, and it’s good he’s looking out for your health. Let’s talk a little more about your lungs. Do you have any symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath, or wheezing?
PATIENT: Coughing… sometimes. But I smoke. Everyone in my family smokes. It's…normal. And shortness of breath? When I climb stairs, maybe. But I'm not…thin. I'm a solid woman. Solid. And wheezing? What is wheezing? Like a teapot?
DOCTOR: Wheezing is a whistling sound when you breathe, like a teapot, yes, that's a good way to describe it. So, you do experience some coughing, and occasional shortness of breath with exertion, like climbing stairs. You mentioned smoking is common in your family – how long have you been smoking, and how many cigarettes a day, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh. A long time. Since I was very young. My mother smoked, my grandmother smoked. Everyone. Maybe… ten? Sometimes more when I'm stressed. The metal work is…hard. Sometimes the boss is…difficult. It helps with that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so honest with me, Ms. Fontanazza. That’s very helpful. Ten cigarettes a day, sometimes more when you’re stressed. And you've been smoking since you were young. Let's move on to some other general health questions, just to get a complete picture. Have you had any other health problems in the past, like asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Pneumonia… I think so. When I was a child. Very sick. Very high fever. But that was…a long time ago. Asthma? No. Bronchitis… maybe? I cough a lot in the winter. Everyone does. It's cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of pneumonia as a child, and winter coughs that you attribute to the cold weather. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for other reasons?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Not that I remember. Hospital… once, maybe? When my son was born. That was…very long ago. He's a grown man now. Works in an office. Very safe. Not like metal work.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about your son. So, no significant surgeries or hospitalizations other than the birth of your son. Now, thinking about your family – are there any health problems that run in your family, besides smoking?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… her heart. She had trouble with her heart. Very old age, the doctors said. And my grandfather… he had something with his breathing. Always coughing. Like me, maybe? But he didn't smoke. He liked tea. Lots of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble in your mother and breathing problems in your grandfather. That’s helpful information. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I like spicy food. Very spicy. Makes me sweat. Medications… I don't take much. Pain pills sometimes, when my back hurts from the metal work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and pain pills occasionally for back pain. Just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. What medications do you take when your back hurts?
PATIENT: Uh… I don't remember the name. Small white pills. My husband buys them. He knows everything about pills. He worries too much. I just take them when I need to.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we can try to find out what they are later. It’s good your husband helps with that. Now, before we move on to the exam, are you currently experiencing any pain or discomfort anywhere besides your back?
PATIENT: No. Just the back sometimes. When I lift heavy metal. Or when the boss yells. That's…stressful. He's a difficult man. And my hands ache sometimes. From the cuts. But nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, back and hand discomfort at times. I understand. Alright, Ms. Fontanazza, if you're comfortable, I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your hands. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do. Metal isn't going to cut itself.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's get this done quickly. Please have a seat on the examination table and lean forward slightly. I’m going to listen to your lungs first. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Hurry up, please. The metal... it waits for no one.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm listening to your lungs now. I hear some mild wheezing in the lower lobes, especially when you exhale. It's not severe, but it’s something we should pay attention to. And now I’ll listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Again, not immediately concerning, but worth noting. I see some small scars and calluses on your hands, consistent with metal work, and a few small, healing cuts. Any pain when I touch these areas?
PATIENT: A little. When you press hard. It's… metal. It's always cutting something. The boss wants it faster, faster, faster. He doesn’t understand. And the wheezing… is that from the smoking? I knew it. He’ll be mad.
DOCTOR: It's very likely the wheezing is related to the smoking, Ms. Fontanazza, along with the dust exposure at work. And the pain in your hands is understandable given the nature of your job. I'm not going to tell your husband anything he doesn't need to know. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your health. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam I’ve done, it sounds like you have some mild work-related strain on your hands and possible early signs of lung irritation from smoking and dust exposure. The heart murmur is something we’ll want to keep an eye on, but doesn’t require immediate action. To get a clearer picture of what's going on with your lungs, I’d like to order a chest x-ray and a lung function test, also called spirometry. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Tests? More waiting? Metal… I need to get back to work. Is it…expensive? I don’t have much money. And I don't like hospitals. They smell funny.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Fontanazza. The x-ray and lung function test will give us a better understanding of your lung health. The lung function test is a simple breathing exercise that takes about 15 minutes, and the x-ray is quick and painless. As for the cost, I know you mentioned having limited funds. We do have some programs that can help reduce the cost of tests for patients with lower incomes. I will have my staff check to see if you qualify for any assistance. Also, the tests are relatively inexpensive compared to some other medical procedures. We can also schedule them at an outpatient imaging center that's closer to you, which may be more convenient. Would you like me to have my staff explore those options for you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can get back to work. But no hospitals. And tell your staff to find the cheapest place. My husband will be mad if I spend too much money.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will make sure to note your preference for avoiding hospitals and prioritize finding the most affordable options. My staff will contact you with the scheduling details and information about any potential financial assistance programs. In the meantime, I strongly recommend trying to cut back on smoking. I know it’s difficult, but even a small reduction can make a difference. And we can discuss some strategies to help you do that during a future appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. I have metal to cut.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. I understand. My staff will be in touch shortly to schedule your x-ray and lung function test. Thank you for coming in today. If anything changes or you develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and please try to be careful with the metal work. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Goodbye.
