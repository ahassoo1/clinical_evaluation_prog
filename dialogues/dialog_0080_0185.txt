DOCTOR: Hi Zelina, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't really have time for this. It's… my breath. It smells bad. People have been… hinting. It's embarrassing, okay? Just tell me what I need to do to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand it's embarrassing, and you're short on time. We'll get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. “Bad breath,” or halitosis, can have a lot of causes, some simple, some that need a little more looking into. First, can you tell me a little more about when you notice it's bad?
PATIENT: Ugh, when? I don’t actively notice, alright? That’s the problem! Other people do. Mostly at work, I guess. It’s a dusty job, highway maintenance. Lots of… everything. But it’s not like I’m not brushing, you know? I do. Sometimes. Look, is it just because of the job? Can you just… prescribe something?
DOCTOR: Okay, highway maintenance – lots of dust and exposure, that’s helpful to know. And you do brush sometimes, alright. It's good you're thinking about it. Before we jump to a prescription, let’s just quickly rule out some of the more common things. "Sometimes" brushing… how often would you say is “sometimes”?
PATIENT: Honestly? When I remember. Okay, look, don’t judge. Things have been… stressful. Divorced, right? It’s not like I’m exactly keeping a schedule. Maybe three times a week? If that? Does it really matter? Just tell me if it’s something serious and what I need to do.
DOCTOR: No judgement at all, Zelina. Divorce is incredibly stressful, and it's completely understandable that routines get disrupted. Three times a week is… less frequent than recommended, yes. Brushing twice a day is ideal to remove food particles and bacteria. Okay, so infrequent brushing can definitely contribute. But let's dig a little deeper to make sure nothing else is going on. Do you notice any gum bleeding when you brush?
PATIENT: Bleeding? No. Not really. Maybe a little sometimes, but I just ignore it. It's… it's not a big deal. Honestly, I don't really look when I brush, alright? I just… get it done. Is this going to take all day? I have a shift starting in a couple of hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant bleeding, got it. I understand you're pressed for time, and I’ll be as quick as possible. Alright. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I don't have a fever or anything. My teeth don't hurt. Look, I just want my breath to not smell bad, okay? It's a simple problem. I doubt it's anything serious.
DOCTOR: You're right, it may not be serious. Just trying to cover all the bases. Okay, no fever, no tooth pain. Do you experience any dry mouth, or do you notice a change in your sense of taste?
PATIENT: Dry mouth… sometimes. It’s hot out there on the highway, you know? And I drink a lot of coffee to stay awake. Maybe that does it? Taste… I don’t know. Everything tastes… normal, I guess. I mostly taste dust and coffee anyway. Can we just skip this part? I really need to know if I just need a stronger mouthwash or what.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry mouth from heat and coffee – that's a possibility. We're getting some good information here. Alright. Let’s do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. Just a look inside your mouth, check your gums, and I’ll listen to your lungs quickly. It will only take a moment. Can you open wide and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Fine. Ah. Hurry up, alright? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything looks relatively okay. Your lungs sound good. I do see a little bit of gum inflammation, which could contribute to the odor, especially with infrequent brushing. I don't see anything immediately alarming. Your weight is listed as 79 kg and your height as 176 cm, giving you a BMI of 25.5. That’s considered overweight. I don’t want to lecture, but that can sometimes contribute to general body odor, as well. Now, about the breath… I suspect the combination of infrequent brushing, gum inflammation, dry mouth, and potentially diet is the biggest culprit. A stronger mouthwash might mask the problem temporarily, but it won’t fix it.
PATIENT: See? I told you it wasn’t serious. So, what do I do? What do I actually need to buy? And is there anything I can take to get rid of the dry mouth? Because the coffee is non-negotiable, alright? I need the coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright, coffee is non-negotiable, understood. Okay, here’s what I recommend: First, switch to an electric toothbrush. They’re much more effective at removing plaque. Second, brush twice a day, for two minutes each time. Set a timer if you have to. Third, floss daily. Seriously. Fourth, a fluoride mouthwash is fine, but it’s not the main solution. For the dry mouth, try sugar-free gum or lozenges to stimulate saliva production. There are also artificial saliva products available over-the-counter. I recommend Biotene. And finally, make sure you’re drinking enough water throughout the day. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a high-fluoride toothpaste to help strengthen your enamel and reduce sensitivity. It can also help with odor. Does that all sound manageable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Electric toothbrush, floss… it sounds like a lot. But okay, I guess I can try. The water I can do. The prescription is good. So, if I do all that, it should get better? And I don’t need to come back unless it doesn’t? Because honestly, I really don’t want to be here again. And… is there anything I can do about the weight thing right now, or is that a whole other conversation? I’m already stressed enough.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you stick with those habits – electric toothbrush, twice-daily brushing, flossing, hydration, and use the high-fluoride toothpaste – you should see a significant improvement in a few weeks. And no, you don't need to come back unless it doesn't get better. If you're still noticing a problem after a month, then we can consider other possibilities. As for the weight… we can talk about that, but you're right, it's a whole other conversation. We can schedule a separate appointment to discuss healthy eating and exercise if you’re interested. No pressure at all. Right now, let’s focus on the breath. I’ll send the prescription to your local pharmacy. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you, I guess. I hope this actually works. And don't bother sending me a bill, alright? I'm not insured, remember?
