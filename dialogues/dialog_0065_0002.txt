DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks. They don't work so good no more. Takes me a long time to… you know… go. It’s a bother, really. Not painful, just… slow.
DOCTOR: I see. So you’re experiencing difficulty with urination – specifically, it takes a prolonged amount of time to empty your bladder. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Prolonged… that’s a fancy word for slow, isn’t it? It just… doesn’t rush out like it used to. And sometimes… sometimes I feel like there’s still some left in there, even after I’m done.
DOCTOR: Right. And this sensation of incomplete emptying – how often would you say that occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Hmm… let me think. Not every time, no. Maybe… two or three times a week? It’s hard to say for sure, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I just know it’s enough to make me go back to the bathroom a little while later.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Like the color? Well, now that you mention it… sometimes it's a little… cloudy. Not always, but sometimes. And… is it normal to smell it sometimes? I'm an old lady, Doctor, things smell funny these days!
DOCTOR: Cloudy urine and a noticeable odor can indicate several things. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not a bit. Just… frustrating. And a little embarrassing. It's not a nice thing to have to talk about, you know? My husband, he just tells me to drink less water, but that doesn't seem right.
DOCTOR: While fluid intake is a factor, simply reducing it isn’t always the answer. Are you experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don't think so. I haven’t felt hot, anyway. And chills… not really. Oh, wait. My bones ache sometimes. But that’s just… old age, isn’t it? As for my tummy… it feels alright. A little bit soft, maybe. But no pain, definitely not.
DOCTOR: Let’s take a look at your chart. I see here you have a history of hypertension, controlled with medication. And… some mild osteoarthritis. Have you had any recent infections, such as a urinary tract infection?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the blood pressure. Gets a bit high sometimes, but the pills seem to keep it steady. And my joints… they creak and groan like an old ship, I tell you! Infections… now that’s a good question. I don’t recall. I’ve been to the hospital a time or two, but I can’t rightly remember why. It was a while ago.
DOCTOR: Very well. It’s difficult to pinpoint without a more comprehensive history. We'll need to run some tests to determine the cause of your urinary symptoms. I'd like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture to check for infection. We'll also do a post-void residual volume measurement to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests… oh dear. Well, I don't like the sound of tests, but if you think it’s necessary… alright. Just… please don’t take too much of my blood, Doctor. And explain what you’re doing, okay? I get a bit nervous when I don’t understand. A post-void… what did you call it? The thing after I pee?
DOCTOR: Yes, the post-void residual volume measurement. It simply involves using an ultrasound to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder after you urinate. No bloodwork is required. We'll have you empty your bladder as completely as possible, then use the ultrasound to assess the volume. A nurse will explain the procedure in detail before we begin. Is there anything else you would like to discuss before we proceed?
PATIENT: Ultrasound… that sounds… less scary than needles. Alright, that’s good. And a nurse will explain… yes, that’s a good idea. I always forget things so easily. Hmm… let me see… No, I think that’s all. Just… try to be gentle, Doctor. And thank you for listening to an old lady complain about her waterworks.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will order the tests now and the nurse will be in shortly to review the process and collect a sample. Please inform her of any medications you are currently taking. We’ll take it from there. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, the pills… yes, I have a bag full. For my blood pressure and my arthritis… and something else. I usually take them with my breakfast. Just a minute… Oh dear, where did I put them…? Perhaps the nurse can help me remember. No, I don’t think there’s anything else right now. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse review your medication list as well. Please remain seated and I’ll have her in shortly.
PATIENT: .
