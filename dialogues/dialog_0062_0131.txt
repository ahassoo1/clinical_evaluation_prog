DOCTOR: Hi Mykeisha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. DeCosta, nice to meet you too. Well, the thing is, my blood pressure's been a bit high lately. That’s what the pharmacy told me when I went to get something for a headache, and they said I should see a doctor about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good you followed up on that. It’s always best to get things checked out. "A bit high" can mean different things to different people, so could you tell me roughly what the pharmacy said your blood pressure was when they checked it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… the pharmacist, she wrote it down on a piece of paper. Hold on a sec… Okay, here it is. It says… 140 over 90, I think. Something like that. It was the top number that was the problem, she said. I don't really understand all that, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, 140 over 90. That is a bit elevated, you’re right. The top number is your systolic pressure, which is the pressure when your heart beats, and the bottom number is your diastolic, the pressure when your heart rests between beats. Normally, we like to see those numbers below 130/80. Do you know if you’ve ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or have you had it checked regularly in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. This is the first time anyone's really paid it any mind, to be honest. I usually only go to the doctor when I’m sick with a cold or something. I haven't had a proper check-up in… oh gosh, probably five years or more. I just turned 36 last month, so I guess it’s time I started paying more attention.
DOCTOR: You're right, 36 is a good time to get things checked out regularly! It’s good you’re thinking about that now. Okay, so this is new for you. Aside from the headache that led you to the pharmacy, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… tired, sometimes. But I work two jobs, so I figured it was just that. I'm a home health aide and I do some cleaning on the side. It keeps me busy, that's for sure. I get a little breathless sometimes when I’m rushing around, but nothing too serious. I just thought it was from all the running.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and occasional breathlessness... those could be related to a lot of things, but it’s good to note them. And yes, working two jobs is definitely tiring! Do you have any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My grandfather, on my mom’s side, he had something wrong with his heart, I think. He was always sick, though, with all sorts of things. And my aunt, she had a stroke a few years back. She was a smoker, if that makes a difference. But my mom, she’s fine as far as I know. Never had any problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, so grandfather with heart issues and an aunt with a stroke—that's helpful to know. Family history can definitely play a role. And yes, smoking is a big risk factor. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My mom always said they were terrible for you, so I just stayed away from them. I do drink sometimes, a glass of wine with dinner maybe two or three times a week. But that's it. I'm not a big drinker.
DOCTOR: Good to know. That's very helpful. And a glass or two of wine isn't typically a concern. Now, let’s talk about any medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements. Do you take anything regularly?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a multivitamin every day, just to keep me going. And I take something for my allergies, a little pink pill. It's just cetirizine, I think. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take ibuprofen. But that's it, really. Nothing else. Does that include things like creams or ointments? Because I use a bit of muscle rub sometimes, after work.
DOCTOR: Yes, that includes creams and ointments too, thank you for mentioning that. So, multivitamin, cetirizine for allergies, ibuprofen as needed, and muscle rub. That's good to know. Okay, before we do a quick physical exam, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had any bad reactions to anything. My mom always said I had a strong stomach. I can eat just about anything. Though I don’t really like shellfish, but that's not an allergy, just a preference.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright, no known allergies. Okay, let's just do a quick check of your blood pressure again to confirm the pharmacy's reading, and then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and just feel your abdomen. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Systolic is 142, diastolic is 91. So it’s consistent with what the pharmacy found. A little elevated. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly noted. Everything sounds and feels normal so far. It's good we've got a baseline now. Given your blood pressure readings and family history, I think it's important to investigate this a bit further. I'd like to order some blood work and a basic EKG to rule out any underlying causes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible. If you think it’s best, then go ahead. I trust your judgment. Blood work and an EKG, right? Is that just a simple test? I don’t mind needles, but I don't want anything too complicated.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, thank you. Yes, blood work and a basic EKG. The blood work will just be a standard panel to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and some other basic markers. And the EKG is very simple – we just stick a few little stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't involve needles, and it doesn't hurt at all. It's completely non-invasive. I’ll write you a lab order. You can go to the lab across the street at your convenience. They’re open until 5pm today. Once we get those results back, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect. Stickers, no needles, good. I can definitely do that. Across the street, you say? That’s convenient. I'll head over there this afternoon, then. And we’ll talk about the results when you get them? Okay. Should I be doing anything special in the meantime? Like, change my diet or anything? I’m not a big cook, so complicated recipes are out of the question.
DOCTOR: Good. I’m glad that sounds manageable. In the meantime, just try to maintain a relatively healthy diet. It doesn't have to be anything drastic. Focus on eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein, and limiting processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive salt. Staying hydrated is also important. As for exercise, even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can be beneficial. But don’t stress about it too much right now. Let's get the test results back first, and then we can tailor a plan specifically for you. Here’s the order. They will need your insurance information, so please bring your card with you. Do you have any questions for me before you head over there?
PATIENT: Okay, fruits, vegetables, walking, no stress. I can handle that. My Medicare card is right here, too. No, I think that covers everything. You explained it all very clearly, Dr. DeCosta. Thank you. I’ll go to the lab this afternoon, and I'll see you again when you get the results. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. I’m glad I could help. And thank you for coming in. We'll get those results back quickly, and we'll go from there. If you have any questions or concerns before then, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good afternoon, and please take care.
PATIENT: You too, Dr. DeCosta! I will.
