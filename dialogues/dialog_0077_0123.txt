DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itchiness, you see. It’s been bothering me for a little while now. Not terrible, but just…constant. It's all over, really.
DOCTOR: Constant, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Not like a rash, exactly. More…dry, and it just feels itchy. It’s worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. I’ve been putting lotion on it, but it doesn’t really help for long.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…it started, I guess, maybe a month or so ago? It was just a little thing at first, barely noticeable. Then it just…gradually got more and more irritating. It's hard to say exactly, you know? Time just slips away these days.
DOCTOR: It certainly does. A month… alright. And is the itchiness localized to any particular areas, or truly all over as you mentioned?
PATIENT: Well, it’s pretty much everywhere. My arms, legs…my back is especially bad, but I can’t really reach back there very well to scratch! And it’s on my tummy, too. It doesn’t seem to be any one spot, just…general discomfort. It's not raised or anything, just…red and itchy. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Ms. Cassimatis. No rash, redness and itchiness all over… and worse at night. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the itchiness?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. No, not really. No fever, no tiredness…nothing like that. I haven’t lost any weight, and I’m eating okay. Oh! Now that I think of it, my skin feels a little rougher than usual, even with the lotion. But that could just be from the itching, I suppose. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. And are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little something for my blood pressure now and then, but that’s it. Nothing regularly. I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible, if I can. My mother always said they just create more problems than they solve! And I haven't changed anything in my routine, not soaps or detergents or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I used to get mosquito bites really bad when I was a kid, but that's about it. Never had a serious reaction to anything. My husband used to tease me that I could eat anything! Though, now that I think about it, I haven’t had shellfish in years… just haven't been in the mood. Does that count? I don't think I'm allergic, exactly. Just…prefer not to.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, Ms. Cassimatis, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to take a closer look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'm not a doctor, you know! Just an old lady with itchy skin. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie down on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I’m going to gently examine your skin, starting with your arms and legs. Hmm… the skin does appear dry and slightly inflamed. No visible rash or lesions, but there is some mild excoriation, consistent with scratching. It's generalized as you mentioned. Skin turgor is slightly decreased, indicating mild dehydration. Any tenderness or pain when I touch here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little bit on my back, Doctor. Especially right around my shoulder blades. It's hard to reach, so I probably scratch at it more than I realize. It's not sharp pain, just…irritated. Like a constant ache, you know? It’s probably just from rubbing against my chair all day. I do a lot of reading.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to finish the examination now. Okay. The skin on your abdomen is also dry and mildly inflamed, consistent with your description. No other significant findings. Based on my examination and your history, it appears you are experiencing generalized pruritus – that's the medical term for itching. There are many potential causes, Ms. Cassimatis, ranging from simple dry skin to underlying medical conditions. Given your age and history, my initial suspicion is dry skin, possibly exacerbated by mild dehydration. However, we should rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests already? Well, I suppose if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I always worry about tests, you know? My husband used to say I was a bit of a hypochondriac. But I trust your judgment. A complete blood count and…what was the other one? A basic metabolic…panel? Sounds complicated. If it will help figure out what's causing this itch, then yes, please go ahead. Do I need to fast for any of them?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be concerned about tests, Ms. Cassimatis. We'll take everything one step at a time. Yes, the basic metabolic panel does require an eight-hour fast. So, if we schedule those tests for tomorrow morning, you would need to refrain from eating or drinking anything after midnight tonight, except for water. The complete blood count doesn’t require fasting. Now, regarding the cost of these tests, I'm aware you mentioned not having insurance. I can explore options to help reduce the expense, perhaps through a local assistance program or a discounted rate at the lab. Let me make a note of that and we can discuss it further after the tests are ordered. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor! Thank you so much. I do worry about the cost, you know? I’m on a fixed income. Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated. A discount would be a blessing. So, eight hours fasting for the…basic metabolic thing…got it. And nothing to worry about for the blood count. I think I can manage that. Just hoping it's not something serious, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cassimatis. We'll do everything we can to make this as easy and affordable as possible. We’ll start with these tests, and then we can discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to apply a fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day, especially after bathing. Avoid hot water and harsh soaps, as these can further dry out your skin. And please, try to drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated. Now, while we’re waiting for the results, if the itching becomes unbearable or you develop any other symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, or weight loss, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Moisturizer, plenty of water, and avoid hot water… I can manage that. And I'll contact you if anything changes. Thank you so much for your kindness and patience. It’s a relief to finally be getting to the bottom of this itch. I was starting to think I was going crazy! So, shall we get these tests scheduled?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cassimatis. Let me just access the scheduling system… Alright, I've scheduled your blood work for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM at the lab across the street. You’ll need to bring your identification and this requisition form, which I’ll print out for you now. The lab technician will explain the procedure. It’s a relatively quick process, and the results should be available in a few days. We’ll contact you as soon as we receive them to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions regarding the scheduling or the procedure?
PATIENT: No, I think I’ve got it. 8:00 AM tomorrow, bring this form, and they’ll explain everything. That sounds manageable. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not dismissing my concerns. I think that’s everything. I’ll see you when the results are back. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day as well, and please, try to get some rest.
PATIENT: .
