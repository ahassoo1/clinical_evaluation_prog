DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about this… tiredness. And this awful habit I’ve gotten back. It’s embarrassing, really. I just… feel weak all the time, and I keep wanting to eat dirt. Yes, dirt. Like, from the garden. Don’t look at me like that, dear. It’s not something I want to do. It just… calls to me. And it’s been getting worse lately. Can we just get this sorted quickly? I have errands.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Hardenburgh. It takes courage to discuss things that are difficult or embarrassing. We will certainly try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. To start, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not courage, it’s just… I don’t have time for fuss. And it’s not just any tiredness. It’s… deep. Like my bones are heavy. It doesn't matter how much I sleep, I wake up feeling like I haven't rested at all. I used to be able to work all day, gardening, cleaning, everything. Now? I’m lucky if I can get through a few chores before needing a nap. And even then, it’s not a good nap. It’s just… lying there. Does that make sense? It’s been going on for… oh, a good few months, at least. Maybe six? I don't really keep track, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Hardenburgh. A deep, persistent fatigue despite adequate sleep is certainly concerning. Six months is a significant duration. And regarding this… urge to eat dirt, could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh, don’t make me. It’s… well, it’s like a craving, I suppose. Not for anything sweet or salty, just… earth. Red clay is the worst, actually. It’s like… my body needs it. It sounds ridiculous, I know. It started small, just a little taste when I was gardening. Now… I find myself digging it up, even when I don’t need to. I tried to stop, but it’s… hard. And it doesn’t even taste good, honestly. It’s gritty and just… unpleasant. But I have to. It’s just… there. Especially when I'm feeling really tired, it gets worse. And… don't ask me where I've been getting it from. It's embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand this is difficult to discuss, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I appreciate you being so open with me. This urge, this craving, is… unusual. It’s important we investigate the cause. To help me understand your overall health, could you tell me a little about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. What do you want to know? Let me think… well, I've been a bit… colder than usual, even in the summer. My hands and feet get numb sometimes, which is new. And… my appetite hasn’t been great. Not that I’m losing weight, just… not hungry. Oh! And I’ve been having a bit of trouble remembering things lately. Not important things, mostly just… where I put my glasses. Which is ironic, isn’t it? Though, I always could remember things perfectly before. It’s all just a bit… unsettling. I also get winded easily now, even walking to the mailbox. Honestly, it's like I'm falling apart. Are we almost done?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hardenburgh. That’s very helpful. It sounds like you’re experiencing a number of concerning symptoms. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… Not really. I had a bad flu when I was younger, but that’s about it. My joints ache sometimes, but the doctor said it was just “old age.” I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I don’t really believe in going to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. They never seem to find anything wrong anyway. I take a little vitamin D sometimes, but that’s it. No regular medications. And I've never had any surgeries or been hospitalized. Honestly, I’m a pretty healthy person. Or, was a healthy person, before all this started. Can we hurry this along? I really need to get to the market.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. To complete the picture, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh dear. That's a long story. My mother… she was always sickly. A lot of aches and pains, always tired. Never really knew what was wrong with her. She passed away when I was young, from… well, just old age, I suppose. My father was a strong man, a farmer. Lived a long life, but he had problems with his heart towards the end. I have a brother, but we haven’t spoken in years. He lives… somewhere. I don’t really know. Honestly, we never were close. And that’s about it. Not much of a family, really. Is this important? I feel like you're asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hardenburgh. That’s helpful. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven’t had a drink since… well, ever. I don't approve of those sorts of things. I used to drink tea, but I've cut back on that too. It makes my hands shake. And recreational drugs? Don't be ridiculous. I'm a respectable woman. I spend my time gardening and reading. That's it. Honestly, I live a very clean life. I eat healthy, mostly vegetables from my own garden. I don't understand why I'm feeling so bad. Are we almost done? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’d like to just do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It won't take long. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have errands, you know. sigh Fine. Here. Be gentle, please. My veins aren't what they used to be. And don’t poke around too much. I don’t like being touched. Just get it over with quickly, alright?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little low, Ms. Hardenburgh, but not critically so. Your heart sounds a bit fast, and I hear some mild crackles in your lungs. Your abdomen feels tender, but nothing alarming. I'd also like to check your fingernails. Your nails appear a little pale and have a slightly unusual shape. Based on your symptoms and the brief exam, I'm concerned about a possible iron deficiency anemia. The urge to eat dirt, the fatigue, the pale nails, and the low blood pressure are all suggestive of this. The cognitive difficulties and crackles in your lungs also warrant further investigation. To confirm this, I need to order some blood work. It will include a complete blood count, iron studies, and some other tests to rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Iron deficiency? Anemia? Oh dear. Is that… serious? I don’t like the sound of that at all. I eat plenty of vegetables, I tell you! And dirt doesn’t have any iron, does it? Honestly, I knew something was wrong, but I didn’t think it was that bad. Blood work… alright, fine. But how long will it take? And will it hurt? I don’t do well with needles. And… how much will it cost? I don’t have insurance, you see. This is all very upsetting. I just wanted a quick fix, not… all this. Just tell me what I need to do, and let's get it over with. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be upset, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s not serious if we catch it early and treat it. The blood work will help us determine the severity and cause of the potential iron deficiency. It's a routine test, and it doesn’t take long – about 10-15 minutes. As for the needle, it's a quick pinch, and it's over before you know it. I'll be as gentle as possible. And I understand your concern about the cost. Let me see what the lab charges are, and we can discuss payment options. The clinic does have some programs for patients without insurance. We'll figure something out. To start, I'll need to draw a few tubes of blood. Can you please sit comfortably in this chair?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. But be quick about it. And don’t poke around too much. I have a very low tolerance for pain, you know. And… what if it’s something really bad? What if I need… surgery? I don’t do well with hospitals. Just get it over with, alright? And tell me exactly what you’re doing. I don’t like surprises. Honestly, this is all very stressful. I just want to feel normal again. Quickly, please. Before I faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. I understand your anxiety, and I will explain everything as I go. First, I’m cleaning the area on your arm with an alcohol swab. This will sting for a moment. Then, I’ll gently insert the needle into your vein. You might feel a slight pinch, and then a little pressure. I will collect a few tubes of blood, and then remove the needle and apply pressure to the area with a cotton ball. It’s very important you remain still during the process. Just a quick pinch now… this will sting for a moment. Okay… ready?
PATIENT: Ouch! That did sting! And it feels cold. No, no, I don’t like this. Are you almost done? How much more? It feels like you’re digging around in there. Just get it over with, alright? And don’t tell me to relax. It’s not helping. Hurry, please. This is awful. I think I’m going to be sick. Just… get it over with!
DOCTOR: Almost done, Ms. Hardenburgh. Just one more tube… there. Okay, all done. There. All done. You did very well. Just hold firm pressure on this area for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. Here, put this bandage on. I'll label these samples, and we'll send them to the lab. It should take a few days to get the results. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity with that arm. I’ll call you as soon as the lab results return. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this moment?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. I feel faint. And… make sure the nurse calls. Don't forget. I don't want to have to come back here again. And… tell me what the results mean when you call. Don't use any fancy medical terms. Just tell me… am I going to be alright? Honestly, this has been a terrible experience. Just… get me out of here. And thank you… I think. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hardenburgh. I will personally call you with the results, and I will explain everything in plain language. I understand this was a stressful experience, and I apologize for any discomfort. The nurse will escort you to the exit. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any bleeding, pain, or dizziness. Have a good day, Ms. Hardenburgh. And please, take care. .
