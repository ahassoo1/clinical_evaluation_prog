DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I’m Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you're 45 years of age. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, forty-five. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, actually – and they need some medical information before I can go. Forms, you see. A lot of forms.
DOCTOR: Forms, yes. Quite common, unfortunately. So, it’s primarily for cruise documentation, then?
PATIENT: Precisely. They want to know about… well, everything, it seems. Past illnesses, operations, allergies. All sorts of things. I thought it best to get it properly written down by a doctor, rather than trying to remember everything myself. It was a while ago now, some of it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's begin with your past medical history, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me think… when I was a wee girl, I had the usual childhood illnesses. Measles, mumps… nothing terribly serious, thankfully. And then, when I was twenty-three, I had my appendix out. That was in 1983, I believe. Do you need the exact date? I might have a letter somewhere.
DOCTOR: The year is sufficient for now, Ms. Squiers. And beyond the appendectomy… any other significant illnesses or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Oh, yes! In 1998, I broke my wrist. Skiing accident, it was. A rather clumsy fall, to be honest. It needed a cast for six weeks, but it healed perfectly, thankfully. No lasting problems from that, either. Is that the sort of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do tell me about anything that required medical attention. And after that… have you had any surgeries besides the appendectomy and the wrist?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing else surgically. Just the appendix and the wrist. I did have rather bad tonsillitis when I was a child, and the doctor threatened to take them out, but it cleared up with penicillin, so thankfully that didn’t happen. A lot of sore throats, though, I remember. And I’ve had the usual flu jabs, every winter.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let's move onto family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m afraid not. My mother passed away in 2010, and my father before that, in 1995. Both fairly old age, thankfully. Not sudden illnesses, so that was some comfort, at least. They were both… reasonably healthy, all things considered. My mother had a touch of arthritis in her later years, and my father had high blood pressure, but nothing terribly serious.
DOCTOR: And siblings, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: I have one brother, Alistair. He’s a few years older than me, and lives in Glasgow. He’s quite well, as far as I know. Always been a strong lad, Alistair. Works as an engineer. He’s had the usual colds and flu, of course, but nothing major to report. I believe he had his cholesterol checked recently, but I don’t know the results, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, a rather important question – are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, I’ve always been able to. Shellfish, nuts, dairy… everything. I haven't even had a bad reaction to insect bites, thankfully. I am rather careful about wasps, though – they do give me the shivers! But that’s more a fear than an allergy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I don’t take any pills, creams, or anything like that. I try to stay as natural as possible, you see. Just a healthy diet and plenty of fresh air. Well, as much fresh air as you get in a city, anyway. And maybe a wee dram now and then, for medicinal purposes, of course. But that's hardly a medication, is it?
DOCTOR: I see. Very good. Now, finally, do you smoke?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. Never have, never will. My mother always said it was a dreadful habit, and she was right. Always had a strong constitution, my mother. Wouldn’t touch the stuff herself, and made sure we didn’t either. I do enjoy a good walk, though – keeps me fit as a fiddle!
DOCTOR: Right. Well, based on what you've told me – and assuming this account is accurate – you appear to be in relatively good health for your age. However, given your age, and the fact you haven't had a check-up in some time, I would recommend a basic blood panel to assess your cholesterol and kidney function. It's simply a precautionary measure. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Yes, I suppose it would be wise, wouldn’t it? I haven't had a proper check-up in years, to be honest. Always meant to, but life just gets in the way, you know? A blood panel, you say? Will it be a terribly uncomfortable process?
DOCTOR: Not at all. Just a small sample taken from your arm. Minimal discomfort. It’s a standard procedure. The nurse can take that now, if you’re agreeable. We'll send the results to you as soon as they're available. And then we can discuss any necessary follow-up.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If it's just a small prick, then I suppose I can manage that. It's all for peace of mind, isn't it? Yes, please, go ahead. The nurse can take the sample whenever you’re ready. Hopefully, it won't take too long, I have a few errands to run this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll just inform the nurse, and she'll be with you shortly. It should only take a few minutes. And please, feel free to ask if you have any further questions. Now, let me just document everything we’ve discussed…
