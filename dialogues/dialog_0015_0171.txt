DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, it's my nails. They just… look funny. Not good funny. I don't really do details, you know? They changed. That's all I know. They just aren't right.
DOCTOR: Changed how, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Ugh. Like… the color. And they’re kinda… thick? Not broken, just… not smooth. I don't paint 'em or nothing. Never have. Just… nails. It's hard to explain. It's like they got… stuff under them or something. It's gross, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Stuff under them,” you say. And they’re thicker than usual?
PATIENT: Yeah, thicker. Definitely thicker. And not like… strong thicker, like healthy thicker. More like… bumpy thicker. And the color... it's not a nice pink. It's kinda… yellow-ish. I don't know why I even bother comin' in for this. It's just nails.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Thut, while it may seem trivial to you, changes in nail appearance can sometimes indicate underlying medical issues. It’s good you came in. Let's take a look. Could you please extend your hands, palms up?
PATIENT: Oh, underlying medical issues? See, I knew it was somethin' serious. Everything's somethin' serious these days. Fine, fine. Here. Just be quick, okay? I got errands.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. There is some yellowing and noticeable thickening, particularly on several digits. And some slight distortion of the nail bed. I'm also noting some crumbling. Do you notice any pain or discomfort in your nails or the surrounding skin?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. Maybe a little… itchy sometimes, but I just figured it was dry skin. I put lotion on, but it doesn’t really help. They just… look bad. Like somethin' is livin' under there. Stop askin’ so many questions! It's nails, not my heart!
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I assure you, I’m asking these questions to get a complete picture. Itching can be relevant. Have you noticed this change in your nails suddenly, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It didn’t happen overnight. I don’t pay that much attention to my nails, okay? I just noticed 'em lookin' worse and worse. Maybe a couple months ago I thought, "Huh, those look kinda weird." And now they look… like this. It's probably nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your skin elsewhere on your body?
PATIENT: Skin? What kinda changes? I get a little dry in the winter, but that's it. I don't have… problems with my skin. Just normal lady stuff. Lotion fixes it. I don't know why you keep askin' about changes. Is it somethin' contagious? 'Cause I really don't have time for that.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Thut, I’m not implying it’s contagious. I'm trying to rule out potential causes. Now, have you had any recent fungal infections – athlete’s foot, ringworm, anything like that?
PATIENT: Fungal? Oh, heavens no. I keep myself clean. I haven't had nothin' like that. I don't even go to gyms. Where do people even get those things? Honestly, I'm startin' to think you're makin' a big deal outta nothin'.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, the changes in your nails – the discoloration, thickening, and crumbling – are suggestive of a fungal infection, most likely onychomycosis. It’s not necessarily a sign of poor hygiene, but it does require treatment. It’s also important to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any history of psoriasis or eczema?
PATIENT: Pso-what-sis? And ex-eh-what? Look, I told you, I just get a little dry skin. That's it. My mama always said lotion fixes everything. I don't have fancy skin problems. Are you gonna give me a cream or somethin', or are we gonna keep playin' twenty questions?
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I’m going to order a nail clipping for a fungal culture to confirm the diagnosis. Until we have the results, I can’t prescribe a definitive treatment. It’s important to know what we’re dealing with. I’m also going to review your medical history in the EHR to ensure there aren’t any other contributing factors. One moment.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… hurry up. I got things to do, you know. And don't go makin' a big fuss over a little nail thing. My grandma lived to be ninety with nails that looked worse than these.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. I see here you have a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril, and a previous bout of shingles several years ago. No other significant dermatological issues reported. I’m going to have the nurse take a clipping from your nails for the fungal culture. This will be sent to the lab, and it typically takes about two weeks for results. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your nails trimmed short and dry.
PATIENT: Hypertension? Oh, yeah. That’s right. Little pills for that. And shingles… that was awful. But what about now? Do you think it’s somethin’ serious? Like, will I lose my nails? I gotta tell you, I use 'em to open things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, it’s unlikely you’ll lose your nails, but onychomycosis can be persistent and difficult to treat. We will address it once we have the lab results. If it is confirmed, treatment options include topical or oral antifungal medications. Oral medications are more effective, but they do have potential side effects, which we would discuss thoroughly. I’m going to give you a referral to a podiatrist for a consultation as well. They specialize in nail and foot care and can provide additional treatment options and guidance. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Podia-what-ist? Another doctor? Seriously? This is ridiculous. I just wanted somethin' for my nails, not a whole medical team! What kinda side effects are we talkin' about? Like, will I get sick? Or somethin' worse? I don’t like doctors. They always find somethin' wrong.
DOCTOR: A podiatrist is a specialist, Ms. Thut, focused on the care of feet and nails. It’s not about finding something “wrong”, it’s about getting a specialized opinion. The potential side effects of oral antifungal medications can include liver enzyme abnormalities, gastrointestinal upset, and interactions with other medications you may be taking. We would monitor your liver function closely if you were to require oral treatment. Here is the referral to Dr. Alim, a podiatrist in the neighboring town. They will call you to schedule an appointment. Until then, keep your nails trimmed and dry and avoid sharing nail clippers. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Trimmed and dry… avoid sharing clippers… honestly, it’s like I’m contagious! Fine. Dr. Alim… okay. But what if I don't want to go to another doctor? Can’t you just… give me somethin’ now? Like a special polish or somethin’? I read about those on the internet.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, while topical treatments are available, they are often less effective for more severe cases of onychomycosis, and your nails appear fairly involved. Applying a polish without knowing the specific fungus present could be ineffective and delay appropriate treatment. I understand you’re hesitant to see another specialist, but I strongly recommend it for the best possible outcome. I am not comfortable prescribing a treatment without a confirmed diagnosis. I am documenting my recommendation for a podiatric consultation in your chart. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. You're not listenin' to me anyway. You just want to send me to another doctor and run up the bills. I’m gettin’ a second opinion. From someone who actually listens. I don't need your fancy polish or your fancy doctors. Just… forget it. I'm leavin’.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, you are welcome to seek a second opinion. However, I have provided you with the best medical advice based on my examination and professional judgment. I document your decision to decline the referral. Please be aware that untreated onychomycosis can potentially spread to other nails or even cause discomfort. If you change your mind, please do not hesitate to contact the office. Have a good day, Ms. Thut.
PATIENT: Yeah, right. A good day.
