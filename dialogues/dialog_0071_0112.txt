DOCTOR: Hello there, Keoni. Good to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, truthfully. I’ve been going to the bathroom rather frequently lately. It’s disruptive, to say the least. I don't quite recall when it started, but it feels like it's been a while now.
DOCTOR: Hmm, frequent urination… alright. Disruptive is a good way to put it. Let's see… Keoni MacVittie, 31… Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… just often. Throughout the day, and even… well, during the night too. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… a constant urge. I find myself needing to go even when I haven’t had much to drink, if that makes sense? I… I wish I could be more specific, but it’s difficult to recall the details. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No, no apology needed at all. It is often hard to remember specifics when you're dealing with something ongoing. So, not painful, just frequent… and you're going even when you haven't consumed a lot of fluids. Do you notice any difference in the amount of urine each time?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I believe it’s… normal? Not a great deal less, and not a great deal more. Perhaps slightly less each time, now that I think about it. But it’s hard to be certain. It all feels rather… consistent, if that makes sense. It’s the frequency that’s the issue, not the amount, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent amount, just more often. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed… let me see. My divorce was finalized about six months ago. That’s been… adjusting, to say the least. Aside from that… no, not that I can recall. I've been working the same job at the hotel, same routine. No new foods, no travel… I really wish I could pinpoint something, but everything feels… quite ordinary. I apologize again for being so vague. It's frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize. Life changes can absolutely affect things, even if it doesn't seem directly related. A big life change like a divorce… alright. And just to be thorough, any fever, chills, pain in your back or side, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills, and thankfully, no blood. My back feels… normal. Sometimes a little achey, but that's just from work, I think. It’s not a sharp pain, or anything concerning. I really don't believe it's related. Just the usual aches and pains from being on my feet all day. I’m… relieved it’s not anything more serious. Is this… common?
DOCTOR: It can be common. A lot of things can cause frequent urination. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule things out. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment. I… I’m a little anxious, admittedly, but I understand it’s necessary. Please, just let me know what to expect. I… I’m not very good with medical procedures.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No need to be anxious. It’s very straightforward. I’ll just listen to your abdomen, check your reflexes, and I’ll need a urine sample. Just a routine check, really. We'll start with listening to your abdomen. If you could lie back on the table, that would be great. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’ll do my best to relax. Please, don't hesitate to tell me if I need to adjust my position or… or anything at all. It’s just… I’ve always been a bit… squeamish. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything sounds… normal here. No unusual sounds. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. It’s quick, just a little tap on your knees and ankles. And then we'll get that urine sample. Do you have any difficulty providing a sample?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No difficulty at all. I… I can provide a sample easily. Just let me know when you’re ready, and I’ll… I’ll do my best. The reflexes sound… fine, I suppose? I don’t really know what I’m looking for. I apologize for being so uninformed.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. There's a specimen cup in the bathroom. Just collect a sample, and bring it back when you’re ready. Take your time. I’ll be right here. And don’t worry about feeling uninformed – that’s what I’m here for.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Hmm… the urine is clear, and the specific gravity is normal. No sign of infection, glucose, or protein. Everything looks normal in the sample. This is… puzzling.
PATIENT: Puzzling? That doesn’t sound… good. Is there something wrong? I was hoping for… well, something to be wrong, so we could fix it, instead of… this. What could it be, if everything looks normal? I apologize for my nervousness, but I am rather worried now.
DOCTOR: No, no, "puzzling" isn't necessarily bad. It just means we need to consider other possibilities. It's good that we've ruled out infection or any immediate problems. Sometimes, frequent urination can be related to behavioral things. Do you drink a lot of caffeine or alcohol?
PATIENT: Caffeine… I have a cup of tea with breakfast, and sometimes another in the afternoon. Nothing excessive, I wouldn't think. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s all. I… I don’t believe that would be the cause. I’ve been drinking tea for years, and this is a recent development. Is there… anything else? Something more serious, perhaps? I am… rather prone to anxiety, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Anxiety can definitely play a role. It can cause a lot of physical symptoms. And you're right, we should explore all possibilities. Given the normal urine results, the lack of other symptoms, and your history of anxiety, it’s possible this is related to that. However, to be absolutely sure, and to rule out anything else, I'd like to do a simple bladder scan. It’s non-invasive, just uses sound waves to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder after you urinate. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A bladder scan… is that… painful? Will it show something… alarming? I… I suppose if it rules things out, it’s worth doing. But I must admit, I am feeling quite anxious now. Just… please explain everything beforehand, and let me know what to expect. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No surprises, I promise. It's completely painless. We just use a small handheld device – it doesn’t insert anything. It’s like a little ultrasound. We simply glide it over your lower abdomen, and it gives us a reading of how much urine is left in your bladder after you’ve gone. It will help us determine if your bladder is emptying completely. It's a quick procedure, just takes a few minutes. Would you like me to demonstrate on myself first, so you can see what it feels like?
PATIENT: That… that would be very helpful, Doctor. If you wouldn’t mind. Seeing it on you would certainly ease my anxiety. I… I appreciate your patience. I am a rather… difficult patient, I suspect.
DOCTOR: See?
PATIENT: That… that doesn’t look painful at all. It seems… quite harmless, actually. And you said it just measures how much is left? It doesn’t… see anything inside? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I am… easily frightened.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Keoni. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned. And you're right, it only measures the amount of urine remaining. It doesn't take any images. Alright, let's do yours then. Just lie back on the table again, and I’ll take a quick reading. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, even if it's just a little bit of pressure.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’ll do my best to relax. Please, proceed. I’m… ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright… just a moment… Hmm. The reading is… slightly elevated. You retain about 80 milliliters of urine after voiding. It's not drastically high, but it’s enough to explain the frequent urination. It suggests your bladder isn’t emptying completely.
PATIENT: Eighty milliliters… is that… bad? What does that mean? Is it something serious? Will I need… surgery? Oh dear. I knew something was wrong. I just… I felt it. What can be done? Is there medication? Please, Doctor, tell me everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Keoni, let's take a deep breath. It's not necessarily serious, but it does explain your symptoms. Retaining 80 milliliters is a little more than ideal, but it's not an emergency. Several things can cause this. It could be a slight weakness in the bladder muscles, a mild blockage, or even just habit. First, we'll try some simple things. We can start with bladder training exercises – essentially, we practice emptying your bladder completely, and then gradually increase the time between visits to the bathroom. We'll also try double voiding - emptying your bladder, waiting a few moments, and then trying to empty it again. We can also discuss fluid management – avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol, and drinking more water throughout the day. In most cases, these conservative measures are enough to resolve the issue. We'll start with those for about a month, and then re-evaluate. If it doesn’t improve, we can discuss further testing, like a urodynamic study. Surgery is rarely necessary, unless there’s a significant blockage. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Bladder training… double voiding… fluid management… That sounds… manageable, actually. Not as frightening as I initially feared. I… I can certainly try those things. A month, you say? And then we re-evaluate? Could you perhaps… write down the instructions for me? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I wouldn’t want to forget anything important. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and kind. I appreciate your reassurance. I feel… a little less anxious now. Perhaps a little hopeful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you go. I've also written down some resources online with helpful exercises and information. "Remember to increase the time between bathroom visits gradually, and drink at least 6-8 glasses of water per day. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, especially before bedtime." And if you experience any pain, fever, or blood in your urine, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions about the instructions?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is… very helpful. I see… increase gradually… avoid caffeine… six to eight glasses… I think… I understand. But just to clarify… when you say “gradually,” how long should I wait between increasing the time? And… is it alright to drink tea? Just one cup in the morning? I apologize for being so… meticulous. I just want to be sure I’m doing everything correctly. And… if it doesn't improve after a month, what would the urodynamic study involve? I'm… rather apprehensive about further testing.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Keoni. It's good to ask questions. When I say “gradually”, start with 15 minutes longer than your usual interval. If that's comfortable, increase by another 15 minutes after a few days. Listen to your body and don’t push yourself. It’s a slow process. And yes, one cup of tea in the morning is perfectly fine. Just be mindful of how it affects you. If it seems to worsen your symptoms, try cutting it out. A urodynamic study is a more detailed assessment of your bladder function. It involves inserting a small catheter into your bladder to measure the pressure and flow of urine. It’s usually done in a hospital setting, and it takes about 30-45 minutes. It's not painful, but it can be a little uncomfortable. We’ll discuss it in more detail if it becomes necessary. For now, let's focus on these simple exercises and see how you respond. Do you feel comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… manageable. Start with fifteen minutes longer, one cup of tea, and monitor my symptoms. And… we'll discuss the urodynamic study if needed. I think… I have everything I need for now. Thank you again for your patience and kindness. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… much better about this. I’m… grateful. I suppose… there’s nothing else to discuss? Unless you have any further recommendations?
DOCTOR: No, I think we’ve covered everything for now. Just remember to listen to your body, be patient with yourself, and don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns. I’m glad I could help, Keoni. And please, don’t worry too much. Most people respond well to these simple measures. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. Thank you again for your kindness and reassurance. I truly appreciate it. I think… I’ll be alright. I’ll follow your instructions carefully. Goodbye, Doctor. And… thank you.
