DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need a check-up for… well, a sports team. Tryouts, you know? Gotta make sure I'm still good to go. Don't want to pull a muscle before I even start.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good planning. A pre-participation physical. Let me pull up your chart here… Alright, Lamark Kingan, 62 years old. And you said this is for tryouts – what sport are you hoping to participate in?
PATIENT: Uh, archery. Yeah, archery. Not exactly running around, thankfully. Though you still gotta be strong to pull that bow back, you know? I’ve been doing it for a while, but they want everyone checked out these days. Seems sensible, I guess.
DOCTOR: Archery, excellent! It does require a good deal of strength and core stability. And have you been actively training for these tryouts, or is this more of a… getting back into it sort of situation?
PATIENT: Actively, yeah. A few times a week. Not like when I was younger, of course. But I'm keeping it up. Mostly just want to make sure my shoulder’s okay. Old injury, you know? Nothing major, but… it sometimes twinges.
DOCTOR: Okay, a shoulder twinge. And when did you first notice this twinge?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. A long time ago. Probably… ten years ago? Maybe more? Fell off a horse, actually. Stupid horse. It didn't bother me for years, just flares up sometimes if I overdo it. I usually just rest it.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of a fall and shoulder pain. And is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I've been shooting a lot. Or if I lift something heavy. It's not… debilitating or anything. Just a little ache. I can still use my arm, no problem. Just… aware of it, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent pain, worse with activity. And on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain when it is bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… probably a three, maybe a four. On a bad day. Most of the time it's barely noticeable, honestly. It’s more just… preventative, you know? Don't want it to become a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, a three or four on a bad day. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a bit, but it's under control with… well, with just watching what I eat, mostly. Nothing a doctor needs to worry about, really. No surgeries or anything like that. Just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled hypertension with diet. No surgeries. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Just… vitamins sometimes. You know, the usual. Old man stuff. Nothing regular, though. I try to get most of what I need from my food. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any allergies. Not to food, not to anything. My wife always joked I could eat anything. She's… gone now, so I haven’t really had anyone to test that theory with lately. But yeah, no allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Kingan. To get a better understanding of things, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a closer look at your shoulder. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Get it over with, you know? The sooner I know, the sooner I can get back to shooting. Blood pressure first, you said? Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat here, and I’ll get started with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Relaxing… trying to, anyway. Always makes me a bit nervous, this stuff. Is my shoulder going to be okay? That’s what I’m really worried about.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 138 over 82. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s take a look at that shoulder. Can you lift your arm out to the side?
PATIENT: Yeah, like this? It’s a little… tight. Doesn't hurt exactly, just feels… restricted. And if I go too high… there’s a bit of a twinge, right here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just gently feeling around. Do you feel any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: A little. Right there. Where you're poking. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. It’s been like this for a while, honestly. I just ignore it usually. It’s probably just old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, and can you rotate your arm inward and outward for me?
PATIENT: Okay… like this? It’s a bit stiff going that way. Feels… tighter than the other side, I think. Not bad, just… not as smooth. Is something wrong? You’re making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kingan. It’s good you’re getting this checked out. Based on what I’m feeling and what you’ve told me, it sounds like you likely have some mild rotator cuff tendinitis and possibly some mild impingement. It's not severe, but it's worth addressing to prevent it from getting worse. We’ll get some imaging done to confirm, just to be sure. I'm going to order an X-ray to rule out anything else.
PATIENT: X-ray? Oh. That sounds… serious. Is it bad? Will I have to stop shooting? I was hoping to try out next week. This is a disaster.
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Mr. Kingan. An X-ray is just a precaution to get a clear picture of what's going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We’ll look at the results together. As for shooting, we’ll need to see what the X-ray shows. But, initially, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that aggravates your shoulder. We’ll get a plan together. I'm going to order a referral to physical therapy as well. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your shoulder and improve your range of motion. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… okay. Better than surgery, I guess. And no shooting… temporarily? Is that what you’re saying? Alright. Fine. Do what you think is best. Just… please tell me I won’t ruin my shoulder completely. I’ve been shooting for too long to stop now. What’s the next step? X-ray and… a phone call?
DOCTOR: Exactly. We’ll start with the X-ray. The radiology department is just down the hall. They’ll get you set up, and it shouldn’t take long. Then, I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results and start you on a physical therapy plan. She’ll also give you some information about managing your pain in the meantime – some over-the-counter pain relievers and some gentle stretching exercises. And, I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory to help with the discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Anti-inflammatory… good. That sounds… manageable. So, X-ray, then follow-up, then… stretching and pills. And no shooting until you say so. Lead the way to the X-ray. I just want to get this over with. The sooner I know, the better. Thank you, Doctor. Even if it’s bad news.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kingan. Let’s get you to radiology. And remember, we’ll take it one step at a time. My nurse, Sarah, will be in touch to schedule that follow-up appointment. She’s excellent and can answer any questions you have.
