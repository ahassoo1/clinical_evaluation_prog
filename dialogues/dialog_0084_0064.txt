DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. I'm Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my chest… it been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It’s like… a squeezing, sometimes. And it feels heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a squeezing, heavy pain in your chest. That definitely warrants a look. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three weeks ago? It was just a little thing at first, after I was doing some work in the garden. I thought it was just from pulling weeds, you know? Old lady problems. But it hasn’t gone away completely. It comes and goes. It's hard to say exactly when it happens, though. Not always after work, not always after I eat… just sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago, initially after gardening, and now it's more unpredictable. And you describe it as a squeezing, heavy pain. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Well… sitting down usually helps. And when I take a little rest. Not like a long nap, just… slowing down for a bit. It doesn't go right away, but it feels… less. Also, my husband, Ricardo, he makes me chamomile tea. That seems to soothe it a little bit, too. It's a nice tea. He's a good man.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know - rest and chamomile tea seem to help. And that’s lovely about Ricardo. Now, does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! When I walk up hills, definitely. Even just a little hill! And if I get… excited, maybe? Like, if my grandchildren are visiting and being silly, and I'm laughing a lot… it feels tighter then. Also, cold air. Brrr! When it gets chilly, it’s not good. I try to stay warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hills, excitement, and cold air seem to bring it on. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I get a little… short of breath. Not all the time, just when the pain is bad. And my arm… my left arm sometimes feels a little… tingly. Not numb, exactly, just… funny. Like pins and needles. But it doesn't happen every time. And… I think I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I'm an old lady! Maybe that’s just old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with the pain, tingling in your left arm, and some increased fatigue. Let's get a better picture of your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have a little bit of the high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years ago. I take a little pill for it, every morning. And my knees… they’re not good! Arthritis, you know? But that’s just old age again, probably. Oh! And I had the flu shot last fall. Ricardo makes sure I get it every year. He's very good about that. Otherwise… I think I’m pretty healthy for my age. What about the Medicare? Do I need to show you my card?
DOCTOR: That's good information, Sherion - high blood pressure, arthritis, and up-to-date on your flu shot. We can verify your Medicare information in a moment, but that’s not urgent right now. Let's talk about medications. You mentioned a pill for high blood pressure. Can you tell me the name of it, and the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Ricardo handles all that. He gets it refilled. It’s a little white pill… I think it starts with an “A”? Amlodipine? Is that right? And… 5 milligrams, I think. Yes, 5 milligrams. He'll know for sure, but that's what I remember. He keeps a list, but it's in his office. He's very organized. He’s a retired accountant. Everything has to be perfect!
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine 5 milligrams. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything! Ricardo likes to cook, and I like to eat! He makes a very good arepa. And… I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. I’ve taken a lot of medicine in my life, being an old lady, you know? No problems. I'm lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And that's good to hear. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let's talk about your family history. Are there any heart problems, high blood pressure, or other serious illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had the high blood pressure, like me. He took pills for it, too. And… my mother, she had the diabetes. She had to watch her sugar. And my brother, he had the stroke a few years ago. It was very scary. But… that's all I can really think of right now. My family isn't very good at talking about these things. It's a little… uncomfortable, you know? They don't like to worry people.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in your father, diabetes in your mother, and a stroke in your brother. That’s helpful information. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Never. Not even tried it. Ricardo doesn’t smoke either. He says it’s bad for your health. And… it smells terrible! No, no smoking. Never. I like fresh air. And… I like to garden, you know? Can't garden with a cigarette in your mouth!
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent – no smoking. And now, finally, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit, sometimes. Ricardo likes a glass of wine with his dinner. And… I might have a little sip with him, on special occasions. Like a birthday, or Christmas. But not very much. Just a little bit. It's not a habit. He says a little bit is good for your heart. But I don't drink it every day, no. Just special occasions.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a little alcohol on special occasions. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me, Sherion. It gives me a good picture of your overall health. Alright, now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll do a quick exam of your chest. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. It's just… this chest pain worries me a little. It feels different this time. I hope it's nothing serious. But you're the doctor, you know? I’ll do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150/88. And your pulse is 78, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart. I’m listening for any unusual sounds… Okay, and now your lungs. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Your lungs sound clear. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, no pain when you push there. Just the usual squeezing sometimes, but it's not happening right now. It comes and goes, you know? Like a little flutter. It’s hard to explain. But right now, it feels okay. Just a little worried. And the tea… Ricardo's tea always makes me feel better. He puts something special in it, I think. But it's probably just the warmth.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain with palpation at the moment. And I understand it's intermittent. Now, I'd like to check your left arm, where you mentioned the tingling. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s not sore. Just… sometimes it feels funny. Like little pins and needles, you know? It doesn’t last long. And it’s not all the way down to my fingers. Just… in the upper arm, mostly. Like when your arm falls asleep, but not as bad. And it doesn’t happen all the time. Just when the chest pain is bad, maybe. It’s hard to say, really. I’m probably just old. Everything hurts a little when you get old, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you could be experiencing angina. That’s chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It can often be triggered by exertion or stress, and relieved by rest. The tingling in your arm and shortness of breath can also be related. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this. I'm going to order an EKG – that's an electrocardiogram – to check the electrical activity of your heart. I also want to order a blood test to check for certain enzymes that can indicate heart damage. We may also need to consider a stress test, depending on the results of these initial tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… angina. That sounds serious. The heart… is that bad? I hope it’s not too bad. I don't want to worry Ricardo. He worries too much already. An EKG… and a blood test… and a stress test… That’s a lot of tests. Okay… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. But… will it hurt? I don’t like needles. And… a stress test… do I have to run on a treadmill? I haven’t run in fifty years! But… if it helps to find out what's wrong, then I'll do it. Just… please don’t make me run too fast!
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sherion. It's good that we're taking these steps to figure out what's going on. Angina can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. We’re not trying to scare you, just be thorough. The EKG is painless – it just involves placing some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart's electrical activity. The blood test will just require a small sample of blood. And as for the stress test, you don’t have to run. You'll be walking on a treadmill at a slow pace, and we’ll gradually increase the speed and incline. We'll monitor your heart rate and blood pressure closely, and stop if you feel any discomfort. And we’ll be right there with you the whole time. I’m also going to prescribe you a medication called nitroglycerin. It’s a small tablet you place under your tongue if you experience chest pain. It helps to widen the blood vessels and improve blood flow to the heart. I’ll also give you instructions on how to use it. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Nitroglycerin… under the tongue… to widen the blood vessels… Okay. That sounds… complicated. But if it helps, then I’ll try it. I hope it doesn’t taste bad. And… the tests… and the walking… I’ll do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please explain everything very carefully. I don't want to get confused. And… Ricardo will want to know about all of this. He likes to be involved. He’ll probably want to come with me to the tests. Is that alright? He’s a good man, and he worries a lot. He'll probably ask a million questions. But he just wants me to be healthy. So… yes. He can come. Just… please be patient with him. He gets a little… excited sometimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherion. It's wonderful that Ricardo is so supportive. He's more than welcome to come with you to the tests, and I'm happy to answer all of his questions. I understand your concerns about the nitroglycerin – it can have a slightly unusual taste, but it’s usually well-tolerated. I’ll give you detailed instructions on how to use it and what to expect. We'll take things one step at a time, and I'll explain everything very carefully. I'm going to print out some information about angina for you to read, as well as instructions for the nitroglycerin. I’ll also schedule the EKG and blood test for you, and we can discuss the stress test after we have the results of those. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you very much. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. And… thank you for not making me run too fast. I’m still a little worried, but I feel better knowing that we’re taking care of it. Please… just explain everything very carefully, and I’ll try to remember everything. And… thank Ricardo for being so supportive. He’ll be happy to know I feel a little better. Maybe… maybe we’ll have some chamomile tea tonight. That always helps.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. I'm glad I could help. And you’re right – chamomile tea is always a good idea. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. We'll take good care of you. Have a good day, and please give Ricardo my best.
