DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… about the cancer. It’s been a little while since I last saw someone about it, and I wanted to get another check-up, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Cancer… right. Yes, of course. It's good you're being proactive. Hmm… vague recollections on my end, unfortunately. Can you tell me a little more about which cancer we're talking about?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, sorry. It’s… it was in my breast. They said it was… stage two, I think? It was a few years ago now, and honestly, a lot of it is a blur. My husband… he handled most of the appointments. I’m… still getting used to things without him.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s… a lot to process, and it’s perfectly alright that things are a blur. Losing someone makes everything harder. Stage two breast cancer… Okay. And what treatments did you have at that time, if you recall?
PATIENT: I… think it was chemotherapy. And… surgery, of course. A lumpectomy, I believe. And then… radiation. It was a lot, all at once. I don't really remember the specifics. I just remember feeling very sick, and tired. And my husband… he was always there.
DOCTOR: Chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation… yes, that is a lot. It sounds like you went through quite a bit. And it's completely understandable that details are hazy. Let's focus on now. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms that brought you in for this check-up?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I feel a pain in my chest. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. And… I’ve been more tired lately than usual. I thought it was just… getting older, maybe? But it’s been going on for a few weeks now, and I thought it best to get it checked out. I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Chest pain and increased fatigue… alright. Can you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, you know? It’s like… a pressure, really. It’s usually on the left side, and it doesn’t really radiate anywhere. Sometimes it’s just… uncomfortable. I don’t know if that makes sense. And it seems to come and go with activity. Like, if I’m walking or doing something around the house, it gets a little worse.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, pressure on the left side, worse with activity… yes, that’s helpful. And how long have you been noticing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, a few weeks, I’d say. Maybe a month? It’s not… debilitating, but I just feel… drained, all the time. Even after a full night’s sleep, I wake up feeling tired. And I've found it harder to concentrate. Little things, you know? Like remembering things. It's a little worrisome.
DOCTOR: Alright. We should probably do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don’t mind, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll palpate your chest and lymph nodes. Please let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. If you could sit up for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, I can do that. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I'm a little nervous, but I'll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. Right there. It’s… a little tender. Not terribly painful, but definitely… sensitive. It feels… different than the rest, you know? Kind of… firm.
DOCTOR: Yes, I feel a small nodule there. Approximately one centimeter in diameter, firm, and slightly fixed. No warmth or redness noted. And now I’m going to check your lymph nodes… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… a little uncomfortable too. Not a sharp pain, but… I can feel something there. It’s… hard to describe. Kind of swollen, maybe? I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Several enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla, approximately one to two centimeters in diameter, firm and non-tender. No erythema noted. Alright. Thank you, Chellsea. That gives me a better picture. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings… we need to do some further investigation. I’d like to order a mammogram and an ultrasound of the left breast and axilla. Also, a biopsy of the nodule. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A mammogram… ultrasound… and a biopsy? Oh. Yes. Yes, that sounds… necessary. It’s… a little frightening, but if that’s what you think is best, then yes. Please. What… what does this mean, Doctor? Are you… worried?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be frightened, Chellsea. We're not jumping to conclusions. These tests will help us determine the cause of the nodule and the enlarged lymph nodes. It could be related to your previous cancer, or it could be something else entirely. The tests will give us the information we need to make a plan. I'm not going to speculate without having the results. But it's good that we're being proactive and investigating this. The mammogram and ultrasound will give us detailed images, and the biopsy will allow us to examine the tissue under a microscope. We’ll schedule those as soon as possible, and I'll review the results with you as soon as they’re available. I’m going to put in the orders now. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I think. Just… when will I hear back? And… will this be covered by Medicare? I… I don’t have a lot of extra money. And… what if it is the cancer again? What happens then? .
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions. The radiology department usually gets back to us within 24 to 48 hours with the mammogram and ultrasound results. The biopsy takes a little longer, usually about a week. As for Medicare coverage, yes, these tests should be covered. Our billing department is excellent, and they will handle everything. If there are any issues, they will contact you directly. As for what happens if it is cancer again… we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. There have been significant advances in treatment over the years. We'll discuss all of your options and create a plan that's right for you. It’s a step-by-step process, Chellsea. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’m going to go ahead and put in those orders now. My nurse will schedule you for the mammogram and ultrasound. She will also give you instructions on how to prepare for the biopsy, if necessary. Does that sound good?
