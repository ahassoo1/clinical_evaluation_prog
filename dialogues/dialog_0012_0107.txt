DOCTOR: Hi Philipp, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um... my heart, it feels funny sometimes. Like…flapping. Not always, but when it happens, it's…fast and weird. It started maybe one month ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, “funny” and “flapping” – I understand. It's good you're describing what you feel. Fast and weird is helpful too. So it's been happening for about a month now. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When? Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… mostly when I rest? Like, after I eat dinner, I sit and watch TV with my wife, and then it starts. Sometimes when I wake up too. Not when I work. I work with… machines, you know? Big machines. Lots of walking. No problems then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be more noticeable when you’re resting, particularly after eating or when you wake up. And it doesn’t happen when you’re working with the machines – that’s good to know. Does anything seem to trigger it specifically?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like… make it happen for sure? I don't think so. Maybe if I drink coffee, it’s a little worse. But I drink coffee every day. Not a lot, just one cup in the morning. I don’t think that’s it. Just… happens sometimes. No reason. It’s just… there. Then it stops.
DOCTOR: Alright, so coffee might make it a little worse, but it's not consistent. It just happens sometimes without a clear trigger. And it stops on its own, okay. How long does it usually last when it does happen?
PATIENT: Um… not long. Maybe five minutes? Sometimes ten? Not very long. I feel it, then I take a deep breath, and it goes away. My wife, she gets worried, but I feel okay after a few minutes. It’s just…scary feeling. Like a bird in my chest, flapping around.
DOCTOR: Okay, five to ten minutes usually, and deep breaths help. That’s good to know. It sounds unsettling, that "bird flapping" feeling. And you said it started about a month ago. Has it been getting worse, staying the same, or better since then?
PATIENT: I think… the same. Not worse, not better. Same amount of times, same… feeling. Maybe a little more worried now, because it still happens. Before, I thought it would just go away. But it's still there. My wife, she says I should come to the doctor. So, here I am.
DOCTOR: It's good you came in, Philipp, and it’s smart of your wife to encourage you to get it checked out. Even if it hasn't gotten worse, we want to figure out what's going on and make sure everything is okay. Now, let’s talk a little more broadly. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’m healthy. I work hard, I eat good food, I don't smoke. Maybe a little overweight, but I’m strong. Never been to the doctor before for anything serious. Just… check-ups when I was a kid. Nothing now for… many years. Maybe fifteen years?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no previous medical diagnoses, and you haven't been to the doctor in around fifteen years. That’s good information. And you feel generally healthy, despite being a little overweight. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, playing soccer, but that's it. Just a cast for a few weeks. Never been in the hospital, never had surgery. Everything else is… normal. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family – are there any heart problems – like heart attacks, arrhythmias, or sudden death – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard question. My father, he… he died when I was young. Something with his heart, I think. But he lived in Yemen, very far away. I didn't know him very well. My mother, she is okay. She is old, but she is healthy. No problems with her heart, as far as I know. My brother, he lives in another city. I don't talk to him often. I don't know about his health. Sorry, I don't have good answers.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay, Philipp. It’s understandable you don’t have a lot of details about your father, and it’s alright you don’t know about your brother’s health. Knowing your father had a heart issue is something we’ll keep in mind. Let’s move on to your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don’t drink alcohol. Not even a little bit. And I don't use any drugs. Never have. I don't like those things. My wife doesn't like them either. We just… live a quiet life. Work, family, TV. That’s all.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Philipp. A quiet life sounds nice. Now, let’s talk about any medications you’re currently taking – even over-the-counter medications or vitamins. Do you take anything regularly?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t take any pills. I sometimes take something for a headache, when it’s really bad, but that’s it. Maybe once or twice a year. Just… ibuprofen, I think. Nothing else. I like to stay natural. I don't like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, just ibuprofen occasionally for headaches. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I don’t think so. I eat everything. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I’m outside, with the grass, but that’s it. Nothing serious. No pills make me sick. I think I’m okay. My wife says I’m a very simple man. Easy to please. No allergies, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, to get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. That’s fine. I trust you, Doctor. What will you do? Is it… painful? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I understand you don't like needles – we can definitely avoid those for now. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. I’ll also take a quick look at your overall appearance. It shouldn't be painful at all – mostly just listening and feeling. First, could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. I will try to relax. It's… hard to relax when I'm thinking about my heart. But I will try. Just tell me what you are doing.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Just breathe normally. I’m listening to your heart now. I’m hearing a regular rhythm, but I do notice a slightly fast rate – around 92 beats per minute. It’s not dramatically fast, but a little elevated. Now, I'm listening to your lungs. They sound clear, no wheezing or crackling. Your blood pressure is 135/85. That's a little elevated as well, but not critically high. And your pulse is strong and regular. Overall, you look healthy, but I do notice your weight is around 220 pounds, which is a bit above your ideal weight. Okay, that’s all for the quick exam. Everything seems generally okay, but those slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure, and your weight, are things we should look into further.
PATIENT: Okay. Elevated… what does that mean? Is it bad? Is my heart broken? I’m scared, Doctor. I don’t want to be sick. I just want to feel normal again. What do we do now?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Philipp, and it’s good you’re expressing how you feel. "Elevated" just means a little higher than what we’d ideally like to see. It doesn't mean anything is necessarily broken or seriously wrong, but it does mean we need to investigate a bit further to understand why your heart rate and blood pressure are a little higher. We're going to do some tests to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order an EKG – that's a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't involve needles. We'll also do some blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and thyroid levels. That will involve a small blood draw. And finally, I’d like you to wear a Holter monitor for 24 hours. It’s a small device that records your heart rhythm continuously while you go about your daily activities. It will help us see if the palpitations happen while you're resting, working, or at other times. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. No needles… good. EKG, blood work, Holter… those sound complicated. What will they tell you? Will they tell you if my heart is broken? Can I still work? I need to work. My wife… she worries a lot. She will be happy if I can still work. What if it’s… really bad? Tell me the truth, Doctor. Is it likely to be something serious? I just want to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take this one step at a time, Philipp. I understand your anxieties, and it’s good you’re asking these questions. The tests aren't complicated, and they'll give us valuable information. The EKG will show us if there are any abnormalities in your heart rhythm. The blood work will check for underlying conditions like high cholesterol, diabetes, or thyroid problems that can affect your heart. The Holter monitor will help us capture any irregular heartbeats that might not show up during a brief EKG. It's unlikely to be something immediately life-threatening, given your description. The fact that you're able to work and go about your daily activities is a good sign. However, we need to rule out potential causes for your palpitations and elevated heart rate. It could be something simple like anxiety, caffeine sensitivity, or a slight irregularity in your heart rhythm that isn't dangerous but needs to be monitored. It could also be a sign of a more underlying condition, like high blood pressure, heart disease, or thyroid problems. That's why we need to do the tests. As for work, it’s likely you can continue working while we investigate. We'll discuss that more after we have the test results. I'll give you a note for your employer if you need one. Let's get these tests ordered, and we'll go from there. I promise we'll figure out what’s going on and get you feeling normal again. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Okay. A plan. Yes. That sounds… good. No work… maybe not good, but if I need a note, I will take it. My wife will be happy you said that. Tests… I don't like tests, but if they will help, I will do them. When will I get the results? How long will it take? Can I drive myself to the lab? And… will it hurt? Please, Doctor, tell me the truth. I just want to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. You're right to ask about what to expect. Let's go through everything. The lab work can be done any time this week. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes, and you can absolutely drive yourself. The blood draw might feel a little pinch, but it’s usually quick. The lab technician is very skilled, and it shouldn't be painful. The EKG will take about 10-15 minutes. The technician will place some stickers on your chest, and it doesn’t hurt at all. The Holter monitor is a little more involved. We’ll apply some stickers to your chest, attach a small recording device, and I’ll explain how to wear it for 24 hours. It’s comfortable, but you’ll need to avoid showering during that time. The results usually take 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. We'll discuss the results in detail and make a plan based on what we find. I’m going to give you these slips with instructions. If you have any questions at all, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And remember, we’re here to help you every step of the way. Does this sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Three to five days… I can wait. Instructions… good. I will read them carefully. My wife will read them too. She is very good at details. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I still feel scared, but I feel… a little better now. Knowing what to expect helps. I will do the tests. And I will call if I have any questions. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can I go now? I need to tell my wife. She will be very relieved to hear about the tests.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Philipp. I'm glad I could ease some of your worry. And you're right, it's good your wife will be relieved. No, there’s nothing else you need to do right now. Just schedule the tests at your convenience, and remember to avoid showering while wearing the Holter monitor. You can definitely go now. And please, don’t hesitate to call if any questions or concerns come up before your tests. We're here to support you. Have a good day, Philipp, and I’ll talk to you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
