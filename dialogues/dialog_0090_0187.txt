DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Chest... hurts sometimes. And my heart... feels like it's jumping. Also, the nurse, she say my blood pressure is... high. Very high. I no like.
DOCTOR: “Sometimes” hurts, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes! Not all day, silly woman. When I walk fast, maybe. Or when my wife yell at me. It's... a pressure. Like someone sitting on my chest. And then... boom, boom, boom. Fast heart. I don't know what you want me to say!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So the chest pressure happens with exertion – walking quickly – and sometimes when you’re upset. And you feel your heart racing?
PATIENT: Racing… yes! Like little bird flapping wings inside. Very annoying. I take pills, you know. For blood pressure. But maybe they no work good enough? I tell you, my wife, she worry too much. She say I need to see doctor. Always.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Let's talk about those pills. What are you taking, and how often?
PATIENT: Pills… uh… blue one, and white one. Every morning. I think. My wife, she give me. I no remember the name. Very long name. Something…press…something. She fill the little box every week. I just take them.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me see if I can pull up your medication list here... Ah, yes. You’re on Lisinopril 20mg daily and Amlodipine 5mg daily. Have you been taking these consistently?
PATIENT: Lisinopril...Amlodip... what? Sounds like… Chinese. I take what she give me. Every morning. Most days. Sometimes I forget. Old man, you know? Memory no so good. But I try. My wife, she gets angry if I no take them.
DOCTOR: It’s important to take your medications every day as prescribed, Mr. Sobkowicz. Irregular doses can make it very difficult to control your blood pressure. Now, besides the chest discomfort and racing heart, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmph. Easy for you to say. You young, you no have wife yelling at you all day. Other symptoms… I get tired. Very tired. And sometimes my legs… they swell. Like balloon. Especially if I sit too long. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. The fatigue and leg swelling could be related to your blood pressure, or other things. Let’s take a look at your legs and listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Examination. Fine. But I no like lying down. Makes me feel weak. Hurry up, I no have all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. Just relax as best you can. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Deep breaths, please. Your heart sounds a bit… rapid. And I do hear some congestion in your lungs. Now, let me check your legs. Yes, there’s definite edema here in both lower legs. How long have your legs been swelling like this?
PATIENT: Edema? What kind of word is that? My legs… they been like this for a while now. Maybe a month or so. Gets worse when it hot. And if I sit too long watching TV. My wife, she say I watch too much TV. She always say something.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes. Very tired. All the time. Even after sleep. I no have energy to do anything. My garden… it's a mess. I used to love gardening. Now, I just sit. My wife, she try to make me feel bad about it. She say I'm lazy.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, it sounds like your symptoms are getting worse, and you’re not consistently taking your medications. We need to get this under control before something serious happens. I'm going to order some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? X-ray? More tests. Hmph. Fine. But I no like hospitals. They smell bad. And they take too long. Is it expensive? My wife… she worry about money. Tell me quick.
DOCTOR: The tests are necessary to figure out what’s causing your symptoms, Mr. Sobkowicz. The cost will depend on your insurance, but we can check with them about coverage. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests ordered. I’m also going to increase the dose of your Lisinopril slightly, and keep you on the Amlodipine. We'll monitor your blood pressure closely. I’m also going to recommend a referral to a cardiologist—a heart specialist—to get their opinion. Would you be willing to see a cardiologist?
PATIENT: Cardio… what? More doctors? This is too much. I just want the chest pain to go away. And the heart jumping. I no want more tests and more doctors. Can't you just give me something for it? A strong pill? My wife… she always say I no listen to the doctors.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your frustration, but we need to be thorough. A “strong pill” won't address the underlying problem and could even be dangerous. The cardiologist will help us determine the cause of your chest pain and heart palpitations. Ignoring these symptoms or simply masking them isn’t a solution. It's crucial you understand this is for your health. I’m ordering the blood work and X-ray. And I strongly recommend the cardiology referral. The nurse will schedule everything for you. Do you have any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Do what you want. Allergies… I think I get itchy sometimes after taking pills. But maybe it's just the dust. My wife, she say my house is dirty. But no serious allergies, I think. Just itchy. Now, can I go home? I'm tired of being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. The nurse will go over the blood work instructions and schedule the other appointments. You can go home now, but please, try to be more consistent with your medication and follow up with the appointments. It’s important for your well-being. Here’s a summary of today’s discussion to take with you. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Whatever. Tell my wife I said hello. And don't bother me again unless it's an emergency. .
