DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Reneisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I’ve been gaining weight, and I haven’t… changed anything about my diet or exercise. It’s rather unsettling, truthfully. I haven’t a clue why it’s happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Unexplained weight gain can be unsettling. To get a better picture of what might be going on, let's talk a little more about it. When did you first notice this weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It began, I believe, sometime around… March, perhaps? Yes, March of this year. It was very gradual at first, barely noticeable, but over the last few months, it’s become quite… significant. I’ve had to have a few things altered, and I’m finding my clothes are uncomfortably tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting around March, gradual weight gain becoming more noticeable in recent months. And you haven’t made any changes to your diet or exercise routine during that time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely none. I eat the same things I always have – mostly traditional Lithuanian dishes, I confess. And I walk every day, about an hour, same route, same pace. My husband and I also do a bit of gardening, which is good exercise, I think. It’s just… baffling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And about how much weight would you estimate you’ve gained since March?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. I haven’t weighed myself precisely every week, you understand. But I’d say… at least 15, perhaps 20 pounds. It feels like more, but I’m trying to be realistic. I was 63 kilograms in January, if that helps at all. I haven’t been on a scale recently, I confess. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around 15-20 pounds since March, with a weight of 63 kilograms in January. That gives us a good starting point. Besides the weight gain, have you noticed any other changes in your body or how you feel?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that you mention it… yes, actually. I have been feeling… rather tired, more so than usual. And I’ve been a bit… colder than normal, even during warm weather. My hands and feet are always chilly. Also, I seem to be… constipated more often. It’s not a constant thing, but it’s… noticeable. I hadn’t really connected it to the weight, to be honest. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all potentially relevant, Reneisha. Fatigue, feeling cold, and constipation can sometimes be linked to underlying medical conditions. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any current medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve always been quite healthy, for the most part. A little arthritis in my knees, which is to be expected at my age, I suppose. But no serious illnesses, no major surgeries, nothing of that nature. My husband always says I’m as strong as an ox! I do have high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily.
DOCTOR: Okay, so managed hypertension with Lisinopril 20mg daily and some arthritis in the knees. And no other medical conditions or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, that is correct. Nothing else. I see my general practitioner, Doctor Vaitkevicius, regularly for check-ups, and he’s always said I’m… reasonably well, given my age. He’s the one who prescribed the Lisinopril, of course. He’s a very good doctor. I don't want to cause him any trouble with unnecessary worry. That's why I waited so long to come in about this weight.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Reneisha. It’s good you’re proactive about your health, and Dr. Vaitkevicius sounds like a thorough physician. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, thyroid problems, heart disease, or any types of cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a bit complicated. My mother had… heart trouble, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don't remember much detail. My father had diabetes, type 2, I think. He managed it with diet for a long time, but eventually needed medication. My sister has… well, she has a bit of trouble with her thyroid, she says. She gets very tired and has been on medication for years. And my uncle, on my mother’s side, had cancer, lung cancer, I believe. But that was many years ago. Is that helpful, Doctor? It’s not a very neat history, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Reneisha. A family history of heart disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, and cancer does give us some important information. And it’s perfectly alright that it’s not “neat” – family histories rarely are. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life, and I very rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s all. And recreational drugs… well, that’s simply not something I would ever consider. I lead a very… respectable life, Doctor. My husband and I enjoy gardening, reading, and spending time with our grandchildren. That is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As far as I know, I have no allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat anything without any problems. Occasionally, my skin gets a little itchy from certain detergents, but that’s just a minor irritation, not a true allergy. I think that’s everything, Doctor. I hope I haven't been too rambling. I just want to understand what's happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Reneisha. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and feel your thyroid gland. Just a routine check, to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I’m ready when you are. I trust your judgment completely. I just… I’m a bit anxious, truthfully, but I want to get to the bottom of this. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's begin. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, 88 beats per minute, and the rhythm is regular. I hear no murmurs, clicks, or rubs. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your thyroid gland feels slightly enlarged and a bit firm to the touch, but there are no distinct nodules. Okay, everything seems generally normal, but the enlarged thyroid and slightly elevated blood pressure are things we need to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function – TSH, T4, and T3 levels – as well as a complete metabolic panel to assess your overall health, and a lipid panel. We will also check a CBC to look at your blood count. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Whatever you think is best. Thyroid function… that’s… that’s what my sister has trouble with, isn’t it? Could it be the same thing? I'm a bit nervous now, to be honest. I’m trusting you to figure this out. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a garden to tend, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be nervous, Reneisha. We’re just gathering information at this point. The blood tests will help us determine if your thyroid is functioning normally. It could be, but it could also be something else entirely. It's important not to jump to conclusions. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as significant weight loss, rapid heartbeat, or difficulty breathing – please contact the office immediately. I’m also going to print out a requisition form for the blood tests and a summary of our discussion today for your records. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Thank you. That’s very thoughtful of you. Three to five business days… I’ll try to be patient. And I will contact the office if anything changes. I appreciate your time and your thoroughness, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease… somewhat. I suppose I’ll go home and try to distract myself with gardening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. It was my pleasure. Remember, I’m here if you have any concerns. Don’t hesitate to reach out. And enjoy your gardening - that's excellent advice! Have a good day.
