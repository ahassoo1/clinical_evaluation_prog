DOCTOR: Hi Terasa, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And my daughter, bless her, she worried something fierce and told me to come. It’s hard to explain… things just go quiet sometimes, and I get so dizzy. It's happened a few times now. I don’t remember exactly when the first time was, though. It's all a bit fuzzy, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, ears and dizziness… I understand. Fuzzy is alright, we'll figure things out. When you say things go quiet, does that mean you can't hear at all in one or both ears?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… just one ear, usually. The right one, I believe. But sometimes it feels like both are muffled, like someone turned the volume way down. It doesn’t last long, thankfully, but it’s quite unsettling when it happens. Honestly, I mostly just try to ignore it and hope it goes away. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, it's not bad that you try to manage, but it’s definitely something we should look into. Okay, so mostly your right ear, sometimes both, and it’s like the sound gets quiet or muffled. Does it happen all at once, or does it build up slowly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… tricky. I think it’s pretty quick. One minute I’m hearing fine, the next… just quiet. Not a gradual fading, if that makes sense. It’s a bit of a shock, really. And then, maybe a few minutes later, it starts coming back. It’s all very sudden. My head gets a bit wobbly too, when the quiet starts. Do you… need me to be more specific? I’m sorry if I’m not explaining it very well.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly fine, Terasa. Sudden quiet and wobbliness… okay. When you say “wobbly”, is that a spinning sensation, like vertigo, or more just feeling unsteady on your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, spinning! Definitely spinning. Like… when you’ve had too much sun, and everything goes round and round. Not all the time, thankfully, but it’s quite strong when it happens. I have to hold onto something, you see. My daughter gets quite worried when I fall. It's happened a couple of times because of it. She's a good girl, my Leilani.
DOCTOR: Okay, spinning sensation, like vertigo, and you've had a couple of falls because of it. I appreciate you telling me that, Terasa. That's important information. Let me quickly check your record here… Hmm. It looks like you’ve been seen at the clinic before, mostly for routine check-ups. Nothing specifically about ear issues. Do you have any other symptoms along with the spinning and quiet – like ringing in your ears, or any pain?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that you mention it, yes. Sometimes. A sort of high-pitched whine. Not constant, thankfully, just now and then. And no pain, no. Never any pain. Just the quiet, the spinning, and that little bit of ringing. And, um… my mother had something like this, I think. With her ears. But it was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details. She was a strong woman, my mother. But she did struggle with her hearing in her later years.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ringing in your ears sometimes, and your mother had some hearing issues as well. That's helpful to know. Alright, Terasa, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears, just to take a look and see if we can spot anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… please be gentle? My ears are a bit sensitive, you see. And don't mind if I flinch a little. Old age, you know. Everything gets a bit more… delicate.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Terasa. I will be as gentle as possible. And it’s perfectly alright if you flinch – I expect that. Okay… I’m just looking… Hmm. Your ear canals are a little narrow, which makes it a bit harder to see clearly, but I don’t see any obvious signs of infection or wax buildup. The eardrums themselves look… normal in color and shape. Now, I’m going to do a quick hearing test with this tuning fork. I’ll place it on your forehead, and then near each ear. Just tell me when you can’t hear it anymore. Okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A tuning fork, you say? Sounds… scientific. Yes, go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try my best to tell you when I can’t hear it. But I warn you, my hearing isn't what it used to be, even when it is working properly. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if I’m doing something wrong. I wouldn’t want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Terasa. Can you hear the tone when I place it on your forehead?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. A little bit faint, but I can hear it. Like a… humming sound, you know? Not very loud, though. It’s… a bit hard to describe. Is that right? Am I doing it correctly? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Terasa, not a bother at all. Now, I'm going to move it closer to your right ear... Can you still hear it?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, I think so. It's… a little clearer now, perhaps? But still not very loud. It's a funny sort of sound, isn't it? It makes my teeth tingle a little. Not unpleasant, just… strange. Is that normal? I've never had one of these things done before.
DOCTOR: It is normal to feel a slight vibration, Terasa. Okay, and now the left ear... Do you hear it now?
PATIENT: … No. No, I can’t. Not at all. It’s… just silence. That’s odd, isn’t it? My right ear can hear it, but not my left. Does that mean something is wrong? I knew it, I knew something wasn't right with my ears. Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Okay, Terasa. It does suggest some hearing loss in your left ear. This is consistent with your symptoms of quietness and dizziness, and the fact that your mother had ear problems as well. The dizziness could be related to a problem in your inner ear, which affects balance. Based on what you've told me, and this quick test, I think it's best to get a more thorough hearing test done, called an audiogram. It will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. I'm also going to refer you to an ENT specialist – an ear, nose, and throat doctor – for a proper evaluation. Would you like me to explain a little bit more about what that involves?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An ENT specialist… that sounds serious. I suppose so, yes, please. If you wouldn’t mind explaining. I don’t want to go rushing into anything without knowing what I’m getting into. Is it going to be painful? And will I be able to drive myself? I don’t want to bother my daughter if I can help it. She’s got a busy schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Terasa, let’s take it one step at a time. An ENT specialist is just a doctor who specializes in ears, nose, and throat – they’re very good at diagnosing and treating ear problems. The visit itself shouldn't be painful. They’ll likely examine your ears with a special instrument, and they might do some more detailed hearing tests. It's similar to what we did today, but more thorough. They may also look at your balance. As for driving, yes, it's probably best if you don’t drive yourself, just in case they need to use any drops that might affect your balance temporarily. I can write you a note for your daughter to excuse you from work, and perhaps she can accompany you to the appointment. I’ll give you a referral to Dr. Lum – she's a very good specialist in the area. I'll also give you some information about preparing for the appointment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… much better, thank you, Doctor. Dr. Lum, you say? I'll remember that. And a note for my daughter, that’s very kind of you. It’s good to know you're thinking of all that. It’s just… my ears have been bothering me for so long, I just hoped it was something simple. But it sounds like it’s a bit more complicated than that, doesn’t it? Still, I suppose it's best to know what I’m dealing with. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little less worried now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. It's perfectly alright to be worried, and it's good that you came in to get it checked out. We'll get to the bottom of it. Here's the referral for Dr. Lum and the information sheet. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Take care, and I hope you get some answers soon. .
