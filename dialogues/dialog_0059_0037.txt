DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Thank you for seeing me. Well, I have been… having trouble breathing, a little. It feels like a whistle when I breathe, you know? Like wheezing. It has been happening for maybe three days now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Wheezing for three days – that certainly warrants a closer look. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… worse when I walk fast, or when I try to do my exercises. I like to walk in the park, keep myself moving, you know? But even a little walk now… makes me stop and rest. It doesn't happen when I am sitting still, usually. And it is not a bad pain, just… uncomfortable. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. So it’s triggered by exertion – walking, exercising – and is relieved when you’re at rest. And you describe it as more uncomfortable than painful. That’s helpful information. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the wheezing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been… a little bit tired, maybe? More tired than usual. And I have had a small cough, but not a big one. Just a little tickle in my throat. No fever, though. I checked my temperature this morning, it was normal. I do not think there is anything else… is that important?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Fatigue and a mild cough along with the wheezing are all potentially relevant. No fever is reassuring. Now, Mrs. Kilton, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any problems with asthma or bronchitis in the past?
PATIENT: Oh. Asthma… I do not think so. My mother had something with her chest when she was old, but I do not think it was asthma. And bronchitis… no, I do not remember being sick with that. I try to stay healthy, you know? Lots of fruit and vegetables. I have been lucky, I think. But it has been a long time… sometimes I forget things. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mrs. Kilton. It's very common to have difficulty recalling medical history from a long time ago. And staying healthy is excellent! Now, have you had any other significant medical conditions diagnosed – things like heart problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me about that maybe five years ago. I take a little pill every morning for it. And… nothing else that I can remember. My heart… the doctor said it was strong. He checked it. I take my pills very carefully, you know? I do not like to miss a day. Is that important for the wheezing?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very important information, thank you. The high blood pressure and the medication you’re taking are relevant. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I do not think so. I eat everything, you know? I like spicy food, sometimes, and I have never had a problem. I did have a rash once, when I was a little girl, from poison ivy, but that was long ago. No problems with medicines that I remember. I have taken many pills in my life, for headaches and such, and nothing bad happened. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mrs. Kilton. No known allergies are helpful. Alright, if you're comfortable, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your heart rate and blood pressure. Then I’ll take a look at your throat and check your oxygen levels with a small clip on your finger. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. I trust you, Doctor. You seem very nice. Please, do what you need to do. I am ready. I hope it does not take too long, though. I have to make a phone call later to my daughter. She is always worried about me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Kilton. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. We’ll get through this efficiently. Okay, take a few deep breaths for me, please… in and out. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, as you described. It's more pronounced on breathing out. Your heart rate is a little elevated at 88 beats per minute, but that could be from the difficulty breathing. Blood pressure is 142/85, which is slightly higher than our target, but not significantly so. Now, let me just take a look at your throat. And your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is within a normal range.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that… bad? The wheezing? Is it my heart? I take my pills, you know. Every morning. I worry about my daughter, she says I should be more careful. Is it serious, Doctor? Please tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, it’s understandable that you’re worried. The wheezing does need to be investigated, but I don’t want you to panic. It’s not necessarily your heart, although we need to consider all possibilities. Your heart sounds okay right now, and your oxygen levels are good, which is reassuring. The most common causes of wheezing are conditions like asthma, bronchitis, or a possible respiratory infection. Sometimes it can be related to allergies, or even a reaction to an irritant in the air. It is also possible that it is related to your high blood pressure and any effect it may have on your lungs. Given your history and the symptoms you've described, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs. It will help us rule out any serious causes and determine the best course of treatment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… oh dear. Is that… dangerous? I have heard things about those. And treatment… what kind of treatment? Will I have to go to the hospital? I do not like hospitals, you know. They smell so strange. And my daughter… she will be so worried. Can we not just take a pill? I take pills for everything else. Please, Doctor. Is an X-ray really necessary?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, I understand your concerns completely. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical tests, especially if you’ve heard concerning things. Let me assure you, a chest X-ray is very safe. The amount of radiation is minimal – it’s about the same as you'd receive from a few days of natural background radiation. It doesn’t involve any injections or invasive procedures, and it provides very valuable information. We’re not talking about going to the hospital at this point, Mrs. Kilton. We're simply gathering information to determine the best treatment plan. And while a pill might help with some of your symptoms, it won't address the underlying cause of the wheezing. It is possible this is just a simple chest infection that a course of antibiotics could take care of, or it might be related to asthma which would require an inhaler. We need to know for sure before starting any treatment. I believe an X-ray is necessary to give us the clearest picture and to make sure we're giving you the best possible care. I would never recommend a test unless I felt it was truly in your best interest. Would you like me to explain the X-ray procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh dear… alright. If you really think it is necessary. But please, be quick. And tell me everything before you do it. I do not like surprises, you know. And… is it very uncomfortable? Will it hurt? And my daughter… can I call her afterwards? I need to tell her I am alright. Just… please be gentle. And explain everything. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Kilton. Absolutely. I’ll explain everything, slowly and carefully. And I will be as gentle as possible. This explains the procedure in detail, but let me go over it with you. A chest X-ray is a quick and painless imaging test. You’ll simply stand or sit in front of a special machine. A technician will position you correctly, and then a brief flash of X-rays will be taken. It doesn’t involve any needles, and it only takes a few seconds. You won’t feel anything at all. The technician will then review the images to make sure they are clear, and I’ll be able to review them shortly afterward. The technician will be the one to take the X-ray and they are happy to answer any questions you may have. And yes, absolutely you can call your daughter afterwards. We have a quiet area where you can make a phone call. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: A little… yes. As long as it does not hurt. And as long as it is quick. And… will they tell me right away if something is wrong? I do not like waiting. My daughter… she worries about me so much. She always says I should be more careful. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Take off my jewelry? Empty my pockets? And… what if it is something bad? Will I have to stay in the hospital? Oh dear… I am getting nervous again.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous, Mrs. Kilton. And I’ll do everything I can to make this as comfortable and stress-free as possible. You don’t need to do much to prepare. You can leave your jewelry on, and there's no need to empty your pockets. Just wear comfortable clothing. As for the results, the technician will take the images, and I’ll review them as soon as I can, usually within an hour. I'll then discuss the findings with you in detail. If anything concerning is found, we will discuss the next steps, which may involve further testing or referral to a specialist. The vast majority of wheezing cases are easily treatable, but we do need to rule out more serious possibilities first. I will do my best to give you a preliminary idea of the results as soon as possible. If further testing or hospitalization is needed, we will discuss everything thoroughly and ensure you understand all your options before making any decisions. Would you like me to call the technician now to get things started?
PATIENT: Alright… yes. Let’s get it over with. But please… be gentle. And tell me everything afterwards. And… could you sit with me while I wait for the results? I do not like waiting alone. And… maybe I should call my daughter now, just to let her know I am alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Kilton. Absolutely. I'll be right here with you the entire time, and I’ll explain everything thoroughly afterwards. And you can absolutely call your daughter now, if that would make you feel better. “Technician, could you please come in?
PATIENT: “Hello, dear? It’s me… Yes, I’m at the doctor’s… They are doing some tests… Yes, I’m a little nervous… No, it’s alright, I’m with the doctor… Yes, I’ll call you after they finish… Don't worry, I’m sure it’s nothing… Just a little wheezing… Alright, dear. I love you too. Bye.” “They are coming, aren't they?”
DOCTOR: Yes, they are just outside. We’ll take things one step at a time, Mrs. Kilton. I'll be right here with you the entire time. They will explain the procedure to you in detail, and I will be here to answer any questions you may have. Remember to breathe deeply, and try to relax. “Good morning! I’m Sarah, the X-ray technician. Dr. Chagaris tells me you’re here for a chest X-ray. I'll just explain the procedure, and we’ll get things started, if you’re comfortable.” I will step back a little to give you both some space, and I'll be right here if you need me.
PATIENT: “Alright… just… be quick, please. And gentle.” “This is all my daughter’s fault… always worrying about me…”
DOCTOR: “Please proceed gently, and explain each step as you go. Mrs. Kilton is a little anxious.” “Of course. We’ll just have you stand here, facing the machine. I’ll need you to take a deep breath in, and hold it for a few seconds. It’s a very quick scan, and it won’t hurt at all. Just try to relax, and keep breathing normally. Are you ready?
PATIENT: “What if I can’t hold my breath? What if I move? What if… what if it finds something bad?” “Just… get it over with, please.”
DOCTOR: “It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, Mrs. Kilton. We’ll take things at your pace. If you can’t hold your breath, that’s not a problem at all – we can always repeat the scan. And if you move, it just means we might need to take another image. It’s not a problem. The most important thing is that you feel comfortable. I'll be right here, and I’ll let you know exactly when to breathe in and out. Would you like me to step back for a moment, and give you a little more time to relax?
PATIENT: “No… just… get it over with, please. I don’t want to be here all day. And… just tell me when to breathe.” “This is all my daughter’s fault…”
DOCTOR: “Alright, Mrs. Kilton. We’ll do it quickly, and I’ll guide you through every step. Just when I say ‘breathe in’, take a deep breath and hold it. And when I say ‘breathe out’, you can relax. I’ll be right here, and I’ll let you know when we’re finished. Are you ready to try?
PATIENT: “Just… hurry, please.”
DOCTOR: “Alright, Mrs. Kilton. Just take a deep breath in… and hold it… hold it for just a few seconds… Excellent… and breathe out… relax… Very good. That was perfect. Just one more image, if you don't mind. Just take a deep breath in… and hold it… hold it… Excellent… and breathe out… relax. That's all we need. Wonderful. You did great.” “All done. Just a few more seconds, and I’ll have the images ready for Dr. Chagaris.”
PATIENT: “Is it… bad? What did it find?”
DOCTOR: “Let’s take a look at the images together, shall we?
PATIENT: “What… what am I looking at? Is that my chest? Is something… wrong?”
DOCTOR: “Yes, that’s your chest. You can see your ribs here, and your lungs are the darker areas. Everything appears normal, Mrs. Kilton. There’s no sign of pneumonia, no fluid in the lungs, and your heart size is normal.” “However, I do see some slight thickening of the bronchial walls. This could be due to a number of things – a mild infection, allergies, or even previous exposure to irritants. It's not necessarily anything serious, but it does explain your wheezing. It’s important to remember that X-rays are just one piece of the puzzle, and further investigation might be needed to get a definitive diagnosis.” “Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: “Thickening… what does that mean? Is it… bad? Will I need more tests? And… will I need to take pills? My daughter… she always worries about me.” “Is it something serious, Doctor? Please be honest with me.”
DOCTOR: “It’s completely understandable that you’re worried, Mrs. Kilton. Let me explain. ‘Thickening’ simply means the walls of your airways are slightly wider than usual. This can happen for a lot of reasons, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious.” “To determine the exact cause, I’d like to order a simple pulmonary function test – it involves breathing into a machine to measure how well your lungs are working. We will also do a blood test to check for any signs of infection. And yes, it is possible you might need to take some medication, but it’s too early to say for sure. It really depends on the results of the tests.” “I want to be honest with you, Mrs. Kilton. I don’t believe this is anything life-threatening, but we do need to investigate further to ensure you receive the best possible care. And I will be here with you every step of the way.” “Does that make sense?
PATIENT: “Breathing into a machine… and a blood test… Oh dear. What if the blood test finds something bad? Will I need to go to the hospital? My daughter… she will be so worried.” “Is it… serious, Doctor? Please, just tell me the truth.”
DOCTOR: “Mrs. Kilton, it’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious. Let me assure you, a blood test is a very routine procedure, and it’s highly unlikely to find anything serious. It's simply to rule out any infection that might be causing your wheezing. And I truly don’t believe you will need to go to the hospital. I’m confident this can be managed as an outpatient.” “I want to be honest with you: it’s possible, though unlikely, that the tests could reveal a more significant condition. But even if that were the case, we would work together to develop a plan, and I would refer you to a specialist if needed. But I really don’t want you to worry needlessly. Right now, it’s most likely a mild infection or allergies.” “Would you like me to explain the pulmonary function test in more detail?
PATIENT: “No… just… no more tests, please. I’ve had enough. Is it… is it something contagious? Will I need to stay away from my daughter?” “Just… tell me if it’s serious, Doctor. Please be honest with me.”
DOCTOR: “Mrs. Kilton, I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed. Let me assure you, based on everything we’ve discussed so far, I do not believe this is contagious. You absolutely do not need to stay away from your daughter.” “And to answer your question honestly: based on my assessment, I do not believe this is a serious condition. It's most likely a mild respiratory issue that can be managed with medication and careful monitoring.” “However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, which is why I recommend the pulmonary function test. It’s a simple, painless procedure that will give us a more accurate understanding of your lung function.” “Would you like me to call your daughter for you?
PATIENT: “No… she will worry. She always worries. Just… just tell me if I need to take pills. And… is it safe to walk in the park? I like walking in the park.” “Just… is it safe to walk in the park, Doctor?”
DOCTOR: “It’s alright to be worried, Mrs. Kilton. Let’s focus on what we do know. Based on my assessment, it is likely safe for you to continue walking in the park, as long as you listen to your body and take breaks when you need them. However, I would recommend avoiding strenuous activity until we have the results of the pulmonary function test.” “As for medication, it’s too early to say for sure. If the tests reveal a mild infection, I may prescribe a course of antibiotics. If it’s related to allergies, I may recommend an antihistamine or an inhaler. But we will discuss all of your options thoroughly before making any decisions.” “For now, let’s focus on getting through the pulmonary function test. It’s a simple procedure, and I will be right there with you every step of the way. And remember, I do not believe this is a serious condition. We will get through this together.” “Would you like me to call a nurse to help you schedule the pulmonary function test?
PATIENT: “Yes… please. And… could she also bring me a glass of water? I feel a little… faint.” “Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.”
DOCTOR: “Of course, Mrs. Kilton. It's my pleasure. I’ll call the nurse right away. She’ll be here shortly with a glass of water and to schedule your pulmonary function test.” “Hi Sarah, could you please come in and assist Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: “Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.” "I hope it is nothing serious..."
DOCTOR: “We’ll get to the bottom of this, Mrs. Kilton. And remember, I don’t believe this is anything serious. Just try to relax and take deep breaths. I’ll be right here with you until the nurse arrives.” “Is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
PATIENT: “No… thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. I… I appreciate your patience.” “Just… thank you.”
DOCTOR: "You're very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. That’s what I’m here for. We will take things one step at a time. Don't hesitate to tell me if you have any further questions or concerns. I’ll be right here."
PATIENT: “Thank you, Doctor.”
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. Take your time.” .
