DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. And I have… a heart thing, the doctors said. It’s called… atrial… something? They said it might be connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Swelling in your left leg and you’ve been diagnosed with an atrial… condition. Let's clarify that atrial thing first – do you remember the full name of the diagnosis?
PATIENT: No, I'm afraid not. They used a lot of big words, and I didn't quite catch it all. Something about the… beating of my heart being irregular? They said it wasn't dangerous right away, but needed to be watched. It’s why I’m here, I suppose. To be watched.
DOCTOR: Right, that sounds like atrial fibrillation, or AFib for short. It's a common heart rhythm problem. Okay, so the swelling in your leg… when did you first notice that?
PATIENT: Oh, AFib… yes, that's it! Thank you for saying it slowly. The swelling… hmm. It started maybe a week ago? It wasn’t much at first, just a bit bigger than usual. But it’s gotten worse each day. It's quite uncomfortable now, and feels… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, gradually worsening swelling and tightness in your left leg. Is the swelling just in your leg, or does it extend to your foot or thigh?
PATIENT: Just the leg, Doctor. From just above my ankle, right up to my knee. My foot and thigh seem alright. No swelling there, and no pain in the thigh, thankfully. It's mostly just… heavy and puffy in the lower leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower leg swelling, no pain in the thigh. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the touch in the swollen area?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no redness. And it doesn’t feel particularly warm, either. It just… looks bigger. And feels… well, like a leg that's filled with water, maybe? Is that possible? I don't know much about these things.
DOCTOR: It absolutely is possible, Nixon. That's a good way to describe it. Okay. Let’s take a look at your leg and then I'll ask you a few more questions. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Please, do take your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. I do see some swelling in your lower left leg, as you described. It’s pitting edema – meaning when I press on it, it leaves a temporary indentation. Your pulses feel normal on both legs, and your skin temperature is the same on both sides. I’m noting all of this. Now, have you had any recent injuries to your leg?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no injuries. I haven't tripped or fallen or anything like that. I haven’t been doing anything strenuous, either. Just… normal daily activities. Walking, mostly. I'm a teacher, so I’m on my feet a bit. But nothing unusual.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent injury, normal activity level. Have you noticed any changes in your urine output – more or less than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t know, actually. I haven’t been paying close attention to that. I suppose… normal? I haven’t noticed anything particularly different. I apologize for not being more helpful. It’s not something I usually think about.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nixon. It’s not something most people routinely monitor. Now, let's talk about your heart condition. Besides the AFib, do you have any other heart-related diagnoses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the atrial… AFib. That’s all they told me. They did some tests, an EKG, I think it was called, and said I had it. They prescribed me some medicine, a small white pill, to take every day. And I have been taking it. I haven't missed a dose.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s good to hear you’re staying on top of your medication. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: I… no, I don't. It's in a little orange bottle, and the label is quite small. I just ask the pharmacist to refill it every month. I'm not very good with remembering names, I'm afraid. I apologize again. Perhaps… the doctors office has a record of it?
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Nixon. We can certainly check your records. Ah, here we are. You're taking Apixaban, 2.5mg twice daily. That’s an anticoagulant, or blood thinner, to help prevent clots related to your AFib. Now, has anything changed recently in your life – new medications, new foods, increased travel?
PATIENT: Oh, Apixaban… yes, that’s it! Thank you, Doctor. That’s very helpful. And no, nothing has changed recently. No new medicines, no different foods… I went on a short trip to visit my sister last month, but that was it. Just a day trip by train. I didn’t do anything strenuous on that trip either, mostly just sitting and talking.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent changes. And you’ve been consistent with your medication. Let's quickly go through a few more general questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, and I haven’t had any trouble with medicines either. I think I would know if I had an allergy, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You absolutely would, Nixon. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't. I had my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy a few times, and it was always normal. I don't have any other conditions that I'm aware of. I'm generally quite healthy, apart from this heart thing and the leg swelling, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I don't smoke, I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine at Christmas – and I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I’m a teacher, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Thank you for all of that information. It's very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, the most likely cause of your leg swelling is venous insufficiency, possibly exacerbated by your AFib. The Apixaban should help with reducing your risk of clot formation, which can contribute to swelling. However, venous insufficiency requires a bit more investigation to rule out other causes and determine the best course of action. I’d like to order a D-dimer blood test to check for blood clots, and an ultrasound of your left leg to assess the veins. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A D-dimer test and an ultrasound… yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. It’s good to know the medicine is helping at least. What does the ultrasound involve, exactly? Will it hurt? I get a bit nervous with… procedures.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Nixon. The ultrasound is completely painless. It uses sound waves to create an image of the veins in your leg. A technician will apply a gel to your leg and then move a small probe over the skin. It doesn't involve any needles or radiation. It takes about 20-30 minutes. I’ll get the orders in now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll schedule you for the ultrasound. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg whenever possible, wearing compression stockings, and staying hydrated. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Elevation, compression stockings, and hydration… yes, I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience with me. I suppose… I just hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nixon. We're taking the necessary steps to figure out what's going on, and we'll address it accordingly. I don’t want you to worry unduly. It’s good that you’re taking this seriously and seeking medical attention. I'll review the test results as soon as they’re available and we can discuss them at that time. Here are the orders for the lab. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you very much for your time and your kindness. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least a little. I will go and have my blood taken now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We're here to help. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. .
