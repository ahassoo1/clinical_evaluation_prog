DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, and it’s… disruptive, to put it mildly. I don't really know why it's happening, and I was hoping you could help me figure it out.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say. Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It feels like… a few weeks, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. Time… slips away, you know? I think it started gradually, and then got noticeably worse about a week or two ago. I honestly can't pinpoint a date. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: A few weeks. Alright. And can you describe what you mean by “a lot”?
PATIENT: Well, normally I go… you know, a normal amount. Four or five times a day, perhaps? But now… it feels like every hour or two. Even during the night, I'm waking up to go. It’s truly… inconvenient. And no, I haven’t changed anything in my diet or drinking habits, as far as I can recall.
DOCTOR: Every hour or two, even waking you at night. And no dietary changes. Hmm. Are you experiencing any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No pain or burning at all. Just… the frequency. It’s just very… unsettling. And a little worrying, if I’m honest. I don’t recall ever having anything like this before. It doesn't hurt, it just… happens constantly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you noticing any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the urine? Oh dear. I… I haven’t really looked, if that sounds awful. I suppose… no, I haven’t noticed anything unusual. It looks… normal, as far as I can tell. I usually just… don't pay attention, if you understand. I apologize for being so… unobservant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Do you have any history of urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I… I honestly don’t know. I've been to doctors, of course, but I don’t really remember specifics. I’ve had a rather… busy life, and details just… slip away. Is there a way to find that out? Perhaps in your records? I’m terribly sorry, I truly am. I wish I could be more helpful. I just… don't have a good memory for these things.
DOCTOR: Let me see… according to this, no documented history of UTIs. However, these records are not always complete. Alright. Now, let's talk about other medical issues. Do you have any chronic conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… Hmm. No, not that I’m aware of. I had a bit of trouble with my… blood pressure a few years ago, but it was brief, and they said it was just stress. It went away on its own. And no diabetes. I don't think so, anyway. I've never been told I have it. I'm divorced, if that matters. And… not insured, unfortunately. It’s hard to keep track of everything, you know?
DOCTOR: Uninsured. Right. And no other medical issues. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your abdomen and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can order a urinalysis to see if there’s an infection. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. An exam and a test… that seems sensible. Please, proceed whenever you're ready. I just… I'm hoping we can find out what's causing this. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll start with your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Normal bowel sounds. Heart rate and rhythm are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation. No obvious abnormalities on initial examination. Now, we’ll need a urine sample. I’ll have a nurse bring you a collection cup. Please try to collect a midstream sample – that is, start urinating, then collect the sample mid-flow. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand, Doctor. A midstream sample. Start, then collect mid-flow. I believe I can manage that. It’s just… I might need a moment, if you don’t mind. It’s just… the frequency. I’ll let you know when I have it. Thank you for explaining it so clearly.
DOCTOR: Take your time. The nurse will be in shortly. I’ll be back to review the results once they’re available.
