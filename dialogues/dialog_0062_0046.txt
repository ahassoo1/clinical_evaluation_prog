DOCTOR: Hi Marialena, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a rather…uncomfortable pressure in my bladder. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s persistent, and it’s becoming quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent pressure in your bladder, that doesn’t sound fun at all. And you said it’s been going on for a few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Roughly three weeks, I believe. It started gradually, just a slight feeling, but it’s definitely increased in intensity over that time. It doesn’t seem to be related to anything specific that I’ve noticed – no changes in my diet or activity level, and I’m drinking about the same amount of water as usual.
DOCTOR: Alright, so about three weeks, gradually increasing pressure, no obvious changes in your routine… That helps. Can you describe the pressure a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s difficult to describe precisely. It feels like a fullness, almost like I need to urinate constantly, even when I haven’t had much to drink. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, located low in my abdomen, right where my bladder is, I suppose. And sometimes, it feels like… a weight, pressing down. Does that make any sense? I apologize if I’m not being very clear.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Marialena. You’re describing it very well. A fullness, a dull ache, and a sense of weight… Okay. And are you actually urinating frequently, or does it just feel like you need to?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It’s… a bit of both, actually. I am going to the bathroom more often than usual, perhaps every two to three hours during the day. But even after I’ve gone, the feeling doesn’t always completely subside. It’s as if my bladder isn’t fully emptying, or the pressure returns very quickly afterward. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency and a sensation of incomplete emptying… That’s helpful information. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this, like burning when you urinate, blood in your urine, fever, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I haven’t experienced any of those other symptoms. No burning, no blood, no fever, and no pain in my back or side. It’s really just this persistent pressure and the feeling of needing to go frequently, even when I don’t. I did notice my urine seems a bit darker than usual, but I assumed that was just from not drinking enough water yesterday. Though, like I said, I thought I was drinking enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no burning, blood, fever, or back pain - that's good. Darker urine could be from dehydration, as you mentioned. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like urinary tract infections, kidney problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t been diagnosed with any of those conditions. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I do have Medicare, and I see my primary care physician for annual check-ups, but nothing significant has ever come up. I’ve never had a urinary tract infection, to my knowledge. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major as an adult. I am married, and my husband is very healthy as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you have a history of good health and regular check-ups. And no family history of kidney problems or UTIs that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. My mother had high blood pressure later in life, and my father had some heart problems, but neither of them ever had any issues with their kidneys or urinary tract. My siblings are also healthy, as far as I know. We don’t have a lot of medical discussions in our family, to be honest. It’s more of a…avoid the topic sort of situation. I hope that doesn’t sound strange.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound strange at all, many families are like that! Okay, so no significant family history. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Certainly. I take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one-a-day. And occasionally, when my joints are feeling particularly stiff – I’m not very old, but I do have some minor arthritis – I’ll take ibuprofen. But that’s it. No other prescription medications, no herbal supplements, nothing like that. I try to avoid taking anything if I don’t absolutely need it. I prefer a more natural approach, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen - good to know. And you have no allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I don’t have any allergies. I haven’t had any allergic reactions to anything in my life, to my knowledge. No food allergies, no medication allergies, no environmental allergies… I’m quite lucky in that regard. I do sometimes get mosquito bites, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I apologize if I’m rambling. I just want to be as thorough as possible.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, you’re being very helpful! And no, mosquito bites don’t count! Alright, Marialena, thanks for all that information. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Just a basic abdominal exam and I'll check your urine sample. That will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I understand that’s a standard part of the process, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I trust your professional judgment, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you could lie down on the exam table, that would be great. I’ll start with listening to your abdomen, and then I’ll gently press on different areas to check for any tenderness. After that, we’ll collect a urine sample. Okay, I’m not feeling any significant tenderness or masses. Your abdomen is soft, and there’s no guarding. I do feel a slight fullness in your bladder, as expected. Now, let’s collect that urine sample. There's a cup in the bathroom, and I'll give you instructions once you're done. Do you have any trouble urinating?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any trouble urinating. As I mentioned before, I’m actually going quite frequently. I suppose it’s just…the sensation is a bit different than usual, but I can go without any difficulty. I will go to the bathroom now and collect the sample as instructed. Please let me know if you need anything further from me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marialena. Just let me know when you're finished. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I tried to collect a mid-stream sample, as I recall being advised to do in the past. Hopefully, it’s adequate. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. This looks good, thank you. Now, I'm going to send this off to the lab for a urinalysis. We'll check for signs of infection, blood, and other abnormalities. That usually takes a couple of days to get the results. While we're waiting for the lab results, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of an overactive bladder, or possibly interstitial cystitis – a chronic bladder condition. It's important to rule out other causes first, which the urinalysis will help us do. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Overactive bladder or interstitial cystitis… I confess, I’m not very familiar with either condition. I have heard of overactive bladder, but I don’t know much about it. Interstitial cystitis is entirely new to me. I appreciate you explaining that to me, Doctor. It’s helpful to have a potential direction to explore. Ruling out other causes sounds very sensible. I’m happy to proceed with whatever tests or procedures you deem necessary. I trust your judgment, and I’m grateful for your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Well, the urinalysis is the first step. If that comes back clear, we can discuss some lifestyle modifications, like bladder training exercises and dietary changes. Sometimes, that’s all that’s needed. If your symptoms persist, we might consider a referral to a urologist for further evaluation, such as a cystoscopy – a procedure where they look inside your bladder with a small camera. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s see what the lab results show first. In the meantime, try to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods, as they can irritate the bladder. And make sure you're drinking plenty of water, even though you're feeling the urge to go frequently. It seems counterintuitive, but staying hydrated can actually help. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That all makes sense, Doctor. Avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods is something I can certainly manage. And I will make a conscious effort to stay hydrated, despite the frequent urges. I suppose my question is…is this something that will likely go away on its own, or is it more likely to be a chronic condition that requires ongoing management? I’m not necessarily afraid of ongoing management, but I’m just trying to understand the potential long-term outlook. And, if it is chronic, are there any medications commonly used to treat it? I'm mindful of potential side effects, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. It's hard to say definitively whether this will resolve on its own, Marialena. Sometimes overactive bladder symptoms improve with lifestyle changes, but for many people, it becomes a chronic condition. Interstitial cystitis is almost always chronic. If it turns out to be chronic, there are several medication options available. Some medications help relax the bladder muscles, reducing the urge to urinate. Others can help block pain signals. There are also some newer therapies available, like bladder instillations. Here’s a brochure from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases about overactive bladder. It details some of the treatment options and potential side effects. It also includes information about bladder training exercises. It's important to remember that everyone responds to treatment differently. We’ll work together to find the best approach for you, taking into account your individual symptoms and preferences. We’ll start with the least invasive options first and only consider more aggressive treatments if necessary. Does that sound reassuring?
PATIENT: Yes, that does sound very reassuring, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly and for providing me with this brochure. It's helpful to have something to read over at my own pace. I appreciate your emphasis on starting with the least invasive options and working collaboratively to find the best solution. That makes me feel much more comfortable. I believe I have no further questions at this time. I will await the results of the urinalysis and contact your office to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. Thank you again for your time and your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope you have a good day. And remember to stay hydrated! .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I will certainly remember to stay hydrated. Thank you again for everything. Have a good day. .
