DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, I must say, this waiting room was… quite pedestrian. But never mind that. I’m here because, well, my husband, he insists I get some… paperwork sorted. Something about what happens if, heaven forbid, I become unable to… manage things myself. He calls it an Advance Directive, or a POLST form. Honestly, I find the whole discussion rather morbid, but he’s quite insistent, and one does try to maintain marital harmony. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly reasonable, Marija. It’s very thoughtful of your husband to be proactive about this, and it is a common concern. It's less about morbid thoughts and more about ensuring your wishes are respected if you were ever unable to communicate them yourself. We can definitely get that paperwork sorted for you today. Before we dive into that though, just to get a complete picture, are you experiencing any health concerns right now that brought you in, or is this solely for the Advance Directive discussion?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. I assure you, I am in perfectly good health. A bit tired, perhaps – grading papers is exhausting – but nothing a strong cup of mint tea can't solve. No, this is entirely at the behest of my husband’s… anxieties. He reads too many articles online, you see. It’s quite tiresome, frankly. So, let's just focus on this… directive. The less time spent discussing my perfectly sound health, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, perfectly sound health is excellent to hear, Marija. We can absolutely focus on the Advance Directive then. To start, are you familiar with what an Advance Directive and POLST form are, or would you like me to explain those in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Well, he attempted to explain it. Something about ticking boxes and deciding what treatments I would – or would not – want. It all sounded rather… dramatic, and frankly, I was trying to prepare dinner at the time, so I wasn't paying terribly close attention. It seemed rather… presumptuous to have to decide these things before they even become an issue. So, yes, an explanation would be… helpful, I suppose. But please, no overly graphic details. I have a delicate constitution.
DOCTOR: Certainly, no graphic details, I promise. It's perfectly understandable to feel like it's presumptuous, Marija. It is about thinking ahead, but it’s also about having control over your care. Essentially, an Advance Directive is a legal document that outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you become unable to speak for yourself. There are a couple of parts. One is a Living Will, which details the types of treatment you want or don’t want in specific situations – like if you have a serious illness. The other is a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, where you name someone – usually a family member, like your husband – to make healthcare decisions for you if you can't. A POLST form, or Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, is a bit more specific. It’s a medical order based on your wishes, and it outlines what treatments you want now – things like CPR, intubation, or artificial nutrition. It's typically used for people with serious illnesses, but it can be useful for anyone who wants to be very clear about their preferences. Does that make a bit more sense?
PATIENT: Hmm. It sounds… complicated. And rather a lot of paperwork, I suspect. This "Durable Power of Attorney" sounds particularly troubling. Are you suggesting my husband doesn't understand my wishes perfectly well already? Because frankly, that’s preposterous. He may worry excessively, but he knows me. Still, the idea of legally documenting his authority… It feels… unnecessary. And rather… demeaning. Is this standard procedure, Doctor? Because frankly, I’m beginning to feel quite overwhelmed. Perhaps a stronger cup of tea is required.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Marija. It does sound like a lot, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed. It’s also wonderful that you and your husband have such a strong understanding of each other. The Durable Power of Attorney isn’t about doubting your husband’s understanding of your wishes, it’s about ensuring anyone providing your care – doctors, nurses, hospitals – knows what you want, even if they can’t reach him immediately. It provides legal clarity and avoids any potential disagreements. It is standard procedure, particularly as we get older, but it’s entirely your decision. We don't have to do this if you aren't comfortable. We can simply discuss your wishes and document them in your chart. Or we can start with a simple form outlining your preferences and revisit it later if you change your mind. Before we go any further, would you like me to explain a bit more about what kinds of decisions this form would cover?
PATIENT: Well, that's… slightly more reassuring. The idea of documenting it in the chart without all the legal ramifications is… appealing. But I still feel a bit… skeptical. What "kinds of decisions" are we talking about, Doctor? Because frankly, I have no desire to pre-emptively decide whether or not I want to be "kept alive" by machines. It sounds rather… undignified. And frankly, I trust my doctors to use their best judgment. I don't need to dictate every minute detail. I'm a reasonable woman. Are we talking about… tubes? And blinking lights? Because if so, I think I'd rather not.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask, and it's good that you're thinking this through. It doesn’t involve dictating every minute detail, and it certainly doesn't have to involve tubes and blinking lights unless you want it to. Generally, these forms address situations where you're unable to communicate your wishes. That could be due to a serious illness, a stroke, or an accident. The kinds of decisions typically covered include: Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation : Whether or not you want to be revived if your heart stops or you stop breathing. Mechanical Ventilation: Whether or not you want to be put on a breathing machine. Artificial Nutrition and Hydration: Whether or not you want to receive food and fluids through a tube if you’re unable to eat or drink. Dialysis: Whether or not you want to receive kidney dialysis if your kidneys fail. Antibiotics/Antifungal Treatment: Whether or not you want to be administered antibiotics if you become seriously ill. The form would simply state your wishes for each of these scenarios. We can tailor it to your specific preferences, and you can choose to address only the scenarios that are important to you. And remember, it’s always possible to change your mind later. Perhaps we could start by discussing what’s most important to you in terms of quality of life?
PATIENT: Hmm. “Quality of life.” That sounds… philosophical. And rather depressing, frankly. Very well. If I were to… become severely incapacitated, I suppose I would want to be kept comfortable. Pain-free, certainly. And I would absolutely not want to be a burden on my family. Prolonging suffering for the sake of… extending life artificially seems rather pointless. So, no tubes, no blinking lights, and definitely no unnecessary interventions. And I would want my husband to be the one to make decisions if… well, if I am no longer able to. Is that… sufficient? It feels rather bleak to be discussing these things, you know. But if it will appease my husband, then so be it. I suppose. Though I still maintain this is all rather unnecessary.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Marija, and you’ve articulated your wishes very clearly. "Comfortable, pain-free, and not a burden," and your husband making decisions – that gives us a very good starting point. It's not about bleakness, it's about respecting your values and ensuring they are honored. So, we can document all of that – your desire for comfort care, no unnecessary interventions, and your husband as your healthcare proxy. There’s a relatively simple form we can use. It's primarily a checklist, with space for additional notes. Before we proceed with the form, would you like me to explain what being a healthcare proxy entails for your husband?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be… prudent. He tends to overthink things, you know. And I wouldn’t want him burdened with any undue stress or responsibility. Explain it thoroughly, Doctor. What exactly are his… obligations? And what if he… disagrees with the doctors? I suppose he'll be expected to make difficult decisions, and I wouldn’t want him blaming himself if… well, if things don’t go as planned. He’s a good man, but he’s not exactly known for his… decisiveness. Though he's excellent at organizing the spice rack, admittedly.
DOCTOR: That's a very thoughtful question, Marija, and it's good that you're considering this carefully. As your healthcare proxy, your husband would be responsible for making medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to communicate them yourself. That means he would work with your doctors to understand your condition and treatment options, and then make decisions that align with your wishes – as you've expressed them to him, and as documented in your chart. His obligations primarily involve: Understanding your wishes: He needs to be aware of your values, preferences, and any specific instructions you’ve given him. Communicating with the medical team: He’ll need to discuss your condition and treatment options with your doctors and nurses. Making informed decisions: He needs to weigh the risks and benefits of different treatment options and make decisions that he believes are in your best interest, based on your wishes. As for disagreements with the doctors, that can happen. He’s not expected to be a medical expert. He can always ask for a second opinion, or request clarification from the medical team. If there’s a significant disagreement, we can involve a hospital ethics committee to help mediate the situation. It's important to remember that he's not making these decisions in isolation. He'll have the support of the medical team, and he can always consult with family and friends for guidance. And ultimately, his primary responsibility is to honor your wishes. Does that help alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, that's… somewhat reassuring. The ethics committee sounds… sensible. And he does tend to consult with his friends before making any major purchases, so that's not entirely unusual. Still, I worry he'll be overwhelmed. But if he insists on being my… proxy, then so be it. Very well. Let's proceed with this checklist, then. But please, keep it simple. I don't want to be buried under a mountain of paperwork. And I would appreciate it if you could explain each section thoroughly before I… tick anything. I want to be absolutely certain I understand what I'm agreeing to. And no tubes, Doctor. That cannot be stressed enough.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. We will keep it simple, and I will explain each section thoroughly before you tick anything. No tubes, noted – we'll make sure that's clearly documented. This form is primarily focused on your preferences for end-of-life care. It’s divided into a few sections. The first section is about your overall goals for care – do you prioritize prolonging life at all costs, or do you prioritize comfort and quality of life?
PATIENT: Comfort and quality of life, undoubtedly. Prolonging life artificially seems… rather pointless, frankly. Especially if it involves tubes and blinking lights. I’ve always believed in living a full and meaningful life, not merely existing. So, comfort and quality of life. Though I suspect my husband will have strong opinions on this matter. He's rather… optimistic, you see. Always looking on the bright side, even when there's nothing to be optimistic about. But if I am the one filling out the form, then my wishes should take precedence, shouldn't they?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. Your wishes take precedence, without question. We're documenting your preferences, and your husband will be expected to honor those preferences as your healthcare proxy. Okay, so we’ll tick “comfort and quality of life.” The next section focuses on specific treatments. It asks about things like cardiopulmonary resuscitation , mechanical ventilation , and artificial nutrition and hydration . Would you like me to explain each of these in a bit more detail before we proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I confess, I find medical terminology rather… daunting. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition… it all sounds rather… invasive. And frankly, none of it appeals to me. But I need to understand what each option entails before I can make an informed decision. Especially the feeding tube. That sounds particularly unpleasant. And I would like it clearly documented that I have no desire to be kept alive by machines. Is that possible, Doctor? A very clear and unambiguous statement? No tubes, no blinking lights, no prolonged suffering. That should be the overarching principle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. “No tubes, no blinking lights, no prolonged suffering” – that’s a very clear and important principle, and we will document that unambiguously. Let's start with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. That’s when we attempt to revive you if your heart stops beating or you stop breathing. It involves chest compressions and potentially mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. It can be lifesaving, but it can also be painful and exhausting, and it doesn't always work. Mechanical ventilation is when we use a breathing machine to help you breathe if you’re unable to breathe on your own. It involves inserting a tube into your airway and connecting it to a ventilator. It can be life-saving, but it can also be uncomfortable and require sedation. And artificial nutrition and hydration is when we provide you with food and fluids through a tube if you’re unable to eat or drink on your own. It can be life-sustaining, but it can also have complications, and it doesn't always improve quality of life. Now, the form asks whether you want us to attempt each of these treatments, or whether you want to forgo them. Do you have any initial thoughts on any of these options?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. No to all of it. No chest compressions, no breathing machines, no feeding tubes. I've lived a full life, and I've always believed in a dignified end. I do not want to be kept alive by machines, no matter how well-intentioned. I would rather be comfortable and pain-free, and allowed to pass away peacefully. Is that clear enough? And please, make sure it's documented very prominently. I don't want any ambiguity. This is a very firm decision, and I don't want it questioned. No tubes, no blinking lights, no prolonged suffering. You're starting to sound like a mantra, Doctor. But it's a good mantra, I suppose. Is there anything else I need to tick on this… form?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. No to all interventions – chest compressions, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. I’ve documented it very prominently, and it is absolutely clear. Your wishes are respected and honored. The next section is about pain management. It asks whether you want us to do everything possible to relieve your pain, even if it means potentially shortening your life. Would you like me to explain that in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds… reasonable, actually. I certainly wouldn't want to suffer unnecessarily. But I've always been wary of strong medication. It makes me… groggy. And I'd like to be aware of my surroundings, even if I'm… unwell. But if it comes down to unbearable pain, then yes, I suppose I would want it relieved, even if it means… well, even if it means shortening my life. Though I hope it doesn't come to that. But if it does, then prioritize comfort, please. No tubes, no blinking lights, and definitely no unnecessary suffering. Is that clear? I feel like I'm repeating myself, but it's important, you know. This is a very firm decision. And I trust you to respect it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. Comfort and awareness prioritized, and medication administered to alleviate pain as needed. I've documented it clearly. Now, the final section is about your healthcare proxy – your husband. It simply asks for his name and contact information, and confirms that he has the authority to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so. Do you have his information readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, thankfully. His name is Omar Chilla. And his contact number is… …and his email address is . He’s generally quite responsive to emails, though he does occasionally get distracted by spice arrangements. But he's a good man, Doctor. A very good man. And I trust him to… well, to do what’s best, even if it's difficult. Though I suspect he’ll be quite overwhelmed by all of this. But he insists on being my proxy, so… here we are. Is that all, Doctor? Are we finished with this… form? I confess, I'm rather relieved it's almost over. It's been a… draining experience. Though I appreciate your patience and understanding. And your unwavering adherence to the "no tubes, no blinking lights" principle. It's very reassuring.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, we are finished. I’ve reviewed the entire form and everything is accurate and complete. It’s all documented – your wishes for comfort care, no life-sustaining interventions, and Omar as your healthcare proxy. I will make a copy for your records, and one for Omar. We’ve covered everything thoroughly, and I appreciate your honesty and clarity. It’s never easy to think about these things, but it’s important to have these conversations. And I want to assure you that your wishes will be respected. Do you have any final questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that's all. You've been very patient and understanding. And you’ve managed to navigate this… delicate subject with remarkable grace. I’m still somewhat overwhelmed, to be honest. But I feel… somewhat reassured, knowing that my wishes are documented and that Omar will be able to… advocate for me, if necessary. Though I suspect he'll be quite flustered by it all. Thank you, Doctor Sieh. You’ve been very kind. And I appreciate your unwavering adherence to the “no tubes, no blinking lights” principle. It’s… a comforting thought. I believe I’ll leave it to you to handle the copies and… other formalities. I think I need a strong cup of mint tea. Perhaps with a little spice. Farewell, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Marija. I’m glad I could help. Please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns in the future. And do enjoy your mint tea – perhaps with a touch of cinnamon. I will take care of the copies and ensure everything is filed appropriately. Take care, and have a peaceful day.
