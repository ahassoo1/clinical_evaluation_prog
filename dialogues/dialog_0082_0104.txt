DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I don't have a lot of time. My throat… it hurts. Has been for a bit, I suppose. Not sure exactly how long. Everything feels rushed these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, a sore throat. Yes, things do seem to move quickly these days. It’s difficult to keep track. You said “a bit”?
PATIENT: Yes, a bit. Maybe… a week? Two? It all blurs together, you know? I’m not good with remembering dates. And honestly, it’s not like it's anything serious. Probably just a cold. I’ve had worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s easy for time to slip away. A week or two… alright. And you said you’ve had worse?
PATIENT: Yes. Much worse. When my husband… well, never mind that. It was a long time ago. This just feels… irritating. I need to get back to work. I have machines to set. Very important machines. It's not something anyone can do, you understand.
DOCTOR: Important machines, yes. I understand needing to get back to things. Just to be thorough, Tammie, can you tell me a little more about the throat pain?
PATIENT: Thorough? Honestly, Doctor, it hurts when I swallow. That’s about it. It's not… throbbing, or anything dramatic. Just a general ache. Like something’s scratchy. And I’m tired, but I’m always tired. Work is exhausting. Is that all you need to know? I really must get back.
DOCTOR: Alright, a scratchy ache when you swallow. And fatigue, which you attribute to work. Have you noticed any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I don’t do fevers. Chills… maybe a little cold sometimes, but that’s just the air conditioning at the factory. And cough? No. Runny nose… sometimes. But that's just allergies, I think. The pollen is terrible this year. Honestly, I haven’t paid much attention. I’m busy. Very busy. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, possible chills from the air conditioning, and a possible runny nose due to allergies. Just to get a clearer picture, Tammie, have you been exposed to anyone recently who’s been sick?
PATIENT: Sick? At the factory? Always. People are always coughing and sneezing. It’s unavoidable. Old man Hemmings had something last week, but I didn't get close. I keep to myself. I don't have time for other people's germs. Frankly, it's probably just a little irritation. I'll be fine. Can we please be done now? I have schedules to manage.
DOCTOR: Alright. You haven't been in close contact with anyone specifically sick, and you believe it's likely just irritation. Just to be sure, and to rule out anything more concerning, would you mind if I take a quick look at your throat?
PATIENT: Look at my throat? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t see the point. It hurts when I swallow. What are you going to do, make it hurt more? I’m not a child. I know what a sore throat is. But… alright, fine. Get it over with. But quickly, please. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand. It will only take a moment. I just want to briefly examine your throat and perhaps feel your neck for any swollen glands. Open wide, please… and say “ahhh.”
PATIENT: Get it over with. It's quite uncomfortable, you know. Honestly, I’ve had worse. But hurry. It's… irritating.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some mild redness in the back of your throat, and your tonsils don't appear significantly enlarged. I do feel a few slightly tender lymph nodes on the side of your neck, but nothing overly concerning at this time. It does seem consistent with a mild viral infection.
PATIENT: A viral infection? Honestly, Doctor, I don't need a fancy name for it. It hurts. What do I need to do? Do I need medicine? I really can’t afford to be sick. I have responsibilities. Machines don’t run themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: You're right, a fancy name doesn't help much. Essentially, it sounds like a common cold. And you're right to be concerned about work. Fortunately, most colds resolve on their own with supportive care. Rest is important, and drinking plenty of fluids. For the sore throat, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, following the package directions. And throat lozenges or warm saltwater gargles can also provide some relief. Given that you're uninsured, I'll keep the recommendations simple and focus on what you can manage without needing a prescription. Do you have access to those kinds of over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter? Yes, I suppose so. The store down the street has everything. But honestly, I don't like taking pills. And gargling with salt water… it’s unpleasant. But I suppose I can manage. Is that all? Can I go now? I need to get back to the factory. The schedule… it won't wait.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now. Rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relief as needed. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, severe pain, or if you don’t see any improvement after a week – please seek medical attention right away. I can provide you with a list of low-cost or free clinics in the area, if you like. Otherwise, I think you should be fine with some self-care. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Low-cost clinics? No, thank you. I'll manage. And no, I don't have any questions. Honestly, I've wasted enough time here already. Thank you for your time, Doctor. But truly, I need to get back to work. Schedules, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. I understand. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to seek help if needed. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
