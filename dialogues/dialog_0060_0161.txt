DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome. I’m Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, a friend suggested I come talk to you about… well, about staying safe. She said there’s a pill I can take, and I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask. I don’t really know much about it, though.
DOCTOR: Staying safe… That’s a bit vague, isn’t it?
PATIENT: It is, isn’t it? Look, my friend… she mentioned something about HIV prevention. A pill you take before you… well, before anything happens that could be risky. She said it’s really effective, but I don't want to assume. And frankly, I’m a little embarrassed to be talking about this. It’s not exactly something I planned on needing to ask a doctor about at my age.
DOCTOR: Right. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis. Your friend is referring to that. It’s a good thing you’re asking questions, Ms. Trefren. It's perfectly reasonable to want to be informed. A lot of people are interested in PrEP these days. Before we go any further, though, let’s just clarify something. Can you tell me a little more about why you’re considering this?
PATIENT: Well… I'm single, as you can see on the chart. I started dating again a few months ago, after… a long time. And honestly, it's been a bit of a whirlwind. I haven't been with anyone regularly in years, and I want to be careful. Really careful. I just want to protect myself, you know? It's not that I don't trust people, but… you can’t be too cautious these days. And my friend said this pill would give me peace of mind.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible, Ms. Trefren. It’s always wise to be proactive about your health, especially when you’re re-entering the dating scene. And it’s good you’re thinking about protection. Before we discuss PrEP specifically, I need to get a more complete picture. Have you had any recent sexually transmitted infection testing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not recently, no. It's been… a long time. Decades, probably. Honestly, it didn't even cross my mind, to be perfectly truthful. I should have, I suppose. Does this mean I need to get tested before we can talk about the pill?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Trefren, it does. It’s standard procedure. We need to rule out any existing infections before starting PrEP. Treating any existing STIs is important for your health, and it also ensures the PrEP medication works effectively. It's also a good opportunity to discuss safe sex practices generally. It’s nothing to be embarrassed about, truly. A lot of people aren’t up-to-date on their testing. We can get that done right here in the clinic today, if you’d like. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, let’s just get it over with. The sooner I know, the better. Honestly, I'm a bit nervous now. I wasn't expecting this to be so… involved. What kind of test are we talking about, exactly? And will it be… uncomfortable? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel a bit anxious, Ms. Trefren. We’ll make it as comfortable as possible. It's a standard blood test, and a urine sample. For the blood test, we’ll check for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and hepatitis B and C. The urine sample will also screen for gonorrhea and chlamydia. The blood draw is quick - just a little pinch. Honestly, it's usually over before you know it. Our phlebotomist is very skilled. We’ll also need to discuss your medical history a bit more thoroughly before starting PrEP. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Never had any reactions to anything. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that's it. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Other than that, pretty healthy for my age, I suppose. Is the blood pressure medication going to interfere with this PrEP thing?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. That shouldn't be a problem, generally. We'll want to monitor your kidney function periodically while you're on PrEP, as Lisinopril and PrEP can both affect the kidneys, but it's routine. And the gallbladder removal shouldn’t be an issue either. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever been exposed to HIV?
PATIENT: Exposed? What do you mean by that? I've never knowingly been near anyone with HIV, if that’s what you're asking. And I’ve never shared needles or anything like that, if you're thinking along those lines. I’m a very… careful person, as I said before. I just want to protect myself while I’m… enjoying life a little bit. Is that so strange?
DOCTOR: Not at all strange, Ms. Trefren. I appreciate you being upfront with me. When I say “exposed,” I simply mean have you ever had unprotected sexual contact with someone whose HIV status you didn't know. Or, have you ever received a blood transfusion before 1985. Just standard questions, to rule things out. And you've answered them perfectly. Now, before we proceed with the testing, I want to explain a little more about PrEP itself. It's not a perfect solution, and it requires consistent use to be effective. Are you comfortable taking a daily pill?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I take my blood pressure medication every morning, so I’m used to taking a pill. I’m a pretty disciplined person, and if I understand this is going to protect me… then yes, I can commit to taking a pill every day. What happens if I miss a day? Or two? Is it like birth control, where it’s a disaster if you forget? I need to know what I’m getting into, Doctor. This is important.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Trefren. And it’s good you’re thinking ahead. It’s not quite as critical as with birth control, but consistency is key. If you miss a dose, it's not the end of the world, but the protection level drops. We recommend taking it as close to the same time every day as possible. If you miss more than two doses, you need to use condoms for the next seven days to be safe. I have a handout here that explains everything in detail. It also outlines potential side effects. The most common are mild nausea or diarrhea, which usually go away on their own. We'll also need to do regular blood tests – every three months – to monitor your kidney function and screen for any STIs. Before we start, are you comfortable with the idea of being tested for HIV every three months?
PATIENT: Regular testing… yes, I suppose so. If it’s necessary, then yes. It’s just… a little daunting, I guess. Having to think about this constantly. But if it keeps me safe, then I’m willing. What if… what if I do test positive, even while taking the pill? What does that mean? Does it mean the pill didn't work? And what if… well, you know. I’m getting ahead of myself, aren’t I? But I need to know these things. I really do. .
DOCTOR: You're not getting ahead of yourself at all, Ms. Trefren. Those are very valid questions, and it's good you're thinking proactively. If you tested positive while taking PrEP, it means the pill wasn't effective in this instance. It's not a failure of the pill itself, necessarily. It could be that you were exposed to HIV before you started taking it, or that you weren't taking it consistently. Or, rarely, the virus may have developed resistance to the medication. We would immediately refer you to an infectious disease specialist for further evaluation and treatment. And we would investigate to determine the cause. It’s important to remember that PrEP is highly effective – over 99% effective when taken consistently – but it’s not foolproof. Now, let's get these tests done, and we can discuss everything in more detail once we have the results. Would you like to change into a gown?
