DOCTOR: Right. So, Keoni MacVittie, 31 years old. Good to meet you. Let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Overgaard. It's… well, it's a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom a lot more recently. Like, constantly feeling the urge, even if there's not much to go, if that makes sense. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I think. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, honestly.
DOCTOR: “A few weeks.” Right. Vague is never helpful, but alright. Constant urge, even with little output… So, not painful?
PATIENT: No, not painful at all. Just… frequent. And a bit disruptive, truthfully. I work as a concierge, so… well, you can imagine. It’s a bit difficult to constantly be excusing myself. I don't think there's any burning or anything like that, though. Just the feeling of needing to go, all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. So no pain, no burning, just frequency. And it’s interfering with work. Have you noticed any changes in how you’re going?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think. I… I don’t believe so, no. It feels normal when I actually go, if that makes sense. The stream is… regular. I haven’t noticed anything different about the color or anything like that, either. It’s just… how often I’m needing to go. I’m really sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Right. So, normal stream, normal color, just…the perception of increased frequency. Have you changed anything in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Diet… that’s… I try to eat fairly healthy. I haven’t intentionally changed anything, but… thinking about it, I have been drinking a lot more water lately. It’s been very warm, and my job keeps me on my feet. I suppose I’m trying to stay hydrated. Could that be it? I honestly have no idea.
DOCTOR: More water…yes, that could explain it. Though, frankly, people often overestimate how much water they actually need. Are you consuming a lot of caffeine or alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, not much alcohol at all. Not since the… divorce. And caffeine… I have a cup of tea in the morning, maybe two. Black tea, usually. Nothing fancy. I avoid coffee, it makes me jittery. I definitely don’t drink energy drinks or anything like that. Is there anything else you think could be causing it? I feel like I’m just rambling now.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no significant dietary changes, limited caffeine, no alcohol. And you've ruled out pain and changes in stream. Have you experienced any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, none of those things. Definitely no fever or chills. No nausea or vomiting, and my stomach has been fine. No abdominal pain either. Actually, thinking about it… I did feel a little tired lately, but I just assumed it was the heat and being busy at work. Is that relevant? I’m really sorry if I’m not being helpful, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: "Not what it used to be," right. Well, fatigue could be a symptom of… many things. Let’s do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just lie down on the table, we'll start with a simple abdominal palpation, and then I'll need to do a quick neurological check, just to rule things out. Nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Okay. I hope this won't take too long. I have a shift starting in a few hours.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just tell me if anything feels particularly tender, or uncomfortable. Now, deep breaths... Hmm. No significant tenderness, but there's a slight…guarding here. Not alarming, but we’ll document it. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you just let your legs dangle down?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that was a little sensitive, just there. On the left side. But it’s not painful, exactly. Just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: “Noticeable.” Right. Guarding on the left side. Now, let me just check your reflexes… Hmm. Reflexes are normal. Strength appears to be good as well. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope. Bowel sounds are present, but a bit…hypoactive. Not concerning, but another thing to note.
PATIENT: Okay. Hypoactive… what does that mean, exactly? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: "Hypoactive" simply means your bowel sounds are a little quieter than usual. It’s not necessarily “bad”, but it could indicate mild sluggishness. Based on what you’ve told me, and this exam, I suspect it’s likely a combination of increased fluid intake and possibly mild dehydration from the heat. It’s not something I’m overly concerned about at this moment. But, we will need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. That… that sounds reasonably reassuring. Rule out… what other possibilities? What would those be? And… what would we need to do to rule them out? I have insurance, right? Or… do I? I can’t seem to remember…
DOCTOR: “Insurance.” Right. The clinic records indicate you are currently uninsured. Unfortunately, that will limit our options. As for "other possibilities"... we need to rule out a urinary tract infection, and, less likely, but we must consider, a mild kidney issue. We can perform a simple urine analysis to start. It will tell us if there’s an infection. If that comes back negative, we can discuss potentially more expensive imaging, though, frankly, given your history, I doubt it's warranted.
PATIENT: Oh. No insurance… right. That complicates things. A urine analysis… that sounds… reasonable. How much would that cost? And… would it require a sample now? I… I didn’t really come prepared for this.
DOCTOR: "Prepared." Right. The urine analysis is fairly inexpensive, about $75 out-of-pocket. And yes, it requires a sample now. There's a restroom down the hall. I'll give you a cup and instructions. Just be sure to collect a mid-stream sample. I'll wait here. Don't take too long, I have other patients.
PATIENT: Oh. Seventy-five dollars… Okay. Mid-stream… right. Thank you, Doctor. .
