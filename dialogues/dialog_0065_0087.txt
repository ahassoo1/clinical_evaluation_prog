DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think? The usual. Honestly, I don’t really keep track anymore. Medicare sent something, I suppose. Is that enough? I haven’t been feeling particularly… anything, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “The usual” can be…vague, Mr. Croonquist. Medicare does send out a lot of reminders for preventative screenings. Let's clarify. Are you referring to your annual physical and bloodwork, or were you prompted for something specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Probably something specific. It's always something, isn’t it? I really don’t remember. Bloodwork sounds right, though. I get tired easily, but… I’m an old man. That's probably just it. Is there a form I need to fill out? Let’s just get it over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need to establish why you're here today, even if it's just for a routine check-up. "Getting tired easily" is something we should investigate, regardless of age. It could be many things. And yes, there is a form, but we’ll get to that after I get a better understanding of your health history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I recall. Never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. Honestly, Doctor, my memory’s just… gone to pot. I used to work at the power plant, you know. Lots of… things there. Chemicals, I suppose. But that was ages ago. I doubt it’s relevant now. Can we just… do the bloodwork?
DOCTOR: “Not relevant”?
PATIENT: Well, I mean, it was a long time ago. Different life. Before… well, before things got fuzzy. It wasn’t like I was swimming in chemicals, just… around them. It’s probably nothing. Look, I appreciate you asking, but I really just want to get this done. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, with all due respect, dismissing a potential occupational exposure history is… unwise. It is relevant. Knowing what you were exposed to can significantly impact how we interpret your results. And frankly, “fuzzy” isn't a medical diagnosis. Let’s try this: were you ever formally diagnosed with any condition related to your time at the power plant?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… hmm. That’s a good question. I think… there was something about my lungs. A cough, mostly. They gave me some… inhaler, I think. A little silver one. I used it for a while, then… stopped. It didn't seem to do much, honestly. And again, that was years ago. Doctor, I’m really not good with remembering things. I just want to make sure I'm healthy enough to… keep living my life. Can we just focus on that?
DOCTOR: “A cough” and “a little silver inhaler” isn’t particularly helpful, Mr. Croonquist. We need specifics. Let me see if I can pull up your records from the power plant’s medical department. Do you recall the name of the plant, or perhaps the city it was located in?
PATIENT: The… the Kandahar Power Plant. It was outside of Kandahar city, Afghanistan. A long time ago, before… everything changed. It was a big place. Lots of… turbines, I think. And dust. Always dust. The records… I don't know if they’d still exist, honestly. It was a different government then, a different… everything.
DOCTOR: Kandahar Power Plant… Yes, I’m finding some limited records here. It appears you were seen for chronic bronchitis and exposure to particulate matter. There’s a note about a pulmonary function test performed in 2008. It doesn’t give specific results, unfortunately. It also notes you were advised to continue using a bronchodilator inhaler. Do you still have that inhaler?
PATIENT: Bronchodilator… no. I haven't seen that in years. I stopped using it because it didn’t really help. It just made my mouth dry. I figured if it wasn't helping, there was no point. Look, I appreciate you digging all this up, but I really just want to get the bloodwork done and be on my way. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's not too much to ask, Mr. Croonquist. However, proceeding without a thorough understanding of your history would be… irresponsible. Given your history of chronic bronchitis and exposure at the Kandahar Power Plant, and the fact that you report continued fatigue, I need to perform a brief physical exam. Specifically, I want to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. It will take only a few minutes. Then we can proceed with the bloodwork. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be quick about it, please. My back’s been acting up lately. I don't want to spend all day here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a deep breath in through your mouth, and exhale slowly. Your breathing is slightly wheezed, bilaterally. And your oxygen saturation is 92% – which is a little low, but not immediately alarming. I also note some mild cyanosis around your lips. Now, could you please sit up straight and open your mouth?
PATIENT: Cyanosis? What’s that? Is that bad? I told you, I get tired easily. Maybe it's just… old age. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not a doctor. I just want to know if I'm going to drop dead anytime soon.
DOCTOR: Cyanosis is a bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels in the blood. It can be concerning, Mr. Croonquist. And while fatigue can be attributed to age, it's crucial to rule out other causes, especially given your history. We're not simply dismissing anything, we're investigating. Based on what you've told me, and the preliminary findings from the exam, I recommend we order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. It’s also essential to repeat the pulmonary function test. I'm also going to write you a referral to a pulmonologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you like me to go over the steps of getting those tests completed?
PATIENT: A pulmonologist? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, it’s just getting to be too much. I just wanted some bloodwork. I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Is a chest X-ray really necessary? I’m an old man. Things are going to break down eventually. Can’t we just do the bloodwork and see what happens?
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, I understand your frustration, but I am obligated to provide you with the best possible care. Dismissing potentially serious symptoms based on age alone is not only irresponsible, it's dangerous. Your oxygen saturation is below the normal range, you have a history of chronic bronchitis, and you report ongoing fatigue. These findings necessitate further investigation. A chest X-ray will help us rule out pneumonia, lung cancer, or other serious conditions. A pulmonary function test will assess your lung capacity and identify any airway obstruction. A referral to a pulmonologist will ensure you receive specialized care and a comprehensive evaluation. I strongly advise you to follow these recommendations. We can proceed with the bloodwork as well, but it is not a substitute for a thorough investigation of your respiratory health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I don't understand any of it, honestly. Just… tell me what I need to do. Where do I go for these tests? And how long will it take? I have… things.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m printing out a referral for a pulmonary function test and a chest X-ray. The pulmonary function test can be scheduled at the Rural General Hospital, their number is listed on the referral form. The chest X-ray can be completed at the imaging center across the street; they accept Medicare, but it’s always best to confirm with them directly. The results will be sent to my office. As for how long it will take… the tests themselves shouldn't take more than an hour each. Scheduling the appointments may take a few days, depending on their availability. I’ll also need you to sign this consent form. And while we wait for those results, we’ll proceed with the bloodwork as scheduled. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. I need to go.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Here’s a copy of the referral form and a list of instructions. Please schedule those appointments as soon as possible. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. And Mr. Croonquist, please follow up with me as soon as you receive the results. .
