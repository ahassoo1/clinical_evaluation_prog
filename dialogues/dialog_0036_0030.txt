DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. My name is Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a little embarrassing, but I've noticed a change in my body odor. It's... different than usual, and it's been worrying me. I can't really describe it, just that it's not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you brought this up – changes like that can be a sign of something worth looking into, and there's no need to be embarrassed at all. It's better to be safe and figure out what's going on. To help me understand what’s happening, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started, I'd say, maybe about a month ago? Around the beginning of July, I think. It wasn’t sudden, more like… gradual. I didn’t really pay attention at first, just thought maybe I was working too hard and sweating more. But it hasn’t gone away, even when I’m not doing much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around the beginning of July, and it’s been persistent, even with reduced activity. And you said it just doesn’t smell like you normally do. Can you describe the odor a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's hard to explain. It's not just… sweaty. It’s… almost sour, but not like vinegar. And maybe a little… musty? I used to smell clean, you know? Even after a long day of work. Now it's like… something else is mixed in. I really don’t know how to put it. I've tried different deodorants, even stronger ones, but nothing seems to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, "sour and musty" is helpful. And the fact that stronger deodorants aren't helping is good to know. Have you noticed it all over your body, or is it localized to certain areas, like your armpits, groin, or feet?
PATIENT: Mostly it's my armpits, I think. I haven’t really noticed it on my feet or anywhere else, thankfully. Though, sometimes, when I've been working really hard, I think I smell it a little bit… everywhere? It’s hard to tell, honestly. I usually just smell it right after I take my shirt off at the end of the day. It’s definitely worse when I’m hot and sweaty, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, primarily in the armpits, potentially more generalized with exertion. Have you experienced any other changes recently, like changes in your diet, weight loss or gain, increased sweating overall, or any skin changes in your armpits – redness, itching, or new growths?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. My weight hasn’t changed much, maybe lost a pound or two, but nothing significant. My diet… I haven’t really changed what I eat. Still the same old things, mostly. I have been sweating a little more than usual, even when it's not that hot, but I figured that was just because of the work. And… no, I haven't noticed any skin changes in my armpits. No redness, itching, or anything like that. Just the smell. It's just the smell that's bothering me so much.
DOCTOR: Okay. No weight change, consistent diet, slight increase in sweating, and no skin changes in the armpits. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see... I don’t have diabetes. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, and I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Other than that… not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. And I'm on Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the gallbladder removal and controlled hypertension. Medicare is helpful information too. And you said it’s well-controlled with medication – what medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: It’s lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. And I take it regularly, haven’t missed a dose in years. I always make sure to refill it on time, you know? It's important to keep that under control.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril 10mg daily, consistently taken. Good. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family had similar issues with body odor, or any unusual medical conditions?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Hmm. Not that I know of, actually. My mother never had problems with body odor, and neither did my sisters. My father had heart problems, but nothing like this. My grandfather… he had some kind of skin condition, but I don't remember what it was exactly. It wasn’t body odor, though. Just… some rash, I think. It was a long time ago. I don’t really know much about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No family history of unusual body odor, and a distant history of a skin rash in your grandfather. Finally, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the lisinopril, like I said. And I take a daily multivitamin, but that's it. Nothing else. I try to eat healthy, so I don’t really need a lot of extra supplements. Just the basic multivitamin to make sure I'm getting everything I need.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just lisinopril and a daily multivitamin. Thank you for all that information, Kerriann. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a closer look at your armpits to see if I notice anything unusual. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I'm ready when you are. Hopefully, you can figure out what's going on. It’s just been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I don’t notice any immediate abnormalities. Examining your armpits, the skin appears normal in color and texture. There’s no redness, swelling, or any visible rashes. I don’t feel any lumps or masses. However, I do detect a faint, unusual odor – it’s subtle, but it's different from typical body odor. Given your history and the exam findings, there are a few possibilities we should consider. It’s unlikely to be something serious, but we want to rule out potential causes. One possibility is a condition called bromhidrosis, which is excessive or abnormal body odor. It can be caused by bacteria breaking down sweat. Another possibility, though less likely given your stable medical history, could be a medication side effect, or rarely, a metabolic condition. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to order a few blood tests. Specifically, I’d like to check your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and a complete blood count. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. If tests can figure out what’s wrong, that’s good. Kidney function and blood sugar… okay. Yes, that's alright with me. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's causing this. It's just unsettling to smell... off. What do I need to do to get those tests done?
DOCTOR: I understand. It is unsettling. Alright, I’ll write you a lab order for those blood tests. You can go to [Name of Local Lab, e.g., Quest Diagnostics] – they have several locations in the area. The order will be sent electronically to them, so you shouldn’t have to bring anything with you except your Medicare card. They’ll likely need a blood sample, and the results should be back within a few days. I’ll also provide you with a referral to a dermatologist, just in case the blood tests don't reveal a clear cause. A dermatologist can take a closer look at your skin and rule out any skin conditions that might be contributing to the odor. The referral won’t obligate you to see them, but it's good to have it as an option. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your usual hygiene routine. Avoid using harsh deodorants or antiperspirants, as they can sometimes irritate the skin. And if you notice any changes in your condition – redness, itching, swelling, or a sudden worsening of the odor – please let me know right away. Do you have any questions about the tests, the referral, or anything else we discussed today?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. So, blood tests at Quest Diagnostics, and a referral to a dermatologist just in case. No harsh deodorants… I can do that. I guess… is there anything I should be looking for? Any particular symptoms that would mean I need to call you before the test results come back? And… what if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions. Let's address those. Regarding symptoms to watch for before the test results, please call me immediately if you develop a fever, notice any significant redness, swelling, or pain in your armpits, or if the odor becomes suddenly much worse. Also, any new rash or skin lesions should be reported right away. As for what if it is something serious – it’s unlikely, but we need to be prepared. If the blood tests reveal an underlying medical condition, we'll discuss the appropriate treatment options. Depending on the condition, this could involve medication, lifestyle changes, or a referral to a specialist. I will explain everything in detail and answer any questions you have. The conditions we're most concerned about ruling out would be metabolic disorders, but given your stable health history, those are less likely. I want to reassure you that we’re taking a thorough approach, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. We're starting with the most common and least serious possibilities and working our way through the less likely ones. The dermatologist can provide an expert opinion on any skin-related causes. Do you feel comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Yes… that makes me feel a little better. Starting with the easy things, and then moving on… I can handle that. And you'll explain everything if something is wrong. Okay. I guess… I'll go to Quest Diagnostics and get the blood tests done. And I'll keep an eye out for those symptoms you mentioned. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I feel a little less anxious now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I'm glad I could help ease your anxiety. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns, even if they seem small. We’ll be in touch as soon as the test results are back. Have a good day, and please take care.
