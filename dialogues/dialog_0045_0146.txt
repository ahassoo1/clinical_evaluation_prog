DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, thanks, Doctor Billman. It’s… muscle weakness, mostly. Been getting worse the last few weeks, I guess. It’s kinda hard to explain exactly when it started, to be honest. Just… weaker.
DOCTOR: Okay, “weaker.” That’s… vague, and I understand it can be hard to pinpoint. Can you tell me where you’re feeling this weakness?
PATIENT: Mostly in my legs, I think. And my arms a little, but the legs are definitely worse. It's… harder to get up from a chair, you know? And walking feels… heavier than it used to. Not painful, just… takes more effort.
DOCTOR: Okay, legs mostly, harder to get up, walking feels heavier. And this has been happening for… a few weeks now, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few weeks. Honestly, it’s hard to say exactly how many. Maybe six? It started slowly, and I just kinda… ignored it, hoping it would go away. It hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Right. Ignoring things rarely makes them go away. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. I've been… tired, I guess. But everyone's tired, right? I work long hours. And… maybe a little more clumsy than usual. Dropped my coffee this morning, which is not like me. But other than that, no. No fever, no pain… nothing else that I can think of.
DOCTOR: "Tired" could be a lot of things. And clumsiness... alright. Do you have any trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: Balance… not really, no. I haven’t fallen or anything. But… maybe I feel a little unsteady sometimes, when I stand up quickly. Just for a second. It's hard to explain. Like… a little dizzy for a moment. Not a full spinny-head dizzy, just… off.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what sort of work do you do?
PATIENT: I'm an insurance appraiser. Auto damage, mostly. So I’m on my feet a lot, looking at wrecked cars, taking pictures, writing estimates… a lot of bending and reaching and… walking around junkyards. It’s… physical work, for sure.
DOCTOR: Right. So physical demands at work. Now, have you noticed this weakness getting worse with activity, or is it there pretty much all the time, regardless of what you're doing?
PATIENT: It’s… worse at the end of the day, definitely. After a long day looking at cars, my legs feel like jelly. But it's not gone in the morning, you know? It’s just… less noticeable. It's kinda there all the time, but flares up with activity. Like, I’ll be fine walking around for a bit, and then after a few hours, it gets… worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed fine. Other than that, no. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, I don’t even remember when. I usually just tough things out.
DOCTOR: “Toughing things out” isn’t a strategy, Mr. McKinnon. It’s a way to let things get worse. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had anything that needed one. Just… a few bumps and bruises over the years. Nothing major. I’m pretty careful, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings – have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mom… she had arthritis, in her hands, mostly. Nothing else that I can think of, really. My siblings are both healthy, as far as I know. We don’t talk that much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your mother. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing that I know of, anyway. I can eat anything, take any medicine… no problems there.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Now, let’s get to the physical exam. I’m going to need to check your reflexes, strength, and balance. It’ll take a few minutes. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. No problem. Just let me know what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, can you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Here we go. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, push back against my hand. Don’t push too hard. Testing right leg... Fair strength. Some weakness noted. Testing left leg… Similar. Also fair, with some weakness. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Relax your legs. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are 1+ bilaterally, slightly diminished. Now, walk slowly for me, please. I notice a slightly unsteady gait, with a wider base of support and a slight hesitation with each step. Okay, Mr. McKinnon. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'd like to get some blood work to rule out some common causes of muscle weakness. We'll check your Vitamin D, B12 levels, and also a complete blood count. I also want to rule out diabetes, so we’ll do a blood sugar test.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Blood work, right? I guess that makes sense. I don't have any problems with needles or anything. Just… don’t like being stuck, if you know what I mean. What kind of things are you looking for, exactly? I mean, is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, it’s too early to say whether it’s “serious.” That’s what the blood work is for. We need to gather information. The tests I've ordered will help us rule out a number of possibilities. Things like vitamin deficiencies – particularly Vitamin D and B12 – can cause muscle weakness. So can diabetes, thyroid problems, and other underlying medical conditions. The blood work will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the next steps. It's good you don't have any issues with needles. We'll just need a small sample. Do you have any allergies to latex or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to latex. I'm fine with all that. So… vitamin deficiencies, diabetes… that doesn’t sound too bad, I guess. If that’s all it is. But what if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, I understand your concern. It's good that we're being proactive. If the blood work does reveal something more concerning, we'll discuss it thoroughly, and I'll explain all your options. In the unlikely event that something more serious is found, we’ll likely need to consider further testing, such as an MRI or nerve conduction studies. We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. Right now, let's focus on getting the blood work done. I'll write you a lab requisition, and the nurse will come in to draw the samples. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… try not to scare me too much when you get the results, okay? And… thanks for explaining everything. It makes me feel a little better, knowing what’s going on. So, nurse will be in here soon?
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll review the results as soon as they become available, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I understand you're anxious, Mr. McKinnon, and I will do my best to explain everything clearly and honestly. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Thank you for your patience.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor Billman. I appreciate it. .
