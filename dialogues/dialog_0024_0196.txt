DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Mutnick, right? Yes… well, it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on… a while now. Honestly, I can’t really say how long. A long while. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: “A long while” isn’t particularly helpful, Ms. Licano. We need specifics if I am to be of assistance. Can you estimate, even roughly, when you first began noticing this… “draining” sensation?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You’re right, you’re right. Specifics… hmm. Let me think. Before… before George passed, maybe? Yes, I think so. It was getting worse then, but… I just thought it was… everything, you know? Grief and such. He… he died in November of 2023. So… after that, I guess. Maybe December? It’s all a bit… blurry.
DOCTOR: December 2023. Very well. And has this tiredness been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s pretty constant, yes. Some days are… worse than others, of course. But it’s always there. Like a weight, you know? Even when I’ve had a good night’s sleep – which isn’t often, mind you – I just… don’t feel rested. Just… blah.
DOCTOR: “Blah.” Right. And are there any other symptoms accompanying this… “blah-ness”?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Sometimes my muscles ache. Not all over, just… here and there. And… I’ve been a bit forgetful lately. More than usual, anyway. Although, at my age… … who isn't forgetful? I don't know, really. Just… generally not feeling like myself.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness and muscle aches are… common. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. Not really, I don’t think. I eat, when I remember to. See? Forgetful again! I usually have a little something for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch… and dinner when I feel up to it. Nothing fancy. I haven't lost my appetite, if that's what you mean. It’s just… sometimes I don’t bother.
DOCTOR: And have you experienced any difficulty with sleep, aside from not feeling rested?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Trouble getting to sleep, mostly. I lie there for ages, just… turning and turning. And then I wake up a couple of times during the night. Not every night, but often enough to be annoying. It's not like I'm tossing and turning all night, but it’s never a solid sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Licano?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just… for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it is. And… a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. Ibuprofen, when it’s bad. That’s about it. Oh, and a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me to take it. Is that all? I always forget.
DOCTOR: You must be more precise, Ms. Licano. Do you recall the dosage of the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Dosage… I really can’t remember. It’s a little white pill. I think… 20 milligrams? Maybe. I just take it every morning, like the doctor told me. I have a little pill organizer, but… sometimes I mess up the days. I'm sorry. I just don't keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway. I used to get a bit of a rash from certain soaps, but that was years ago. Nothing to do with medications, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… George had a heart attack, so I was in the hospital with him. But that wasn't me being sick, you know? I mean, I haven't been hospitalized for anything serious. Nothing I remember, anyway. A few bad colds, that's all.
DOCTOR: And have you had any major surgical procedures aside from the tonsillectomy?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Let me think. I had a hysterectomy… a long time ago. Maybe thirty years ago? Something like that. And… a knee replacement a few years back. But that was… 2018, I think? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, regarding your family history… are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… well, my mother had… something with her heart. I don’t really remember what, exactly. She died when I was young. And George’s father… he had diabetes, I think. But other than that… not really. We weren’t a very healthy family, to be honest. Lots of smoking… and bad habits.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke, Ms. Licano?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Not anymore. I used to, years ago. But I quit… oh, goodness, must be twenty years now. Best thing I ever did, that.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing much. A glass, maybe two. It helps me relax. Not every night, mind you. Only when I'm feeling stressed. Which is… most of the time, lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to need to conduct a brief physical exam. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll start with your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just… be gentle, please? My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 150 over 88. Pulse is 72, regular. Heart sounds… normal, but somewhat distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please relax. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are… diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Overall, a fairly unremarkable exam, aside from the elevated blood pressure. Now, based on what you've told me, and the exam, I suspect you may be experiencing fatigue due to a number of factors, including potential stress, poor sleep, and possibly suboptimal blood pressure control. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. We also need to repeat your blood pressure reading on a separate occasion. Based on the results, we can determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a lot. Blood work… I don’t like needles. But… if you think it's necessary. So, you think it's just… stress? And the blood pressure? I suppose that makes sense. I've been a bit worried, lately. I guess that would raise it. Will the blood work tell me what's wrong?
DOCTOR: The blood work will help us identify potential underlying causes for your symptoms, Ms. Licano, not necessarily tell you definitively what is “wrong.” It will rule out things like anemia, thyroid problems, or vitamin deficiencies. We need objective data. As for your blood pressure, it's elevated, and while stress can contribute, it needs to be addressed. We’ll start with the blood work and repeat the blood pressure reading. If it remains elevated, we may need to consider medication. I will give you a requisition form for the lab. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I also want you to try to improve your sleep hygiene. That means going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, I understand. Sleep hygiene… Easier said than done, I'm afraid. But I'll try. And the blood work… is it a lot of tubes? I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: It's a standard blood draw, Ms. Licano. A few tubes. The phlebotomist is very skilled. It will be over before you know it. Now, unless you have any further questions, I believe we've covered everything. I will have my nurse contact you with the lab results. Please schedule a follow-up appointment once you’ve had the blood work completed. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. Blood work… .
