DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Panjoj. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, recently, my memory has been… not as good. It is concerning. I am Venus Alvara, by the way. Perhaps you have it in your papers, but I like to be… thorough.
DOCTOR: Yes, Venus, I do have your information here. Thank you for confirming. It is good to be thorough. And yes, I see here you're concerned about some memory changes. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. It is… difficult to explain. It is not that I forget everything. I remember dates, names of people I met… very clearly, actually. But small things… where I put my glasses, if I took my medication… these things, I struggle with now. It is… frustrating. And, frankly, a little frightening. I have been told my blood pressure is… high. Could that be related?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Venus. It is concerning when you notice changes in your memory. It's good that you're able to distinguish between remembering certain things and struggling with others – that helps us narrow things down. And yes, high blood pressure can absolutely affect cognitive function, so that’s a very good question to ask. Before we jump to conclusions, let’s try to get a more detailed picture of what’s going on. When did you first start noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a good question. I believe it started… perhaps six months ago? It was gradual. At first, I thought it was just stress. My husband… he passed away two years ago. I am still… adjusting. But it has not gotten better with time. In fact, it feels… worse. Now, I worry constantly.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Venus. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, and grief can certainly affect many things, including cognitive function. It’s understandable that you'd be concerned about this, especially since it hasn’t improved with time. So, six months ago is when you began noticing the changes. Can you give me a specific example of a time recently where you had trouble remembering something?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. It is… kind of you to say so. Just yesterday, actually. I went to the grocery store. I had a list – I always have a list. But… I went to make tea when I returned, and I could not recall if I bought tea. I stood there… staring at the bags, and I couldn’t be sure. I ended up buying another box… just in case. It seems silly, I know, but it is… these little things that worry me. And then I worry about the worrying itself, you see?
DOCTOR: That doesn't sound silly at all, Venus. It's very helpful to have these specific examples, and it gives me a better understanding of what's going on. It is common to experience anxiety when dealing with memory issues, and that anxiety can sometimes worsen the memory problems. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, concentration, or ability to complete familiar tasks besides the memory issues?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… a fair question. My concentration… it is not what it once was. I used to enjoy reading, but now I find myself… rereading the same pages multiple times. And… sometimes, I feel a little… sad. Not constantly, but… waves of it. I do not think it is a… deep depression, but it is more than just grieving, perhaps. As for familiar tasks… nothing major. But I sometimes feel… overwhelmed by small things. Like, balancing the checkbook. It used to be simple.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venus. That's all very helpful information. Difficulty concentrating, waves of sadness, and feeling overwhelmed with tasks… These things can all be interconnected. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I have… hypertension, as you know. It runs in my family. And… I had a small heart attack five years ago, but it was… minor. I was told I recovered fully. I do not take many medications, just… something for the blood pressure. I do not recall the name currently, I apologize. And… I have arthritis in my hands, which makes some things… difficult, but it is not… relevant to this, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venus. So, Lisinopril for hypertension, and a history of a minor heart attack. We’ll certainly keep those things in mind. The heart attack could be relevant, even if it was minor. And the arthritis... it is good to know, as it can affect your ability to do certain things. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any… allergies. None that I am aware of, at least. I have eaten… many things in my life. I have never had a reaction to anything. As for medications… I have not taken many, so I would have… noticed, I believe.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Venus. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any instances of memory loss or dementia in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a… difficult question. My mother… she became… confused in her later years. But we never had a… proper diagnosis. It was… just assumed it was age. My grandmother also… forgot things, I think. But again, it was many years ago, and no one… investigated, you could say. I do not know if it was… significant or not. It was… common for older people to forget, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venus. It’s helpful to know even if a definitive diagnosis wasn’t made. Any history of cognitive decline in the family is worth noting. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And I… rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner… on special occasions. Maybe once a month, if that. It is not a… habit.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venus. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam and a few simple cognitive tests. Just to get a better baseline assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. I would like to… understand what is happening, and if there is anything I can do. Please… proceed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then, I'll do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. Finally, we’ll do a few questions, a simple memory test, to evaluate your cognitive function. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 82 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 145/90. That’s a bit higher than we’d like, even with the Lisinopril. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. It feels… strange, to be examined like this. Not unpleasant, just… a little unnerving. I hope my blood pressure is not elevated because of… this.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Venus. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. And yes, the exam itself can temporarily raise your blood pressure, so we’ll take that into consideration. Reflexes are a little brisk, but within normal limits. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is everything… alright? They feel… a little cold, your hands. It is not… a complaint, just an observation.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venus. Yes, my hands can be a little cold sometimes. Everything is alright. Your grip strength is normal. Now, let’s move on to a simple memory test. I’m going to say three words, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me. Then, I’ll ask you to recall them again in about five minutes. The words are: apple, table, and penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Apple… table… penny. Is that… correct? I hope I remembered them properly.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Venus. Perfect. Now, we'll continue with a few other questions. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: The year… hmm. It is… 2025, is it not? August… the second. Yes, 2025.
DOCTOR: Correct. And what city are we in currently?
PATIENT: Hmm… We are in… the city. I believe it is… Urban. Yes, I am quite certain of that.
DOCTOR: Very good, Venus. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards. Take your time, and don’t worry if it’s not perfect.
PATIENT: … d… l… r… o… w… Yes. W… o… r… l… d. Is that… correct? It feels… difficult.
DOCTOR: That was a good attempt, Venus. It's not easy! It's a challenging task for many people. Now, let's go back to those three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, and penny. Can you tell me those three words again?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. … I… I can't seem to… recall them. I know there were three words… apple, perhaps? But I… I can't remember the others. I am so sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Venus. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty with short-term recall, especially with a bit of stress. Based on what we’ve discussed and the exam results, you're experiencing some memory issues and some difficulty with concentration. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which can contribute to cognitive impairment. Now, I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. If it will help to… understand what is happening, then yes, I am happy to have the tests. A brain scan… it sounds a little frightening, but I trust your judgement, Doctor. If you think it is necessary, then let us proceed. I just want to know what is happening, and what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Venus. I understand your apprehension about the brain scan, but it's the best way to get a definitive diagnosis. We'll schedule those tests for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a medication to help lower your blood pressure. It’s important to control your blood pressure to protect your cognitive function. I will also recommend some lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet. I'd also like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can provide a more specialized assessment and help you develop a treatment plan. Would you like me to schedule that appointment for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very kind of you. If you could schedule the appointment with the neurologist, that would be… a great help. I do not want to… overwhelm myself with too much to do at once. You are very… thorough, Doctor Panjoj. And I appreciate your… patience. It has been a little… stressful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venus. I’m glad I could help. I understand this is stressful, and we'll take things one step at a time. I've scheduled an appointment with Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurologist specializing in memory disorders, for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. They’ll be in touch to confirm. Here are the lab orders, the prescription for Lisinopril 20mg daily, and the information about your appointment with Dr. Vance. Please take these to the lab and pharmacy as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You have been… very helpful, Doctor. You answered all of my questions, and you explained everything… very clearly. I appreciate your… kindness. And your patience, again. It is a… relief to have a plan. Perhaps… perhaps things will be alright. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venus. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. And you’re right, having a plan is a good first step. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. I’ll see you again for a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to discuss the results of the tests. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Venus.
PATIENT: .
