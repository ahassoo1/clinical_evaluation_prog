DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Gedalya. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker lately, and my eyelids… they’re drooping. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, and it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… getting worse over a few months. Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started in my legs, I think. Just feeling a bit more tired after walking, you know? Now, it’s… it's harder to get up from a chair sometimes, and climbing stairs is… quite a task. It’s not a sudden thing, it’s just… gradual. And it seems to be spreading to my arms a little now, too. It's difficult to carry things for any length of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset, starting in the legs and now affecting your arms as well… and difficulty with activities like getting up and climbing stairs. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness and drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, actually. I’ve been having some… blurry vision. Not constant, but it comes and goes. And sometimes… well, sometimes it feels like my voice is a little… slurred, maybe? It’s hard to describe. My ex-wife mentioned it a few times, but I wasn't sure if I was just tired. It's not all the time, though. Just… occasionally.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and occasional slurred speech… okay. And how about any changes in your breathing?
PATIENT: Changes in my breathing? Not that I’ve noticed, no. I mean, I get out of breath climbing those stairs, but I just assumed that was from the weakness. Nothing… unusual, I don’t think. I haven’t been short of breath just… sitting or lying down. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I was asking. Good to know. And have you noticed any changes in your weight recently – either gaining or losing?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, a little. I think I’ve lost a bit of weight, actually. Not intentionally, mind you. My appetite hasn’t been fantastic lately, and… well, my divorce was finalized about six months ago, so things have been a bit stressful. I haven’t weighed myself properly in a while, but my clothes feel… looser, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss, decreased appetite, and recent stress… all important things to know. Now, just to get a bit of a broader picture, have you been having any trouble swallowing, any changes in your bowel habits, or any skin rashes or unusual sensations?
PATIENT: Trouble swallowing… no, not really. My bowel habits are… normal, I suppose. Nothing out of the ordinary. And no rashes or unusual sensations, thankfully. No, everything else feels… fairly normal, apart from the weakness and the eyelids, of course. It’s just… it’s all a bit worrying, to be honest. It's starting to affect my daily life.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you came in to get it checked out. Let’s move on to a bit of your medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I recall, no. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was… a very long time ago. And I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, measles, chickenpox… but nothing serious as an adult. I’ve generally been quite healthy, to be honest. I don't take any regular medication, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a teenager and otherwise healthy. No current medications. And how about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mother passed away a few years ago. She had… some heart problems, I believe. My father is still alive, but he’s quite elderly and… a bit forgetful, to be honest. He doesn't really talk about his health much. As far as I know, there weren't any… neurological conditions or anything similar on either side of the family. But I don't know much detail, I'm afraid. It wasn’t something we discussed a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with heart problems, father elderly and a bit forgetful, no known neurological conditions. And are you currently working or in school?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I’m a Facilities Manager. It’s… a fairly physical job, actually, which is why I'm getting concerned about the weakness. Lots of walking around, checking buildings, making sure everything is in order. It’s becoming… difficult, to be honest. I haven’t mentioned it to my employer yet, but… I’m worried it might start to affect my work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Facilities Manager, fairly physical job. Just one more thing for the history, and it's quite important. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had any reactions to medication before. And no food allergies, either. I can eat pretty much anything. I've never had any problems with pollen or anything like that, either. No, I don't have any allergies, as far as I'm aware.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Gedalya, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to do a physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and assess your muscle strength. It'll just take a few minutes. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No, no questions at the moment. That sounds… perfectly reasonable. Please, go ahead. I'm ready whenever you are. It’s a relief to be getting something done about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Reflexes are… a little diminished, actually. And finally, I'm going to check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? I hope that’s enough. It doesn’t feel quite as strong as it used to, honestly. It’s… a bit difficult. It feels like I’m putting in the effort, but it's not translating into much strength. I'm trying, Doctor. Really, I am.
DOCTOR: I see. And that's perfectly alright, Gedalya. It’s good you’re letting me know. Now, let’s check your strength in your legs. Can you lift each leg up while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it looks. And I can feel it straining my muscles a little. It's not as easy as it used to be. Is this what you're looking for? It feels… weak, Doctor. Really weak.
DOCTOR: Yes, Gedalya, that’s exactly what I was looking for, and thank you for your effort. Your leg strength is also diminished. Now, I’m going to check your eye movements. Just follow my finger with your eyes. And can you tell me what colors you see in this image?
PATIENT: Yes, I can see… blue, and… red, and… green. Is that correct? It's a little blurry, honestly, but I can make out the colors. It's not as sharp as it should be. They seem a bit… faded, Doctor. Not very vibrant. And it takes a moment to focus.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gedalya, based on the history and the physical exam, I'm concerned about possible weakness and neurological issues. Your symptoms – the drooping eyelids, the weakness in your arms and legs, the blurry vision, the occasional slurred speech, and diminished reflexes – could indicate a few different things. We need to rule out some serious conditions, such as Myasthenia Gravis, or potentially something affecting your nervous system. I want to order some blood tests, including a test for acetylcholine receptor antibodies, to check for Myasthenia Gravis. I also want to schedule an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to rule out any structural issues. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an MRI… That sounds… serious. Is it something I should be really worried about, Doctor? I mean, Myasthenia Gravis… I've heard of it, but… Yes, please. I want to know what’s going on. If those tests are the best way to find out, then yes, absolutely. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this. It’s just… a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Gedalya, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed. It's good we’re addressing this now. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and create an appropriate treatment plan. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and, most importantly, an acetylcholine receptor antibody test. For the MRI, we'll be looking at your brain and spinal cord with and without contrast. You can get the blood tests done at the lab across the street. And I’ll have my nurse schedule the MRI for you as soon as possible. It usually takes a few days to get an appointment. While we wait for the results, it's important to avoid strenuous activity, and please, if you notice any new or worsening symptoms – particularly any difficulty breathing or swallowing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Avoid strenuous activity… difficulty breathing… This sounds… frightening, Doctor. No strenuous activity, got it. And if anything gets worse, go to the emergency room. Okay. I think… I think that’s all. Just… how long will it take to get the results back? And what if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Gedalya. The blood test results typically take 2-3 business days. The MRI results will take a bit longer, usually 3-5 business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. If it is something serious, like Myasthenia Gravis, there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. Treatment options include medications, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and immunosuppressants, and in some cases, surgery. We'll discuss all of your options in detail if necessary, and we'll work together to create a plan that's right for you. I'm here to support you every step of the way, Gedalya. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns between appointments. And remember, we're taking this one step at a time. We'll get to the bottom of this. Do you want me to write down the number for the emergency room, just in case?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. Just in case. And thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. It’s… it’s a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And for not dismissing my concerns. I think that’s all for now. I’ll schedule the blood tests as soon as possible. And I’ll wait to hear from your nurse about the MRI appointment. Thank you again, Doctor Finco. I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. It's my job to listen to your concerns and help you find answers. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any questions at all. We'll get through this together. Take care, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
