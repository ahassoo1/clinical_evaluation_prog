DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen. It's been there for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's...difficult to describe exactly. It’s not painful, not usually. More of a… firmness. It feels like it’s gotten a bit bigger over the last few months, maybe? I haven’t really been keeping close track, to be honest. It's located… sort of in the middle, below my belly button.
DOCTOR: Alright, not usually painful, feels firm, and has been slowly growing over the last few months, located mid-abdomen below the belly button. That gives me a starting point. Has anything made it more noticeable – like, do you notice it more when you strain, or when you're constipated, for example?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I think it might feel a little more prominent when I’m… well, when I haven’t had a regular bowel movement. Nothing drastic, but perhaps a little more noticeable then. I haven't paid that much attention, if I’m being truthful. It doesn’t really bother me day-to-day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems somewhat related to bowel movements. And it’s not causing you significant discomfort currently. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently – anything different with frequency, consistency, or color?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything seems… normal, in that regard. Perhaps a little slower sometimes, but I wouldn’t say a dramatic change. I eat a lot of… well, my wife does most of the cooking, and it's generally healthy, but I don't always have enough water. Could be that. I haven't noticed any blood or anything concerning in that area, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. No blood, that's reassuring. And you mention a tendency toward constipation and not drinking enough water. Have you had any other symptoms alongside this lump?
PATIENT: No, not that I've noticed. No weight loss, no fever, no nausea… just the lump. I haven’t been feeling particularly tired either. I do some choreography work, you see, so I’m generally quite active, and that keeps my energy up. It's just...been there. I suppose I was hoping it was nothing, but my wife insisted I come get it checked.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know - no other symptoms and you're active. Your wife is wise to encourage you to get it checked out. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, things like that, but nothing major. No surgeries, no chronic conditions… I take a vitamin D supplement occasionally, but that's it. My wife handles all the medical appointments, so I don't always know the details. I'm Medicare eligible, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical conditions or surgeries, just occasional vitamin D. And you're covered by Medicare. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything my wife cooks, and she puts garlic in everything, so I'm pretty sure I'm not allergic to garlic. No known reactions to any medications either. I haven't needed to take many prescriptions over the years, thankfully. I do have slightly sensitive skin, but that's not an allergy, just…sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies, just sensitive skin. And your wife cooks with garlic – good to know! Now, thinking about your family, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My father had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my mother… she had some issues with her stomach, but I don’t know the specifics. She passed away several years ago. My wife's family… they've had some cases of diabetes, I think, but that's about all I know. We don't really talk about medical history much, unfortunately. It’s not a priority in our family.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of hypertension, a vague history of stomach issues on your mother’s side, and diabetes in your wife's family. That’s helpful. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned, I do choreography work. It’s not terribly strenuous, but it keeps me moving most days. I’m married, and we live in the suburbs. We eat fairly healthy, mostly. I enjoy reading, and I walk when the weather is nice. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I wouldn’t say I have any particularly unhealthy habits. Mostly just trying to live a comfortable life.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very good to know. Active lifestyle, healthy diet, no smoking, minimal alcohol. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently palpate the area to feel the lump more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Raghunathan. Please lie flat on your back, and relax your abdomen if you can. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants, normal activity. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. I do feel a firm, non-tender mass approximately 3 centimeters in diameter located midline, below the umbilicus. It appears to be fixed, meaning it doesn’t move easily under my fingers. There’s no rebound tenderness, and you aren’t guarding. It's not painful to the touch, which is good, but the fact that it’s fixed is something we need to investigate further. Given the location and firmness, we'll need to get some imaging done to get a better look. I'm thinking a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis would be the best course of action. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, I suppose that makes sense. It's fixed, you say? That doesn't sound good, does it? Is it… serious? And what exactly does a CT scan show? I’m not very familiar with medical procedures, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining things to me, though. It’s a little unsettling to hear it’s fixed, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You're right to be a little unsettled, Mr. Raghunathan. "Fixed" means it doesn't move freely when I press on it, which can sometimes indicate it's attached to deeper tissues. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious, but it does mean we need to find out what it is. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of your abdomen and pelvis. It allows us to see the size, shape, and location of organs and tissues, and can help identify the cause of the mass. We can see things like lymph nodes, blood vessels, and any potential abnormalities. It's a relatively quick and painless procedure – you'll lie on a table while a scanner rotates around you. We may need to administer some contrast dye intravenously to enhance the images, but we'll discuss that further if needed. To be clear, I’m not saying it is anything serious, but we need to rule out potential causes. Possibilities range from a benign growth to something that requires further attention. The CT scan will give us the information we need to determine the best course of action. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye – iodine, shellfish, or any other known allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. No shellfish, no iodine...nothing comes to mind. My wife always checks those things, and she would have mentioned it if there were any concerns. A CT scan sounds… alright, I suppose. If it will give us answers, then I'm willing to do it. What's the next step? Do I need to do anything to prepare for it? And roughly, how long will it take to get the results? I understand you can't give me a diagnosis right now, but some idea of the timeline would be helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the allergies. Alright, we’ll schedule the CT scan for you as soon as possible. I’ll have my assistant, Sarah, set that up for you before you leave. She’ll give you specific instructions regarding preparation – you may need to fast for a few hours beforehand and avoid caffeine. She'll also explain the contrast dye in more detail. The scan itself typically takes about 15-30 minutes. The radiologist will then review the images and send a report to me. I usually receive the results within 24-48 hours, but it can sometimes take a little longer depending on their workload. Once I have the report, I’ll contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a plan. We’ll talk through all your options and answer any questions you have. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – pain, fever, nausea, changes in bowel habits – please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright, Mr. Raghunathan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and your clear explanations. Having Sarah set up the appointment and provide detailed instructions is very helpful. I feel much more at ease knowing what to expect. Please, let me know if you need any further information from me. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. We'll get this sorted out. I'll have Sarah come in and schedule that scan for you now. Don’t hesitate to reach out if any questions arise before your appointment. .
