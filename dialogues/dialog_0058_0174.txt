DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s…difficult to explain. I just feel…down. Very down. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I haven’t the energy for much these days, truthfully.
DOCTOR: “Down,” okay. And how long have you been feeling this way, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly…perhaps six months now? It started gradually, I think. Not a sudden thing. Just…less joy in things. Less enthusiasm for my work, even. And I love my work. It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Six months…that’s a bit longer than just a passing mood, then. And you said less energy…can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, well…it’s not that I’m constantly tired, exactly. It’s more like…everything feels heavy. Getting out of bed is a chore. Even small tasks, like making a cup of tea, feel exhausting. I used to be very active, you know. Ski patrol in the winter, lifeguarding in the summer. Now…I find excuses not to go. I just…don't feel like it. It’s very unlike me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you having any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Not falling asleep, precisely. I sleep…in fits and starts. I wake up several times during the night, usually with my mind racing. Then I lie there, thinking…worrying…until I can drift off again. It's quite frustrating. I don’t feel rested when I wake up, even after a full eight hours.
DOCTOR: Racing thoughts, disrupted sleep… Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Quite a bit. I’ve lost my appetite, I have. Food just doesn’t seem appealing anymore. I used to enjoy cooking, trying new recipes… now, I often skip meals entirely. My daughter keeps bringing me soup, bless her heart, but even that doesn’t always stay down. It’s all rather unpleasant, really.
DOCTOR: Soup not staying down…is that a recent development, or has that been going on for a while as well?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. Not often not staying down. Just…sometimes. When I really don't feel up to eating. It's been happening…maybe a month? The lack of appetite has been longer, certainly. The soup thing is recent. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, I must admit. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Well, I suppose I’ve been…more irritable than usual. Snapping at my daughter, which I hate doing. And…a general lack of concentration. I used to be very sharp, good with numbers and details. Now, I forget things constantly. Small things, mostly. Where I put my keys, appointments… It’s quite worrying, really.
DOCTOR: Irritability, forgetfulness…Alright. Now, Ms. Derasmo, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Years ago, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. It’s been…well managed, I think. I take medication for it, religiously. And…arthritis, in my knees. It flares up sometimes, particularly in the cold weather. That's why I can't ski as much anymore, even when I feel up to it. Otherwise…no, nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, arthritis…And what medications are you currently taking for those conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see... For the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams every morning. And for the arthritis, I take Ibuprofen as needed. Usually, 400 milligrams, two or three times a day, when it flares up. Sometimes I use a topical cream as well, Diclofenac. That’s all, I believe. I try to keep track, but sometimes I forget… ironic, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, rather. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. I used to be quite nervous about taking pills, but…I’ve gotten used to them, I suppose. No food allergies either. I'm quite lucky in that regard, really. My daughter has several, poor thing. It’s a constant worry for her.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Quite a long time ago now. I had my gallbladder removed, back in…oh, goodness, 1988, I believe. And…a hysterectomy, a few years after that. That's all, thankfully. Routine things, really. No major operations. It feels like a lifetime ago, now. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It's good to have a complete picture. And finally, Ms. Derasmo, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, my mother lived to be 85, a very strong woman. She had arthritis, like me, but otherwise, she was quite healthy. My father passed away when I was young, heart attack. And…my sister, she struggled with anxiety for many years, but…that's about it, I think. No history of depression, as far as I know. It's a bit of a blur, truthfully. It was a long time ago. Is this nearly over, Doctor? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Derasmo, based on what you've told me, and given the length of time you've been experiencing these symptoms… it sounds like you may be suffering from depression. It's quite common, especially in people your age, and often has a very treatable cause. However, given your age and medical history, we need to rule out any underlying physical causes first. We'll start with a simple blood test to check your thyroid levels, vitamin D, and a complete blood count. It’s likely nothing, but we must be thorough. I also want to do a brief cognitive assessment to see if there’s any significant memory impairment. That doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s good to have a baseline. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. More tests. Very well. If you insist. I suppose it's best to be safe. Blood tests…fine. And the…cognitive assessment? How long will that take? I really must be going this afternoon. I do hope it won’t take too long. I haven't the patience for endless examinations, truthfully.
DOCTOR: It will be brief, Ms. Derasmo. Approximately ten minutes. We’ll just ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and concentration. I'll have the nurse draw the blood, and then we can get started with the assessment. If you'd like, you can wait in the waiting room after the blood draw, and I will call you when I'm ready. It's hardly a lengthy process, and the results will help us determine the best course of action. We'll proceed methodically, and I assure you, I won't waste your time.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Let’s get this over with, then. The sooner it’s done, the better. Please, just let me know when you're ready. I have a luncheon appointment at 2:30, and I absolutely cannot be late. Honestly, all these tests… it's quite exhausting. .
