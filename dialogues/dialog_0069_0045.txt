DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… well, my face gets very red. Flushes, you know? It happens sometimes, and it’s been… more lately. That’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your face gets red, and it's been happening more frequently recently. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… hard to say why. It just… comes on. Not always. Sometimes after I eat. Sometimes when I… talk to people. Not always, though. It's not like every time. And it goes away after a little bit. Maybe five, ten minutes? It’s just… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I see. So it seems to happen somewhat randomly, sometimes after eating and sometimes during social interactions, but not consistently. And it lasts for about five to ten minutes. That does sound frustrating and understandably embarrassing. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe how your face feels when it flushes?
PATIENT: It gets… warm. Very warm. Like a hot… a hot feeling spreading. Not painful, just… hot. And my skin feels… tight, maybe? Like it's stretching. And red, of course. Very red. People look at me.
DOCTOR: Okay, warm and tight, with noticeable redness. That's helpful. And you're right to mention people looking at you - that can definitely add to the discomfort. Now, have you noticed anything specifically that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really. I mean, spicy food sometimes. But not always. I ate a very spicy curry last week and nothing happened. I was talking to a friend yesterday, and it started then. He was telling a funny story, I think. It’s… unpredictable. I wish I knew what causes it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with it being unpredictable. It makes it difficult to manage when you don't know what sets it off. Let's try to get a broader picture. Besides the flushing, have you experienced any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Sometimes my heart beats a little faster when it happens. Not a lot, just… noticeable. And I get… a little sweaty. Palms, mostly. Not all over, just my hands. And… I think I get a little dizzy sometimes, but maybe that’s just because I’m embarrassed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so along with the flushing, you’ve noticed a faster heartbeat, some sweating in your palms, and occasionally some dizziness. That’s good information. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Hmm… let me see. Years ago, I had… high blood pressure. But the doctor said it was okay after I started taking pills. I stopped taking the pills a long time ago, though. And… nothing else, really. Just the usual colds and flus.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was managed with medication in the past, but you're no longer taking anything for it. Thank you for letting me know. And no other significant medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky. Nothing like that. Just a few stitches when I was a little boy, falling from a tree, but that’s it. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. Just… tea. I drink a lot of tea. Different kinds. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements other than tea. Now, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life. Never had a problem. Sometimes I get a little itchy after I cut the grass, but I think that’s just the grass.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And that itchiness after cutting the grass is likely just a mild reaction to it. Now, I’d like to ask a little bit about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or close relatives – who experience anything similar to what you’re describing, like frequent flushing or rosacea?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had a red face sometimes. But she said it was just from the sun. She loved gardening. And my father… he didn’t have that problem. My sister… I don’t know. We don’t talk very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother sometimes had redness, likely related to sun exposure, but no other family history that seems directly relevant. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Okay. I live alone, since my wife… passed away. I mostly stay home. I used to work as a counselor, helping people with… problems. But I retired a few years ago. I read a lot. And I cook. I like to cook. Not much exercise, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. And it sounds like you have a quiet, thoughtful lifestyle. Before we proceed, is there anything else you think might be relevant?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! I do drink some wine with dinner, sometimes. A glass or two. And I get very stressed sometimes. Thinking about… things. The past. It makes my chest tight. That’s all, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, you sometimes have a glass or two of wine with dinner, and you experience stress that causes chest tightness. That's helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It'll just take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That’s fine. Blood pressure… I haven't had that checked in a long time. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Your pulse is 88 and regular. Listening to your heart and lungs, everything sounds clear, no abnormal sounds. I also note some mild redness on your cheeks and forehead. So, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, several possibilities come to mind. Given the episodic flushing, associated with sweating and palpitations, and your history of high blood pressure, we need to consider things like rosacea, but also rule out other potential causes. A common one, especially given your stress and wine consumption, could be rosacea exacerbations, but we also need to consider other possibilities like carcinoid syndrome, although that's less likely. It’s also important to rule out any cardiac issues. To help narrow things down, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be comfortable with a blood test to check your complete blood count, liver function, and thyroid levels?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, alright. I don't like them, but… if you think it’s necessary. I just… I don't have insurance, Doctor. How much will it cost?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, especially without insurance. Let me see… the tests I’m recommending will likely cost around $200-$300, depending on the lab. We can discuss options if that’s a significant burden. Some labs offer payment plans, or we can prioritize the most essential tests first. We can also explore options at a community health clinic that might offer lower rates. For now, let's focus on the blood tests. If the results are inconclusive, we might need to consider further testing, such as a referral to a cardiologist to rule out any heart issues, or a dermatologist to evaluate the possibility of rosacea. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or what they’re looking for?
PATIENT: $200-$300… that’s… a lot. But… alright. I suppose it’s better to know. And I don't want anything serious. What are they looking for, exactly? You said something about my liver and… thyroid? I don’t even know what that is.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Let me explain. The complete blood count checks for a range of things, like anemia or infection. The liver function tests look at how well your liver is working, as liver issues can sometimes cause flushing. And the thyroid test checks your thyroid hormone levels, as an overactive thyroid can also cause similar symptoms. Essentially, we're trying to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the flushing. It’s a precautionary measure. I’ll write you a lab order now. You can take it to [Lab Name - provides local lab option]. They’ll be able to draw the blood, and the results will be sent to me. It usually takes a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding alcohol and trying to manage your stress levels. Perhaps some deep breathing exercises or meditation?
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breathing… I used to do that with my wife. She was very good at it. So, I take this to the lab, and they’ll tell you the results? And then we talk again?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. You take the lab order to [Lab Name], and they'll draw the blood. The results will be sent directly to my office. Once I have them, I'll review them and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a plan. It usually takes 3-5 business days for the results to come back. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like chest pain, shortness of breath, severe dizziness, or a high fever—please don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
