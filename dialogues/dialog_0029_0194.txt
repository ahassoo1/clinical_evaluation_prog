DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m Dr. Chora. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… it's hard to explain, exactly. Things haven't been right, with my ears. They keep… going funny. And I get so dizzy sometimes. It's just… unsettling. My daughter, Lani, she made me come. Said I should get it checked. She worries, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, “funny” – can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not ha-ha funny, you know? It's like… everything gets muffled, suddenly. Like someone turned the volume down. And then sometimes, it feels like pressure, deep inside. It doesn’t last long, usually, but it’s scary when it happens. Then the spinning… oh, the spinning is the worst. Makes me want to just lie down for a week. I can’t really remember when it started, though. It comes and goes, you see? It’s been… a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing and pressure in your ears, along with dizziness. And it comes and goes... alright. Has anything specific brought it on that you've noticed?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. No, not really. Not that I can recall. It doesn't seem to matter if I've been busy, or resting, or anything. Lani asked if it was stress, maybe, but… I don’t feel particularly stressed. It just… happens. My husband, Ratu… he used to get ear trouble sometimes, but it was different. His was more pain, I think. This is… just weird. And the spinning, like I said, comes out of nowhere. It's hard to explain, Doctor. I’m not good with remembering details.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. We'll try to figure it out together. No pain, just the muffled hearing, pressure, and dizziness. Let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Now that you mention it… yes. Sometimes. A very faint ringing. It's not constant, and it’s not very loud. I hardly notice it most of the time, to be honest. Like a very quiet hum. It comes and goes, just like everything else. Is that important, Doctor? It’s probably nothing, really. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: It could be something, Ms. Mayhugh, and it’s good you mentioned it. Let’s get a better picture. Have you had any nausea or vomiting with these episodes of dizziness?
PATIENT: Nausea… yes, sometimes I feel a bit queasy when the spinning starts. Not always, though. And I haven't actually been sick, no. Just… feeling like I might. It passes with the dizziness, usually. It's all very unpleasant, really. It makes me quite tired afterwards, too. I just want it to stop, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, muffled hearing, pressure, ringing in the ears, dizziness, sometimes with nausea. Let’s move on to your overall health. Do you have any other medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a bit high, but they put me on a little pill for it. I take it every morning. That’s all I can really remember. Nothing else, no. I haven't got diabetes or anything like that. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. Lani always tells me off for having too much coconut cream, but… it’s nice, you know? And I take Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. And the medication for your blood pressure is good to know. Okay. Let's talk about your past… Have you ever had any ear infections, or problems with your balance before this started?
PATIENT: Ear infections… oh, goodness. As a child, maybe? I had so many illnesses when I was little, it’s all a bit blurry. Nothing serious, I don’t think. And balance… well, I’ve always been a bit clumsy, if that counts! But nothing that a good night’s sleep didn’t fix. No, I don’t think I’ve had any problems with my balance, not until these episodes started. It's just… strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. So no history of ear infections or balance issues before this. Now, have any close family members – your parents, siblings, perhaps – experienced similar problems with hearing or balance?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now you mention it… my father, he had terrible trouble with his ears in his old age. He couldn’t hear properly for years, and he fell a few times. The doctor said something about his inner ear, I think. And my sister, Elina, she gets very dizzy sometimes. Not as bad as me, but she complains about it. It runs in the family, maybe? I never thought much about it before, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's useful information, Ms. Mayhugh. A family history of ear problems and balance issues. Okay. Now, do you take any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, no other medications. Just the one pill for my blood pressure, every morning. I try to keep things simple, you know? I don’t like taking too many pills. Now, are we almost finished, Doctor? I do have an appointment with Lani later, and she’ll be worried if I’m too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Mayhugh, we’re getting there. Just a few more questions. Before we finish, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, no. I eat all sorts of things. Lani makes me try new fruits sometimes, even though I prefer my fish and vegetables. No, I haven’t got any allergies. I think that's everything, isn't it? I'm not very good at remembering things, Doctor, so I hope I haven't forgotten anything important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears, check your balance, and take your blood pressure again. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. It’s just… I don’t like anything poking around in my ears. But… if you think it will help, then yes. Go ahead. But please be gentle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Mayhugh, I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’m just going to look in your ears with this light. I’ll also check your balance and listen to your heart and lungs briefly. Okay. Your ear canals look a little bit narrowed, and there's some wax buildup in both ears. The eardrums themselves appear intact, but slightly cloudy. I'm going to check your balance now. Please follow my finger with your eyes. Your balance is slightly off, particularly when looking to the left. Blood pressure is 140/90. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you might have a combination of age-related changes in your ears, some wax buildup, and potentially some involvement of your inner ear. The family history is also relevant. I'm concerned about possible Meniere's Disease, which could be causing some of the dizziness and hearing issues. However, we need further testing to confirm this. I recommend a hearing test, also known as an audiogram, and possibly a balance test called a videonystagmography, or VNG. I'll also order some blood work to rule out other causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that sounds like a lot of tests. Meniere's… what is that? Is it serious? And balance test… will I fall over? I just want to feel normal again, Doctor. Is there anything I can do now? Anything at all? And… will these tests be expensive?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Mayhugh. Meniere’s Disease is an inner ear disorder that can cause episodes of dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus – ringing in your ears – and a feeling of fullness in the ear. It’s not typically life-threatening, but it can be very disruptive. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and guide treatment. The hearing test is painless; you’ll just wear headphones and listen to different tones. The balance test involves some head movements and eye tracking, and we’ll have you safely supported throughout the procedure. We will take every precaution so you don’t fall. For now, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and salty foods. These can sometimes worsen the dizziness. Staying hydrated is also important. And if you experience a particularly bad episode of dizziness, lie down in a quiet, dark room. Regarding costs, Medicare should cover a significant portion of the tests. Our billing department can help you understand any out-of-pocket expenses. I'm going to write you a referral for the hearing test and the balance test. I also want you to follow up with an otolaryngologist – an ear, nose, and throat specialist – for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you like me to recommend someone?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good about Medicare. And… yes, please. A recommendation for an ENT would be wonderful. I wouldn’t know where to start. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It's just… a lot to take in. Avoiding caffeine and salt… I suppose I can try that. Lani will be pleased, she’s always telling me off about my coconut cream. So, tests, ENT appointment, and… no caffeine and salt. Is that everything? And… how long will it take to get an appointment with the specialist? I do hope it’s not too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Mayhugh, that summarizes it well. Tests, ENT appointment, and limiting caffeine and salt. Here is the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, an excellent otolaryngologist. Her office is on Elm Street, and the number is 555-1234. Wait times can vary, but their scheduler should be able to give you an estimate. It's usually a week or two to get an appointment. I'll also send these notes to her office. I also want you to keep a log of your dizziness episodes - when they occur, how long they last, and any triggers you notice. This will be helpful for Dr. Sharma. If your symptoms worsen significantly, or you develop a high fever, severe headache, or difficulty walking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
