DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Hmm… what does bring me in? Yes. Well, it’s this… certification, you see. One has to keep up with these things, though I confess the particulars always seem to… slip my mind. Something about needing to be examined for… continuing practice? Is that right? It’s rather bothersome, all this paperwork and revisiting.
DOCTOR: Right. A certification renewal exam. Yes, they do those. It’s… responsible of you to keep it up, I suppose. Though, frankly, most people my age wouldn’t bother. But let’s not dwell on that. So, this exam requires a general physical, correct?
PATIENT: A general physical? Oh dear. Is that truly necessary? I thought it was simply a matter of… verifying my sight and hearing. I’m not feeling unwell, you understand. Perfectly functional, all things considered. I keep myself quite active, despite… well, never mind. Is there absolutely no way to circumvent this… thoroughness? It seems a bit much for a simple re-certification, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, the certifying body has specific requirements. I’m not at liberty to… “circumvent” them. And truthfully, even if I were, it’s a rather foolish idea to simply skip important health checks. It’s not about whether you feel unwell; it’s about establishing a baseline and making sure there aren’t any underlying issues. Now, let’s just proceed with the exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Well, when you put it that way… It’s just… a bit undignified, really. Being poked and prodded. And I assure you, Doctor, I am quite aware of my own health. I’ve been a practitioner myself for… a very long time. Still, I suppose one must endure. Very well. Where shall we begin? Though I must warn you, I am not particularly fond of… bright lights.
DOCTOR: Right. Very well. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature. Then a quick listen to your heart and lungs. We'll do a basic neurological exam, check your reflexes and coordination. And yes, we will need to look in your ears, eyes and throat, which unfortunately involves… bright lights. It's standard procedure, Mr. Oriley. I'll try to be quick about it. Now, if you could just sit back and relax... or as relaxed as you're able.
PATIENT: "Relax," you say. It's easy for you to say. I haven't the slightest idea what a "neurological exam" entails. Is it painful? Will it take long? And please, do try to be gentle with the ears. I've always had… sensitive hearing. Honestly, the indignity of it all. I used to administer these exams, you know. It's a rather… humbling experience, being on this side of things.
DOCTOR: It won't be painful, Mr. Oriley. A neurological exam simply assesses your nerve function – your balance, coordination, reflexes, simple memory and speech. It's very straightforward. As for your ears, I will be as careful as possible. It's a quick look to ensure there are no blockages or infections. Honestly, I find your… reminiscing rather unnecessary. We're here to fulfill a requirement, not to discuss your past career. Now, if you'll just follow my instructions… we can get this over with. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: “Follow your instructions,” indeed. A rather… curt manner, Doctor. One would think a little politeness wouldn't go amiss. Very well. There. But do be careful. I have rather sensitive veins, you see. And please, don't squeeze too tightly. I dislike anything… constricting. Honestly, I've never understood why this is necessary. Measuring the… pressure. Seems rather barbaric, really. Is it accurate, even?
DOCTOR: It is perfectly accurate, Mr. Oriley. It's a standard diagnostic tool. And no, I won’t “squeeze too tightly.” I'm a doctor, not a… torturer. Now, remain still and try to relax your arm. I need a stable reading. Honestly, the amount of questioning is delaying the process unnecessarily.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, that’s… snug. Rather snug, wouldn't you say? It’s making my arm feel quite… numb. And is it necessary to make it so… tight? I feel a bit… lightheaded, actually. Honestly, I’ve always been rather averse to constriction of any kind. It’s… unsettling. Are you certain this is the proper procedure? Perhaps a less… aggressive approach would be preferable?
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, it is necessary. A proper reading requires a certain amount of pressure. And you are not experiencing any adverse effects. A slight discomfort is normal. Now, if you would just cooperate, we can finish this quickly. Your blood pressure is 148/92. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. We will monitor it. Now, let's move on to your pulse. Please extend your other arm. And try to remain calm. Honestly, the amount of anxiety you are exhibiting is only making things worse.
PATIENT: "Anxiety," you say? It’s perfectly natural to be anxious when subjected to… these indignities. And "slightly elevated," you say? Perhaps it's the… unsettling atmosphere. Or the incessant poking and prodding. Honestly, I’ve never understood why doctors insist on being so… clinical. A little empathy wouldn't go amiss. Very well. There. But do try to be gentle with the… wrist. It's rather delicate.
DOCTOR: Your pulse is 78 and regular. Nothing concerning there. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath and exhale slowly. Now, breathe normally. Honestly, this is becoming quite tedious. Do you have any history of heart problems or lung disease?
PATIENT: “Tedious,” you say? I assure you, Doctor, my medical history is quite extensive. I was a practitioner for many years, you see. Heart problems? No, none that I’m aware of. Though my father… he had a bit of a cough, as I recall. Nothing serious, though. A simple chest cold, mostly. And my lungs… perfectly functional, all things considered. Though I do get a bit… breathless sometimes, when climbing stairs. Honestly, it's probably just age. Do you require a detailed family history? It’s… rather lengthy.
DOCTOR: A brief summary will suffice, Mr. Oriley. Any instances of heart disease, stroke, cancer, or diabetes in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. My mother… she had a touch of arthritis, as I recall. Nothing serious. My brother… he had a bit of a… digestive issue, years ago. Nothing life-threatening. And my aunt… she had a touch of… something, many years ago. Cancer, perhaps? I honestly can't recall the specifics. It was a very long time ago, you see. Honestly, my family history is rather… unremarkable. Mostly aches and pains, as far as I can remember. Is this truly necessary? It’s… dredging up unpleasant memories.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s move on to a basic neurological exam. I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. This may be slightly uncomfortable. Honestly, if you could just try to cooperate… it would be greatly appreciated.
PATIENT: “Slightly uncomfortable?” That’s… reassuring. Honestly, I’ve always been rather sensitive. And “relax,” you say? It’s difficult to relax when one is anticipating… blunt force trauma. Are you certain this is the proper procedure? Perhaps a less… invasive approach would be preferable? Very well. There. But do be gentle. And please, warn me before you… strike.
DOCTOR: Hmm. That’s a slightly diminished response. Now, I’m going to check the other side. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t move your head. Honestly, this is a standard procedure to assess nerve function.
PATIENT: There. I'm following it. Though my eyesight isn't what it used to be, you see. And my coordination… well, it's not as sharp as it once was. Honestly, I’m surprised you haven’t noticed by now. Is this truly necessary? It’s… rather exhausting. And is it possible to… stop? My eyes are starting to… water.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. It appears we have enough information for now. Your neurological function is… slightly diminished, but not significantly concerning at this stage. Now, let’s move on to your ears and eyes. This will involve shining a light into your eyes, as you feared. And a brief look into your ears. Honestly, it's standard procedure. Please lean back.
PATIENT: “Assault” seems rather… dramatic, but accurate. Honestly, I’ve always been rather sensitive to bright lights. And foreign objects near my ears. Are you certain this is absolutely necessary? Perhaps a… verbal assessment would suffice? I can assure you, my hearing is perfectly adequate. Though my ears do tend to… ring sometimes. Very well. There. But do be gentle. And please, warn me before you… insert anything. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Your ears appear clear, although there is some wax buildup. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Vision is slightly blurred, as you mentioned. Honestly, this is all consistent with age. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: "Consistent with age," you say? How… reassuring. Honestly, I’ve always been rather proud of my eyesight, despite the… minor imperfections. And allergies? Hmm… let me see. I believe I had a slight reaction to… penicillin, many years ago. A simple rash, as I recall. Nothing serious. And I'm rather sensitive to… dust, as well. It makes me sneeze. Honestly, I can’t recall any other allergies. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. Is this truly necessary? Dredging up the past, again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmm… let me see. I believe I take a small dose of… something for my blood pressure. A simple pill, as I recall. And occasionally, I take an… antacid, for indigestion. Honestly, I can’t recall the names. My wife used to manage all that. And sometimes, I take a… pain reliever, for my arthritis. Honestly, it's all rather… hazy. Is this truly necessary? It’s… dredging up unpleasant memories, again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Based on my assessment, you are experiencing some age-related decline in vision and neurological function. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated. And you have some wax buildup in your ears. Overall, you are in relatively stable condition, but it’s important to monitor these issues. I recommend annual check-ups. Now, I’m going to prescribe some ear wax removal drops. I also recommend a follow-up appointment with an ophthalmologist to assess your vision. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: "Age-related decline," you say? How… disheartening. Honestly, I’ve always prided myself on my… vitality. Annual check-ups? An ophthalmologist? It all seems rather… excessive. Ear wax removal drops? Very well. If you insist. But I assure you, my hearing is perfectly adequate. Very well. But I'm not promising anything. Honestly, I'd rather not be subjected to any further… indignities. Is that acceptable?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the prescription. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the ophthalmologist at your convenience. And try to get a better handle on your medications. It's important for your health. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: "Assist you with?" Honestly, I think I’ve endured enough… assistance for one day. No, thank you. I believe that will be all. I'd like to be on my way, if you don’t mind. Honestly, I'm feeling rather… depleted. I suppose... good day to you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Oriley. And please, remember to schedule that appointment. .
PATIENT: .
