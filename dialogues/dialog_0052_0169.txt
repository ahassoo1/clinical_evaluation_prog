DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. My name is Dr. Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Shely, you say? Right. Well, it’s… my face. And legs. They’re swelling up. Been happening a bit lately, though I can’t rightly say when it started, exactly. Just… gradually, I suppose. It’s bothersome, mostly. Makes my boots uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Miner. It sounds concerning. So, you’re experiencing swelling in your face and legs that has been developing gradually. Can you tell me more about the swelling?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. It’s just puffy, you know? Not like a… a bruise or anything. More like I’ve been sleeping face down in a bucket of water. And the legs… both of ‘em, mostly around the ankles. Feels tight, like the elastic in my socks is too small. I don’t know what could be causing it. I haven’t… done anything different, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: I understand. Puffy swelling in the face and tightness in your ankles, developing gradually without any obvious cause that you can recall. That’s helpful. To get a better understanding, could you describe when you notice the swelling is worst?
PATIENT: Worst… well, evenings, usually. After I've been on my feet all day at the shop. Welding, you know? It's… hot work. Standing. Though I've been doing that for decades, so I wouldn't think that's new. It seems to go down a little when I… lie down, I guess. Not completely, but enough to notice. Though I wouldn't say it disappears. It’s just… less. I don’t pay much mind to it, usually. It's just… getting a bit worse lately, that's all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Miner. So, the swelling is worse in the evenings after a day of standing and welding, and it improves somewhat when you lie down, but doesn't fully resolve. That gives me some further information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I've been a bit… tired, maybe? But I'm nearly sixty, Doctor. Tiredness comes with the territory. And my appetite ain't what it used to be. Though that could be the weather, too. Hot days make me lose my hunger. Can’t say I’ve noticed anything specific, like a rash or… shortness of breath, or anything dramatic like that. Just the swelling and a general feeling of… being old, I suppose. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Miner. It's good you're sharing all of this with me. Feeling tired and having a decreased appetite can be related to several things, and it's helpful to know. It’s good to hear you haven’t experienced any rash or shortness of breath. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… well, not much, if I'm honest. I've always been a fairly sturdy sort. Doc always said I had a good constitution, back when my regular doc was still… around. High blood pressure… maybe? I think he mentioned something about it once, years ago. Said to watch my salt intake. But I don’t really pay much attention to that sort of thing. Never been diagnosed with diabetes, and my heart feels… fine. I mean, I get a little winded climbing stairs, but that’s just age, isn’t it? I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long while. Lost my wife, you see, and… things just sort of slipped.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Miner. It sounds like you've been through a difficult time. It's common for health concerns to take a backseat during periods of grief and adjustment. And it’s alright that things have slipped. You mentioned a possible history of high blood pressure, and that’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Nothing major, if I recall correctly. Had my tonsils out when I was a boy, that’s about it. And… I broke my arm once, falling off a roof when I was younger. But that was a long time ago, and they just set it in a cast. No hospitals, not really. Just the local doc for a few stitches here and there over the years. Nothing serious enough to warrant a stay.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Miner. No major surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s helpful to know. Now, could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my mother lived to be a good age, I suppose. Early eighties. She had… arthritis, I think. Bad hands, couldn't knit anymore. And my father… he had a weak heart, if I recall correctly. Died fairly young, in his sixties. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t really remember the details. None of my siblings have any… remarkable illnesses, as far as I know. We don’t really keep in touch much anymore. It’s all a bit… hazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Miner. A history of arthritis in your mother and heart problems in your father. That’s helpful information. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. And I’ve never been bothered by pollen or dust or anything like that. I work around metal all day, so I’m used to all sorts of things in the air. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no. Though, now that I think about it, sometimes my skin gets a bit itchy after I’ve been welding all day, but I always figured that was just the fumes. It’s never bothered me enough to go to the doctor about it, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Miner. No known allergies, though you’ve mentioned some occasional skin irritation after welding. That is good to know. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Not a one. Never been much of a pill-taker, myself. I don’t trust ‘em. I’ve always preferred to let things heal on their own, if possible. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing. Just… good old-fashioned hard work and a bit of luck, I suppose. That’s it, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Unless you have any other questions for me?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Miner. That is very thorough. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination to further assess your condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical examination… alright, I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. I’m not one for poking and prodding, but I’ll cooperate. Just… be gentle, alright? My bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Miner. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your legs and ankles. Finally, I’ll examine your face. Your blood pressure is 150/90, your heart rate is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6°F. Your heart sounds are regular with a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear. There is noticeable swelling in both ankles, with 2+ pitting edema bilaterally. There is mild facial puffiness, particularly around the eyes and cheeks. No rash or lesions are noted. Based on my examination, I’m noting elevated blood pressure, a heart murmur, and swelling in your ankles and face. This, combined with your symptoms, suggests several possibilities. To help narrow down the cause, I would like to order some blood tests and a urine test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a urine test… alright, if you think it's necessary. Though, I don't like needles, Doctor. And I’m not keen on providing samples, if you catch my drift. But, if it will help figure out what’s going on, I’ll do it. Just… try to be quick, alright? And tell me what you're looking for. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Miner. I will ensure the process is as quick and comfortable as possible. The blood tests will help us assess your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and check for any signs of inflammation or infection. The urine test will help us further evaluate your kidney function and look for protein levels, which can indicate kidney problems. Given your elevated blood pressure and the swelling in your ankles and face, it’s important to rule out potential heart, kidney, and liver issues. The tests will help us determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan. I'll have the lab technician draw a small sample of blood – around two vials should be sufficient – and collect a urine sample from you. They will provide you with instructions on how to collect the sample correctly. Once the results are available, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Well, will these tests… hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I’ve got things to do, you see. Can't be spending all day at the clinic. And… how much will all this cost? I’m on a fixed income, and I don’t have much to spare. I haven’t got insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Miner. The blood draw itself will cause only a brief, momentary discomfort – a small pinch, like a mosquito bite. The lab technician is very skilled and will minimize any discomfort. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. I will contact you as soon as they are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Regarding the cost, I understand your concern about not having insurance. I will speak with our billing department to see if we can offer any financial assistance options or a discounted rate for uninsured patients. I will do my best to work with you to ensure you receive the necessary care without incurring excessive financial burden. We can also discuss prioritizing the most essential tests to keep costs down, if needed. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your salt intake, staying well-hydrated, and avoiding prolonged standing or strenuous activity if possible. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or sudden weight gain, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Reducing salt… I suppose I can try. And avoiding standing… well, that’s difficult, seeing as that’s how I earn a living. But I’ll keep it in mind. I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… get it over with quickly, alright? And don’t charge me an arm and a leg. I suppose I’ll go and find the lab technician then. Where are they?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Miner. I understand your concerns, and I assure you I will do everything I can to make this process as smooth and comfortable as possible. The lab technician, Sarah, is just down the hallway, in room number three. She's expecting you. Just let her know you're here for the blood tests and urine sample, and she'll guide you through the process. Please don't hesitate to let me or any of our staff know if you have any questions or concerns at any time. We are here to help. I will review your test results as soon as they become available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Now, if you’re ready, please go ahead and find Sarah in room three. I will see you again soon.
PATIENT: Alright then. Room three, you say? Thanks, Doctor.
