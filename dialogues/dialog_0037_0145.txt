DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Lonell Bahta. I am here today... well, my daughter, she arranged this visit. It is regarding… eligibility, she said? For assistance at home. Something about health care… for when one needs it. I believe she called it hospice, but I am not entirely certain what that entails. She felt it best to have a doctor confirm everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bahta, thank you for clarifying. It sounds like your daughter is proactively looking into potential support services for you, which is very thoughtful. Hospice is a service that provides comprehensive comfort care, often for individuals with a serious illness, but it's not the only option available. We can certainly explore all possibilities today. To get a better understanding of what support might be most helpful, could you tell me a little bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Yes, my daughter… she worries. A good girl, always has been. As for my health… well, I had a surgery, quite some time ago now. On my… abdomen. It was… complicated. There were infections, a long recovery. It is… better now, but not as it was before. I tire easily, and there is… discomfort. Not pain, exactly, but… a persistent ache. I also have trouble… keeping weight on. I eat, but… it seems to go right through me. Is that… sufficient information? I do not wish to bore you with details.
DOCTOR: No, that's very helpful, Mr. Bahta, thank you. It’s good you’re sharing this with me. It sounds like that abdominal surgery had a significant impact, and the lingering fatigue, discomfort, and weight loss are definitely things we need to investigate further. Just to clarify a few details – when was this surgery, approximately?
PATIENT: Approximately… let me see. It was… 2018, I believe. Yes, 2018. It was in the… early spring. March, perhaps? It was a difficult time. Many complications, as I mentioned. I remember the dates quite clearly, actually. My daughter, she kept a very detailed journal. She is very organized.
DOCTOR: That’s good you remember, and even better that your daughter kept a record. Seven years ago is a significant amount of time, and knowing the specifics can be very helpful. Now, besides the fatigue, discomfort, and weight loss, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Recently… hmm. That is a good question. My… appetite has diminished somewhat. Not a complete loss, but… I do not enjoy food as I once did. And my… sleep. It is… fragmented. I wake frequently during the night. Not every night, but… often enough to be bothersome. Also… my hands. They tremble, occasionally. Not constantly, but… when I try to perform… delicate tasks. Like writing. Or buttoning a shirt. It is… inconvenient, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, diminished appetite, fragmented sleep, and the occasional hand tremors. Thank you for being so thorough, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like there are a number of things going on. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Aside from the abdominal surgery in 2018, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else, to my knowledge. The surgery… that was the only significant medical event. I had… the usual childhood illnesses, of course. Measles, mumps… chickenpox. But nothing… chronic. I was always… quite healthy, actually. Until the surgery. My doctor, at the time, he said I was… a robust specimen. Before the complications, that is.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Bahta. And what about any family history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. My… father, he had… problems with his heart. Later in life, of course. He passed away when I was… quite young, actually. Perhaps 70 years of age. My mother… she lived a long life, thankfully. Reached her early 90s. She had… arthritis, mostly. In her hands and knees. Nothing… serious, as I recall. My sister… she is still living. Healthy, as far as I know. She lives in… Marseille. We do not speak often.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart issues with your father, arthritis with your mother, and your sister is healthy. Thank you. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… nothing regularly, Doctor. No. Not anymore. After the surgery… I was on pain medication, for a time. But that was years ago. I occasionally take… a digestive aid, if I am feeling… unwell. Something for the stomach. But only when necessary. And… a multivitamin, from time to time. Just to… supplement my diet, given my… appetite. Nothing prescribed, if that is what you are asking.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Bahta. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. Never have. I have… a somewhat sensitive stomach, as I mentioned, but no true allergies. I can eat most anything, thankfully. My daughter… she is very careful about what she eats. Many sensitivities, she claims. But me… no. I am quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bahta, thank you for providing me with all of that information. It's very helpful. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a basic neurological assessment to evaluate the tremors you mentioned. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I have… nothing to hide. And if it will help… determine what is causing my… discomfort, then I am happy to cooperate in any way possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Your lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, let’s examine your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No masses are palpable. And finally, I'd like to check your reflexes and assess the tremors in your hands. Could you please extend your arms in front of you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. I do notice the trembling… it is more pronounced when I am… concentrating. Like this, for example. It is… subtle, but present. Please, do not hesitate to… point anything out. I wish to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal. The tremors are indeed present, and appear to be a resting tremor, meaning they are more noticeable when your hands are relaxed. They do diminish with movement, as you pointed out. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam findings, it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. The fatigue, abdominal tenderness, weight loss, and tremors could be related to a number of things. Given your history of abdominal surgery and complications, we should start by ruling out any chronic inflammation or malabsorption issues. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and inflammatory markers like CRP and ESR. I’d also like to order a stool sample analysis to check for any underlying infections or malabsorption. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. Whatever tests you deem necessary… I agree to them entirely. I trust your professional judgment. Blood work and a… stool sample? Yes, I can manage that. Is there anything I need to… prepare beforehand? Any specific instructions? I wish to be as compliant as possible.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Bahta. For the blood work, you’ll need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks other than water. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning at the lab across the street. As for the stool sample, the lab will provide you with collection containers and detailed instructions. It’s important to follow those instructions carefully to ensure accurate results. In the meantime, I want to address your daughter's concern about potential hospice care. While it’s good she’s thinking proactively, hospice is typically reserved for individuals with a life-limiting illness with a prognosis of six months or less. Based on what we’ve discussed, it doesn’t sound like you are at that stage. However, there are other supportive care options available that might be helpful, such as a referral to a gastroenterologist to further investigate your abdominal issues, and potentially a consultation with a nutritionist to address your weight loss and diminished appetite. Would you be interested in exploring those options?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you for clarifying the… hospice matter. My daughter… she sometimes worries excessively. A referral to a… gastroenterologist and a nutritionist sounds… quite sensible. Anything that might alleviate my… discomfort and restore my appetite would be greatly appreciated. I am happy to pursue those options. Please, proceed at your convenience.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Bahta. I’ll go ahead and write those referrals for you now. I’m also going to order the blood work and stool sample analysis. The lab results should be back in about a week. Once we have those, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have covered everything… quite thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and attention to detail. You have… alleviated much of my anxiety. I am grateful for your assistance. I suppose… there is nothing further at this moment. I shall await the lab results and your… follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Bahta. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. I'll have the lab requisitions and referral paperwork ready for you before you leave. The receptionist will also schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or significant weight loss – please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any restrictions in your daily activities that I should know about?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not particularly. I… limit strenuous activities, of course. But I am able to… manage my daily routine without significant difficulty. I walk… a short distance each day, for exercise. And I enjoy… reading. But otherwise, no significant restrictions. I am… reasonably independent.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like you’re maintaining a good level of activity. Okay, here are your lab requisitions and the referrals to the gastroenterologist and nutritionist. The receptionist will assist you with scheduling your appointments. She’s also been informed to schedule your follow-up appointment once the lab results are available. I want to thank you again for coming in today. I’m confident we can get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been… exceptionally thorough and informative. I appreciate your kindness and professionalism. I shall follow your instructions diligently and await the results. Thank you again for your assistance.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: And you as well, Doctor. Goodbye. .
