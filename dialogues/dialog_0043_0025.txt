DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, I want to know more about where my family come from. Long time ago, you know? I hear you can do a test with spit… to find out? I want to know if I got more Marshallese blood, or… other places. My mother, she never talk much about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Scobie. You're interested in learning more about your ancestry, potentially through genetic testing. That’s certainly something we can discuss. The test you’re referring to is a DNA ancestry test, and yes, it does involve a saliva sample. Before we proceed with ordering any tests, let’s talk a little more about what you're hoping to learn. Knowing your family history, even the parts your mother didn't discuss, can be quite helpful in interpreting the results. Could you tell me anything at all about your mother’s side of the family?
PATIENT: Hmm… not much, really. She come from the islands, long time ago. Marshall Islands. That’s all I really know. She work hard, always. Didn’t talk about before. My father… he was American, I think. Soldier. He leave when I was small boy. Never see him again. So… mostly just the islands. And me, growing up here. That’s it. Is the test… hard? Does it hurt?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Scobie, the test is not hard at all, and it certainly doesn’t hurt. It’s a very simple process – you simply provide a saliva sample, usually by spitting into a tube. The kit will have very clear instructions, and the nurses here can walk you through it if you prefer. It sounds like you have some Marshallese heritage, through your mother, and potentially some American heritage through your father. The ancestry test can help you understand the proportions of different ethnicities in your genetic makeup. To give you a more complete picture, and to help us interpret the results, would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your health history?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I don’t like needles. Health history? Hmm… what kind of questions? I try to stay healthy. Eat fish, walk around. Old age is catching up, though. My knees… not so good. And I forget things sometimes. But nothing too serious, I think. Just old man stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re staying active, Mr. Scobie. It’s very important. And it’s perfectly normal to experience some changes with age, like knee pain and occasional forgetfulness. We’ll definitely address those as well. Let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been told I have any of those. Doctors haven't seen much of me, to be honest. Just checkups when I was young boy, maybe. And when I broke my arm, long time ago. Mostly, I been okay. Take a little medicine for my knees now, sometimes. The pain gets bad when it rains. But that’s all, I think. Mostly just old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, no major medical diagnoses, and just occasional medication for your knees. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your knees, or who prescribed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s a white pill. Small, round. I get it from the pharmacy down the street. Old lady there, she knows me. I don’t remember the name, sorry. Doctor told me to take it… years ago. Maybe Dr. Lee? He retired now, I think. He was good doctor. I just keep taking it when my knees hurt. It helps, so that’s good.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Scobie. We can certainly look it up. It’s common to forget names, especially after some time. Knowing you get it from the pharmacy down the street is helpful. Now, let’s talk about any surgeries you may have had. You mentioned breaking your arm – did that require surgery?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I broke it when I was a little boy. Playing around, fell out of a tree. They fixed it at the hospital. Put it in a cast for a long time. I think they had to put in some… metal? It hurt a lot, but it healed okay. I can still move it, so that’s good. No other surgeries, though. Just the arm, when I was small.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the arm fracture when you were a child, which was treated with a cast and potentially some internal fixation. Now, thinking about your family, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one. My mother, she just got… old. I think. She didn’t talk much about being sick. She just… stopped moving around. And my father… I never knew him well enough to know about his family. I don’t think there was much sickness, but I don’t really know. Nobody talked about it. Mostly, just… old age. Like me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete, especially when relatives weren't open about health concerns or if you didn’t have much contact with them. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I eat lots of different things. Fish, mostly. And rice. Never had any problems with food. And I haven’t taken much medicine, so I don’t know about allergies to that. Sometimes my skin gets itchy when I go in the sun, but that’s just the sun, I think. Nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the medication for your knees?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the white pill for my knees. I don't really take vitamins or anything like that. I try to eat good food, that's enough. Old-fashioned, I guess. Don't need much medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. So, to summarize, you're 85 years old, of Marshallese descent, with no known allergies, no major medical diagnoses, and you're currently only taking a white pill for knee pain. You had an arm fracture as a child and have limited information about your family medical history. Now, considering your interest in learning more about your ancestry, we can proceed with ordering a DNA ancestry test. It involves a simple saliva sample, which you can provide at your convenience. Are you interested in proceeding with that today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I think so. I want to know where my family come from. Maybe it will help me understand things better. What happens after you get the spit? How long does it take? And… how much does it cost?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. That’s a very understandable desire. After we collect the saliva sample – it’s a very simple process, just spitting into a tube, like I mentioned – the kit gets sent to a specialized laboratory. They analyze your DNA, and it typically takes about 6-8 weeks to receive the results. The cost of the test is approximately $199. Medicare may cover a portion of the cost, but I'll have to verify that with your insurance plan. I can also check for any available discounts. The results will be sent to you electronically, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. The report will show the estimated percentages of your ethnic background, along with information about potential ancestral origins. Would you like me to go ahead and order the kit for you?
PATIENT: $199… okay. That’s not too bad. Yes, please order the kit. And check with Medicare, if you can. I don’t want any surprises. Six to eight weeks… that’s a long time. But if it tells me where my family come from, it’s worth the wait. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve just ordered the DNA ancestry kit for you, Mr. Scobie. I'm also submitting a request to Medicare to verify your coverage. We’ll receive a notification once they’ve processed the request. In the meantime, I’ll have the nurses provide you with instructions on how to collect the saliva sample. They’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for approximately eight weeks from today, once we anticipate the results to be available. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. You been very helpful. Thank you. I’ll just wait for the spit kit, and then wait some more. Hopefully, I learn something about my family. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope the test provides you with valuable insights into your ancestry. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. The nurses will be with you shortly to provide you with the kit and instructions. Have a good day, Mr. Scobie.
