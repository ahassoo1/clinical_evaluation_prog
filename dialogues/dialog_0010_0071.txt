DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it's about gettin’ some shots. My granddaughter… she’s applyin’ for a visa to come visit from overseas, and I believe she needs certain vaccinations before she can be approved. I’m helpin’ her with the paperwork, and I want to make sure we do everything right. I’m not entirely sure which ones she needs, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very thoughtful of you to help her with that. Visa requirements can be tricky. To be sure we get the correct vaccinations, could you tell me where she's applying from – what country is she coming from?
PATIENT: She’s comin’ from…let me see… Ukraine. Yes, Ukraine. It’s a bit of a complicated situation there, and she’s lookin’ to come stay with me for a while, if everything goes through.
DOCTOR: Right, Ukraine. I understand. Okay, let me quickly check the current CDC recommendations for visa applicants coming from Ukraine… Alright, it looks like, based on her age and potential length of stay, she’ll likely need an updated measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, a tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis booster, and verification of a varicella vaccine or proof of immunity. It’s also good to be current on influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations, though those aren’t usually required for the visa itself. Does she have a record of her vaccinations available?
PATIENT: Oh, my… that’s a lot of names! She might have some records… she’s got a folder of things from back home, but I’m not sure if those old papers are still good, or even if they’re in English. She left Ukraine a few years ago, and things were…difficult, you understand. I haven’t seen those papers myself yet. Would it be alright if we just… started fresh, and got her whatever she needs here? I'm happy to cover the cost, of course.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Skarbek. Starting fresh is perfectly reasonable, especially given the circumstances. It will be the most reliable way to ensure she’s protected and meets the requirements. We can do a quick check of her antibody levels for some of those diseases, if you’d like, to see if she already has immunity, but it’s not essential. For now, let's plan on administering the MMR, Tdap, and varicella vaccines. Do you know of any allergies she has to medications or vaccines?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. She’s always been a healthy girl. Never had much trouble with sickness, really. She did have a bit of a rash once when she was little, but her mother said it was just from some berries she ate. Nothing serious. I don’t recall her ever havin’ any trouble with a shot before, either. She might have been a bit fussy, like most children, but no actual reaction, as far as I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies or past reactions is helpful. And just to confirm, she's currently a healthy adult with no ongoing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, she is. Strong as a horse, that girl. She's been workin’ hard since she left Ukraine, tryin’ to build a new life for herself. No health problems at all, to my knowledge. She gets tired, of course, but who doesn’t? Just a normal, healthy young woman. She’s a bit worried about the shots, though. She doesn’t like needles much, and she’s nervous about everything with the visa, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Skarbek. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about needles and the visa process. We’ll do our best to make this as comfortable and quick as possible for her. Before we proceed, could you tell me her date of birth, just to confirm her age for the vaccinations?
PATIENT: Certainly. Her birthday is… let me think… March 12th, 1998. Yes, March 12th, 1998. She’ll be 25 next year. Time flies, doesn't it? It feels like just yesterday she was a little girl.
DOCTOR: Yes, it certainly does. Alright, everything matches up. Now, before we administer the vaccines, I just want to quickly review her vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. And then I’ll listen to her heart and lungs, just as a standard precaution. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. She's in your hands. I just want to make sure she gets everything she needs to stay healthy and get that visa. She’s a good girl, and she deserves a chance at a better life.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, blood pressure is 128 over 76, pulse is 72 and regular, and her temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m just going to listen to her heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and another one… Okay, everything sounds clear and normal on both sides. Heart sounds strong and regular as well. Everything checks out nicely. Now, do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the vaccinations?
PATIENT: No, sir, I don't believe so. You've explained everything very clearly, and you’ve been very kind. I appreciate you takin’ the time to make sure she’s alright. I suppose… what can I expect after the shots? Will she be sick? Will she have a fever? I just want to be prepared to take care of her.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, and it's smart to be prepared. The most common side effects are mild. She may experience some soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, which usually resolves within a few days. She might also feel a little tired or have a mild fever, especially after the MMR vaccine. We recommend giving her over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen if she's uncomfortable, and encouraging plenty of fluids. Serious reactions are very rare, but we’ll be here if anything concerning happens. We'll also give you a handout with more detailed information on potential side effects and what to do if they occur. We’ll monitor her for about 15 minutes after the injections to make sure she doesn't have an immediate reaction. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds…reassuring. A little soreness and tiredness I can handle. Thank goodness for over-the-counter medicine. I just want her to be comfortable. Alright, let's get it done then. I trust your judgment, Doctor. She’s ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’m going to administer the MMR and Tdap vaccines in her left arm, and the varicella vaccine in her right. It will sting for a moment, but it will be quick. Try to relax her arm. Here we go… first the MMR… and now the Tdap… and finally the varicella. Okay, all done. Now, we'll have her sit here for about 15 minutes so we can monitor her. I’ll check her vital signs again in a few minutes. Do you have any immediate questions or concerns?
