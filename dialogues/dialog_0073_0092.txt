DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh. Korrell, you say? Well, I… I got this breathin’ problem. Gets worse, you know? Feels like… like sandpaper. And my mouth… always dry. Eyes too. Like the desert. Not good. Not good at all. I don't rightly remember when it started, though. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: "Old age," right. Well, we’ll try to pinpoint it a little better than that, if we can. Sandpaper feeling… that’s… descriptive. And the dryness – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, mostly. All day. I gotta sip water all the time. Used to not need to do that. And...and it's not just my mouth. My throat feels it too. Scratchy. Like I been yellin’ all day, but I haven't. Honestly, everything feels…old. Is that a sickness? Everything just gettin’ old?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Constant dryness… and the throat scratchiness. Alright. And this has been developing over… how long now?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Time… that's a hard one. Maybe… a few months? Six months, maybe? Could be longer. I don’t keep track of that stuff. Too busy… well, I used to be busy. Traffic lights, you know? Fixin' 'em. It's all blurry, really. I just know I ain't breathin' right.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Six months, give or take. Let's see if we can get a clearer picture. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the breathing and dryness?
PATIENT: Symptoms… besides feelin' like I’m dyin’ of thirst? Let me think… sometimes, I get a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. And… my ankles swell up a bit at the end of the day. Always figured that was just the heat. We get a lot of heat here, you know. But... now that you mention it... maybe it’s more than just the heat. I dunno. Everything feels connected these days, but I can't put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: Dizziness upon standing… and ankle swelling. Okay. And have you had any chest pain, cough, or fever recently?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. Not really. Sometimes a little… tightness, maybe. But I get that from worryin’, too. Cough? Not much. A little tickle in my throat now and then, but not a proper cough. Fever… no, I don’t think so. I feel warm sometimes, but that’s just Florida. It's always hot. You got good air conditionin’ here, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just… don't poke too hard. Old bones, you know. Traffic lights ain't gentle on a fella.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Let's listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Okay, good. A little bit of wheezing… and your heart rate is a bit elevated. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation. Blood pressure is 148/92… and your oxygen saturation is 94%. Not ideal, but not critically low. Now, let’s take a look at your throat… open wide and say “ah.” Slightly dry, as you mentioned. Now, let's check your ankles. Some mild swelling… and a little tenderness.
PATIENT: Wheezin’? Elevated heart rate? See? I told you somethin’ was wrong. This ain't just old age, doc. What does all that mean? I don’t understand all that fancy talk. Is it somethin’ serious? Don’t tell me I need a hospital. I hate hospitals.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds, let's not jump to conclusions. The wheezing and elevated heart rate could indicate a few things. Your oxygen saturation is a bit low, and the swelling in your ankles, along with the constant dryness, suggests there might be some fluid retention. It could be related to your heart, but it could also be something else entirely. Given your age and these symptoms, I think we need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a BNP to check for heart failure. It's fairly standard. No need to panic yet. We'll get the results back quickly, and then we can discuss a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Chest X-ray…blood work… Sounds like a lot. But… I guess if you gotta know, you gotta know. BNP… what's a BNP? Is that gonna hurt? I don’t like needles. And… what if it’s somethin’ bad? Don't beat around the bush, doc. Just tell me straight. I'm an old man. I can handle it. But I ain’t goin’ to the hospital if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: A BNP is just a blood test, Mr. Guilds. It stands for B-type natriuretic peptide, and it helps us assess whether your heart is under strain. It won’t hurt any more than any other blood draw. Look, I understand your concerns. The results will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. It could be something related to your heart, which is why we're doing these tests. But it could also be something else, like a lung issue or even dehydration. I don't want to alarm you, but it's important to rule things out. We’ll discuss all of your options once we have the results, and I assure you, we’ll try to avoid a hospital stay if at all possible. I'll give you a requisition for the lab and the X-ray facility. They're both located nearby. Do you have any questions about where to go or how to schedule the tests?
PATIENT: Okay…okay. Just a blood test. And a picture of my chest. Nearby, you say? I can still drive, thankfully. I got a fella, young man, helps me with things sometimes. He can take me if I need it. But… what if the results are bad? What then? You gonna send me straight to that hospital? I just want to know what I’m lookin’ at, doc. Be straight with me. Old man deserves that much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, let's not get ahead of ourselves. We don't know the results yet. If the results show something concerning, we’ll discuss all of your options. That could include medication, further testing, or, in some cases, hospitalization. But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. I understand your apprehension, but getting a diagnosis is the first step. If it is something serious, the sooner we address it, the better. I promise I won't send you to the hospital without a thorough discussion and explanation. We'll explore all other avenues first. Here are the requisitions. The lab and X-ray facility are both at 123 Main Street. Their number is 555-1234 if you need to schedule an appointment. Schedule them as soon as you can. Once you have the results, you can either have them sent directly to my office, or you can bring them with you when you come back for your follow-up appointment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… 123 Main Street. 555-1234. I think I can manage that. So… blood test and picture. Then I come back and you tell me what's wrong? You promise you won’t just send me to that hospital? I appreciate you bein’ straight with me, doc. Most doctors these days… they don't take the time. Alright. I guess I'll go get these tests done. Thank you, doc. For everythin’.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guilds. And I promise, we’ll take things one step at a time. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and drive safely.
