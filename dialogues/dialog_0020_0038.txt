DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. I believe I was told to inquire about… paperwork? Something to do with making sure my wishes are known, should… things become difficult. I'm afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, and I didn’t quite grasp all the details over the phone. It had to do with an Advance Directive or a POLST form, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. We received a request for you to discuss Advance Care Planning – that includes things like an Advance Directive and a POLST form. It's very thoughtful of you to be proactive about this, especially given your concerns about memory. It can be a little overwhelming, so we’ll take it slow. First, let’s just clarify – when you say “difficult,” what specifically are you concerned about?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a specific event, if that makes sense. More a… general worry. I don't want… decisions made for me that I wouldn't have chosen myself. Especially regarding medical care. I’ve seen… things. And I would prefer to have some say, even if I… am unable to articulate it at the time. It’s a bit vague, I realize. It’s difficult to explain. Is a POLST form different than an Advance Directive? Perhaps if you explain the differences, it would help me understand what I need.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, it’s not vague at all. It’s very common to feel that way, and you’re very insightful to be thinking about this now. You’re right to ask about the difference. An Advance Directive is a broader document – it outlines your overall wishes for medical care, generally for situations where you can’t speak for yourself but aren’t necessarily facing an immediate life-or-death crisis. It can include things like a Living Will – specifying what kind of treatments you want or don’t want – and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, which names someone to make decisions on your behalf. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is more specific. It’s a medical order, based on your wishes, that tells healthcare providers what to do in an emergency. It's for people with serious illnesses or frailty. It deals with things like CPR, intubation, and artificial nutrition. Given what you’ve described, it sounds like discussing both an Advance Directive and perhaps a POLST form would be beneficial. Does that distinction make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that clarifies things considerably. So the Advance Directive is more… encompassing, a general plan. And the POLST form is for… immediate situations. I think I understand. It sounds as if the Advance Directive is the more pressing matter, then. To get that established, first. I suppose… where do we begin? Is there a form I need to fill out? Or is this more of a… conversation? I apologize for my confusion; I truly am trying to grasp this.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Evann. This is a process, and it's perfectly normal to have questions. We'll go at your pace. It is primarily a conversation. There is a form, but it’s really a starting point to help guide us. It asks about your values and preferences regarding medical care. We’ll go through it section by section, and I’ll ask clarifying questions along the way. It’s about making sure your wishes are documented. Before we dive into the form, could you tell me a little about what’s important to you when it comes to your health and quality of life?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I suppose… maintaining my dignity is paramount. Even if… things are difficult. I don’t want to be a burden, either. And I’ve always valued my independence. Being able to… think for myself, make my own decisions. I also… I don’t want to prolong suffering unnecessarily. If there’s no hope of recovery, I don’t want… aggressive interventions. But I also don’t want to be… rushed. There’s a balance, I suppose. Is that helpful? I’m afraid I’m not very articulate.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Evann. In fact, that’s excellent. Dignity, independence, avoiding unnecessary suffering – those are all very important values to consider, and it's good you’ve identified them. It sounds like you’re someone who values quality of life very highly. Okay, let’s start with the Advance Directive form. It has sections on things like life-sustaining treatment – things like CPR, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. We can discuss each one, and you can tell me your wishes. First, let’s talk about CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation. If your heart stops beating or you stop breathing, CPR can sometimes restore your heartbeat and breathing. However, it’s not always successful, and it can be physically demanding. Would you want CPR performed if you were to collapse here in the clinic?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question. I've seen CPR performed. It… doesn't always seem to be effective, and it looks… unpleasant. I suppose… if there’s absolutely no chance of recovery, then no. I wouldn’t want to be… kept alive artificially. But if there’s even a small possibility… then yes, I would want them to try. It’s… a difficult line to draw. Perhaps it depends on the circumstances? Is there a way to specify that? To say “try, but only if there’s a reasonable chance”?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, it is a difficult line to draw, and your hesitation is perfectly reasonable. And yes, there is a way to specify that. The form allows us to add clarifying statements, and we can definitely state your preference for attempting CPR only if there's a reasonable chance of recovery. We can also specify under what circumstances you wouldn’t want it performed – for example, if you have a terminal illness. So, we can write something like: “I want CPR performed unless it is determined that there is no reasonable chance of recovery.” Does that accurately reflect your wishes?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that… that captures it perfectly. “Unless it is determined that there is no reasonable chance of recovery.” That feels… right. Thank you. That’s… a weight off my shoulders, to have that clarified. What’s next? Mechanical ventilation, you said?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. It’s my pleasure to help. And yes, next is mechanical ventilation. This involves using a machine to help you breathe if you’re unable to breathe on your own. It’s often needed for people with serious lung problems or after a major surgery. There are different levels of ventilation – some are temporary, used to give your lungs a rest, while others are long-term. Would you want to be placed on a ventilator if you were unable to breathe on your own?
PATIENT: That… is another difficult one. I've seen people on ventilators. It doesn’t seem like a… comfortable existence. And I understand it can be… a long process. I suppose… if it’s only temporary, to give my lungs a rest, then yes. But if it’s long-term, with no hope of improvement… then no. I wouldn’t want to be… sustained artificially in that way. Is there a way to specify a time limit? For example, “try ventilation for a week, then discontinue if there’s no improvement”?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a very reasonable request, and it's something we can definitely include in the Advance Directive. Specifying a time limit for ventilation is a common practice. So, we can write something like: “I want mechanical ventilation to be attempted, but only for a maximum of one week. If there is no significant improvement within that timeframe, ventilation should be discontinued.” Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfect. “A maximum of one week.” That feels… good. I appreciate you being so… understanding. And allowing me to be so specific. It makes me feel… more in control. What about artificial nutrition? Feeding tubes, you mean?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable and in control of these decisions. And yes, let’s discuss artificial nutrition. This involves providing nutrients and fluids through a feeding tube, either through your nose or directly into your stomach. It’s often needed for people who are unable to eat on their own. There are different types of feeding tubes, and they can be temporary or long-term. Would you want to be provided with artificial nutrition if you were unable to eat on your own?
PATIENT: That… is another difficult one. I've seen people with feeding tubes. It doesn't seem like a… dignified existence. And I understand it can be… uncomfortable. If it's only temporary, to give my body a chance to recover… then yes. But if it's long-term, with no hope of improvement… then no. I wouldn’t want to be sustained artificially in that way. Is there a way to specify that, as well? To say “try it for a week, then discontinue if there’s no improvement”? Or… if my quality of life is severely diminished?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can definitely specify both a time limit and a quality of life consideration. It's very important to document your wishes regarding quality of life. So, we can write something like this: “I want artificial nutrition to be attempted for a maximum of one week. If there is no significant improvement within that timeframe, or if my quality of life is severely diminished, artificial nutrition should be discontinued.” Does that accurately reflect your wishes, Evann?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that captures it perfectly. “A maximum of one week, or if my quality of life is severely diminished.” That feels… right. Thank you. That’s… a tremendous weight off my shoulders. Is there anything else? Any other… scenarios we should consider? Or are we finished for today?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. I’m glad we were able to get that documented. We’ve covered the major scenarios – CPR, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. We also touched on quality of life, which is incredibly important. There are a few other things we could discuss, such as pain management and end-of-life care preferences, but those are often addressed in a separate document called a POLST form, which we talked about earlier. For today, I think we’ve made excellent progress with the Advance Directive. We can review the form together to make sure everything is accurate, and then you can sign it. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… excellent. Reviewing the form together would be… reassuring. And then signing it. Yes. Let’s review it. And thank you again, Doctor Beinborn. You’ve been… incredibly patient and understanding. I truly appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. It's my pleasure. And you were a very thoughtful patient. Let's go through this section by section, and we can make any necessary adjustments. Here's the section on CPR... Does this wording still accurately reflect your wishes: "I want CPR performed unless it is determined that there is no reasonable chance of recovery"?
