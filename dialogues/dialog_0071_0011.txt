DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Or… good afternoon, it is getting on, isn't it?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor… Galena, is it? Look, I ain't got all day. Just need somethin' signed so I can get this done with. It's about...well, a little fixin' up, you could say.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. “A little fixin’ up.” Can you tell me a bit more about that, Mr. Honcoop?
PATIENT: Details, details. It's… cosmetic. They want a paper from a doctor sayin' I’m… fit enough. I work with towers, you see. Radio stuff. Been doin' it a long time. That's all you need to know, really. Don't see how climbin' towers has anythin' to do with… this. Just need the signature.
DOCTOR: I understand you need a form signed stating you're fit for work. And it involves… tower work, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! That's right. Towers. Lots of 'em. High up. Don't see what that's got to do with… look, I ain't got no heart problems or nothin'. Strong as an ox, for my age. Just… paperwork. Can we get this over with? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Just to be absolutely sure, and to properly complete the form, I'd like to ask you a few quick questions. Just routine, you understand. And maybe a very brief look at your blood pressure and listen to your heart. It won't take long. Will that work?
PATIENT: Listen to my heart? Blood pressure? Now hold on a minute. I told you, I’m fine! I don't need examinin'. This is ridiculous. I just need a signature! I ain't payin' for a whole check-up for somethin' simple. Waste of time and money. Look, Doctor, are you gonna sign the paper or not? I really don’t understand why this is so difficult.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration. Truly. However, ethically, I can't sign a document stating you're fit for a physically demanding job – like tower work, which, as you say, involves climbing – without at least a basic assessment. It's for your safety, as well. It wouldn’t be responsible of me to sign something without knowing you’re able to handle the physical strain. I can check your blood pressure and listen to your heart – that's all I’m suggesting, right now. It will take less than five minutes. If everything is perfectly normal, I’m happy to sign the form right away. What do you say?
PATIENT: Five minutes, you say? Five minutes. And just listenin' and checkin'? No pokin' and proddin'? Fine. Five minutes. But if it goes a second over, I’m walkin' out. And don't expect a thank you. This is… inconvenience. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, five minutes it is. If you could just sit back and relax, that would be great. I'm just going to take your blood pressure first. Can you tell me, have you had any dizziness or shortness of breath lately?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Shortness of breath? Look, I climb towers for a livin'! You think I'd be climbin' if I was faintin' and wheezin'? No. I haven't. Now get on with it. I got a schedule to keep. This is holdin' me up. Five minutes, remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. And I do hear a slight murmur when I listen to your heart. Have you ever been told you have a heart murmur before?
PATIENT: Murmur? What's a murmur? Never heard of it. Doctors never said nothin'. I been climbin' these towers for forty years! Forty years, I tell ya! If somethin' was wrong, I’d know. This is… preposterous. You tryin' to tell me I’m too old to work? I'm perfectly capable. Just check the boxes and let me go. This is ridiculous. You makin' somethin' out of nothin’.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I’m not trying to say you’re too old to work. A murmur is just a sound the heart makes, and it doesn't necessarily mean there’s a problem. However, with the slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur, I really think it would be responsible to recommend a more thorough evaluation by a cardiologist – a heart specialist – before signing this form. It's for your own safety. Climbing towers is physically demanding, and we need to be sure your heart is healthy enough to handle it. Would you be open to getting a referral to a cardiologist?
PATIENT: A specialist? Now you're just tryin' to get more money outta me! I knew it! This whole thing is a waste of time. I'm perfectly fine, and I don't need a doctor tellin' me what I already know. I’m walkin’ out. And I’m tellin’ everyone I know what a racket you’re runnin’ here. You’re not gettin’ a signature outta me, and I don’t want nothin’ more to do with this. Good day, Doctor. .
