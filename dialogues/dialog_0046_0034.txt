DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Good morning to you too. Um... I just moved here. New to the area. I think that's why I'm here? Like, for a check-up, I guess? It’s kinda… a lot to remember everything when you’re settling in. Medicare said I should come see someone.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Emileigh. Moving is a big change, and getting established with new healthcare providers is definitely on the list. A welcome check-up is a great idea. So, to start, and just for my records, can you confirm your date of birth for me?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I… think it’s… July 12th? No, wait… July 15th? Ugh, I’m so sorry. My brain isn’t working so good right now. I think it's the 15th, but don’t quote me on that. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. It's very common to feel a bit scattered during a transition like this. We can double-check everything. Let's go with July 15th for now, and we’ll confirm it in the system. Okay, July 15th it is. And just to get a baseline, can you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Um… okay. I’m… not very tall. Around five feet? Maybe a little less. And… I weigh… a lot. Like, around 170 pounds? I think. It’s hard to say exactly. I haven’t checked in a while. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Around five feet and 170 pounds. We’ll get more precise measurements here today, just to have accurate records. Now, apart from the general check-up due to your recent move, are you experiencing any specific health concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not really? I mean, I get tired a lot. But I always have. And sometimes my back hurts… from working, I guess? I’m a… a mechanic. Mechanical… something. Technicians? I help build things. It’s kinda hard work, but I like it. But no, nothing major that I can think of. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh. Fatigue and back pain are common, especially with physically demanding work. It's good you mentioned them. Regarding the fatigue – would you describe it as just feeling generally tired at the end of the day, or is it interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: It's… more than just tired at the end of the day, I guess. Like, some days it's hard to even get started. And then I'm just… blah. I still go to work, 'cause I have to. But I don't really do much after. Just… sit. And sleep. Is that… bad? I don't know what's normal anymore, honestly. I just feel… kinda worn out all the time.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite draining, Emileigh, and it's definitely worth exploring. Feeling persistently worn out and having difficulty starting your day isn't typical, and we want to figure out what might be going on. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been developing gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It didn’t just… happen overnight. It’s been… getting worse, slowly, for maybe… six months? Or longer? Ugh, it’s hard to remember. Everything kinda blends together. I just know it wasn’t like this before. I used to have more energy. I used to… do things.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening over the past six months or so. That's very helpful information. It sounds like this has been impacting your quality of life, and we'll certainly get to the bottom of it. To get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical… history? Um… I don’t really… have one? I mean, I haven’t been to the doctor much. Just for check-ups when I was a kid, I think. And… I broke my arm once, when I was little. Playing with my cousin. That's about it. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I guess. Or, I thought I was. Is there something specific you're looking for? I don't know what counts as "history."
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s great that you haven’t had many medical issues in the past. “Medical history” just means any illnesses, surgeries, or conditions you’ve had, even if they were a long time ago. So, no major illnesses, no surgeries besides the broken arm as a child… that's good to know. What about any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of? I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, pretty much. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I’m around cats, but that’s probably just… fur? Is that an allergy? I don’t think so. My husband has allergies, though. He sneezes a lot. But I’m okay. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Just a little itchiness around cats, which may not be an allergic reaction. That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back, when it’s really bad. But that's it. And… sometimes a vitamin, when I remember. My mother always told me to take vitamins. But I don't really keep up with it. That's all. Nothing regular. Does that count? I don't take anything every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen for back pain and sometimes a vitamin. That's helpful to know. Now, just to get a broader picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… I work. A lot. I’m a mechanical technician. I build things, like I said. My husband and I… we live in a small apartment. We don’t really go out much. He likes to watch TV. I used to… hike, before I got so tired. I don't smoke. And I only drink… sometimes, with dinner. Is that what you mean? I don’t really have a… a lifestyle, I guess. Just… work and home.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Emileigh. It sounds like you’ve been very focused on work, and it’s understandable that you haven’t had much time for other activities. And are there any major stressors in your life right now?
PATIENT: Stressors… um… Work is stressful. Sometimes. My husband… he's been sick lately. Not like, really sick, but… tired a lot. And… he worries a lot. About money. And… things. I try to help, but… it’s hard. He gets… upset sometimes. And… I don't really know what to do. Is that… a stressor? I don't really like talking about it.
DOCTOR: It absolutely is a stressor, Emileigh. It sounds like you’re carrying a lot, both at work and at home, and it’s very brave of you to share that with me. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed in a situation like that. We don’t need to go into detail if you’re not comfortable, but it’s good for me to know what’s going on in your life. Okay. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. That’s fine. I guess. What are you going to do? I don’t like needles. And I hate when people touch my feet. But… okay. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, Emileigh. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’re just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. I won’t be doing any blood work or shots today, and we can definitely avoid touching your feet if you’d prefer. Okay, just breathe normally. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Ears look clear. Throat is a little pink, but no signs of infection. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Alright. Everything seems within normal limits, but these are just initial observations. Given your fatigue and other symptoms, I think it would be a good idea to order some blood work to get a more detailed picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t really like needles, but… I want to feel better. What are you looking for? Like, what’s wrong with me? I just… feel so tired all the time. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Emileigh. The blood work will help us rule out several possibilities, such as anemia, thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, and infections. It’s a routine test, and it doesn't necessarily mean there's anything serious wrong. We'll just need a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. It only takes a few minutes, and the nurse is very skilled. We’ll send it to the lab, and the results usually come back within a few days. While we wait for the results, I also want to discuss some strategies for managing your stress and improving your energy levels. Would you be open to talking about that?
PATIENT: I guess… okay. Talking about stress… that sounds hard. But… I’m tired of feeling tired all the time. So… yeah. Let’s talk about it. What do I do? I just… feel overwhelmed. And my husband… he's not much help. He just worries more.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, Emileigh, and it sounds like you’re carrying a lot on your own. It takes courage to acknowledge that you need support. Let's start with identifying some of the specific stressors in your life. You mentioned work and your husband's worries. Are there any other factors contributing to your stress levels?
PATIENT: Um… the apartment is small. It feels… claustrophobic sometimes. And I worry about money. Always. Even when we have enough. And… I miss my family. They live far away. I used to visit them more often, but now… I don't have the energy. And… I feel guilty. About everything. About not working harder, about not being a better wife, about not visiting my family. It’s… a lot. I just… want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: That is a lot, Emileigh. It sounds like you’re carrying a significant emotional burden, and it’s no wonder you’re feeling exhausted. It’s important to remember that you’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s okay to ask for help. One of the first things we can do is explore some stress-reduction techniques. Have you ever tried mindfulness exercises, deep breathing, or yoga?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don’t really… have time for that. I’m always too busy. Working, or taking care of things around the apartment, or worrying about my husband. I don’t even know where to start. And… I’m not very good at relaxing. I always feel like I should be doing something. It sounds silly, I know. But… I just can’t seem to switch off.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound silly at all, Emileigh. It’s very common to feel like you need to be constantly productive, especially when you’re carrying a lot of responsibilities. The good news is that relaxation is a skill, and it can be learned. There are some simple techniques you can try, even if you only have a few minutes each day. We can start with deep breathing exercises. Would you like me to guide you through one now?
PATIENT: I… guess so. If it won’t take too long. I don’t want to be a bother. And… I’m probably not very good at it. But… okay. Go ahead. Just… tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: You won’t be a bother at all, Emileigh. And there's no such thing as "good" or "bad" at this – it’s just about taking a few moments to focus on your breath. Okay. Let’s start by finding a comfortable position. You can close your eyes if you’d like, or just soften your gaze. Now, take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your belly with air. Feel your stomach expand. Hold it for a few seconds… and then slowly exhale through your mouth, releasing all the tension. Let your body relax with each exhale. We’ll do this a few more times. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Just focus on the sensation of your breath. Don't worry about trying to control it, just observe it.
PATIENT: It's… hard. I can't seem to get the air all the way down. And my mind keeps wandering. I'm thinking about all the things I need to do later. And… I feel a little anxious. Like something bad is going to happen. I'm not very good at this. I think I'm making it worse.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Emileigh. It’s very common for your mind to wander, especially when you’re first starting out. It takes practice to quiet the thoughts and focus on your breath. And feeling anxious is also a natural response to stress. You're not making it worse – you're simply experiencing what many people go through. Let’s try a slightly different approach. Instead of trying to control your breath, let’s focus on simply noticing the sensations in your body. Notice how your chest rises and falls with each breath. Notice the feeling of your feet on the floor. And if your mind wanders, gently redirect your attention back to your body. We’ll do this for just a few more moments. And remember, there's no right or wrong way to do it. Just observe.
PATIENT: It’s… a little better. Not much, but… a little. I still feel anxious, but I’m not as overwhelmed. And… my back doesn’t hurt as much. Maybe. I don’t know. Is this… what it’s supposed to feel like?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Emileigh. Even a little bit of relief is a positive step. And yes, that’s exactly what it’s supposed to feel like – a gentle sense of calm, a slight easing of tension. It’s not about eliminating all thoughts or feelings, but about learning to observe them without getting carried away. It sounds like mindfulness exercises could be helpful for you, but it’s important to practice regularly to see the benefits. We can discuss some resources for guided meditations or mindfulness apps. We should also keep an eye on your lab results, to see if there's an underlying physical cause for your fatigue. Before we finish, I want to make sure you have someone to talk to if you’re feeling overwhelmed or anxious. Do you have a support system – family, friends, or a therapist – you can lean on?
PATIENT: Not really. My husband… he worries a lot, but he doesn’t really listen. And my family lives far away. I haven’t seen them in months. I don’t really have anyone to talk to. That's… why I put it off for so long. I just… deal with it. I didn't want to bother anyone. And… I didn't think it would help.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emileigh. It takes courage to reach out for help, and it's perfectly okay to feel hesitant. But it's important to remember that you don't have to deal with everything on your own. There are many resources available to provide support. I can give you information about local therapists, support groups, and mental health hotlines. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. That would be… helpful. I guess. I don’t know if I’ll actually use it, but… it’s good to know it’s there. Thank you. I think that’s all for now, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now, Emileigh. We've covered a lot today. I'll have the nurse draw your blood, and I'll give you some information about the resources we discussed. Here’s the information about local therapists and support groups. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please take care of yourself, Emileigh.
