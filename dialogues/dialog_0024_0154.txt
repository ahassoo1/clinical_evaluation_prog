DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. Been botherin’ me again. Seems like… a problem I've had off and on. It’s… uncomfortable. I don’t rightly remember when it started, exactly. A while ago, I think.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” you say. A rather vague description, Ms. Wease. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. Well, I have to… go to the little girls’ room… a lot. And it burns. A burning feeling, when I… you know. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like it doesn't all come out, if you understand. It’s just… unpleasant. I really don't like it. Is that specific enough? It’s been happening for… some time, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Burning with incomplete emptying… right. And how often would you say you are going to the restroom, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a hard question. More than usual, certainly. I used to… well, I don’t really keep track of such things. But now… it feels like every couple of hours, even if I haven't had much to drink. Maybe more. It's… disruptive. Especially when I'm drivin’ the RV. And… and at night, too. I have to get up a lot. Is that… helpful? I’m sorry I can’t be more precise.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, nocturia… Very well. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, my. I… I don't think so. Not that I’ve seen. Sometimes it’s a bit… cloudy, maybe. But no blood, no. I would remember that, wouldn’t I? It’s… a frightening thing, blood. I don’t recall seein’ any. Though… I haven't really been looking closely, if you understand. It’s just… unpleasant, and I try to… deal with it quickly.
DOCTOR: And have you experienced any pain in your lower abdomen, or your back, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… sometimes. Not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache. And sometimes it feels like a pressure, right… here. And the back… a little bit, too. Not all the time, though. Comes and goes. I just thought it was… getting old, you know? I do a lot of drivin’, and sittin’ for long hours can't be good for you. Is that… common?
DOCTOR: “Getting old” is rarely a diagnosis, Ms. Wease. Now, let’s discuss your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, hypertension, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re askin’ things I can’t rightly remember. I… I had a touch of the flu, I think, last winter. And my knees bother me something awful. But… conditions? No, not that I recall. The doctor… the one before, he didn’t mention anything. I’ve never been a sickly woman. Not really. I do take a little somethin’ for the arthritis, but that's it. I’m afraid I’m not much help, am I? My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Just the one. For my knees, you see. It’s… Ibuprofen, I think. The little blue pills. I take them when they really hurt. Sometimes a couple at a time, if I’ve been drivin’ a long stretch. And… and sometimes I take somethin’ for sleep, if I can't get to sleep because of the… the waterworks, you see. But that’s just occasionally. A small white pill. I can't remember the name of it, though. It’s… for sleep. That’s all I know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Wease, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh. Lie down? Well… I suppose so. I'm not very… flexible these days, Doctor. Is it… necessary? I mean, couldn’t we just… talk about it? I'm not fond of examinations, if I'm honest. But… if you think it's necessary. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Wease. Please lie supine. I will be auscultating your abdomen and performing a quick neurological exam. Please inform me if anything feels uncomfortable. Now, if you will just relax... Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh, my… A little bit, yes. Right… there. Not sharp, exactly. Just… tender. It’s always tender there, really. I suppose it’s just… me. It’s not a terrible pain, but… I can feel it. Is that… bad? And what does "auscultating" mean, exactly? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Auscultating means listening with a stethoscope, Ms. Wease. Your abdomen is soft, but I do detect some tenderness in the suprapubic region. Now, I'm going to perform a quick neurological exam. Could you please cross your legs?
PATIENT: Cross my legs… Oh dear, that’s… a little difficult. My hips aren’t what they used to be. Is this… important? I mean, will crossing my legs tell you something about my… waterworks? It's just… a bit uncomfortable, really. And… what are you lookin’ for, exactly? I don’t mean to be difficult, but I like to know what's happenin’.
DOCTOR: I am assessing your reflexes, Ms. Wease. Your reflexes are… diminished. Now, if you will just bear with me for a moment… Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes! Yes, I felt that. It… it pricked a bit. Diminished reflexes? What does that mean? Is that… serious? Is somethin’ wrong with my legs? I walk perfectly well, you know. I drive the RV all over the country! I… I don't understand. Is my… waterworks connected to my legs somehow? This is all very confusing. Are you sure this examination is necessary?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wease, based on my preliminary examination, and your reported symptoms, I suspect a possible urinary tract infection combined with some degree of peripheral neuropathy. The diminished reflexes could be a result of the neuropathy, which is fairly common in individuals your age. We will need to run a urinalysis to confirm the presence of an infection. I will order a complete blood count as well. The results should be available within 24 hours. I will call you with the results.
PATIENT: Oh… Infection… and… neuropathy? I… I don't understand all those words. And what do I do now? Do I need to take somethin’? Will it… will it hurt? And you'll call me? When exactly? I’m often out drivin’ the RV, you see… Oh dear. This is all very… unsettling. Is there anything I should do right now? Anythin’ at all?
