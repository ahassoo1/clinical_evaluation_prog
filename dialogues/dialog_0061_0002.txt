DOCTOR: Talofa lava, Zoie. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what did I come for? Oh! Yes. It’s… going to the bathroom. It’s hard. Like, when I need to go, it doesn’t… come easy. Does that make sense? I don’t really remember much else. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Zoie. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with urination. That’s a very common concern, especially as we get older. So, just to clarify – is it difficult to start going, or is it difficult to completely empty your bladder, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, both, I think. Starting is… a wait. And then, even when I think I’m done, I feel like there’s still some left. Not a lot, but… something. It’s a little embarrassing to talk about, but… that’s it. I don't really understand what you're asking about 'bladder' though. Is that… the bag inside? I always called it something else when I was younger.
DOCTOR: It is perfectly alright to talk about, Zoie, that's what I’m here for! And yes, the bladder is the bag inside that holds your urine. It’s perfectly normal to not remember all the medical terms. Okay, so it sounds like you’re having trouble both starting and fully emptying. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it something new?
PATIENT: Oh… newish, I think. Maybe a few months? It comes and goes, you know? Some days it’s worse than others. I thought it was just… getting old. My husband, he says I drink too much tea. Maybe he’s right! I do love my tea. But I’m not sure if that's the reason. It just… started happening, and I thought I should probably get it checked. I don't remember exactly when it started though. Time just… goes by.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of intermittent difficulty. And your husband thinks it might be the tea. That’s good information. We can definitely explore both possibilities. Besides the tea, have you noticed any other changes – like feeling like you need to go very frequently, or any pain or burning when you go?
PATIENT: No pain, no. Not burning. Just… the waiting. And I do go a lot, I think. More than I used to. But again, I'm old! Maybe old people just go more often. I really don’t know. I don’t think it’s bothering me too much, to be honest. Just… a little annoying. And I worry about accidents, you know? When I’m out. I don’t want to make a mess.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about accidents, Zoie. That's a very valid worry, and it's good you're bringing it up. So, no pain or burning, just increased frequency and difficulty starting and emptying. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your abdomen and a gentle pelvic exam, just to check things out. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a check? Hmm. A pelvic exam? What does that involve? I’ve had those before, I think… but I don’t remember much. Is it… uncomfortable? I’m not sure I like the sound of that. But if you think it’s important… okay. But please be gentle, dear. My old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. I completely understand your hesitation, and I will be very gentle. A pelvic exam allows me to check your bladder and surrounding muscles to get a better idea of what's going on. It involves a brief external exam and then a gentle internal exam with a speculum – it’s similar to a Pap smear. We can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. We'll start with listening to your abdomen first, and then we can discuss if you'd like to proceed with the internal exam. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Listening to my tummy first… that sounds okay. That doesn’t sound too bad. As long as it’s quick. I don't like being poked and prodded for too long. And… are you going to tell me what you find? I like to know what’s happening, even if I don't understand all the fancy words. Just… tell me in plain English, dear.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. I will definitely explain everything in plain English. No fancy medical words, I promise. Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. Everything sounds relatively normal. I don't hear any unusual noises. Your bladder feels… full, which is expected, but not distended. There’s a little tenderness when I press here on your lower abdomen, but nothing major. Now, would you like to proceed with the internal pelvic exam?
PATIENT: Hmm… tenderness… that’s probably just old age again, isn’t it? Everything hurts a little when you get old! An internal exam… I… I don’t know. Is it necessary? Can’t you tell me what’s wrong without it? I really don’t like things going… up there. It’s just… uncomfortable and a little embarrassing. Maybe we can skip that part? I’m not sure I’m feeling up to it today, dear. Perhaps just listen to my tummy is enough for now?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Zoie. It’s perfectly alright if you’re not comfortable with the internal exam. We can absolutely skip that part. Based on listening to your abdomen and your symptoms, it could be a number of things. It sounds like you might have some mild overactive bladder, where the bladder muscles are contracting a bit too much, causing the frequent urge to go. The tenderness could be related to age, as you said, or possibly some mild inflammation. To get a clearer picture, I would recommend a urine test to rule out any infection. That’s a simple test, just a sample of your urine. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A urine test… that sounds much better! Just a little sample, you say? That I can do. No poking and prodding, just a little… pee in a cup? Yes, that I’m happy to do. Where do I go to do that? And how much do I need to give you? I don't want to make a mess! Old hands aren't very steady these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Zoie. Just a little sample in a cup. The restroom is right over there. Please try to collect a "midstream" sample – that means start urinating, and then collect the sample about halfway through. You don't need to fill the whole cup, about two ounces is plenty. I’ll give you a few minutes of privacy. Just bring it back to me when you’re ready, and I’ll send it to the lab. I’ll also have the nurse bring you a lid for the cup.
PATIENT: Okay, midstream… I think I remember that. Start and then… collect the middle part. Two ounces… that’s not much, is it? Alright, alright. I can do that. I’ll be right back, dear. And thank you for being so patient with an old lady like me. It's hard to remember things these days.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Zoie. No rush at all. I’ll be right here when you get back.
PATIENT: Here you go, dear. I hope I did it right! It was a little tricky, and I might have spilled a tiny bit… but I think I got enough. My hands were shaking so much. I hope the lab doesn’t mind if it’s not perfect! I’m so sorry if I made a mess.
DOCTOR: This is perfect, Zoie. Don’t worry about a tiny bit of shaking or a little spill – it happens! The lab is used to it. It’s the sample itself that’s important, and this looks great. I’ll send this off to the lab right away. It usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the results back. While we’re waiting, let's talk about some things you can do to help manage your symptoms. Have you ever tried doing what are called “bladder training exercises?
PATIENT: Bladder training exercises? Oh dear. That sounds… difficult. Like trying to train a naughty puppy! I don't know if my bladder can be trained. It's an old bladder, you know? It’s been through a lot! What do these exercises involve? Is it… hard? And will it make things worse if I can’t do them right? I worry about accidents, you know. That’s my biggest fear.
DOCTOR: It's not like training a puppy, Zoie, don't worry! It's more about learning to control the urge to go to the bathroom. It involves trying to delay urination for a few minutes each time you feel the urge. Start small – just try to add a few minutes each time. It helps strengthen the bladder muscles over time. And it’s perfectly alright if you can’t do it perfectly right away. It takes practice, and it's not about completely holding it back – just delaying it a little. We can start very slowly, and if it makes things worse, we’ll stop. We’ll work at your pace. Would you be willing to give it a try?
PATIENT: Hmm… delaying it a little… that sounds… scary. But if it helps, and if I can stop if it gets too bad… alright. I suppose I can try. But don't expect miracles, dear. My bladder is very stubborn! And what if I really need to go? Can I just go whenever I need to? I don't want to make a mess, you know. It’s just… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie! Absolutely. If you really need to go, you go. It’s not about depriving yourself or making yourself uncomfortable. It's just about learning to gently control the urge when you can. Think of it as gentle exercise for your bladder, not a strict training regimen. We’ll start with just adding 5 minutes each time you feel the urge. If that’s too much, we’ll reduce it to 2 minutes. And if it causes any discomfort or makes you anxious, we’ll stop immediately. We can also talk about some other things you can do, like avoiding caffeine and alcohol, which can irritate the bladder. And we can discuss pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, which can also strengthen the bladder muscles. Would you like to talk about those now?
PATIENT: Caffeine and alcohol… oh dear. I do love my tea! And a little sherry now and then… But if it helps… alright. I can try to cut back. Maybe just one cup of tea a day? And maybe skip the sherry altogether. Pelvic floor exercises… Kegel exercises… that sounds… complicated. I don't even know where my pelvic floor is! And how do I exercise something I can't even find? Oh dear. This is all very overwhelming. Can’t I just take a pill or something? My daughter always says pills fix everything.
DOCTOR: I understand it feels overwhelming, Zoie. It's a lot of information to take in. And your daughter isn’t wrong, sometimes pills can help! There are medications that can help with overactive bladder, but we usually try lifestyle changes and exercises first, because they often work very well and have fewer side effects. And don’t worry about finding your pelvic floor! It’s the muscles you use to stop the flow of urine midstream. If you can do that, you’re using your pelvic floor muscles! We can practice them together right now, if you'd like. It involves squeezing those muscles, holding for a few seconds, and then relaxing. We can start with just five squeezes, and we’ll go slowly. Would you like to try?
PATIENT: Squeezing those muscles… like stopping the pee? Oh dear. I haven't done that in… well, a very long time! I'm afraid I'm a bit rusty! But alright, alright. I'll try. But don't laugh if I make a mess! My old muscles aren’t what they used to be. Is that right? Am I doing it properly? It feels… strange. Like trying to lift something very heavy with muscles I didn't know I had!
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Zoie! You’re doing it exactly right! It does feel strange at first, and it’s normal if it’s a little difficult. You can feel the muscles in your lower abdomen tightening, that’s a good sign. Hold it for about three seconds, and then relax. Don't strain, just gentle squeezes. We’ll do five squeezes, and then take a break. One… two… three… relax. Good! That’s one. Two… three… relax. Excellent! You’re doing wonderfully. Just keep practicing, and it will get easier over time. Don't worry about making a mess – you’re not going to! This is all about gentle exercise, not about pushing yourself too hard. We'll take it slow.
PATIENT: One… two… three… ouch! That one hurt a little. But alright, alright. I'll keep going. Three… two… one… relax. Four… two… one… ouch! Maybe this isn't such a good idea. My old muscles are protesting! I think I've done enough for today. My tummy is aching now. Perhaps we can skip the exercises and just talk about the pills now? My daughter always says pills fix everything. And honestly, dear, my tummy is aching. I'm a bit tired now. It's all very exhausting, you know. Being an old lady is hard work!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. You’ve done wonderfully trying those exercises, and it’s perfectly alright to stop when you’re feeling uncomfortable. It sounds like your tummy muscles are a bit sore, and we don’t want to push yourself. We can definitely talk about medication options now. There are several different medications that can help with overactive bladder. They work by relaxing the bladder muscles and reducing the urge to go to the bathroom. Some of the common side effects include dry mouth and constipation, but we can discuss those in more detail. Would you like me to explain the different types of medications available?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Tell me about the pills. Dry mouth and constipation… oh dear. That doesn’t sound very pleasant. But if it helps… alright. What are the names of the pills? And how often do I have to take them? And will they interact with my other medications? My daughter always says to be careful about interactions. And what if they don’t work? I’m a bit skeptical, you know. Pills don’t always fix everything. But alright, tell me about them anyway. I suppose it’s worth a try. Just please don’t use any fancy medical words. Plain English, dear. Plain English.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. Plain English, I promise. There are a couple of main types of medications we can consider. One is called oxybutynin, and the other is called tolterodine. Both work in a similar way – they calm down the bladder muscles. Oxybutynin is available as a tablet you take once a day, or as a patch you put on your skin. Tolterodine is also a tablet taken once a day. The most common side effects are dry mouth and constipation, as you mentioned. We can manage those with things like drinking plenty of fluids and eating a high-fiber diet. Now, regarding interactions, it’s very important to be careful, and your daughter is right to be cautious. I’m looking at your medication list now. You're currently taking lisinopril for your blood pressure and simvastatin for your cholesterol. Both medications can interact with oxybutynin and tolterodine, although the interactions are generally mild. We would need to monitor your blood pressure and cholesterol levels closely if you start one of these medications. And you're right to be skeptical, Zoie. Pills don't always fix everything, and they don't work for everyone. About 60-70% of people experience significant improvement with these medications, but it can take a few weeks to see the full effect. We can always try a different medication if the first one doesn't work, or we can explore other options, like bladder injections. But let’s start with the medications and see how you do. Would you like me to write you a prescription for oxybutynin?
PATIENT: Oxybutynin… that sounds like a complicated name to remember! And monitoring my blood pressure and cholesterol… oh dear. That sounds like a lot of work! I’m already taking pills for those things! Alright, alright. I suppose I can try the oxybutynin. But just a small dose, please. And if it makes me feel dizzy or gives me a bad tummy ache, I want to stop immediately. And if it interacts with my other pills, I want to know right away. And what about the bladder injections? What are those like? Are they painful? I’m a bit scared of needles! My daughter always says needles are the worst! But alright, write me the prescription for the oxybutynin. But just a small dose, please. And please explain everything very carefully. And please don’t use any fancy medical words. Plain English, dear. Plain English.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. I’m prescribing you a low dose of oxybutynin, 5mg once a day. It’s a very low dose to start with, and we can always increase it if needed. Here’s the prescription. You can take it to your usual pharmacy. Now, regarding the bladder injections, they involve injecting a small amount of medication directly into the bladder muscle. It can help to calm down the bladder and reduce the urge to go to the bathroom. The injections can cause some mild discomfort, but it’s usually not very painful. We would numb the area with a local anesthetic first. The injections are usually given over a series of several weeks. However, we can hold off on those for now, and see how you do with the oxybutynin. It’s very important to let me know if you experience any side effects, such as dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, or changes in your blood pressure. And if you’re not seeing any improvement after a few weeks, we can explore other options. I’m happy to answer any other questions you have. And please don't hesitate to call my office if you’re concerned about anything. Here’s a handout about oxybutynin, including potential side effects and interactions. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… a lot of information to remember! Side effects… interactions… oh dear. I think… I think that’s enough for today, dear. My old brain is getting tired. And I’m a bit worried about taking all these pills. But alright, I’ll try the oxybutynin. And I’ll let you know if I feel any different. And I’ll be sure to call if I get dizzy or have a bad tummy ache. Thank you for being so patient with an old lady like me. And thank you for explaining everything in plain English. You’ve been very kind. I think I’ll go home and have a cup of tea now. And maybe a little nap. Good day to you, dear. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Zoie. It was lovely meeting you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And yes, a cup of tea and a nap sound wonderful. Take care of yourself, and have a lovely day. .
