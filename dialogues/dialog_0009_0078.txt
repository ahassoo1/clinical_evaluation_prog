DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply… I feel like I need a reset. A jumpstart, if you will. I’m just… not feeling myself lately. And I’m hoping you can help me figure out what that means.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Not feeling yourself” is a very common concern, and often a good starting point. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… where to begin? It’s not one big thing, Doctor. It’s… a collection of little things. I’m tired, even when I sleep. Not like, fall-down exhausted, but a constant… dragging feeling. My appetite isn’t what it used to be, though I haven’t lost much weight. And… I’m just less interested in things I used to enjoy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you’re experiencing a constellation of symptoms. We’ll definitely get to the bottom of this. Let's start with the tiredness – how long have you been feeling this dragging sensation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's been building for a few months, I suppose. Maybe six? It started slowly, just needing a little extra coffee in the morning. But now… even with coffee, I’m just… sluggish all day. It's not interfering with my work too badly, but it’s definitely impacting my hobbies. I used to love gardening, but lately, I just don’t have the energy for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, about six months of gradually increasing fatigue, impacting your hobbies… And you mentioned a change in appetite. Could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, I’m not really not hungry, Doctor. It's just… food doesn't seem as appealing anymore. I used to look forward to dinner, plan meals, really enjoy the process. Now… it feels like a chore. I eat because I know I should, not because I want to. And I definitely don't crave anything specific, like I used to. Sometimes I skip meals altogether, if I'm honest. Just… no appetite, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite for about six months, with a loss of enjoyment of food, and sometimes skipping meals. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss during this time?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've checked a couple of times, just to be sure, but the scale hasn’t moved much, if at all. Perhaps a pound or two, but nothing significant. I'm glad it hasn’t been worse, to be honest. It's more the feeling of not being myself than any actual physical change.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Sometimes the feeling is as important as the physical symptoms, and it’s important to address both. Now, I'd like to ask you a few more general questions, a sort of head-to-toe check-in, just to get a better overall picture. It's called a Review of Systems, or ROS. Are you okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Please, go ahead. Anything that might help, Doctor, I’m happy to share. I just want to feel better. I’m starting to worry this is… something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and we’ll investigate thoroughly. Let’s start with your sleep. You mentioned feeling tired, but how is your sleep?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not terrible. I usually fall asleep okay, within half an hour or so. But I wake up several times during the night. Not necessarily fully awake, just… aware. And then it takes me a little while to get back to sleep each time. I wouldn't say it’s restful sleep, if that makes sense. I’ve tried counting sheep, warm milk… nothing really seems to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, falling asleep is relatively easy, but with frequent awakenings and difficulty returning to sleep. That definitely contributes to feeling unrefreshed. Do you snore loudly, or has anyone ever told you that you stop breathing during sleep?
PATIENT: Hmm… my husband, Ricardo, says I do snore. Nothing terribly loud, he says, but enough to notice. He hasn't said I've ever stopped breathing, no. He usually just nudges me a little bit to roll over. But he also says he's a heavy sleeper, so… I don’t know how reliable he is.
DOCTOR: That's good information, nonetheless. Okay. Let's move on. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor, please forgive me, but that’s… a little personal. Let’s just say everything is… a little irregular. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… not. It's hard to explain. It's certainly not a comfortable topic, but it's been happening along with everything else.
DOCTOR: You have absolutely nothing to apologize for, Ms. Pitzel. These things are important, and it’s essential to have a complete picture. Irregular bowel habits, along with the other symptoms… thank you for sharing that. Have you experienced any unintentional weight changes, any fevers, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, no weight loss, like we discussed, and thankfully no fevers, chills, or night sweats. I've been lucky to avoid anything like that. Though, I have been feeling a little more… achy lately. Just general muscle aches, nothing specific. It feels like I'm getting older, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fevers, chills, or night sweats, but some generalized muscle aches. Ms. Pitzel, before we move on to your medical history, do you have any trouble with your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Well… Ricardo has been saying I’m a little more forgetful lately. Small things, mostly. Like where I put my glasses – which is ironic, considering I’m wearing them right now! And sometimes I have trouble finding the right word when I’m speaking. Nothing major, but… noticeable. He jokes that I’m losing my marbles. I’m not so sure it’s funny.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re noticing these things and that you’re able to share them with me. It's not uncommon to experience some cognitive changes. Okay, let's take a step back and talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve always been quite healthy, all my life. I do have some mild arthritis in my knees, but that’s been managed with over-the-counter pain relievers and some gentle exercise. Other than that, nothing really. I've been very fortunate. I’m Medicare eligible now, of course, but I haven’t needed much more than routine checkups and flu shots. Oh, I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but I recovered well from that.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild arthritis, gallbladder removed ten years ago, and otherwise healthy. Have you ever had any major surgeries or hospitalizations besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I’ve broken a bone or two as a child, typical things, but nothing that required a long hospital stay or significant surgery. I really have been very lucky in that regard. I’ve always tried to take good care of myself, eat healthy, exercise regularly… it’s just frustrating that I’m feeling this way despite doing all those things.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's definitely concerning when you're doing all the right things and still not feeling well. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, and she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes later in life. My father had some heart problems, I believe, though I don't remember the specifics. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had Alzheimer's disease. It’s a scary thought, honestly, with the memory problems I’ve been experiencing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Pitzel. That’s important information. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been a very firm believer in a healthy lifestyle. My parents didn’t smoke, and they instilled in me the importance of avoiding harmful habits. I've always been very careful about what I put into my body and how I treat it.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. How about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally – maybe two or three times a week. It's more of a social thing, really. Ricardo and I enjoy pairing wine with our meals. It's not excessive, definitely not a habit. Nothing that would interfere with my health, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate alcohol consumption. And finally, let's talk about your allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue. It’s one of the few things I don’t have to worry about. I've always been quite lucky in that regard as well. Is that everything, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe so. Thank you for being so thorough, Ms. Pitzel. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… I take a multivitamin daily, just a standard one. And I occasionally take ibuprofen for my knee pain, when it flares up. Otherwise, nothing. I really try to avoid taking too many pills, if I’m honest. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Oh! And I do take a probiotic sometimes, to help with digestion. But not regularly, just when I feel a little… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That gives me a much clearer picture. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears, nose and throat, and gently examine your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, go ahead, Doctor. I trust your expertise. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not critically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound good. Ears, nose and throat are all clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen feels normal. Do you experience any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. It's a little… unusual, being poked and prodded, but no pain. Nothing uncomfortable. You're being very gentle. It just feels strange.
DOCTOR: That’s good. It’s always best to be thorough. Alright, Ms. Pitzel, that completes the physical examination. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical findings, the symptoms you're experiencing – the fatigue, decreased appetite, interrupted sleep, muscle aches, and some cognitive changes – could be due to a number of things. It's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone to check your thyroid function, and Vitamin D level. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds very sensible. Anything that might help me figure out what's going on, I’m happy to do. Blood work sounds perfectly fine. Do you have a lab preference?
DOCTOR: Yes, we typically use Quest Diagnostics. Here’s a lab requisition form. It has all the necessary information, including the address and hours. They’ll send the results directly to me. It should take a few days to get everything back. In the meantime, I would like you to start keeping a daily symptom diary, noting the severity of your fatigue, your appetite, and any sleep disturbances you experience. This can give us a better understanding of your overall pattern. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very manageable, Doctor. I can certainly do that. A symptom diary… it’s a good idea to track everything. I have a nice planner I can use. And Quest Diagnostics is right down the street, so that's convenient. When should I expect to hear back from you?
DOCTOR: I anticipate having the results back within 5-7 business days. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once I’ve had a chance to review them. If anything urgent comes up in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough and explained everything clearly. I feel much better just knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. Thank you for listening to me and taking my concerns seriously. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. It’s my job, and I’m happy to help. Remember, we’re a team in this. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s the lab requisition form, and my card with the office number. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
