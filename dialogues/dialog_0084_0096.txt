DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Komarov. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's about my eyes, really. They’ve been really bothered by the sun lately. More than usual, anyway. It feels like they’re super sensitive – like even on a cloudy day, bright light just hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitivity to light... that's good to know. And you say "more than usual"—has this been a gradual thing, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it was gradual, actually. It wasn't like bam, one day I couldn't handle the sun. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, I guess. Maybe starting around… April? Yeah, around April it started to feel a little different.
DOCTOR: Alright, so April is when you first noticed a change. And has it been consistent since then, steadily worsening, or are there days when it’s better or worse?
PATIENT: It definitely has ups and downs. Some days it’s almost okay, like if I’m wearing good sunglasses and a hat. But other days… even with the sunglasses, it feels pretty bad. Especially if I’m out for a long time. And, honestly, it seems worse in the afternoons. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Worse in the afternoons is good information. Okay, and besides the sensitivity to light, have you noticed any other changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really with the seeing itself. Everything looks clear enough, as far as I can tell. No blurriness or anything like that. But… sometimes my eyes feel gritty, like there’s something in them, even when I know there isn’t. And they get tired really easily. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely counts. Gritty feeling and fatigue… Okay. Have you experienced any pain in your eyes, or redness, or any discharge?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. And I haven’t noticed any redness. No discharge either. It's just… uncomfortable, more than anything. Like they’re strained. And the light thing, of course. It’s a weird feeling, hard to explain. It’s not sharp pain, just… too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, redness, or discharge. Just discomfort and fatigue, with the light sensitivity being the main issue. Alright. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean… I lost my wife a few years back, which was… hard. But health-wise? Nothing major. I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox and all that. But I haven’t been to the doctor much, to be honest. I try to stay healthy. I have Medicare, so I go when I need to, but… mostly okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I’m sorry to hear about your wife. As for your health, so no diagnosed medical conditions. Have you ever had any eye problems before—any injuries, surgeries, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, never. My eyes have always been pretty good, to be honest. I haven’t had any injuries, and definitely no surgeries. I wear glasses for reading sometimes, now that I’m getting older, but that’s about it. Just regular age-related stuff, the doctor said. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior eye issues or surgeries. Just reading glasses. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to eat well and get enough sleep. That’s pretty much it. I might take a pain reliever if I get a bad headache, but that’s maybe once or twice a year. Over-the-counter, that is. Nothing prescribed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And no allergies to anything that you know of?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Not that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, touch anything… I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife used to joke I had a cast iron stomach! But seriously, no allergies I know about.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No allergies. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My parents both passed away a while back. They were pretty healthy, actually, as far as I know. Dad had high blood pressure, I think, but that was about it. And my wife's family... I don't know them that well, honestly. We didn’t stay in touch much. I don't recall anyone having major eye problems, but I wouldn’t swear to it. It’s not something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known significant family history of eye problems. And finally, a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. Nothing regular. I prefer tea, to be honest. And water, of course. A lot of water. I try to stay healthy, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No smoking, minimal alcohol. Alright, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick exam of your eyes. I'll check your vision, look at the structures of your eyes, and measure your eye pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. Please have a seat. I’ll start with your visual acuity – just reading some letters on a chart. Try to read the smallest line you can.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I’ll do my best. Let me know if I need to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking straight ahead... Can you read the bottom line for me?
PATIENT: Umm… let me see… It's… blurry. I can see the shapes, but I can't make out the letters. Maybe the line above? Okay, that one… I think it says… “E… F… P… Z…” Is that right? It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, your vision is somewhat reduced, but not severely. I'm going to check each eye individually now. Can you read the bottom line with just this eye?
PATIENT: Okay, let me try... Hmm... it's still blurry. Maybe a little better than before, but not much. I can make out a few of the shapes, but I can’t read the letters properly. I think… maybe a "C" and an "L"? It's really tough.
DOCTOR: Alright, and now with the other eye covered… Okay. Your optic discs look healthy, and I don’t see any major abnormalities in the vessels or macula. I’m going to check your eye pressure now. This might sting for a moment.
PATIENT: Okay, a little sting is fine. Just let me know when you're ready. I'm not a fan of eye drops, but I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Okay, this will just take a moment. Alright, and… okay. Your eye pressure is reading 22 in the right eye and 24 in the left eye. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to shine a light in your eyes and check your pupils and reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. It's a little bright, but I’m okay. Just let me know if you see anything unusual. I’m trying to keep my eyes still.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. No obvious abnormalities there. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. That feels fine. A little pressure, but no discomfort. Everything feels okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on my examination, your vision is slightly reduced, your eye pressure is a little elevated, but everything else appears normal. The sensitivity to light, fatigue, and gritty feeling could be related to a number of things, including dry eye, mild inflammation, or even just eye strain. Given your symptoms and the slightly elevated pressure, I’d like to recommend a few things. First, I want you to start using artificial tears four times a day. Second, I'd like you to schedule a follow-up appointment with an ophthalmologist for a more comprehensive evaluation, including a visual field test and OCT scan. They can rule out any underlying conditions like glaucoma. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. Artificial tears four times a day, I can do that. And scheduling a follow-up with an ophthalmologist… yes, that makes sense. I want to make sure everything is okay, so a more thorough check is a good idea. Do you have any recommendations for an ophthalmologist around here? And about the artificial tears… is there a specific brand you suggest?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. Dr. Anya Sharma is excellent. Her office is about 20 minutes away, at 142 Hillside Road. I can give you her number and address. As for artificial tears, Systane Ultra is a good option, but any preservative-free brand will do. Preservatives can sometimes cause irritation. I’ll write down both the doctor’s information and a prescription for the Systane. Also, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms like sudden vision loss, severe pain, or halos around lights, please contact me or go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Okay, Dr. Sharma, 142 Hillside Road… got it. And Systane Ultra, preservative-free. Thank you. That’s very helpful. No, I think that answers everything, Doctor. Just to be clear, those symptoms you mentioned – sudden vision loss, pain, halos… those are things I should definitely go to the emergency room for?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Sudden vision loss, severe pain, or halos around lights are red flags and could indicate a serious problem that needs immediate attention. Don’t hesitate – go to the emergency room right away. I’m glad I could help. Please follow up with Dr. Sharma as soon as possible, and don't hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Komarov, and take care.
