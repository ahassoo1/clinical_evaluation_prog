DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Right. The… education visit. My husband, he said I should come. Something about… learning things? I work with metal, you see. It’s… hard work. Not much time for… learning.
DOCTOR: An “education visit,” yes. Your husband scheduled this appointment for you. And you work with metal… could you elaborate on that a little?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What does that mean? I… I cut metal. And bend it. And… put it together. Sheet metal. For buildings. Mostly. It’s… dusty. And loud. It's a good job. He worries too much, my husband. Always has.
DOCTOR: Right. Sheet metal work for buildings. And it's dusty and loud. I understand. Your husband is concerned about the conditions of your work. We can certainly discuss that. But before we get into that, are you experiencing any health problems?
PATIENT: Health problems? Not really. I get… tired. Everyone gets tired, right? And my hands… they ache sometimes. From the metal. It’s normal. I don’t… complain. What kind of problems would I even be looking for? He just said I should learn things. It's very confusing.
DOCTOR: “Learn things.” Yes. Well, fatigue and aching hands are common with physically demanding work, certainly. However, working with metal can expose you to a number of things… things that can cause problems later if we don’t address them. Have you noticed any difficulty breathing, even when you're not working?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. I mean… maybe a little. When I climb the stairs? But everyone gets winded. Old age, you know? I’m not… young anymore. Thirty-three is… getting there, right? Not like I'm running marathons. Honestly, this is a waste of time. My husband… he always overreacts.
DOCTOR: Thirty-three is not old. But strenuous work can exacerbate underlying conditions. Let's take a few minutes to check your oxygen saturation and listen to your lungs. It’s a simple procedure. And it will give us a baseline, regardless. Then we can talk about proper safety precautions at work, which, frankly, should have been discussed years ago. If you'll just sit here, please.
PATIENT: Safety precautions? He did say something about that. Always nagging me about a mask. But it gets in the way. And it’s hot. Fine. But this better be quick. I have things to do. Metal doesn't cut itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is… borderline. And I do hear some mild wheezing in your lower lobes. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Asthma? Bronchitis? No! Never. I just… cough sometimes. Everyone coughs. It’s… winter. Or dust. Or… something. Look, I don’t understand all these… numbers and words. Ninety-two… is that bad? And what are lobes? Are those… metal parts? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: “Lobes” are parts of your lungs. And 92% oxygen saturation is not ideal, especially given your work. The dust you’re inhaling is clearly irritating your lungs. It's causing inflammation. We need to discuss a proper respirator. And I'm going to order a chest X-ray just to get a better look at what’s going on. Have you had one of those before?
PATIENT: A… respirator? Like for underwater? No! I can’t breathe with those things! And an X-ray? I don’t like those. Radiation, right? My mother always said… Never mind. Look, maybe I just need a vacation. A nice, long vacation. Away from metal. And dust. And… doctors. Is that an option?
DOCTOR: A vacation is… a temporary solution. But ignoring this problem will only lead to more serious issues down the line. We are not discussing underwater respirators, Ms. Fontanazza. A proper N95 respirator will filter the dust and protect your lungs. And the radiation from a chest X-ray is minimal—far less than you’re exposed to naturally in a single year. I strongly recommend we proceed with the X-ray. And I will write you a prescription for an inhaler to help with the wheezing. We’ll revisit the respirator discussion after we have the results. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? I… I don't really take anything. Maybe some pain pills when my hands really hurt, but those are… old. From my grandmother. I don’t know what’s in them. Honestly, all of this is just… a lot. Can’t I just… go home? And maybe try to work slower? Less metal, you know?
DOCTOR: Working slower is… a start. But it doesn’t address the underlying inflammation and potential for long-term lung damage. And taking medication from your grandmother… that’s extremely risky. We have no idea what you’re taking, or how it might interact with other things. Fine. I will order the chest X-ray, and the inhaler. But I expect you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and proper safety precautions. And please, do not take any more medication without consulting a doctor. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Under… stand. Fine. X-ray. Inhaler. But no promises about the respirator. It’s hot, you know. And uncomfortable. So, can I go now? I really need to get back to work. Metal isn’t going to cut itself.
DOCTOR: The nurse will schedule the X-ray and give you instructions. The inhaler prescription is for Albuterol; use as directed. And I strongly suggest you reconsider the respirator. Yes, you may go. But please, take this seriously. This isn't just about metal, Ms. Fontanazza, it's about your health.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. .
