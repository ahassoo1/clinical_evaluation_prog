DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… unusually thirsty lately. And hungry, constantly hungry, even after a good meal. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s… disruptive. I’d like to get to the bottom of it, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Erxleben. That’s perfectly reasonable. Increased thirst and hunger can be indicative of a number of things, and it's good you're getting it checked out. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this thirst?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Well, it’s not just a dry mouth, if you understand me. I mean, I’m constantly reaching for water, even during the night. I wake up feeling parched. And it doesn’t quite quench it, not really. I've been drinking… a lot more than usual, probably double what I normally would. I suppose that's a good way to put it. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: No, doubling your water intake isn’t typical, Mr. Erxleben. That certainly warrants further investigation. And waking up thirsty despite drinking fluids is also a key symptom. Now, regarding the hunger – you mentioned it persists even after meals. Can you describe the types of meals you've been eating?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I try to eat a balanced diet, if that makes sense. I usually have porridge for breakfast, a sandwich or some soup for lunch, and then something like chicken and vegetables for dinner. Nothing too extravagant. Honestly, even after a fairly substantial meal, maybe an hour or so later I’m feeling… peckish again. It’s quite irritating, actually. I’ve also found myself craving… sweeter things, if that's relevant. Biscuits, fruit… things like that.
DOCTOR: That is relevant, Mr. Erxleben. Increased appetite alongside a craving for sweets can be telling. To get a broader picture, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Nothing major, anyway. I had my appendix removed when I was a boy, a very long time ago, but that was it. No diabetes, no heart problems, no… nothing. I’ve always been relatively healthy, to be honest. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a good few years, actually. Mostly just for the yearly check-ups. I’ve always prided myself on good health, which is why this is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Erxleben. It is unsettling when something changes unexpectedly, especially when you've been in good health. And thank you for letting me know about the appendectomy. That’s useful information. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had… well, she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart, later in life. Nothing particularly… alarming when I was young, though. I wouldn't say there’s a strong history of anything major. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had arthritis, quite badly, but that’s about it, I think. Honestly, it’s not a family known for its ill-health, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Erxleben. High blood pressure and heart trouble are worth noting. Now, before we move on, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don't take any medication, Doctor. Never have. I pride myself on avoiding pills if I can. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, perhaps, but that’s it. And not even regularly. I really don't like taking anything unless it's absolutely necessary. It’s one of the reasons I’m a bit concerned about all of this. I haven’t changed anything in my routine.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Erxleben. It helps to rule things out. Alright. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have. Never will. It’s a terrible habit. My father smoked for a while, but he gave it up years ago. It’s quite a relief, actually, to not have that hanging over me. I’ve always been careful about my health, as I’ve mentioned.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Well, I enjoy a pint of beer with my dinner occasionally, perhaps on a Friday or a Saturday. Nothing excessive, mind you. A pint, maybe two, at most. I wouldn't say I drink regularly, certainly not every day. It's more of a… social thing, if you understand me. And I certainly wouldn’t describe myself as a heavy drinker. I certainly don't drink to excess.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Erxleben. Occasional social drinking is unlikely to be a contributing factor. Now, to complete the picture, could you tell me about your work and general activity level?
PATIENT: Right. I work at the docks, as a shipping, receiving, and inventory clerk. It's… not particularly strenuous work, mostly paperwork and checking deliveries, but it does involve being on my feet for a good portion of the day. It’s a fairly demanding job mentally, if not physically. As for activity… I try to walk when I can, but it's difficult with the hours I work. I don't have much time for hobbies, to be frank. Just the usual, really. Watching television, reading… nothing too exciting. I suppose I could do with being more active, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Erxleben. That gives me a good overview of your lifestyle. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, are you experiencing any other symptoms – anything at all – that we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not really. I wouldn't say so. I haven't noticed any weight loss, no blurred vision, no… no frequent infections. Just the thirst and the hunger. And maybe… a little bit more tired than usual, now that you mention it. But I put that down to the long hours at work. No, nothing major. Those are the only things. It's just… unsettling, as I've said. This all feels rather out of the blue. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Erxleben. The combination of increased thirst, hunger, and fatigue is worth investigating. Alright. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
