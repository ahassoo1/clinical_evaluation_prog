DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Vanochten. Well, to be frank, my wife insisted. She worries too much, always has. But, uh, she wants me to get checked for… you know… the HIV. I haven’t been doing anything, honestly, but she’s been reading things online, and now I have to come here. It’s a bit ridiculous, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. It’s good your wife is proactive about your health, even if it feels unnecessary right now. It’s always best to rule things out, and we can certainly do that. Just to be clear, is there anything specific that prompted her concern?
PATIENT: Specific? No, not really. It’s just… she saw a documentary, I think. About people getting it. And she’s decided I need to be tested, just in case. Honestly, it's a waste of everyone’s time. I mean, I’ve been married to the same woman for ten years, and before that… well, let's just say I wasn’t exactly a wild one. It's probably just her nerves, she’s been a bit stressed with her job.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you being open with me. Even without specific risk factors, testing can provide peace of mind, and it's a fairly routine procedure. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions? No, never. Not even as a kid. I've always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I’ve never needed a lot of medical attention, thankfully. I eat my vegetables, I get enough sleep… my wife makes sure of that, at least.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just the occasional paracetamol for a headache, but that's it. I try to avoid taking anything if I can, really. My wife gets all those herbal remedies, but I don't really trust those things. Give me a good night's sleep and a bit of fresh air and I’m right as rain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, no transfusions. And you have no known allergies, correct?
PATIENT: Right, no allergies. Not to anything. I eat all sorts of things. My wife likes to try new cuisines, so I've had a bit of everything over the years. Spicy food, nuts, shellfish… nothing bothers me. I'm a pretty robust guy, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. Given your history – or rather, the lack of any specific risk factors – and your good overall health, I understand your wife’s concern might be stemming from anxiety. However, we will proceed with the HIV test as requested, to provide reassurance. It involves a simple blood draw. Before we do that, are you comfortable discussing your sexual history at all?
PATIENT: Now see, this is exactly what I was worried about. I mean, really? After all I've told you? It’s just a routine check, isn’t it? My wife’s being silly, and now you're asking me about… that. Look, I’ve been married for ten years, faithfully. What more do you need to know? This is getting a bit ridiculous, frankly. I'm not here to talk about my private life.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Belan, and I apologize if I've upset you. You are absolutely right to set boundaries. I asked only to ensure we have the most complete picture for your health, and I respect your decision not to disclose that information. We can proceed with the test based on the information you have provided. It's important to understand, however, that a negative result, in this situation, doesn’t entirely eliminate the possibility of exposure, as it's been a while since any potential risk. But it’s a good starting point. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes, it makes sense. Look, just do the test and tell me it's negative so I can go home and tell my wife she was wasting everyone's time. I don't understand why you need to keep explaining things. I just want this over with. Honestly, doctors these days… always overcomplicating everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. I'll order the HIV test now. It will involve a small blood sample taken by our phlebotomist just down the hall. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, if you experience any flu-like symptoms – fever, fatigue, rash – please contact us immediately. Now, before we proceed with the blood draw, is there anything else at all you’d like to discuss or any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just get it done. I've got things to do, you know. And please, just tell my wife it’s negative. She'll be thrilled, and then maybe she’ll stop worrying about every little thing. Honestly, she reads too many articles online.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. I'll have the phlebotomist come in and draw your blood. And I'll make a note to communicate the results clearly to both you and your wife. Here’s a requisition form for the lab. Please take this down the hall to the lab technician, and they'll get started right away. It shouldn’t take long. Do you have any difficulty with walking, or do you require assistance getting to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I'm fine. Perfectly capable of walking. Honestly, you’re treating me like I’m an old man. I just need to get this done and go home. Thank you. Or, no, actually, thank my wife for insisting on this whole ordeal.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. If you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. Please don't hesitate to let the reception desk know if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day. .
