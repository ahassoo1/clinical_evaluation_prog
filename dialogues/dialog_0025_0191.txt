DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I asked to come in about getting tested for HIV. It's… a personal matter, of course, but I wanted to be sure.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “personal matters” are often the most important ones. It’s good you’re being proactive. And it's entirely responsible of you to want to know your status. Now, can you tell me a bit more about why you’re concerned about HIV?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it's not that I've done anything… specifically. My husband and I… we've been together a very long time. But lately, I've just been… reading things. Online, you know? About it. And it made me think, perhaps we should just check. For peace of mind, really. It’s been a while since either of us has been tested for anything, and… well, you never know, do you?
DOCTOR: “Reading things online.” Right. That always leads to unnecessary worry. While it’s good to be informed, the internet isn’t exactly a reliable source for medical advice. It's good you're thinking about this, even if it's sparked by something less than concrete. So, just to be clear, you’re requesting testing as a precaution, even though you have no specific concerns about exposure?
PATIENT: Precisely, Doctor. That's it exactly. No particular incident, no… risky behaviour, if you will. Just a growing feeling that it’s a sensible thing to do. A check-up, really. And my husband… I think he would be relieved to know we've both done it. For both our sakes.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. A preventative measure. Sensible, if a little…hypochondriacal, frankly. But better safe than sorry, I suppose. Now, let's go over a little bit of your medical history, just to be thorough. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I’ve always been… quite careful, and my husband is the same. We haven't had many partners in our lives, so to speak. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, things like that, but nothing serious. No STIs, no major health problems. Just getting a bit creaky in the joints these days, if you must know.
DOCTOR: “Creaky in the joints.” Yes, well, that comes with age, Ms. Shaub. I’m more concerned with things that might impact your immune system, not…achiness. Have you ever had a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never a transfusion. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. I’ve had all my vaccinations, I believe – tetanus, things like that. My husband keeps track of those things, he's very organised. Honestly, I haven’t been in a hospital for anything serious in… well, decades, I suppose. A broken arm when I was a child, and when I had my son, of course. But nothing since.
DOCTOR: Alright. No transfusions, standard vaccinations… And just to be absolutely clear, you've been with your husband the entire time, and you have no concerns about his past medical history impacting this?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Entirely. We’ve been married for… oh, goodness, almost forty years now. We spoke about this at length, and he is happy to be tested as well, of course. He has no reason to believe he’s been exposed to anything. We were both very careful when we were younger, and… we’ve been exclusive for a very long time. He’s quite adamant about it, actually.
DOCTOR: Right. Forty years of marital fidelity. That simplifies things, I suppose. Now, let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, Doctor. It's been creeping up a bit lately, as you get older, you know? Nothing major. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And sometimes, if my arthritis is particularly bad, I take some over-the-counter ibuprofen. That's all. Really.
DOCTOR: And no allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to be quite prone to hay fever as a child, but that's cleared up with age. Honestly, I'm rather robust, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies, standard blood pressure medication...Now, I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline, Ms. Shaub. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes...standard procedure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I understand. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement entirely.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just lie down, please. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are regular… no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear… but I do notice some mild wheezing. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath or coughing recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. No coughing, no breathlessness. The wheezing… that’s probably just the arthritis acting up, I expect. It sometimes affects my chest, makes everything feel a bit tight. It comes and goes. Nothing to be alarmed about, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Hmm. These lymph nodes are slightly enlarged… Not dramatically, but noticeable. And you said you experience some chest tightness… I’m going to need to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel, just to rule out anything serious. And, of course, we'll proceed with the HIV test. I also want to check your Vitamin D levels, given the joint pain. It's a sensible precaution.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Enlarged lymph nodes… Is that something to be worried about? Perhaps it's just a reaction to the arthritis medication? I do hope it’s nothing serious. I'm not fond of tests, if I'm honest. But if you think it’s necessary, of course, I'll comply. When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: It could be a reaction to the medication, Ms. Shaub, but we need to rule out other possibilities. It’s standard procedure. Honestly, you worry too much. The blood work should be back in about a week. I'll have the nurse call you with the results. In the meantime, try to relax. And I’d like to see your husband scheduled for testing as well. We’ll need to get that arranged. Let me see… what’s his name again?
PATIENT: His name is Charles, Doctor. Charles SHAUB. He’s… well, he’s a retired accountant. Very meticulous. He'll be relieved to hear you want to test him as well. He's always been concerned about keeping up with things. And thank you, Doctor. For being so thorough. Even if I do worry too much. Is there anything else I need to do? Or any precautions I should take while we wait for the results?
DOCTOR: Charles Shaub. Alright. I'll have the nurse schedule him as well. And no, there are no precautions you need to take. Just continue with your normal routine. And please try not to spend too much time online researching potential illnesses. It only leads to unnecessary anxiety. I’ll have the nurse give you the lab requisition forms and instructions before you leave. We’ll discuss the results when they come back. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate your thoroughness, and I'll try my best to stay off the internet. And please, thank your nurse for me. She sounds very efficient. I’ll see you when the results are in.
DOCTOR: Alright. Goodbye, Ms. Shaub.
