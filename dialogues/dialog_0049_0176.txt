DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re still going. It’s really getting on my nerves, to be honest. It’s been over 48 hours now, I think.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, alright. More than 48 hours… that is a bit unusual. Have you tried anything to get rid of them already?
PATIENT: Oh, you name it, Doctor. Holding my breath, drinking water upside down… my son told me to try a spoonful of sugar, that one didn't work either. I even tried scaring myself, which was silly, really! Nothing seems to touch them. They just keep coming. It's quite exhausting, actually.
DOCTOR: Yes, those are the typical…methods. And you said they started a couple of days ago?
PATIENT: Yes, it was Monday, I believe. August first. I was at work, setting up for the evening show… and they just started. Nothing special happened, no big shock or anything. Just… started. I run the entertainment at “The Oasis Club”, you know, downtown? Lots of little performances, singers, belly dancers… that sort of thing. Keeps me busy, but these hiccups are making it hard to talk to the performers, and even harder to enjoy my tea. It’s a small thing, maybe, but it’s really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Entertainment… alright. And you haven't experienced any other symptoms with the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the hiccups. No heartburn, no stomach pain, nothing like that. I’m eating normally, drinking my usual amount of tea… well, trying to, anyway. It's hard to drink tea with hiccups! I haven't felt feverish or anything either. I’m just… hiccuping. It's just… incredibly persistent. It’s making me anxious, to be honest, worrying about why they won’t stop.
DOCTOR: Anxiety can certainly contribute… but we need to rule things out. Do you have any history of… let’s see… esophageal issues?
PATIENT: Esophageal issues? Hmm… not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve always had a bit of indigestion sometimes, but nothing serious. I mean, I enjoy my food, and sometimes spicy food gets to me a little, but it’s never been anything I’ve needed to see a doctor about. My mother had some trouble with acid reflux when she got older, but I haven’t had anything like that. Just the usual heartburn now and then, easily fixed with some antacids. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, not much at all, Doctor. Just a little something for my blood pressure, losartan, 50 milligrams, once a day. And occasionally some ibuprofen for a headache, but that's it. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea for most things, really. It’s usually enough, but definitely not helping with these hiccups. I don’t take anything regularly for indigestion or heartburn. It’s usually just occasional, so I haven’t needed to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick listen to your chest and abdomen, just to be thorough. Then we can discuss some possibilities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. I'm just hoping we can figure out what’s causing this, and get it stopped. It’s really wearing me down, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. And another… Okay. Now I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little bit, actually. Just on this side, Doctor, here. Not terribly painful, but… noticeable. It’s not constant, it’s only when you press on it. It feels… a bit bruised, maybe? Not like an injury, but… sensitive. It’s probably nothing, but I thought I should mention it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this tenderness been present for long, or did it appear around the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I think it started the same day, Doctor. Or maybe the day after. I was so focused on the hiccups, I didn’t really pay attention to anything else. I just noticed it this morning when I was getting dressed, it felt a little sore when my clothes touched it. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It feels like something is… a bit swollen maybe? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. The X-ray will help us rule out any issues with your lungs, and the blood work will give us a better overview of your overall health, and potentially identify any inflammation. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to be thorough. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best, I’m happy to do. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and get these hiccups to stop! Where do I go for the X-ray and blood work? And will you call me with the results, or should I schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's a requisition for the X-ray and blood work. You can get both done at the lab just across the street – they take walk-ins. The results should be back within 48 hours. My assistant will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. If the hiccups become severely debilitating, or you experience any difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's very helpful. No, I don't think I do, not at the moment. You've explained everything very clearly. I'll go across the street now and get it done. Hopefully we'll have some answers soon. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate it very much.
