DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is Quicksey, yes? My daughter, she make appointment for me. For the… the old people place. She want make sure I am okay for go there.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Abdollahi, Quicksey is correct. And it's very thoughtful of your daughter to arrange this assessment to ensure you're prepared for the assisted living facility. That’s exactly what we're here for – to make sure you’re healthy and comfortable transitioning. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you and your daughter are considering assisted living at this time?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I am getting old, you know? It is hard to do things now. Cooking… cleaning… the house is too big for just me and my husband. He… he is not so good anymore either. My daughter, she worry a lot. She say it is better place for us, more help. I don't… I don't know. I like my house.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s very common to feel apprehensive about such a big change, even when it’s a practical decision. It's good that your daughter is involved and supportive. We want to make sure this is the right fit for both you and your husband, and that you're both as comfortable and safe as possible. Let’s talk a little bit about your current health. Can you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have… the pressure, the doctor say. High pressure. I take the pills for that. And… my knees. They hurt a lot when it is cold. The doctor give me something for that too. I forget the name. Is… white pill, I think. And sometimes… my tummy, it not happy. But not all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and some knee pain, and occasional stomach upset. That gives us a good starting point. Can you recall what the doctor told you about your blood pressure diagnosis?
PATIENT: Oh… the doctor say… too much blood pushing. Is not good for the heart, he say. I need to be careful. That is why I take the pill. Every morning. And… he say not too much salt. I try, but I like salt! Is hard.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult to change habits. And you're right to be mindful of your salt intake with high blood pressure. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I don't remember. Is in the orange bottle. My daughter, she fill it. She know everything. I just… take it. I am sorry. My brain… it slow sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s very common to forget medication names, especially when you have a lot on your mind. We can easily look it up in your records. Ah, here we are. It looks like you’re taking Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once daily. Is that correct—one pill every morning?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor! One pill. Every morning. With the water. You are good. My brain… is working a little now, see? Lisinopril… yes. That is the name. Thank you. Is good you remember for me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s my pleasure. Now, you mentioned some knee pain. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It hurts… when I walk too much. And when it is cold, like winter. Or when it is going to rain. Sometimes it is just… achy. I use the cream my daughter buy. It smells nice, like flowers, but it don't help much. I try not to walk too much. My husband, he help me. He slow too, now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s aggravated by walking and cold weather, and the cream provides minimal relief. Do you experience any swelling or redness in your knees along with the pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No red. No big swelling. Just… hurt. Like old bones. Sometimes it stiff, too. In the morning, it hard to move. I need to… wiggle them. And then it get better, a little. But walking… is always hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, no swelling or redness, just pain and stiffness, particularly in the morning and with walking. Now, let’s talk about your stomach issues. You mentioned it's not constant. Can you describe what that discomfort feels like when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… is like… bubble. In my tummy. And sometimes… I feel sick. Not throw up sick, but… almost. It happen after I eat, sometimes. I try to eat small plates. My daughter say maybe I eat too fast. Is hard to remember to slow down, you know? I like my food! Is good food.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Abdollahi. It sounds like you might be experiencing some indigestion or perhaps some sensitivity after eating. So, it's more of a feeling of fullness or discomfort, and sometimes nausea?
PATIENT: Yes! Discomfort. And… bubble. And sometimes… feel like I need to… you know… go to the bathroom. Is not bad, but I need to go quick. Sorry, Doctor. Is old lady things.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Abdollahi. These are important things to discuss. It sounds like you could be experiencing some increased urgency with bowel movements as well. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me about any major medical conditions you’ve had in the past – things like heart problems, diabetes, or any surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Let me think… My husband, he had the heart problem. I… I think I had the gallstones, many years ago. The doctor take them out. Long time ago. And… I had the baby! Two babies. That is surgery, yes? But… I don't remember much else. Is hard to remember so far back. I am old, Doctor. Very old.
DOCTOR: You're not very old, Ms. Abdollahi! And it's perfectly normal to have trouble remembering things from a long time ago. So, you had your gallbladder removed many years ago and you've had two children. That’s helpful to know. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mama, she have the pressure too. Like me. And… my brother, he have the sugar sickness. The diabetes, yes? My husband’s mama, she have the… the bad sickness. Cancer, my daughter say. She not here now. Long time ago. Is sad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and cancer. That gives us a good starting point. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your current medications. Besides the Lisinopril for your blood pressure, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take the white pill for the knees. I forget the name! And… sometimes I take the thing for the tummy. When it is bad. Is… pink pill, I think. And I take the vitamin… the one with the orange juice. Every morning with breakfast. My daughter, she give me everything. Is good daughter.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a good support system with your daughter! So, you take Lisinopril, a white pill for your knees, a pink pill for your stomach when needed, and a vitamin with breakfast. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I eat everything. My mama, she make good food. Never had a bad reaction. Sometimes… a little itchy from the bugs, but not from food or pills. No, I think I am okay.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Abdollahi. No known allergies. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What is that? Oh… you mean… what I do? I stay at home mostly. My husband, he stay home too. We watch the TV. We eat. We sleep. Sometimes my daughter come visit. Is quiet life. Not much walking anymore. I used to like to dance, long time ago, but not now. My knees… they not good for dancing.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a peaceful life, Ms. Abdollahi. It's important to enjoy what you can. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor! No smoking. No drinking. No… what you say? Recreation things? No, never. I am good lady. My mama, she teach me to be good. Is not good for the body. No, I never do those things.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Abdollahi. Very good. Now, before we do a quick exam, I just want to ask about any recent changes you've noticed in your health—anything at all—like changes in your weight, appetite, sleep patterns, or mood?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think I am a little more tired now. And sometimes… I forget things. Like… where I put my glasses. Or what I was saying. My daughter say I am getting old, and that is normal. I eat… about the same. Maybe a little less now. And I sleep… okay. Sometimes I wake up in the night, but not too much. No big changes, I think. Just… old lady things.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Abdollahi. Some changes are normal as we get older. It's good that you're aware of these things. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll just check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment to check your reflexes and balance. It won't take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is okay. Do what you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle. My old bones… they not so strong anymore.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Abdollahi. I will be very gentle. Alright, let's start by checking your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/82. Your heart sounds regular, but there’s a slight murmur – a common finding in older adults. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am breathing. Deep breath… like this? Is okay. Murmur… is that bad? My husband, he have murmur too.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. And no, a murmur isn't always bad. Many people have them without any problems. It just means there's a slight whooshing sound when your heart beats, and often it’s harmless. Since your husband has one as well, that’s likely a familial trait. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back, if you don’t mind. Your abdomen is soft. No tenderness or masses. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is also common with age. And finally, I'm going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me, if you're able. This is to assess your balance.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can stand. Oh… a little dizzy. Slowly… slowly… Is okay. But I need to hold onto something. My legs… they not so strong anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s good you recognized the dizziness and held onto something. It’s very common to feel a little unsteady when standing up quickly, especially with some balance issues. Alright, that concludes the quick exam. Everything seems generally stable, but we have a few things to address. You have slightly elevated blood pressure, some diminished reflexes, and some mild balance issues. The dizziness warrants a little further investigation. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Dizziness… is that why I fall sometimes? I fall last month, and my daughter, she worry a lot. She say I need to be careful. Is the dizziness why? And… the balance, is that why I walk slow? Is it getting worse? I don’t want to fall anymore.
DOCTOR: Those are very important questions, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s possible the dizziness and balance issues contributed to your fall last month. Falls can be caused by many things, and we need to figure out what's going on with you specifically. Your slow walking is also likely related to the balance issues and diminished reflexes. It's good you're being proactive about this, and we want to prevent further falls. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the dizziness. I also recommend a referral to a physical therapist for a comprehensive balance assessment and exercises to improve your strength and stability. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is good. Blood tests… and the… the physical person? To help me walk better? Yes, please. I want to be strong again. And I don’t want to fall anymore. My daughter… she will be happy. Is good you listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. We’re here to help, and it's good you're taking these steps. Okay, I'm ordering the blood tests now. They'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and thyroid levels. We'll also get a referral to a physical therapist. I'll have the paperwork ready for you to take with you today. Now, while we wait for the test results, I recommend you use a walker or cane for support, especially when you're walking outside. Make sure your home is well-lit and free of clutter to prevent trips and falls. And please let your daughter know about the referral and the blood tests. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You are very kind. And… I am glad you remember my name. My brain… sometimes forget things. But you are good. Thank you for everything. I trust you to help me be strong again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. And you're right, sometimes remembering things can be a challenge. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. We’ll get these tests done and get you scheduled with the physical therapist as soon as possible. Here’s the paperwork for the blood tests and the physical therapy referral. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns when you go for the tests or when you schedule the appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. Thank you again. You are very kind. I will see you when I get the results. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I’ll see you when your results are back. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions in the meantime. Have a good day, and be careful! .
