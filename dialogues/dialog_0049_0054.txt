DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, good morning, Doctor. Cough, yeah. Been coughing... a long time now. And tired, also. Very tired. Feels like... always got a cold in my head, you know? Happens a lot.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A long time now, you say?
PATIENT: Ugh... I don't really know how long. Months, I think? Maybe more. It comes and goes, but it always comes back. Like... every few weeks, maybe? It’s just... annoying, mostly. And makes me sleepy.
DOCTOR: And when you say “comes back,” is it the same cough each time, or does it change at all?
PATIENT: Um... I think... same kind. Lots of... phlegm. You know? Like something stuck in my throat. Sometimes more, sometimes less. And my head feels full, like pressure. Sorry, it's hard to explain. I don’t remember much about each time, really. They all kinda blend together.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats with these episodes?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes. Not high, I think. Just feel warm. Chills… maybe a little? Hard to say. I usually just feel tired and want to sleep. No… no night sweats, I don't think so. My wife, she would tell me if I was sweating a lot, yeah? She usually knows.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything made it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… Um… dust, maybe? When I work, lots of dust from the tires. And… when it’s cold. Cold weather makes it bad. Also, sometimes when I bend down, it feels tighter in my chest. But… mostly it just is. Doesn’t seem to matter much what I do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no smoke. Never. My wife doesn't like it. Bad for health, she says. I listen to her. I drink... sometimes. Not much. Just a beer with dinner, maybe.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… I don’t think so. Sometimes my nose gets itchy, but I thought that was just the dust. I don’t get… big reactions, you know? Like swelling or trouble breathing. Just… itchy nose sometimes. Maybe dust is allergy? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Huh… medical history… I… I don’t really go to the doctor much. When I was a kid, maybe. But I can’t remember what for. I had the flu, I think, a few times. Never anything… serious. Bronchitis… pneumonia… no, I don’t think so. My wife, she takes me when I really need to go. She remembers these things better. She says I need to take more care of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No… I don’t think so. No surgeries. Nothing cut open. Maybe… maybe when I was a baby? But I don’t remember. Definitely nothing when I was older. Just… normal things. Cuts and scrapes when I was working, but nothing big. This cough is the biggest problem I’ve ever had, really.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she had… problems with her lungs when she got old. She coughed a lot, like me. But… I don’t know what it was. My father was healthy, I think. My wife's family… I don’t know them very well. She says her grandfather had something with his heart, but… that’s all I remember. I don't ask about it much. It makes her sad, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to confirm, you said you work with tires?
PATIENT: Yeah, tires. Tire repair, changing tires... all that. Been doing it… a long time now. It’s dusty work. Lots of bending and lifting. Sometimes my back hurts, but… that’s another thing. This cough is just… always there. It's tiring, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your lungs now. Could you please take a deep breath in, and then out, for me?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Like this? Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, take another deep breath... and out... Good. I'm hearing some wheezing in your lungs, and some crackles as well. Your breathing sounds a bit labored. It sounds like there's some congestion. I'd also like to check your oxygen saturation. Let me just get a reading here… 92%. That's a little on the low side. Do you ever feel short of breath?
PATIENT: Short of breath… Not all the time. But… sometimes, yeah. When I walk up hills, maybe. Or… when I’m really tired. It feels like I can’t get enough air. But I just slow down, and it’s okay. 92? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s not critically low, but it's lower than ideal. Given your history and what I'm hearing, I suspect you may have some underlying bronchitis, possibly with some asthma component. The wheezing supports that. The dust exposure at work is likely exacerbating things. I'd like to order a chest x-ray to rule out any pneumonia or other more serious issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… Is it… dangerous? I don’t like hospitals. But… if you think it’s important, Doctor, I’ll do it. I just want to feel better, you know? This cough is… tiring. What will it show?
DOCTOR: No, an X-ray is very safe. It's just a quick image of your lungs. It will help me to see if there's any infection, fluid build-up, or other problems that could be causing your symptoms. I'm also going to order a basic blood test to check your white blood cell count, which can also indicate infection. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It’s a bronchodilator, called albuterol. Would you be able to get that filled today?
PATIENT: Albuterol… inhaler… Okay, I think so. There’s a pharmacy near my house. Will the inhaler help with the cough? And the tiredness? I really hope it helps. I need to work, you know? What about the dust? Should I… stop working? That’s… difficult.
DOCTOR: The inhaler should help to ease your breathing and reduce the wheezing, which may help with the cough. However, it won't address the underlying cause. The tiredness is likely related to the difficulty breathing and the ongoing inflammation. As for the dust, it’s ideally best to minimize your exposure as much as possible. I can write a note for your employer recommending a dust mask and, if feasible, improved ventilation. We’ll see what the x-ray and blood tests show, and we can adjust the plan from there. We might also consider a referral to a pulmonologist, a lung specialist, for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Pulmonologist… that sounds serious. Dust mask… okay, I can try that. My boss… he’s usually okay with things. Um… will the inhaler make me sleepy? I need to be alert at work. And… how long will it take to feel better? I just want to get back to normal. This is all a bit much. Maybe… .
