DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s these… spells, I suppose you’d call them. I get confused. Not all the time, mind you. But it’s happening more often, and my wife, she worries. She says I ask the same questions twice, sometimes in the same minute! It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: "Spells," you say. Alright. And how long has this been going on, these… episodes of confusion?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s been… well, probably six months now. Maybe a little longer. It started subtly, you know? Forgetting where I put my tools, things like that. A tile setter forgets things sometimes, it’s a messy job. But it’s gotten worse. I’ll be in the middle of laying a floor and… just blank. Like a piece of the day is missing. Not a whole day, just… bits. And then I ask my son where I left my level, and he tells me I just had it in my hand. It’s… irritating, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Irritating, yes. And are these… blank spells accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… not really. No dizziness, no headaches. Sometimes, I feel… a bit shaky afterwards, but that could just be from being tired, you know? I work hard. Long days. I wouldn’t say it’s anything to write home about. Just… confused. And then a bit flustered when I realize I've asked something silly. My wife says I get a little… grumpy. But she’s always saying something.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Medical history… well, nothing much. I've always been a strong man. Worked with my hands my whole life. Had a bit of a bad back a few years back – the tile work, you know? Saw a chiropractor for that. That’s about it, really. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. I take a daily aspirin, Doctor told me to a while back, just in case. And my wife makes me take vitamins, if that counts.
DOCTOR: Aspirin, daily. Vitamins. Alright. Any surgeries or hospital stays I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Never broken a bone, never needed stitches, nothing. I've been lucky, I suppose. Always careful with my tools. Though I did have a bad fall once, when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree. But that was in Cambodia, a long time ago. Didn't even go to a doctor for it, just patched myself up. A little scrape, that's all.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my wife, of course. We have three sons. All grown up now, with families of their own. My father… he died when I was still young, from some kind of fever. Mother lived a long life, passed away about ten years ago. She was a strong woman, too. No one in my family… well, no one has had these kinds of problems. No one confused like this. It’s… concerning, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you drink alcohol, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: A little. Sometimes, with dinner. A glass of wine, maybe. Or a beer when I’m watching the football game with my sons. Nothing excessive. I don’t sit around drinking all day, if that’s what you’re asking. Never have.
DOCTOR: Minimal alcohol. And do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife wouldn't allow it, and frankly, I don’t see the point. Bad for you, plain and simple. Always told my sons the same thing. They listen, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Lason, given your age and these… episodes, we’ll need to rule out a few things. I’d like to do a basic physical exam, and then I'm going to order some blood work. Just to check your thyroid, your blood sugar, and some other things. It's probably nothing, but it's best to be thorough. Now, if you’ll just follow me over to the examination table…
PATIENT: Blood work? Seems a bit much, doesn't it? For a little confusion? I'm a perfectly healthy man, as I’ve told you. But… alright. If you insist. Just don't expect to find anything. Following you is fine. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I have a floor to finish.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Lason. It's better to be safe than sorry. Now, if you could just sit here… First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath. And tell me if you have any pain anywhere.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Listening to my heart. Always healthy, as I said. No pain anywhere, really. Maybe a little ache in my back sometimes, but that’s just the work. Been doing this for fifty years, you know. It's to be expected. There. Deep breath.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Any history of falls recently, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Falls? No, none. Not recently, not ever, as I’ve said. I'm a careful man, Doctor. I've always been. I don't go stumbling around. This is getting a bit ridiculous, isn't it? A few moments of confusion and now I'm being checked for falls?
DOCTOR: It’s a necessary part of the evaluation, Mr. Lason. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. And can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Relaxed. Always relaxed. Today’s date…? Hmm. Let me think… It's… August the second. 2025, isn’t it? Yes, August the second. I think. My wife always keeps track of these things, I usually don’t bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me what city we’re in?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's… this city! The one with… the buildings. It's… …I always let my wife drive, I don't pay attention to where we are! Honestly, this is… I know it’s a city, a big one!
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your frustration, but it’s important you answer these questions truthfully. It’s not about testing your general knowledge, it’s about assessing your cognitive function. Given your reported confusion and difficulty recalling basic information, I’m concerned about possible early signs of dementia. I am going to refer you to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. And I still want to proceed with the blood work. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Dementia?! Now you’re just being absurd! I have a few moments of confusion, a little forgetfulness, and suddenly I have… dementia?! I’ve worked hard my entire life, kept my mind sharp, and you’re telling me this? A neurologist?! No. Absolutely not. This is ridiculous. I came here for a simple check-up, not to be insulted and sent off to… to specialists! I think I’ll get a second opinion. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, please sit down. I am obligated to investigate your symptoms thoroughly. While it may not be dementia, dismissing your confusion without proper evaluation is irresponsible. I understand your frustration, but my priority is your health. The blood work is a simple procedure, and the neurologist can provide a more definitive assessment. I am providing you with a referral, but I strongly advise you to follow through with it. This is for Dr. Emily Carter, she’s an excellent neurologist. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. My nurse will provide you with the lab requisition form. .
PATIENT: Fine! Fine! But don't expect me to be grateful. This is a complete waste of my time, and I still think you're jumping to conclusions. Doctors these days… always looking for something wrong. .
