DOCTOR: Good morning, Jeannemarie. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been coughing up… some blood. It scared me a little, so I thought I should come get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay. Coughing up blood is certainly something we want to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it’s not a lot of blood, Doctor. More like… streaks, really. In my spit. It happened a couple of times this week. Not every cough, just… sometimes. I don’t… I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Jeannemarie. Streaks of blood are still something we need to look into. And when did you first notice this happening this week?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. I was brushing my teeth and… there it was. Then again on Thursday, but much, much less. I haven’t seen any today, but I was still worried. Is it… is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good you came in to get it checked. There are several things that can cause blood in the sputum – some are more concerning than others, and it's important to rule those out. Have you been having any other symptoms along with the coughing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I have been a little more tired than usual, I think. But it is very hot lately, so I thought it was just the weather. No fever, no chest pain… and my breathing feels okay. I do have a bit of a cough, of course, but that is not new. It is just… a little worse. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and a slightly worse cough… good to know. And have you noticed any weight loss recently, Jeannemarie?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes feel the same. I… I eat fairly well, even if I don’t feel like it sometimes. My husband… he always made sure I ate enough. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I… I had pneumonia a long time ago, when I was in my twenties. But I recovered fully. And I have high blood pressure, but it is controlled with medication. Other than that… nothing major, I don’t think. My husband… he was the one who always remembered things like that. He passed away last year, so… it’s been a little difficult to keep track of everything. I apologize.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jeannemarie. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult, and it’s perfectly alright that things are a bit hazy right now. Do you remember what medication you are taking for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It is… Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said my levels were low. I think that is everything. Do you need to know anything else about my medicine? I have it at home if you need the bottle.
DOCTOR: No, that's very helpful, thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not have any allergies. I have never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. My husband always said I was very lucky that way. He used to joke that I could eat anything! I… I miss his jokes. I apologize, I am getting a little emotional.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jeannemarie. It’s perfectly natural to feel emotional, especially given your recent loss. Let’s get back to your health. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, I have never smoked. My husband… he tried it once, a long time ago, but he didn’t like it. He always said it smelled terrible. I have always avoided it. I think it is very bad for your health.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I… I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, when my husband was still here. But I haven’t really been drinking much since he passed. Maybe one glass a month, if that. I don't really enjoy it without him, to be honest. It just reminds me… I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Jeannemarie. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart, and feel your lymph nodes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I want to know what is happening, so I am happy to do whatever you need. I just hope it is not anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please sit back and take some deep breaths for me, that would be great. First, I'm going to listen to your lungs, both front and back. Take a nice, deep breath… and exhale slowly. Again, please. Okay, everything sounds clear so far, but I do hear some mild wheezing on both sides. Now I'm going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Okay. I am breathing. Is that okay? The wheezing… is that bad, Doctor? I am a little worried now. I didn’t feel anything when I was breathing before, but if you hear something…
DOCTOR: It’s good you're letting me know your concerns. Your heart sounds regular, Jeannemarie. The wheezing is mild, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we’ll investigate further. Now I’m just going to feel your lymph nodes. These are glands in your neck that can sometimes swell if there’s an infection. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That does not hurt. I don't feel anything unusual. They feel… normal, I think. I just want to get this figured out, so I can stop worrying. It's been a stressful year.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Everything feels normal there. Now, I’d like to get a chest X-ray just to get a better look at your lungs. It will help us rule out any potential problems. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. An X-ray sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what is happening. Is it a lot of radiation? I have heard things…
DOCTOR: The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very low, Jeannemarie. It’s comparable to the amount of natural background radiation you’re exposed to over a few days. It’s a very safe and helpful test. I’ll send you down to the radiology department. They’ll take a few images, and then a radiologist will review them. Once I have the results, we can discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience. So, I just go to the radiology department now? Is it far?
DOCTOR: Alright. Yes, just head down the hallway to the radiology department. It’s just a short walk, and they’ll be expecting you. They'll have your order. Once you’ve had the X-ray, they’ll let me know the results immediately. I will be right here in my office. If you have any questions or feel unwell while you’re waiting, please don’t hesitate to let the nurses know. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and for explaining everything so well. I feel a little better knowing we are getting to the bottom of it. I will go to radiology now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns. I’ll be waiting for the results.
