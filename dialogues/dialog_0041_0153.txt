DOCTOR: Hi Brando, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. It's… something about a check-up? For… performing, I think? Honestly, the details are a little fuzzy. They just sent me over. I’m Brando Krahn, by the way.
DOCTOR: Right, Brando Krahn. Okay, that's perfectly alright. Sometimes those referrals don't come with all the details. A check-up… performing, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I… well, I work at the theater. Ushers, mostly. Sometimes tickets. Lobby stuff. It's not a glamorous life, Doctor. I’ve been doing it a long time, though. A very long time. Do you… need to know what show? I can’t quite remember which one they wanted me cleared for.
DOCTOR: No need to stress about the show specifically right now, Brando. It sounds like it’s a general check-up to make sure you're physically able to continue your work at the theater, which is wonderful. Just to get a better idea of things, have you been feeling any pain or discomfort lately?
PATIENT: Pain…? Not really, no. A little stiff sometimes, getting up in the morning. Old age, you know? But nothing… worrying. Just the usual aches and pains. I’m a tall man, and that can’t be good for the joints, I suppose. It hasn't stopped me yet.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Brando. Stiffness is common as we get older, and being taller can certainly put extra strain on your body. Alright. Just to be thorough, let’s do a quick run-through of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Hmm. That’s a tough one. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course, but… nothing major, I don’t think. Maybe high blood pressure once? A long time ago. My ex-wife was always fussing over that. Nothing they ever really did anything about, as I recall. I’m really not good with remembering things like that. It was a while ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure is good to note, even if it wasn’t actively treated. And it’s alright if you don't remember all the details, we can work with what you do recall. Do you know if you’ve had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, I believe. That’s… probably it. And maybe a mole removed once? On my back, I think. But that was years and years ago. Very minor. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve lived a fairly quiet life. No major incidents.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsils and a mole removal - noted. And that’s good to know you've had a fairly quiet life. How about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Well, I was divorced a long time ago. No children. My parents… they’re both gone now. I don’t really have any close family left. It's just me, mostly. Did they want to know about family history of illnesses? I don't really know much about that either, to be honest. My parents weren't ones for talking about their health, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Brando. And it's alright that you don't have much information about your family's medical history. We'll focus on what we do know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I used to get hay fever as a kid, but I grew out of that. And I’m not a fan of shellfish, but that’s more of a preference than an allergy, you know? I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything, as far as I remember. Unless… there was that one time with the penicillin? When I was young. But it was so long ago, I barely remember it. Just a rash, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible mild reaction to penicillin in the past, and a preference against shellfish. Noted. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy. Mostly just a little vitamin D in the winter, and maybe some aspirin if I get a headache. But nothing regular. I think that’s everything? Honestly, I’m not a complicated case. I’m just an old man who ushers at a theater. I’m ready to finish this up if you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. That's helpful. So, no regular medications, possible penicillin sensitivity, no known allergies other than shellfish preference. Just to get a better overall picture, and with your permission, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… Yes, alright. If you think it's necessary. I haven’t had one in… well, I don’t even remember. Just… try to be gentle, Doctor. I’m a bit of a fragile old man, you know? And if I start to feel dizzy, please let me know. I get lightheaded sometimes. Let's get this over with, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Brando. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145 over 90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I'm hearing a little wheezing in your lungs. Do you have any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Oh dear. No, no asthma. Never been diagnosed. But… I did have a bad cough last winter. It lasted for weeks. The doctor just gave me something for the symptoms, I think. It was a long winter, lots of people were sick. Maybe it was just a bad cold? I don’t really remember. It’s hard for me to keep track of these things, Doctor. Are you sure it's something to worry about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned the cough, Brando. A little wheezing can be caused by a number of things, even a lingering effect from a cold, but we should investigate further. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes and a few basic neurological functions. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Overall, everything seems okay, but the elevated blood pressure and slight wheezing are things we need to address. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. The X-ray will help us rule out any lung issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh dear. More things. If you think it's necessary, Doctor. Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. Just… please try to make it as quick as possible. I have… commitments, you see. I just want to get this all sorted out and get back to work. And… who pays for these tests? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Brando. You’re right to ask about the cost. The tests will likely be around $300 to $500 total. Unfortunately, as you mentioned, you don’t have insurance, so you will be responsible for the full amount. The lab does offer a payment plan if that would be helpful. Regarding the payment plan, let me give you the number for their billing department. They can explain the options. And to be sure, we can discuss potentially getting you connected with resources to help with healthcare costs in the area. For now, let's get the lab order processed. You can go to [Local Lab Name] at [Lab Address]. They’re open Monday through Friday from 8 AM to 5 PM. Do you have any questions about getting to the lab, or the tests themselves?
PATIENT: $300 to $500…? Oh dear. That's… a lot of money. A payment plan… I suppose that’s better than nothing. What about the tests themselves? Will they be… painful? Will I need to fast beforehand? I just don't want any surprises. And thank you for the number. I appreciate your help, Doctor. This is all a bit overwhelming for an old man, you know? .
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Brando, and it’s alright to feel overwhelmed. The tests themselves are not painful. The blood draw will just be a quick pinch, and you’ll be done in a few minutes. Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or sugary drinks. You can still drink water. And for the chest X-ray, you won't need to do anything special. You'll just be asked to stand still for a few moments while the technician takes the pictures. Here's the billing department number again, just in case you misplace it. And if you have any questions or concerns after the tests, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. To summarise, we've ordered a CBC, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. Fast for 8-12 hours, go to [Local Lab Name], and please call if you have any questions. After we get the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
