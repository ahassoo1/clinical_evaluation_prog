DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, I don’t have a lot of time. I'm just...tired. Really tired. And it's not like normal tired. It's...hard to explain. And I been...eating dirt. Not a lot, but…yeah. Dirt. Don't look at me like that. It just…helps, okay? It's stupid, I know.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Dirt. Clay. Earth. Whatever you call it. It's…like a craving, you know? I don't want to eat it, but...I do. And it hasn't stopped. It's getting worse, and I'm exhausted all the time. Look, I just need something to make me feel normal again. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, this is...unusual. Let's try to be precise, Ms. Cantoran. When did this…craving, as you call it, begin?
PATIENT: Ugh, precise? Look, I don’t keep calendars about when I start weird cravings, okay? It’s been…months, I guess? Maybe longer. Everything feels blurry these days. Before my husband…well, it wasn’t happening. After…things just…changed. I don’t know when exactly, does that help? It’s just been getting worse and worse lately. I just want to be done with this whole thing.
DOCTOR: I see. And this fatigue…is it constant?
PATIENT: Constant? Yes! Like, all the time. Even when I sleep, which I can barely do anymore, I feel tired. It’s not like…regular sleepy. It’s like my bones are heavy, you know? Like…dragging weights around all day. Everything is just…harder. Even thinking is harder. Honestly, Doc, it’s awful. Can we just…skip to the part where you give me something for it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, your records indicate no prior medical history, and you are currently uninsured. This complicates matters, naturally. Now, this craving for…earth…is quite concerning. Before we consider any medication – and I assure you, I’m not simply going to prescribe something without a proper assessment – we need to rule out some possibilities. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? Sometimes, yeah. It's not sharp, just…a dull ache. And changes in...bowel habits? Look, I don’t talk about that with people, okay? Especially not doctors. It's…normal stuff. Maybe a little…different, but nothing major. Honestly, I just want to feel less tired and stop craving dirt. Is that too much to ask? I don't have time for a whole investigation.
DOCTOR: "Normal stuff" is precisely what I need to know, Ms. Cantoran. Vague descriptions are unhelpful. Are you experiencing constipation, diarrhea, or anything else unusual?
PATIENT: Ugh, look, are you trying to be difficult? It's…sometimes hard to go, okay? Sometimes easy. It changes! Happy now? Honestly, it's probably just stress. My husband…it’s been a year, but…things haven’t exactly gotten easier. I just want a pill to make it stop! Is that too much to ask? I don't have the energy for this whole interrogation.
DOCTOR: Stress alone does not account for the consumption of non-nutritive substances, Ms. Cantoran. This is known as pica, and it can be indicative of a nutritional deficiency. We need to run some blood tests. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, iron studies, and a vitamin D level. And please, try to be more forthcoming with your medical history. It helps me help you.
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ugh, fine. Whatever. But honestly, I doubt it's anything. I eat okay. I mean, I try to. I just…haven't been feeling like cooking much lately. And I don't have insurance, remember? How much is all this going to cost? And will it actually help me? I don't want to waste my money.
DOCTOR: We can discuss payment options after the tests are completed, Ms. Cantoran. As for whether it will help, that is precisely the purpose of the investigation. Now, regarding your diet…can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, typical? Honestly, it’s mostly toast. Or cereal. Sometimes I'll have a sandwich, if I feel up to it. I don't really feel like eating much. It's hard to explain. And I drink a lot of coffee, if that matters. I used to cook a lot more…with my husband. But now…it just feels pointless. Look, I’m not a gourmet chef, okay? I eat to survive, not for pleasure. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Right. A limited diet, coupled with coffee consumption…and the persistent craving for…earth. We’ll proceed with the blood tests. I’ll also need a stool sample. We need to rule out any parasites or other intestinal issues. I’ll have the nurse explain the collection process. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A STOOL SAMPLE?! Are you serious? Look, I already told you, it’s just stress! I'm not going to…collect a stool sample. That’s ridiculous. I’m wasting my time here. Honestly, I think I’m just going to…go home. I don't need this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your…discomfort. However, dismissing potential medical causes without proper investigation is irresponsible. A stool sample is a simple procedure, and it’s crucial for ruling out serious conditions. I am a physician, and I am obligated to ensure a thorough assessment. I strongly advise you to reconsider. We can discuss financial assistance options if cost is a concern. But refusing necessary tests is not a viable solution.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine! FINE. A stool sample. Are you happy now? It’s disgusting, and I'm humiliated, but fine. Just…tell me what I need to do and let me get this over with. And don't expect me to be cheerful about it. Honestly, this is the worst doctor's appointment ever. And if it turns out to be nothing, I’m not paying for any of this.
DOCTOR: The nurse will provide you with a collection kit and detailed instructions. It is essential to follow them precisely to ensure accurate results. Here is the requisition form for the blood tests and stool sample. Please take this to the lab. The nurse will be with you shortly to discuss the collection process. And Ms. Cantoran, please refrain from consuming any iron supplements until we receive the results of the blood tests. Now, are there any other…unusual substances you have been consuming that you haven't mentioned?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Are you accusing me of being a weirdo? No! Just the dirt. Okay? JUST the dirt. I'm not eating rocks or anything. Look, I'm tired and stressed and I just want to feel better. Can we just focus on the dirt? I don't want to talk about any other...things. I'm going to go sit down.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. I expect full cooperation. .
PATIENT: .
