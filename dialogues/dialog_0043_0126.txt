DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Erxleben. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, to be frank, I’ve been feeling… unusually thirsty lately. And hungry, constantly. It’s a bit bothersome, really. It’s not… normal for me.
DOCTOR: I see. Unusual thirst and increased hunger, you say. And you feel this is a change from your typical state of well-being?
PATIENT: Yes, quite a change. I usually have a decent appetite, but this is… more than decent. And I’m always reaching for a drink, even after I’ve had a good amount. It started, oh, I’d say about a month ago, maybe a bit less. It’s just been gradually getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so of progressively worsening thirst and hunger. Has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I've consciously noticed, no. I haven't been feeling ill, exactly. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I put that down to work. Nothing… dramatic. I suppose I’ve been going to the bathroom a bit more often as well, now that you mention it. But I drink a lot, so I figured that was just natural.
DOCTOR: Increased urination alongside the thirst and hunger is certainly worth noting. And you haven't experienced any weight loss, blurred vision, or increased susceptibility to infections, have you?
PATIENT: Weight loss… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. Blurred vision, no. Infections… I had a bit of a cold last month, but nothing more than the usual. Look, I’m a shipping clerk, not a doctor. I don’t really keep track of these things. Is something serious wrong? I need to get back to work this afternoon, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Erxleben, and I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations regarding medical details. It's good you're being attentive to these changes, even if you haven't meticulously documented them. To get a clearer picture, let’s briefly review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I recall, no. Just the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing… chronic. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, and a broken arm once, but that was years ago. I haven’t really needed to see a doctor much, thankfully. I have private insurance, so I get regular check-ups when required, but everything’s always been fine. Divorced, work a lot… not much time for illness, if you understand me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. A history of childhood illnesses, an appendectomy, and a broken arm, otherwise generally healthy. And no known chronic conditions. What about family history?
PATIENT: That's… a tricky one. My mother passed away a few years back, heart problems. Father's still alive, but we're not particularly close. He has high blood pressure, I believe, and maybe some arthritis. Nothing… major. My grandparents… well, they’re all gone now, and I wasn't really close to them either. I don't know much about their medical history, to be honest. It wasn't something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems and hypertension. Thank you for sharing that. Now, regarding your social history, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I’ll have a pint with my dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. I need a clear head for work, you see. Shipping manifests don’t sort themselves, and the boss isn’t forgiving. A quiet life, mostly. Just work and… well, not much else.
DOCTOR: Very good. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no drug use. Now, one final question regarding your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't take any pills, vitamins, or anything like that. I try to eat a balanced diet, but… work’s busy. As for allergies, I don't think so. I've never had a reaction to anything. I might get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that's just sneezing, nothing serious. Honestly, I'm a fairly simple case, Doctor. I just want to know why I'm so thirsty and hungry all the time. And if it's going to affect my work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough overview of your history. Based on what you’ve described – the increased thirst and hunger, accompanied by increased urination, and with no known medical conditions or medication use – a few possibilities come to mind. The most common would be diabetes, specifically Type 2 diabetes, though we would need to rule out other causes first. It’s important to note that I am not making a diagnosis at this point, but this is a strong initial consideration. To get a clearer understanding, I would like to perform a physical exam and order some blood tests. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. Well, I suppose if that’s what you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests… yes, alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. I really do need to get back to work this afternoon. Is it something serious? Will I need… injections? I'm not good with needles. And the physical exam… what does that involve? I don't like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Erxleben. It’s natural to feel anxious when facing potential health issues. Diabetes, if properly managed, is very often a controllable condition. Many people live full and active lives with it. The blood tests will help us determine your blood sugar levels and assess your overall health. As for injections, that depends entirely on the results of the tests. We can discuss all options thoroughly if needed. The physical exam will be relatively straightforward. I’ll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also examine your abdomen and check your feet for any signs of nerve damage, which can sometimes occur with diabetes. It's a standard exam, and I will explain everything as I go. Would you mind stepping onto the scale so we can begin?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Scale it is. Though, I must say, I'm not fond of those things. Always seem to add a few pounds. Let's get this over with, then. Hopefully, it won’t take too long. And please, go easy with the poking and prodding. I have manifests to sort, you know.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms. And your height is 170 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. 170 centimeters. Is that… bad? Is that what you were expecting? I told you I don’t like scales. They're always exaggerating. It's probably the uniform, it's quite heavy, you know. Shipping clerks don't get the easiest of jobs.
DOCTOR: It’s not a matter of “good” or “bad”, Mr. Erxleben, simply a data point. Your Body Mass Index is 32.3, which falls into the obese category. This doesn't automatically mean anything is wrong, but it does warrant further investigation, particularly given your symptoms. Now, if you'll allow me, I'd like to check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Obese, you say? Honestly. It's mostly muscle, I assure you. Lifting boxes all day… it builds character, if nothing else. And I suppose it's not all muscle. But it's not as bad as it sounds, Doctor. Go on, then. Get it over with. Just… try not to squeeze too hard, alright? I have a deadline to meet, you know. And my boss isn’t known for his patience.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about your workload, Mr. Erxleben. I assure you I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That's slightly elevated, which, combined with your weight and symptoms, adds to our concerns. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? That’s… not good, is it? Honestly, I haven’t been sleeping well lately, worrying about work. Perhaps that’s it? A bit of stress. That’s all it is, I’m sure. Just stress. Go ahead, then. Listen away. I hope this doesn’t take too long, Doctor. The manifests aren't going to sort themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but there's a little tenderness in the upper quadrants. Now, I’d like to check your feet. Could you remove your shoes and socks, please?
PATIENT: Tenderness? That’s probably just from standing all day. It’s a tough job, Doctor. A very tough job. I’m on my feet for hours, shifting boxes, loading trucks… it takes its toll. Feet are fine, though. Nothing special. Just a bit tired, that’s all. Please don’t find anything wrong with them, alright? I need these to… well, to work.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, and sensation seems slightly reduced in your toes. There are no open sores or obvious signs of infection, which is good. Based on the physical exam and your reported symptoms – increased thirst and hunger, increased urination, slightly elevated blood pressure, a murmur, and diminished sensation in your feet – I am concerned about the possibility of Type 2 diabetes. It's not definitive, of course, but the findings warrant further investigation. To confirm this, I'd like to order a comprehensive blood panel, including a fasting blood glucose test, a hemoglobin A1c test, and a lipid panel. We should also check your kidney function and liver enzymes. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. That… that doesn’t sound good, does it? I’ve heard stories… injections, diet restrictions… Oh, this is just what I needed. Fasting? Injections? I really don't like the sound of this at all. But, I suppose if you think it’s necessary, Doctor… Yes, alright. Do the tests. But please, tell me… is it serious? Will I be able to… keep working? And what about the injections? Are they… painful? This is all very upsetting, you know. I have responsibilities. Manifests to sort.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Erxleben. It’s natural to feel anxious when facing a potential diagnosis. Let's address your concerns one by one. First, diabetes, when properly managed, is often a very controllable condition. Many people live full and active lives with it. It requires lifestyle adjustments – diet and exercise – but it doesn’t necessarily mean a drastic change in your life. Regarding injections, many people with Type 2 diabetes do not require insulin injections. The initial management often involves oral medications and lifestyle changes. If medications are necessary, the injections are usually very small and relatively painless, thanks to modern technology. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and allow us to determine the best course of action. We’ll discuss all options thoroughly before making any decisions. I'll write the lab order now. The lab is just down the hall. They will take your blood, and the results should be available within 24-48 hours. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a personalized treatment plan. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We'll tackle this one step at a time. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: One step at a time… alright. That’s… that’s what I’ll try to do. No injections… that’s… good. Oral medications… that sounds… less bad. I suppose. And the results in 24-48 hours… that’s… acceptable. Just… one question. If it is diabetes… will I be able to keep my job? I mean, I have bills to pay, responsibilities. It’s a demanding job, you know. A lot of physical work. I can’t afford to lose it. That’s all I really care about, Doctor. Keeping my job.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid concern, Mr. Erxleben, and a very important one. In most cases, absolutely. With proper management, most people with diabetes can continue to work and live full, productive lives, including those with physically demanding jobs. Diabetes is a manageable condition, and we’ll work together to create a plan that allows you to maintain your health and your livelihood. We’ll discuss potential accommodations if needed, and I can even write a note to your employer outlining your condition and any necessary adjustments. The key is early detection and consistent management. We'll focus on controlling your blood sugar levels, maintaining a healthy diet and exercise routine, and monitoring your overall health. I'm confident that we can help you manage this condition effectively and allow you to continue working and fulfilling your responsibilities. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this point?
PATIENT: Accommodations… a note to my employer… that’s… good to hear. That’s very reassuring, Doctor. Honestly. I was terrified of losing my job. That’s all I really care about. No, I think… I think that’s everything for now. Just… thank you. Thank you for being so… understanding. And for not dismissing my concerns. I’ll go get the blood tests done. Hopefully, they won't take too long. And hopefully, the results aren’t too bad. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Erxleben. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Remember, we’ll tackle this one step at a time. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon. .
