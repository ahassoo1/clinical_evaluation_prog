DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. I see you’re twenty years old. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’m here because I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg. It’s…well, it’s been a bit bothersome, so I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Numbness can certainly be bothersome. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It primarily affects my left leg, though sometimes I feel a tingling sensation in my foot as well. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. Usually, it’s more noticeable after I’ve been standing or walking for a long period – like after a long day at work, animating or setting up effects. It doesn't really hurt, just…absent feeling, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. “Absent feeling” is a good way to describe it. So it’s primarily in your left leg, with some tingling in the foot, and it seems to be triggered by prolonged standing or walking. Can you tell me where exactly on your leg you're feeling the numbness?
PATIENT: It’s…difficult to pinpoint exactly. It’s not like a single spot. It feels like it starts in my hip, and then radiates down the outside of my thigh and into my calf. Sometimes it’s more in the front of my shin, other times it’s on the outer side, near my knee. It’s never really in my foot itself, just the tingling, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So it seems to be following a path from your hip, down the outside of your thigh and into your calf, with tingling in your foot. Has anything specific caused it to start, as far as you can recall?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I honestly can’t recall any particular incident. It didn’t come on suddenly after an injury or anything like that. It was more…gradual. I first noticed it maybe a month or two ago, just a slight feeling, and it's slowly become more frequent and noticeable. I was thinking it might be related to how much time I spend standing and contorting my body for work, but I truly can’t say for certain.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a gradual onset over the past month or two, and you suspect it might be related to your work as an animator, given the prolonged standing and unusual postures. Do you experience any weakness in your leg, or any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No weakness that I’ve noticed, thankfully. And my balance seems perfectly normal. I haven't tripped or stumbled more than usual. I do a fair amount of hiking when I have the time, and that hasn’t been affected.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And no pain associated with this numbness?
PATIENT: No, not any pain. It’s purely a sensation of…lost feeling. Sometimes it feels a little cold, even when my leg isn’t actually cold. But no sharp pains, no aching, nothing like that. It's more disconcerting than anything, you know? To feel…nothing where there should be something.
DOCTOR: I understand completely – that can be quite unsettling. Alright, Tarin. I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your legs and back, if that’s alright with you. This will help me assess your reflexes, strength, and sensation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment and want to do whatever is necessary to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could lie down on your back on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I’m going to start with some neurological testing. Okay, I’m checking your reflexes now. Patellar reflex is 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflex is 2+ bilaterally. Plantar reflex is flexor bilaterally. Now, I'm going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly. Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, good strength in both arms and legs – 5/5 throughout. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. Close your eyes for me. I’m going to gently touch different parts of your legs with this cotton ball, and I want you to tell me when you feel it. How about here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. Right here.
DOCTOR: Okay, and here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one too. It feels…a little less sharp than the last one, though. Not by much, just…subtly different.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now here, on the outer side of your calf… Do you feel that?
PATIENT: No…I don’t think so. I mean, I think I feel something, but it’s very faint. Almost like…static. It's not a clear sensation like the others.
DOCTOR: Okay. And on this side, do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one clearly. It’s a distinct sensation. Much sharper than the one on my left leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tarin. Thank you for your patience. Based on the physical exam, there's some decreased sensation on the outer side of your left calf compared to your right. Your reflexes and strength are normal, which is reassuring. Given your history and the exam findings, it's possible this is related to a nerve compression somewhere along the path of the sciatic nerve, perhaps in your hip or lower back. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI sounds sensible. If it will help determine the cause and rule out other possibilities, then yes, absolutely. I trust your judgment, Doctor. What does that involve, if you don't mind me asking? And how long would I need to wait for the results?
DOCTOR: Certainly. An MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the structures within your spine – the bones, discs, nerves, and surrounding tissues. It's a painless procedure, but you’ll need to lie very still inside the scanner for about 30-45 minutes. It’s important to remove any metal objects beforehand – jewelry, watches, piercings – as they can interfere with the imaging. I’ll have my nurse go over the specific preparation instructions with you. As for the results, it usually takes about 24-48 hours for the radiologist to interpret the images and send a report to me. I’ll then review the report and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that aggravate your symptoms – prolonged standing, heavy lifting, or twisting motions. If the numbness worsens or you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness, pain, or bowel or bladder changes, please contact the office immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. Yes, that sounds good. I'll be careful to avoid aggravating activities and will definitely contact the office if anything changes. I'll make sure to follow all the preparation instructions carefully as well. Thank you for taking the time to examine me and for your clear explanations.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your MRI and provide you with the necessary paperwork. Do you have any other questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and I feel much better informed now. I’ll just wait for the nurse then. Thank you again for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright then. I’ll let you get settled and wait for the nurse. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes to mind. Have a good day, Tarin.
PATIENT: You as well, Doctor. Thank you.
