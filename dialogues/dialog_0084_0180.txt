DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Cantoran. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s… this tiredness. It's just bad. And I… I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I crave it. It’s weird, I know. Just… get on with it, okay? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. I understand you're short on time, and we'll try to be efficient. Tiredness and… a craving for dirt, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, dirt. Clay, mostly. Red stuff. It started… a while ago. I don’t really keep track. It's not like I want to eat it, it's just… there. And I feel better when I do. Which is… stupid, I guess. Look, am I sick or what? Don't ask me a bunch of questions about when it started, I told you, I don't remember!
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem. We'll skip the detailed timeline for now. Just to clarify, when you say you feel better… can you describe what “better” means?
PATIENT: Better like… less shaky. And not so… empty. Hard to explain. Like when you're really hungry, but it's not food hunger, it's… something else. My stomach feels… settled, I guess. It's just... a feeling. And then the tiredness isn't as bad for a little while. I don’t know! It's just what happens. Are you gonna give me something for it or what?
DOCTOR: Okay, less shaky, not as empty, and settled stomach when you consume the clay… that’s helpful. And the tiredness improves temporarily. It sounds like there could be a nutritional deficiency at play here. Before we jump to any conclusions or medications, I need to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any other cravings?
PATIENT: Cravings? Ugh. Look, I already told you, I eat dirt. That’s the craving. What other cravings are you expecting me to have? Ice? Chocolate? I don’t have time for this. I eat the clay when I need to, that’s it. It’s not a hobby, it’s… something I just do. Can we just get to the point? I don't understand why you're asking so many questions!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran, and I apologize if it feels like I’m asking too many questions. I need to rule out certain possibilities to understand what's going on and get you the right help. It’s important to understand why you’re craving clay. Have you experienced any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? What kind of question is that? I eat. I eat whatever’s around. It’s not like I have a special diet or something. Mostly beans, tortillas… whatever’s cheapest. My husband… well, he used to do the shopping. He's gone now. It’s all… just food. I haven't been changing things around. I told you, I don’t keep track of these things! Look, are you a specialist in dirt-eating or something? Because if not, I’m wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, beans and tortillas… and your husband handled the shopping previously. Thank you for that information. I'm a family medicine doctor, Ms. Cantoran. And while I don't specialize in… clay consumption, the craving itself can indicate a nutritional deficiency, such as iron deficiency anemia. To get a better idea, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and order some blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do, remember? And no poking around too much. I hate needles. Just… do it quickly. I don't need a lecture about being healthy, I just need something to make me stop feeling so tired. Are you sure this is going to help? I doubt it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. I'll be as quick as possible. We’ll start with your vitals, and then a brief physical exam, focusing on looking for signs of anemia – pale skin, brittle nails, things like that. Then we'll take some blood to confirm. If you could please sit up here, we’ll get started. Let me listen to your heart and lungs first.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry up. It's hot in here. And don’t tell me I need to eat more vegetables. I know I should, okay? My mother told me that a million times. Just get the poking over with.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. I notice your nail beds are a little pale, and they seem somewhat brittle. That could be consistent with iron deficiency. Now, let’s check your skin tone. Your skin also appears slightly pale. This strengthens my suspicion, but we need the blood work to confirm. I'm going to have the nurse draw a few vials. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: Pale? Brittle? Well, no kidding. I work outside all day. Sun, dirt, everything. It's hard on you. I don’t need you to tell me what my skin looks like! And yes, fine, do the blood work. Get it over with. I'm starting to get a headache. Just… don't poke me too much. And don't expect me to be grateful, okay? This whole thing is a waste of time, I bet. It’s probably just old age.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to draw the blood. It’s a standard procedure, and she’s very efficient. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. It may or may not be anemia. In the meantime, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Ugh. No. Nothing. I take whatever anyone gives me if I'm sick. I don’t have time to be picky about allergies. My husband used to handle all that too. Just… no, I don’t have any. Are you sure this is going to take long? I got things to do. I can feel myself getting weaker just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. The blood work will give us a clearer picture, and we should have results back within a few days. In the meantime, I'm going to write down a few recommendations for you, just to help manage your tiredness while we wait. I’m going to recommend you try to increase your fluid intake, and prioritize rest when possible. While I understand you have a lot going on, even small changes can make a difference. I’m also going to note that we need to investigate the clay eating further.
PATIENT: Investigate the clay eating? What is there to investigate? I eat dirt when I feel bad! It's not a mystery! And I don’t need you to tell me to drink water. I drink water. Just… get this over with. You’re making me feel worse just talking about it. I’m tired, I eat dirt, end of story. Give me the paper, let me go. I doubt any of this will help. Waste of time. Just a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Ms. Cantoran. It just includes some general advice. I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I'm not being helpful. But it's important to rule out any underlying causes for the clay eating, even if it seems… straightforward. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. I need to go. Honestly, I don't see the point of all this. Just… no. I'm done. Let's just get the blood work, and then I'm leaving. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. I’ll let the nurse know you're ready. I understand you’re not optimistic, but I hope we can get some answers for you. .
