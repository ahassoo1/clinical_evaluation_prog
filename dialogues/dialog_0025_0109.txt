DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Brum is the name. My head… back of my head hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now. Not a bad pain, but… always there. Like a weight.
DOCTOR: A constant weight, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Not sharp, not like a… a hammer. Just… heavy. And sometimes, when I move my head quick, it feels… funny. Not dizzy, but… off. I worked with the trains all my life, you know. Maybe I pulled a muscle? Old man things.
DOCTOR: Trains, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Rail yard. For… a long time. Forty years, maybe more. Dinkey operator, hostler… lots of moving things, lots of… bumps. Not easy work, even when I was young. But good work. I liked it. This headache… it's new though. Never had one like this before.
DOCTOR: Right. So, this is a new headache, starting about three days ago. Constant, like a weight, and you notice a strange sensation with quick head movements. Let's get a better picture of this. Do you have any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… no fever. No… seeing things funny. Not sick to my stomach. Just… tired. Old man tired, you know? But I’m always a little tired. I don’t think that’s from the headache. No… nothing else, I don’t think. My wife… she used to ask me this. She always remembered things better than me. I miss her.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you said quick movements bring on this “funny” sensation. Can you describe that sensation more precisely?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. Not like spinning, no. More like… everything wobbles for a second. Like looking through water, maybe? But only for a blink. And it only happens when I turn my head fast. Not slow, gentle movements. Quick ones. Like when I look for a car coming. I still drive, you know. Careful driving, though.
DOCTOR: Wobbling, like looking through water… briefly. And it doesn't seem to be accompanied by any nausea or vision changes beyond that momentary distortion?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No sickness. And my eyes… I see just fine. Read the paper every morning. Sometimes I need my glasses, of course. But I don't see blurry or double. It's just… that wobble. And the weight. It's a… a nagging thing, you know? Doesn't stop me from doing things, but… it's always there. I don't know if this helps. I'm not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Let’s move on to some other questions then. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. Old age is my biggest condition, I guess. A little arthritis in my hands, but that's it. Never been a sick man. My wife… she had a little trouble with her heart, towards the end. But I… I’ve always been strong. Never broken a bone, never had… anything serious. No insurance, either. Never needed it, until now maybe.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgery. Not even my tonsils when I was a boy. My mother… she didn’t believe in cutting things out unless you had to. She was a strong woman. I… I think I’ve been lucky, mostly. This headache is… new, though. And worrying me a little. It's not a bad pain, but… constant. Like a shadow.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family… my mother lived to be ninety-five, Doctor. Very strong woman. Never sick a day in her life, almost. My father… he died when I was young, from… something with his lungs. Worked in the coffee fields, you know. Not good air. No one in my family… headaches, not that I remember. Heart trouble, a little. And that lung thing with my father. But no headaches. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just a little cream for my hands, when the arthritis flares up. That’s all. Never been one for taking pills. My wife… she had a lot of pills towards the end. Didn’t seem to help much. I… I prefer to just deal with things. This headache… I was hoping it would just go away. But it hasn't. That's why I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. I'm going to check your neurological function and some basic things. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. My eyes are good. Always have been. Is this good? I’m a little worried about this, you know. It's not a bad headache, but… it’s there. Always.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. And now the other side.
PATIENT: Oh! That tickles. My legs… they work alright, I think. Old man legs, but they still get me around. Is something wrong? This is making me a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your neck. Can you gently turn your head to the left, and then to the right?
PATIENT: That… that’s a little uncomfortable, Doctor. It feels… tight. Like a knot in my muscles. I used to lift a lot of heavy things, you know. With the trains. Maybe it’s just old age. It's not a sharp pain, just… tight. And the headache… it's there. Always.
DOCTOR: Tightness is present, and there is some tenderness to palpation. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: My heart… it's been good, as far as I know. Never had any trouble with it. My wife… she had a little murmur, towards the end. But I… I’ve always been strong. I feel a little nervous, Doctor. What do you think it is? Is it something serious? This headache… it's just always there.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, given your age and the nature of your symptoms, and considering the lack of any acute neurological deficits, it's likely this headache is related to muscle tension in your neck. However, the constant nature of the pain and your history of working with heavy machinery warrants further investigation. I want to order a CT scan of your head, just to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: A… a scan? What kind of scan? Is something wrong, Doctor? This doesn’t sound good. I… I don’t like scans. And I don’t have… insurance, you know. Can’t I just take something for the headache? Something for the muscles? This is worrying me a lot. The headache… it’s just always there.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, a CT scan is a simple imaging test. It will give us a clear picture of your brain and rule out any underlying structural issues. It’s standard procedure given your symptoms and age. As for medication, pain relievers may offer temporary relief, but they won't address the root cause of the problem. And frankly, dismissing this without proper investigation would be irresponsible. I understand your concerns about insurance, and we can discuss options for financial assistance. But your health is the priority. We need to know what we’re dealing with. I'm going to write you a referral for the scan and a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help in the meantime.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. A scan… alright. If you think it's important. I don’t like going to hospitals, you know. Too many… beeping machines. And my wife… she didn't like hospitals either. But… if you think it's best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. A muscle relaxant… that sounds good. Something to take the edge off. Just… please tell me if it's something serious. This headache… it's just always there. And I miss my wife so much.
DOCTOR: The scan will provide us with more information. We'll discuss the results when they come back. Try the muscle relaxant as directed. If you experience any concerning side effects, contact the office immediately. I'll also have the office staff assist you with finding resources for financial assistance regarding the scan. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… thank you. For… looking at me. And for the medicine. I’ll… I’ll make an appointment for the scan. This headache… it’s just always there. .
