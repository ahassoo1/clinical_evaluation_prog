DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Pirl, is it? Yes, alright. It's about my… well, it’s about the bruising. I’ve been on this blood thinner for… oh, a good while now, since the heart scare, and I seem to be black and blue all over. It's getting ridiculous, frankly. Bumping into things isn't even that hard, you know? I’m a careful man.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Farson, I understand. Bruising easily while on a blood thinner is certainly a concern. And it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. Just to clarify, do you recall which blood thinner you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a question. The name… it escapes me. It's a little pill, orange-ish, I think. The pharmacy sends it automatically, you see. I just… take it. My wife, bless her soul, she handled all that. It's been a year since she passed, and honestly, keeping track of these things… it's a bit of a mess. Is there a way you can just… look it up with my name? I have Medicare, so hopefully that helps.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Farson. That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly access your medication list through your Medicare information. Just one moment… …Alright, it appears you’ve been prescribed Warfarin. And yes, it’s been a year, as you mentioned. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other unusual bleeding?
PATIENT: Warfarin, yes, that rings a bell. It’s a mouthful, isn’t it? And no, not really. Just the bruising. A little more than usual, that’s all. No nosebleeds, gums don’t bleed when I brush, nothing like that. It’s just… unsightly. And my daughter keeps worrying. She's a nurse, you know, so she’s always on my case about things. Though, frankly, she doesn’t know everything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. It’s good your daughter is attentive, even if she is a bit… concerned. Now, let's get a better idea of how often this bruising is occurring, and where specifically. Could you describe a typical instance?
PATIENT: Well, it’s hard to say “typical”. It’s not like I keep a logbook, Doctor. But… let’s see. Yesterday, I was just moving a chair, a light one, and I noticed a mark on my forearm later. Not a big bump or anything, just… a bruise appeared. And a few days ago, I knocked my shin against the coffee table. Now that one hurt a bit, and it’s a rather large bruise. Before this, it was just little things. But it seems to be… getting worse. And bigger, if that makes sense. It’s just… worrisome, you know? A man shouldn't be falling apart like this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. It’s certainly not typical to bruise so easily, and it’s good you’re addressing it. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out anything else that might be contributing to this. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Don’t mind if I’m a bit… bony. I’ve always been a slim fellow. Not much meat on my frame, you see. Though, I used to be quite the athlete, back in Guatemala. But that was a long time ago. Go ahead, then. Let’s get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. If you could just have a seat here, that would be wonderful. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll take a look at the bruising on your forearm and shin. … Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. That’s within a normal range. Now, if you’ll just extend your arm… … It appears to be a fairly significant bruise, as you mentioned. And it's tender to the touch. Now, let's take a look at your shin. … This one is larger, and also tender. No signs of any breaks or fractures, thankfully. Do you notice any swelling or warmth around either of these areas?
PATIENT: No, no swelling that I can tell. Just the bruising, and the tenderness, of course. Feels… achy, I suppose. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And it's all so… purple. Not a nice color, is it? My daughter says it’s a sign of something, but honestly, she always makes a mountain out of a molehill. I used to play football, you know. Got plenty of bruises back then, but they didn't look quite like this. They healed faster, too. Things just don’t work the same anymore, do they?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. It sounds like these bruises are different than what you've experienced in the past. Now, to get a clearer picture of what's going on, I’d like to order a blood test. It will check your INR levels, which measures how well your blood is clotting while on Warfarin. It will also check your complete blood count to rule out any other underlying issues. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps figure things out, then go right ahead. I don’t mind a little blood draw. I’ve had plenty of those over the years. Just… tell me when and where. And how long it will take? I have a bridge game on Thursday, and I wouldn't want to miss that. Old Man Hemmings is ruthless when he has a good hand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. We can have the blood drawn right here in the clinic. It should only take about 15-20 minutes, and the results will typically be available within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, come in and draw the blood for you now. In the meantime, let's review your medical history, just to make sure we have everything up to date. Could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, besides the heart condition that led to the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. My heart, yes. That was the big scare, a few years back. And… I had my prostate removed, oh, maybe ten years ago now. No problems since, thankfully. And I have a bit of arthritis, in my knees mostly. Nothing serious, just aches and pains, especially when it's cold. Oh, and I used to have high blood pressure, but that’s been under control for years with medication. I think that’s… about it. I’m not a sickly man, Doctor. Never have been. Just… getting old, I suppose. It’s a terrible business, this aging.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Farson. That’s helpful to know. And I understand your frustration with aging; it certainly comes with its challenges. Now, do you recall what medications you are currently taking for your arthritis and high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… for the arthritis, it's… Ibuprofen, usually. Just over the counter stuff, when it flares up. Nothing fancy. And for the blood pressure… ah, it's… Losartan, I believe. A little white pill. I take one every morning. My wife… she managed all the pills. I just… swallow them. It's getting harder to keep track of everything, honestly. She was so organized, you see. I miss her terribly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. It’s completely understandable that it’s difficult to keep track of everything after losing your wife. We can certainly help you organize your medications, if you’d like. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to take all sorts of things when I was younger, traveling through the jungle in Guatemala, you see. Had to take malaria pills, all sorts of things. Never bothered me. I’m a tough old bird, Doctor. Honestly, I think they give me too much credit sometimes. Worrying over a few bruises… it's a bit much, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Well, it's always better to be cautious, Mr. Farson. Now, one final question regarding your social history. Do you drink alcohol or smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, you see. Dreadful habit. And alcohol… I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, back when my wife was still with us. But I haven't really had much of an appetite for it since. It just… doesn't seem appealing anymore. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea, to be honest. Helps me sleep.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Farson. That’s all the information I need for now. Maria will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual bleeding – such as nosebleeds, blood in your stool, or excessive bruising – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. Just… hope it’s nothing serious. I have a golf tournament next month, you see. Old Man Hemmings is counting on me to be his partner. He's a terrible golfer, but a good friend. Alright, then. Let's get this blood drawn, and hopefully, everything will be alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. I’m glad I could help. Maria will be right with you. And I hope you and Old Man Hemmings have a wonderful tournament. Maria, could you please come in and draw blood for Mr. Farson?
