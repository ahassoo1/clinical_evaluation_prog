DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Um... travel, I think. My wife... she wanted to go somewhere. Big trip. She planned it all. I don't really remember where exactly, though. It was... before.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recent trip. And you're having some concerns related to that trip?
PATIENT: Concerns? Not really me. She was worried about... shots? And sicknesses. You know, for traveling. She made a whole list. I just... I just need to make sure I’m okay to go. It's a long flight. Don’t want to get sick on the plane. That would be bad.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your wife was very thorough in preparing for your trip, which is excellent. So, to clarify, you’re here to ensure you're medically cleared for travel, and you'd like me to review any necessary precautions or vaccinations?
PATIENT: Vaccinations... yeah, that sounds right. She said something about needing some. And maybe pills? For... stopping things? I don’t know. She had a whole bag of stuff. I just... I don't have the list now. It’s probably at home. She did everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's see what we can do. I'm accessing your record now. It looks like you've been a patient here before. Do you recall when your last physical exam was, Mr. Tayar?
PATIENT: Physical... exam? Um... A long time ago, I think. Before... everything. Maybe last year? Or the year before? Honestly, I don't keep track of those things. She always remembered. It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Alright. It appears your last documented physical was approximately two years ago. It looks like you were up to date on your routine vaccinations at that time. However, given the travel involved, we may need to consider additional precautions depending on your destination. Do you happen to know where you and your wife are traveling to?
PATIENT: That’s the thing! I... I really don’t. She told me, of course, but… it’s gone. Just… gone. Somewhere warm, I think. Beaches… and old buildings. She liked old buildings. She had the tickets and everything. I just… followed her. I didn’t ask questions. It was easier that way.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright, Mr. Tayar. It sounds like you were trusting your wife to handle the arrangements, and that’s perfectly normal. We’ll figure this out. Since you don't recall the specific destination, let's start with a general travel health assessment. Could you tell me about any symptoms you're currently experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No… not really. Just… tired. All the time. But that’s… that’s normal, right? I haven’t been sleeping well since… since she left. Nothing medical, I mean. Just… sad. And a little bit lost.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely understandable to feel tired and overwhelmed after a significant loss. Grief can have a profound effect on both your emotional and physical well-being. However, we still want to rule out any underlying medical causes for your fatigue, especially before a long flight. Have you noticed any fever, chills, body aches, cough, diarrhea, or changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not really any aches. Maybe a little bit hungry, sometimes, but mostly I just… don’t feel like eating. I’ve lost a bit of weight, I guess, but not much. I just… don’t bother. It's hard to explain. Everything just feels… empty. It’s not like being sick, you know? It’s just… nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant loss of appetite, which is common with grief. We'll keep that in mind. Let’s move on to a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic… what now? No, I don’t think so. She always took care of the doctor stuff. I just… went when she told me to. I never really asked. I'm sorry. I just… I’m not good with this. I always let her handle it. Everything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Tayar. It's not a problem at all. Many people prefer to let a loved one manage their healthcare. We'll just take things slowly. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospital… Um… once. A long time ago. When I was a kid, I think. Broken arm, maybe? Playing football with the other boys. It was… quick. Nothing serious. Just a cast for a few weeks. That’s all I remember. It was a long time ago. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, a broken arm in childhood. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. She always asked me before I took anything. And I always told her I didn’t have any. She was very careful. I never had a reaction to anything. Never. That’s why I let her handle it. She knew what she was doing. I just… trusted her.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. She had a whole bag of pills for herself, but I didn’t take any. Never needed to. She always said I was healthy. Strong. I didn’t need anything. Now… now I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health before your trip. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam… you mean… like, poking and prodding? I guess so. If you have to. But… please be gentle? And… quick? I don't really like doctors. She always made it easier.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tayar. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. We’ll start with your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. First, could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay… I’m sitting. Be quick, please. I don’t like being here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. Take a few deep breaths. Your blood pressure is 128/78, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also normal. Your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, normal. Your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, which is normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay… breathing. Deep breaths. Is everything okay? It feels… cold.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and I don’t hear any murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lungs are clear, and I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums appear normal. Your throat is clear, and there’s no redness or swelling. Everything appears normal so far, Mr. Tayar. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Hmm… it feels… okay. A little bit sore, maybe? But that’s probably just… from being nervous. She always said I was very sensitive. Is that bad? Is something wrong? I don’t like this.
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say definitively, Mr. Tayar. Some tenderness is not uncommon, especially if you're feeling anxious. However, since you mention some soreness, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you been experiencing any nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea recently?
PATIENT: No… no nausea. Not vomiting. A little bit of… everything, maybe? I haven’t really been eating much, so… things are just… slow. Constipated, I guess. But I didn’t really think much of it. She always said I needed to drink more water. It’s probably just… from being sad. Everything feels… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like your constipation is likely related to your decreased appetite and overall emotional state. However, to rule out any other potential causes, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel . These are routine blood tests that can help us assess your overall health and identify any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests…? You mean… needles? I… I don’t really like needles. She always said I was very squeamish. Is it… necessary? Can’t you just… tell me what’s wrong without poking me?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Tayar. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about needles. However, these blood tests are relatively quick and painless, and they can provide us with valuable information about your health. Think of it as a precautionary measure, just to make sure everything is okay before your trip. It will help me provide you with the best possible care. We can also use a numbing cream to minimize any discomfort. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood tests?
PATIENT: … Fine. But… quick, please. And… be gentle. And… don’t tell me when you’re going to poke me. She always said it was better not to know. I just… want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tayar. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I will respect your preferences. I won’t tell you when I’m going to poke you. The nurse will start by cleaning your arm, and then she’ll quickly draw a small amount of blood. It will only take a few minutes. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort during the procedure. I’ll be right here if you need anything.
PATIENT: … Is it over? It… didn’t hurt as much as I thought it would. But I still don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tayar, it’s all over. You did a wonderful job. Just keep that bandage on for a few hours to prevent any bleeding or irritation. We'll send the blood samples to the lab, and we should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… when can I go home? I just want to rest. And… try to forget about all this. I just… miss her. Is it okay if we just… skip the vaccinations for now? I don't think I can handle much more today.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tayar. Your well-being is my priority. We can definitely skip the vaccinations for now, and we can revisit that discussion once we have the results of your blood tests. I’m so sorry for your loss. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. Please remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and don't hesitate to reach out for support if you need it. Before you go, I'm going to write you a note for a few days of excused absence from work, just in case you need it. I also want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in a few days to discuss the blood test results and create a plan for your travel health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay… a note would be good. And… a follow-up. I guess. But… please make it quick. I don't want to be here for long. Thank you… I think. I just… want to go home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tayar. Here’s the note for excused absence. The nurse will help you schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Please remember to take care of yourself, both physically and emotionally. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We'll take good care of you, Mr. Tayar. Have a safe trip home, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. And again, my deepest condolences for your loss. Take care.
PATIENT: .
