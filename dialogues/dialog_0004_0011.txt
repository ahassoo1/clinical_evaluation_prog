DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get this over with. I need… a paper. A paper sayin’ I can do somethin’. A cosmetic thing. My niece, she says I need a doctor to say it’s alright. I don’t remember what it’s called, exactly. It’s… for my face.
DOCTOR: A paper… for something cosmetic on your face. Right. Well, we need to be a bit more specific than that, Mr. Honcoop. I can't simply write a paper saying something is alright without knowing what “something” is. Is this a surgical procedure?
PATIENT: Surgical… maybe? Honestly, I don't rightly know. She handled all the arrangements. Young people these days, always takin’ care of things. It involves… liftin’. Liftin’ somethin’ on my face. Makes me look… fresher, she said. It’s not a big deal, is it? I just need the paper so I can get it done. I ain’t got time for a lot of questions, Doctor.
DOCTOR: “Lifting…somethin’ on your face.” Very well. It sounds like you’re referring to a facial cosmetic procedure, likely a facelift or similar. And you say your niece arranged everything?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. She did. Good girl, that niece of mine. She found this… place. Very modern. Said it was a good price. She handles all the… details. I just need you to say it’s okay, Doctor. My health… is fine. I don’t go to doctors much. Never have. So, can you do it? I got a fish fry to get to later.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I cannot simply sign off on a cosmetic procedure without a thorough assessment. It's a medical procedure, regardless of whether you consider it “major” or not. I need to know your medical history, any medications you take, allergies… even your current vital signs. And frankly, I need to see what this procedure entails. Do you have any information about the “place” your niece found?
PATIENT: Medical history? Allergies? Doctor, I told you, I don't go to doctors. I take a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, sometimes. A small white pill. And I ain’t got allergies. I’m a perfectly healthy man! As for that… place. It’s called “Forever Young.” Sounds reputable, don’t it? She showed me pictures. Looked clean enough. I don’t know what else you need to know. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. I just want the paper, Doctor. Surely, you can just write it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, “clean enough” is not a medical assessment. And a small white pill for blood pressure is information I need to document. What is the dosage?
PATIENT: Dosage? I haven’t the foggiest. It’s a small one! She gives it to me. Honestly, Doctor, are you always this difficult? I'm tellin’ ya, I don't remember numbers and things anymore. I just take it when I feel a little… fluttery. This is ridiculous. I came here for a simple clearance, not a whole examination! Forever Young said all I needed was a doctor’s signature. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I am ethically obligated to ensure your safety. Signing off on a procedure without knowing your medical history or the details of what you're consenting to is irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I cannot, and will not, do that. Furthermore, “Forever Young” does not appear to be accredited by any reputable medical boards. I strongly advise against proceeding with anything there. I can offer to perform a basic physical exam and review your vitals. If everything checks out, and if you can provide specifics about the proposed procedure, I can then assess whether a clearance is appropriate. However, I need information, and you need to cooperate. Are you willing to do that, or shall I document that you refused medical assessment and recommend you consult with a specialist?
