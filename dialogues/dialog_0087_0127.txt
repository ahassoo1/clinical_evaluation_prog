DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I'm Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve been noticing some weakness, mostly in my arms and legs. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a bit, I think. It’s been getting slowly worse over the last few months.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weakness in your arms and legs, and drooping eyelids developing over the last few months. That is certainly something we should investigate. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a bit more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… difficult to explain. It’s not like I can’t do things, exactly. It's more like… everything takes more effort. Like, if I’m carrying groceries, my arms get tired much faster than they used to. And sometimes, my legs feel like they’re going to give out when I’ve been walking for a while. It's not constant, but it’s definitely noticeable. Especially at the end of the day.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, the weakness is exertional – meaning it gets worse with activity – and improves with rest. It's more pronounced at the end of the day. Has this been interfering with any of your daily activities?
PATIENT: Yes, it has, actually. I work in facilities management, so I’m on my feet quite a bit, and doing a fair amount of lifting and carrying. It's… it’s been harder to keep up with the workload, to be frank. I've been finding myself needing more breaks, and sometimes I have to ask colleagues for help with things I used to handle on my own. It’s a bit embarrassing, really. And it makes me worry about keeping my job.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It's good you're recognizing the impact this is having. Let’s move on to the eyelid drooping. Has this been noticeable by anyone else, or is it something you've primarily observed yourself?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My… my ex-wife mentioned it a few times, actually, during video calls with the children. She said I looked… tired, and that my eyes seemed heavy. But she also says a lot of things, so I wasn’t entirely sure if it was just her being… observant. I’ve noticed it more myself when I look in the mirror, and like I said, it feels heavier than usual. It's not dramatic, but it’s definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been noted by at least one other person, and you’ve confirmed it yourself. And you feel the heaviness. Has there been any vision changes accompanying this – double vision, blurry vision, or difficulty focusing?
PATIENT: No, not really. My vision seems… normal, I think. I wear glasses, as you can see, but my prescription hasn't changed recently. I haven’t noticed any double vision or blurriness, and I can focus alright. It’s just… the feeling of the eyelids being heavy. Like I’m constantly trying to keep them open. It doesn't hurt, though. Just… tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, no changes in vision. Let’s move on to some other things. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the weakness and eyelid drooping?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, generally. But honestly, who isn’t these days? It’s hard to say if that’s related or just… life. I haven't had any fever, or any unexplained weight loss, or anything like that. Oh, and I’ve been a bit… constipated, if you don’t mind me saying. It’s not a major issue, but it’s been more frequent lately. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue, and more frequent constipation. Those could be relevant. Now, let's go through some of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing major. I broke my arm once when I was a teenager, but it healed fine. I haven't been hospitalized for anything serious, and I don't take any regular medication. I had a bit of trouble with anxiety a few years back, but I haven't needed any treatment for it in a long time. And… I was divorced about a year ago. Is that… medical history?
DOCTOR: We appreciate you sharing all of this. The divorce is not directly medical history, but stress can certainly impact one's health. We’ll keep that in mind. Let's move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, family history. My father had high blood pressure, and he had a stroke a few years ago, but he's doing alright now, recovering. My mother, she had some trouble with arthritis, mostly in her hands. And… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had some kind of muscle weakness when he was older. I don’t know the specifics, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and no one really talked about it much. It just… seemed to come with age. It wasn't anything specific they ever diagnosed. Just… frailty, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of high blood pressure and stroke in your father, arthritis in your mother, and some undefined muscle weakness in your maternal grandfather. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Alright. I live alone in a small apartment in the suburbs. I work full-time as a facilities manager, as I mentioned. I see my children fairly regularly - they live with their mother, but I have visitation rights, and we spend weekends together. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol occasionally – a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, although I admit it's not always easy with my schedule. I don’t really have any hobbies, to be honest. Work takes up most of my time and energy. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you. That's all very helpful. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to any medication. I can eat pretty much anything without any trouble. No food allergies, no seasonal allergies… nothing. I'm pretty boring in that regard, really. I suppose that's one less thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Thank you for providing all of that information, Mr. Schaust. It’s a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. We’ll start with your vital signs, and then I’ll check your strength, reflexes, and coordination. I will also take a look at your eyes and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Doctor. I’ve been a bit worried about this, and it’s reassuring to be taking steps to figure things out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat here. I’m going to start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly. Like this? Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Good strength. Now, I'd like you to resist as I try to push your arms down. Just try to hold your arms where I put them. Now, let's check your legs. Could you please straighten your legs out while lying on the table?
PATIENT: Alright, here we go. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’ll try to keep them as still as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now I'm going to check your reflexes. Finally, I’m going to examine your eyes. Okay. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Alright, that completes the physical examination. Thank you for your cooperation. I have a few findings here that we need to discuss. Your strength is slightly reduced in your legs, your reflexes are a little brisk, and I noticed some mild drooping of your eyelids, particularly when you look straight ahead. I also saw some muscle twitching in your calves. I’m also noting the ptosis.
PATIENT: That... doesn't sound good, does it? What does it mean? Is it something serious? The drooping eyelids I noticed myself, of course, but the muscle twitching… and reduced strength… I’m a bit worried, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing too serious. What are you thinking? Could it be… something neurological?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schaust. It is important to be thorough. Given your symptoms – the weakness, eyelid drooping, and the muscle twitching – and the physical exam findings, several possibilities need to be considered. While it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, one potential cause that comes to mind is Myasthenia Gravis. Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles, leading to weakness and fatigue. The eyelid drooping – called ptosis – and the muscle twitching – fasciculations – are common symptoms. The reduced strength in your legs can also be consistent with this condition. However, there are other possibilities we need to rule out. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests, specifically to look for antibodies associated with Myasthenia Gravis. We'll also need to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Autoimmune… antibodies… It sounds… complicated. I’ll be honest, Doctor, I’m not very familiar with medical terms. Is it… curable? And what does it mean if it is that? Would it… get worse? Blood tests are fine, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. I just… I need to understand what’s going on. It’s unsettling to think something could be attacking my own body. Is it… common? And what’s the next step if the blood tests come back positive? Will I need to see a specialist? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor, but I’m a bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: You have every right to be overwhelmed, Mr. Schaust, and you’re asking very good questions. Let’s address them one by one. Myasthenia Gravis is not typically curable, but it is treatable. With appropriate treatment – which often includes medications to suppress the immune system and improve nerve-muscle communication – many people can achieve significant remission or manage their symptoms effectively and lead a normal life. It's not incredibly common, affecting approximately 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 6,000 people. If the blood tests come back positive, it would confirm the diagnosis. In that case, I would refer you to a neurologist – a specialist in disorders of the nervous system – for further evaluation and management. They would perform additional tests, such as a nerve conduction study and electromyography , to assess the extent of the condition and determine the best course of treatment for you. It’s important to remember that it is treatable. In the meantime, I want to emphasize that we’re still in the early stages of investigation. The blood tests will give us valuable information, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. We’ll discuss all the results with you thoroughly and develop a personalized treatment plan if necessary. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… makes a bit more sense. A neurologist… that sounds… serious. But I understand we need to rule things out and get a proper diagnosis. And it's good to know it's treatable, even if there isn't a cure. Okay, so blood tests first. How long will that take? And do I need to do anything special to prepare for them? Also, should I be avoiding any activities in the meantime? I'm worried about making things worse. I mostly just want to take things easy. Thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. It’s… reassuring to have someone to talk to about this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. It’s my job to help you understand what’s going on and to provide the best possible care. The blood tests should take approximately 24-48 hours for the results to come back. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare for them – just a standard blood draw. I will give you a lab slip with instructions when you leave. Regarding activities, it’s a good idea to take it easy for the time being, especially any strenuous activities that might worsen your weakness. Avoid prolonged periods of exertion and listen to your body. If you notice any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. You may find your symptoms fluctuating. It’s not uncommon. I will have the lab slip printed for you now. I'll also give you some written information about Myasthenia Gravis. While it is important to be prepared, it's also important to remember we haven't confirmed anything yet. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I’ll try to take it easy and listen to my body, and I’ll contact the office if anything changes. Thank you for the information. I will follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. We will contact you as soon as the results are available. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Wishing you all the best, and please remember to take care. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
