DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Oriley, yes, that’s me. It’s… a certification, I believe. Something about needing to be certified for my… work. Honestly, the details escape me. It was my ex-wife who scheduled it, you see. She’s always been the organized one.
DOCTOR: Alright, a certification appointment. That's perfectly alright. We can certainly sort that out. To start, and just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit about what kind of work you do?
PATIENT: Healthcare… technical things. All sorts of things, really. It’s not terribly important, is it? I mean, if they require certification, I suppose it must be something. I’ve been doing it for… well, a very long time. I wouldn’t bother coming if it wasn’t necessary. Do you need specifics? Because I really don’t recall them offhand. It involves… machines, mostly. And people. Naturally.
DOCTOR: No, no, don't worry about specifics right now. Just “healthcare technical things” is fine for now. It’s helpful to know the general area. And you’re right, we only need the certification if it's required. Now, have you had any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well, I seem to be… losing my hearing, I suppose. It’s not dreadful, but I do find myself asking people to repeat themselves more often. My ex-wife pointed it out, naturally. Said I was becoming “difficult to converse with.” She has a way with words, that woman. And my eyesight… perhaps not as sharp as it once was. Reading small print is becoming a chore. Though that could just be the lighting in my flat. It’s rather dim, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, hearing and vision changes. Those are both important to note. It's good your ex-wife brought them to your attention. We can certainly check those out today. Beyond those changes, have you noticed any other new symptoms – anything at all that's different from how you usually feel?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness. I'm an older man, Doctor. What doesn't ache? No, I haven't anything… dramatic. A bit of fatigue, perhaps, but I attribute that to the general… state of things. And my knees are a bit creaky in the mornings. But really, nothing that requires a doctor, if you understand me. I'm not one for fussing over minor discomforts. Though I suppose that’s what you're paid for, isn't it? Finding things wrong with perfectly functional people.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're generally feeling functional. Fatigue and knee discomfort are common, and we can certainly discuss those as well. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Shortness of breath? Doctor, I assure you, I’m not that old. No, no chest pain. My breathing is… adequate. And my weight? I haven’t stepped on a scale in years. I eat when I’m hungry, and that’s that. It’s all rather simple, really. I’m a fairly straightforward man. Are we getting anywhere with this certification, or are we simply cataloging the aches and pains of a senior citizen? Honestly, I have a rather pressing appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Oriley. Just a few more questions, and then we can move on to the certification requirements. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past – anything you've been treated for before?
PATIENT: Significant… conditions? Oh dear. That was… a long time ago. I believe I had the measles as a child. And perhaps a bout of pneumonia once. But that was decades ago, before your time, I imagine. Nothing serious. Nothing that required… prolonged attention. I’ve always been rather robust, you see. A strong constitution. I don’t recall any… specialists. Doctors always fussed, but it was never anything truly alarming. Honestly, I’m starting to forget what it was even for. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Alright, measles and a bout of pneumonia in the past. That's helpful to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I believe I had my tonsils out when I was quite young. And… possibly an appendectomy? It's all rather hazy. My mother handled all the arrangements, you see. She was very efficient. I wasn't terribly involved in the details. It was… a long time ago. Before… well, before everything, really. I wouldn't stake my life on it, but I seem to recall a brief stay in the hospital. It was nothing dramatic, I assure you. Just a routine procedure, I believe. Is this getting us any closer to this certification?
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Mr. Oriley. Just a few more questions, and then we can discuss the certification. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, Doctor, I'm a remarkably resilient man. I eat everything put in front of me. And I've taken medications when necessary, of course, but I've never had any… unpleasant reactions. Perhaps a mild headache occasionally, but nothing that required a trip to the emergency room. I'm not one for sensitivities, you see. A strong constitution, as I mentioned. Honestly, I suspect these questions are more for your benefit than mine. Are we finished with the interrogations? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No, no, nothing at all. I prefer to let nature take its course, you see. I don't believe in relying on artificial remedies. A bit of rest, a healthy diet—that’s all I need. I’ve always been a rather… self-sufficient man. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect my ex-wife is the only one who ever bothered with pills and potions. She was a bit of a hypochondriac, if I’m being honest. Are we finally getting to this certification? I really do have an appointment. A pressing one.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Very good. Now, let’s talk about this certification. Do you happen to know what organization requires this certification, and what the certification is for specifically?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, that’s precisely what I can’t recall! My ex-wife handled all of that. She said it was… something to do with my work. To ensure I was… up to date. It involves… technical standards, I believe. Something about safety regulations. I’ve been doing this work for decades, I assure you, I’m perfectly capable. But she insisted on this certification. Something about a new directive. I really wish she'd provided me with more details. It's all rather frustrating. Is there anyone I can contact to get this information? Perhaps a number? I really shouldn't have to endure this, you know. I just want to get it over with. .
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's certainly frustrating when you don’t have all the details. Let’s see if we can figure this out. Do you have any paperwork related to this appointment?
