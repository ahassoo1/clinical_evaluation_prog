DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Sobkowicz, welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Just… chest. Hurts sometimes. And… heart goes fast. Doctor say blood pressure high too. Old man problems, you know? Get on with it, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Chest hurts sometimes and heart goes fast,” and your previous doctor mentioned high blood pressure. We’ll definitely get to the bottom of things. To start, can you tell me a little more about this chest pain?
PATIENT: More…? What more is there to say? It hurts! Like… pressure. Sometimes feel like someone sitting on my chest. Not all the time. Just… when I walk too much, maybe. Or… when I get upset. Is that enough? I don’t have time for a story.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. “Pressure, like someone sitting on your chest,” that comes on with walking or when you’re upset. That gives me a better idea. Does the pain radiate – meaning, does it spread anywhere else, like your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiate? You use big words, Doctor. I… sometimes feel it in my left arm. A little. Not always. Mostly just the chest. Like a tight band. This is taking too long. Is it serious? Just tell me if I need pills or not.
DOCTOR: Okay, “tight band” in the chest, sometimes spreading to your left arm. And you're understandably concerned about whether you need medication. To help me figure that out, let’s go through a few more questions, if you don't mind. It's important to get a complete picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain and fast heart rate?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Like what? I get tired easy. Old man tired. I… sometimes short of breath. When I climb stairs. That’s it! Nothing else. Really. I just want to know if I’m going to drop dead, Doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. “Tired easily, short of breath when climbing stairs” – that’s good to know. Before we talk about what might be going on, I'd like to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Get it over with. Just… don’t poke too much. And be quick about it. I have a garden to get back to. A man's tomatoes don’t water themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I’ll take a quick look at your extremities – your arms and legs. Okay, heart rate is a bit fast, around 98 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished in the bases. Blood pressure is 162 over 94. Pulses are a bit weak, but present in all extremities. No swelling noted. Skin is warm and dry.
PATIENT: 162…? That high? See! I told you it was bad! What does that mean? Is it the heart? Is it… the end? My wife will be upset. She likes the tomatoes too. Just tell me straight, Doctor. No fancy words. Am I going to need a hospital?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your concern. A blood pressure of 162 over 94 is elevated, and it’s good we’re checking it. It does contribute to the chest pain and shortness of breath you’re experiencing. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, it sounds like you are likely dealing with uncontrolled hypertension—high blood pressure—and possibly some underlying heart issues. The chest pain could be angina, which is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart, and the shortness of breath can be related to that as well. However, I can't give you a definitive diagnosis without further testing. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order an EKG—that's a quick and painless test that records your heart's electrical activity—and a basic blood panel. I also think a chest X-ray would be helpful. As for whether you need the hospital right now, no, I don’t think so. But we do need to investigate this further quickly. Would you be comfortable scheduling those tests today?
PATIENT: Tests…? More waiting? Fine. Just… get it done. But no poking! And… can I get the results quickly? My wife… she worries. And the tomatoes… they need me. And I don't want to sit in a hospital all day. Schedule the tests, but make it fast. And tell me what they're for in plain English, Doctor. No big words.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand your concerns, and I'll make sure everything is scheduled as quickly as possible. The EKG will show us if there's any irregular heartbeat or signs of a previous heart attack. It's like taking a picture of your heart's electrical activity. The blood panel will tell us about your cholesterol levels and kidney function, as high blood pressure can affect those. And the chest X-ray will help us see if there’s any fluid in your lungs or any other issues. I’ll have my nurse schedule you for those tests this afternoon. The results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours, and we'll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a blood pressure medication to help lower your pressure. It’s a common medication, and it should help relieve some of your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Medication… hmph. Fine. As long as it doesn't make me sick. And… is it expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. Just make sure it's something I can afford. And… tell me what it does, in plain English. No fancy words. And… can I still garden? I need my tomatoes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand your concerns about cost and side effects, and I’ll make sure to prescribe something that’s both effective and affordable. I'm going to prescribe Lisinopril, a common medication for high blood pressure. It works by relaxing your blood vessels, which makes it easier for your heart to pump blood and lowers your pressure. As for side effects, some people experience a mild cough or dizziness, but those usually go away within a few days. We’ll monitor you closely to make sure you’re not experiencing any problems. It’s a generic medication, and it should be relatively inexpensive—around $10-$20 per month, depending on your insurance. I can also help you find a discount card if needed. And yes, you should still be able to garden! Just try to avoid strenuous activity when you're first starting the medication, and listen to your body. If you feel tired or short of breath, take a break. We want you to enjoy your tomatoes, not risk your health. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… get the tests done quickly. And… don’t make me sick with the pills. My wife would be upset. And the tomatoes… they need me. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowicz. We’ll get those tests scheduled right away, and I'll do my best to keep the medication side effects to a minimum. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your tests and go over everything with you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And yes, we want to keep you healthy and enjoying those tomatoes! Have a good day, Mr. Sobkowicz.
