DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ardelle Oitker, 81 years old. Let’s get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it's this tiredness. Just… so tired. Seems to come and go, but when it is here, I can barely lift a thing. And the young man at the lab said something about my… my numbers being off. Something about my muscles? Honestly, I don't pay much attention to those things. My husband usually handles all that.
DOCTOR: "Numbers being off," right. Wonderful. Okay. So, tiredness… comes and goes. And something about muscle numbers from the lab. Do you remember when this tiredness started?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? Honestly, everything's a bit of a blur these days. It feels like… a long time. Maybe a few months? It's hard to say, really. I've always been a bit… delicate, you see. Not like these strong young women nowadays.
DOCTOR: A few months. Right. And besides just being tired, are you noticing anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else? Hmm… well, my bones ache a bit. Always have, really. And I get a bit breathless just walking to the shops. But that's just old age, isn't it? Everyone my age feels that way. I don't see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Bones ache, breathless… Medicare, suburban location. Let's see what the EHR says. Have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Falls? Oh, goodness no. I'm very careful. Though… now that you mention it, I did stumble a bit last week getting out of the car. But I caught myself, thank heavens. My husband was right there to help, of course. He’s a very strong man.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you had any recent hospital stays or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… medications… I take a little pill for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white one. And… oh! And something for my arthritis. A yellow one, I think. I just let my husband sort all that out, honestly. He knows what I need. As for hospitals… not recently, no. Had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was ages and ages ago.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, arthritis medication, gallbladder removal… Years ago. Right. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I eat everything. I used to be a very good cook, you know. My husband says I make the best momos in the whole state. Never had a problem with allergies. Though… I don't care for cilantro. It tastes like soap, honestly. But that's not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, cilantro isn’t an allergy. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have my book club this afternoon, you see. And I promised to bring the biscuits.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please sit here. 150/88… not terrible. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply. A bit of crackling… probably just age. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh dear, reflexes? I never was very good at sports, you know. Always clumsy. I do hope this doesn’t take too long… my biscuits might get cold.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are diminished, as expected. Some mild swelling in your hands, but nothing concerning. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing some age-related muscle weakness and fatigue, potentially exacerbated by the medications you’re taking. We should check your Vitamin D levels and a basic metabolic panel. I’ll order those tests for you.
PATIENT: Oh. Tests? More numbers? Honestly, I just wish I knew what was wrong with me, instead of being poked and prodded and having numbers thrown at me. Will these tests at least tell me if I need to rest more? My husband keeps saying I overdo it, but I like being busy.
DOCTOR: The tests will give us a better idea of what’s going on. And yes, potentially indicate if you need to slow down. I’m also going to order a CBC to rule out anemia. The lab results will be available in a few days. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss them. For now, try to get a bit more rest, and continue taking your medications as prescribed. Any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Oh, goodness. Let me think… Will I be able to still go to book club? That’s really the most important thing, isn’t it? And… will these tests make me feel worse before I feel better? I do hope not.
DOCTOR: No, the tests won’t make you feel worse. And yes, you can still go to book club. Just… try not to lift anything heavy before then. Here are the lab requisitions. The nurse will explain everything. Next patient. .
PATIENT: Oh… alright then. Thank you, I suppose. I do hope they explain everything clearly. I’m not very good with… with all of this.
