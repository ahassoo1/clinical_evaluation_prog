DOCTOR: Hi Jammal, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Polczynski. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank... I have been, how you say... passing a lot of gas. Much more than is comfortable. It is… embarrassing, really. It has been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Passing a lot of gas can be really uncomfortable and, like you said, embarrassing. It's good you came in to talk about it. A month, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately one month. It doesn't hurt, exactly… more of a… fullness. And the sound, sometimes. It is quite… noticeable. I eat normal food, I think. Nothing too strange. Just… regular things. Do you need to know what I eat? I can try to remember.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful to get a better idea of what you typically eat, yes. Not to scrutinize, just to see if anything might be contributing. Roughly, what does a typical day of meals look like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. For breakfast, usually just toast. Sometimes with a little jam. And coffee, of course. Then, for lunch, often a sandwich. Ham and cheese, or turkey. Nothing fancy. Dinner… varies. Sometimes I cook, like chicken and potatoes. Sometimes I get something quick, like… a burger and fries. I drink a lot of water, too. And… oh, yes! I do enjoy a sweet roll with my coffee, sometimes two.
DOCTOR: Okay, toast, coffee, sandwiches, chicken, potatoes, burgers, fries… and sweet rolls. That's helpful, thank you. And you said you drink a lot of water – that's good. Any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I have been eating mostly the same things for a long time, I think. Perhaps… a little more coffee lately? It has been very warm, and I find it… refreshing. But that is the only change I can think of. I have not tried any new foods, or anything like that. Do you think it could be the coffee?
DOCTOR: Coffee could be a factor, yes. Caffeine can stimulate the digestive system, and sometimes that can lead to increased gas. It’s also possible it’s something else, though. Have you noticed if it's worse after certain meals, or at a particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I believe it is… more noticeable after dinner. When I have had the chicken and potatoes, or perhaps… the burger and fries. Not so much after toast in the morning. And the sweet rolls… well, they sometimes cause a little… bubbling, but not always. It is very strange. Like it depends on… the day, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse after dinner, especially with heavier meals like chicken, potatoes or burgers. And sometimes with the sweet rolls, but not consistently. That does sound a bit unpredictable. Have you experienced any other digestive symptoms along with the gas?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think carefully. Sometimes, a little… bloating. Like my stomach feels full, even when it is not. And occasionally, a little… discomfort. Not pain, exactly, more of a… pressure. But that is not always. And… oh! Sometimes after dinner, I feel a little… tired. But that could just be from eating too much, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating, occasional pressure, and sometimes feeling tired after dinner. That gives me a little more to work with. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes in… bowel movements? Hmm. I… believe they are fairly regular. Not particularly… different than usual. Maybe a little… looser sometimes. But nothing dramatic. I do not have any trouble going, if that is what you mean. Just… not as firm, perhaps, on occasion.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally regular, but sometimes a bit looser than usual. Alright. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now, just to listen to your abdomen and check for anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Please, proceed. I do hope it is not anything too serious.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that. It's likely nothing serious, but it's always best to rule things out. Please lie down on the examination table, and I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Alright. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds – no signs of obstruction or anything immediately concerning. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness or masses. Everything feels okay, physically.
PATIENT: That is… very reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. So, what do you think is causing all the… gas? Is it the coffee, perhaps? Or something else entirely? I do appreciate you examining me, even if it does not seem to be anything serious.
DOCTOR: Given your symptoms and the exam, it sounds like you likely have what we call functional bloating and gas. That means your digestive system isn’t functioning optimally, leading to increased gas production and discomfort, but there’s no underlying disease causing it. The coffee could certainly be contributing, as can other foods like those high in fiber or simple sugars. However, sometimes it can be related to how quickly you eat, swallowing air, or even stress. We can try a few things to see if it improves. Would you be open to keeping a food diary for a week, noting what you eat and when you experience gas?
PATIENT: A food diary… yes, I believe I can do that. It will require some… effort, but I am willing to try anything that might help. And you mentioned… stress? I do worry from time to time, it is true. But I do not think that is the main cause. Still, I will try to keep track of that as well, if you think it is important.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to rule things out, and stress can sometimes play a bigger role than we realize. The food diary will give us a clearer picture of what might be triggering your symptoms. Also, try to eat slowly, chew your food thoroughly, and avoid carbonated beverages. We can also consider a trial of a low-FODMAP diet if the food diary doesn’t give us enough information, but let’s start with the diary for now. I’ll print out a form for you to fill out. If your symptoms worsen or you develop any new symptoms like abdominal pain, bloody stools, or weight loss, please contact the clinic immediately. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a very reasonable plan, Doctor. I will certainly try to eat more slowly and avoid the carbonated drinks. And I will keep a careful diary, as you suggest. Thank you for being so… thorough. I feel much better knowing we are taking steps to address this. And I will contact the clinic immediately if anything changes, as you advised.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jammal. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. Remember, it’s likely nothing serious, but it's always best to be proactive. Here’s that food diary form. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss your findings. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been most helpful, and I appreciate your time and patience. Two weeks sounds perfect for a follow-up. I will do my best to fill out the diary diligently. Thank you again for everything. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jammal. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. Have a good day.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Polczynski. I will certainly keep that in mind. And thank you again for your kindness. You have a good day, too.
