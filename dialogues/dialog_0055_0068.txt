DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I am Dr. Eaddy. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… the swelling. After the cancer, you see? It’s mostly in my legs, but sometimes my arms too. It's just… puffy. It’s annoying, really. I want it to go away.
DOCTOR: “After the cancer,” you say. Very well. Could you elaborate on the cancer treatment you received?
PATIENT: Oh… um. It was… a long time ago now. Maybe five years? They gave me… pills. Lots of pills. And then… the radiation. Yes, radiation. It made my hair fall out, of course. And I was very tired. I don't remember all the names of the things, honestly. It was a lot to keep track of, you know? I just want the swelling gone now. Is that… fixable?
DOCTOR: Five years post-treatment… a rather vague recollection, unfortunately. It makes it difficult to assess the situation properly. Do you recall where the cancer was located, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was… in my breast, I believe. Yes, my right breast. They… removed it. And then all the pills and the radiation, like I said. It was a very… upsetting time. Honestly, I don't like to think about it too much. Does knowing where it was help with the swelling? It feels… heavy, you know? Like my legs are filled with water.
DOCTOR: Right breast, and subsequent radiation therapy. It is not uncommon to experience lymphedema following such treatment, although five years is a considerable time. Have you noticed any changes in the appearance of your skin on your legs?
PATIENT: Lym-pe-de-ma? Is that… a fancy name for the swelling? I don’t know. Changes in my skin… um. It's a little harder, maybe? And… sometimes it feels itchy. Not all the time, but sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It just doesn't feel right, you know? It’s not smooth like it used to be. More bumpy. Oh, and it’s warmer too, I think. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Harder skin, bumpy texture, and warmth… those are certainly pertinent details, Ms. Queener. It could indicate some degree of infection, or a more chronic inflammatory process. Let’s have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh… infection? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good. Are you going to… poke me? I don’t like needles. And I hope it doesn’t hurt. Please be gentle? I’m a bit of a… baby, when it comes to things like that.
DOCTOR: Needles are rarely required for a simple examination, Ms. Queener. I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. I simply need to palpate your legs to assess the extent and nature of the swelling. Please, allow me to proceed. I need to feel the area to properly evaluate it. It’s hardly an invasive procedure.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Pal-pa-te… you mean just… touch? That’s okay, then. Just… don’t poke. And try not to take too long, please? I have an appointment later this afternoon. It’s… hair appointment. Very important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see… yes, there is definite pitting edema present. And your skin does feel warmer than normal to the touch. It appears to be most pronounced in the lower leg. Do you experience any pain or discomfort with this palpation?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a bit uncomfortable, yes. Not terrible pain, but… a dull ache, maybe? It feels… squishy. Like squeezing a water balloon. Is that bad? And it is warm, isn’t it? Like a hot water bottle. Not feverish, just… warm. Like you said. I really don’t like this feeling.
DOCTOR: “Squishy,” and a dull ache… yes, these findings are consistent with lymphedema, though the warmth warrants further investigation. We need to rule out cellulitis, an infection of the skin and underlying tissues. Now, let’s examine the other leg… is this leg similarly affected?
PATIENT: Yes… it feels about the same, I think. Maybe not quite as puffy, but… still swollen. And warm. It’s hard to tell, really. They both feel… heavy and uncomfortable. I mostly just want it to stop. It makes my shoes feel tight. And I can’t wear my pretty sandals.
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on my examination, you are experiencing bilateral lower extremity edema, likely secondary to lymphedema following your breast cancer treatment. However, the presence of warmth raises concern for possible cellulitis. To determine the cause definitively, we will need to conduct some blood work. I will order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. It’s a standard procedure.
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh dear. I don’t like needles… at all. Will it hurt a lot? And how long will it take? I really do have that hair appointment, you know. It's very important.
DOCTOR: Ms. Queener, the blood draw itself is a brief discomfort, at most. A small pinch, that’s all. It will take only a few minutes, and the laboratory is quite efficient. As for your hair appointment, we will ensure the blood work is expedited. It’s hardly a life-or-death situation, and I’m certain they can accommodate you. However, it is imperative that we ascertain the underlying cause of this swelling to ensure you receive appropriate treatment. A pretty hairstyle is hardly a substitute for proper medical care.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright. If it’s just a small pinch. And you promise it won’t take too long. I suppose I can manage that. But I expect you to be quick about it. And please, no poking. Where do I go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: The laboratory is just down the hall, room 203. They are expecting you. Take this form with you, and they will assist you. Once the results are available, they will be automatically sent to my office. I will review them and contact you to discuss the next steps. I suggest you proceed promptly, Ms. Queener. My schedule is quite full this afternoon.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it doesn't take too long. And I really do appreciate you trying to be quick.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome. Do try not to worry unnecessarily.
