DOCTOR: Hello Amy, welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Kamahele. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been… well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen, and it’s been making me a little anxious, so I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand why that would be concerning. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It feels firm, not squishy, and it’s maybe the size of a plum? It doesn't hurt constantly, but it’s tender to the touch sometimes. I first noticed it a few weeks ago, and it doesn't seem to be getting smaller, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: A plum-sized, firm lump that’s tender… okay. And you said a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, about three or four weeks ago, I think. It was… gradual. I didn't wake up one day and it was suddenly there. It sort of just appeared over a few days, and I kept thinking it was just something I was imagining at first. But then my wife noticed it too, so I figured it was worth getting a professional opinion.
DOCTOR: That’s good you had your wife take a look, and you're right to get it checked out. Has anything changed about it since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so. It doesn’t seem bigger, and the tenderness hasn’t gotten dramatically worse, but it hasn't gone away either, as I mentioned. I haven’t noticed any other symptoms… no pain elsewhere, no changes in my bowel habits, no fever or anything like that. Just the lump.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms. That's helpful to know. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, if that's alright. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me think… I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, maybe ten or twelve years old, but I recovered fully. Otherwise, nothing major. I do have slightly high blood pressure, which my family doctor monitors, but it's usually well-controlled with medication. And, uh, I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia as a child, high blood pressure controlled with medication, and appendix removed. Yes, all of that is good to know. And the appendix removal is relevant. Do you remember when you had your appendix removed, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me see… I was probably around sixteen or seventeen. So, that would have been… almost twenty years ago now, I suppose. 2005 or 2006, roughly. It was a pretty standard procedure, nothing complicated. I healed well and haven’t had any issues since.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about family history?
PATIENT: That’s a tricky one. My mother had… some heart problems when she was older, and my father had diabetes. On my mother’s side, my grandmother had breast cancer, but that was a long time ago. I don’t know much beyond that, to be honest. We weren’t very close, and health history wasn’t really discussed much in my family. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful. Knowing even a little is better than nothing. Okay, and just a few more questions before I examine you. Do you take any medications regularly, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, just the blood pressure medication, Lisinopril, 20mg daily. And I take a multivitamin, but that’s it. Nothing else prescribed or over-the-counter regularly. I try to stay healthy, so I don’t rely on many pills. I also drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. And you mentioned drinking a lot of water, which is excellent. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. No food allergies, no issues with antibiotics or any other medications. I’ve always been pretty good on that front. I do get hay fever in the spring, but it’s just sneezing and a runny nose, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright Amy, I'm going to listen to your abdomen and then feel around. Please lie back on the examination table. Let me know if anything is uncomfortable. Just try to relax, and I'll be as gentle as possible.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Relaxing… I'll do my best. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing normally. Sounds normal so far. Okay, a little tenderness here… Hmm… yes, that’s definitely tender. Firm, roughly plum-sized… not easily movable. No rebound tenderness… no guarding… I don’t feel any other masses or enlarged organs. Okay. So, based on what you've told me and my initial examination, it’s hard to say definitively what this is. It could be a number of things. Given the location and firmness, we’ll need to do some further investigation to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: That makes sense. I appreciate you being thorough. Further investigation… what kind of investigation are we talking about? Are we thinking… imaging? Blood tests? I'm trying not to jump to conclusions, but… it’s hard not to worry.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry completely. It’s always best to get things checked out. Given the location and your description, I'd like to start with a blood test. It will give us some baseline information, and can rule out some possibilities. We’ll also want to get an abdominal ultrasound. It’s a non-invasive imaging test that can give us a much better view of the lump and the surrounding tissues. An ultrasound can help us determine if it’s a solid mass, a fluid-filled cyst, or something else entirely. It will also help us with size and location. It's the best first step. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. Blood tests and an ultrasound… I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. It's a relief to have a plan. When can we schedule those? And, uh, if you don't mind me asking… what are some of the things you’re thinking this could be? I know you said you don’t want to jump to conclusions, and I respect that, but… just a general idea would be helpful. I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Of course. Preparing is a good idea. We can get the blood test done today, right here in the clinic. I’ll write you a requisition, and the phlebotomist will take care of it. As for the ultrasound, I'll have my assistant schedule that for you. The closest imaging center is about fifteen minutes away. We should be able to get you in within the next few days. As for what it could be… it's difficult to say without imaging. It could be a benign cyst, a lipoma , or a muscle strain. Less commonly, it could be something more concerning, like a hernia or, rarely, a tumor. But it’s important to remember that most abdominal lumps are not cancerous. The imaging will help us narrow down the possibilities. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Benign cyst, lipoma, muscle strain… those all sound much less worrying than the other possibilities. I appreciate you being so upfront and honest. Okay, blood tests today and ultrasound scheduled for the next few days. That sounds good. I trust your judgment, Dr. Kamahele. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. What do I need to do to prepare for the blood tests? And for the ultrasound, is there anything I should eat or avoid beforehand?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I always want my patients to feel informed and comfortable. For the blood tests, there's not much preparation needed. Just try to drink plenty of water beforehand. It makes it easier for the phlebotomist to draw the sample. You can eat normally before the test. As for the ultrasound, you don’t need to fast beforehand. You can eat and drink as usual. However, it's best to avoid carbonated beverages immediately before the test, as they can cause bloating and make it harder to get a clear image. And you may be asked to wear loose-fitting clothing. I’ll also give you a written summary of these instructions before you leave. And I’ll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results come in. That will give us a chance to discuss them in detail and decide on a course of action. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. No fasting, avoid carbonated drinks, and loose-fitting clothing for the ultrasound… I can definitely manage that. And a follow-up appointment to discuss the results… that’s very reassuring. Thank you, Dr. Kamahele. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. I think that’s all my questions for now. I’m ready for the blood tests whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I'm glad I could help. Alright, let’s get you set up with the phlebotomist. She’s right down the hall, in room three. I'll have my assistant, Sarah, bring you the requisition form. And I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, Amy.
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Kamahele. I will. And I appreciate it again.
