DOCTOR: Right. Well, Lilliana Voner, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's me. Lilliana. Though... sometimes I forget how to spell it, honestly. It’s been a while since anyone asked for the full name. It’s good to meet you, Doctor… Osga, right?
DOCTOR: Osga is fine. Look, I have quite a backlog today, so let's try to be… succinct. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sorry. My joints… they're just stiff in the mornings. Especially my hands and knees. It’s… hard to get going, you know? Like an old… rusty gate. It doesn’t hurt bad, just… not easy.
DOCTOR: Right. Stiffness… mornings. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. A while now. Maybe… a year? Or more? It comes and goes, you see. Some days it’s worse than others. I mostly just try to ignore it, but it's getting harder to do things with the grandkids.
DOCTOR: "Ignore it," right. Well, that rarely solves anything. And “comes and goes” isn’t a diagnosis. Do you have any pain with it?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. Not a sharp pain, more of a… ache. Especially if I’ve been using my hands a lot. Like, if I’m baking, or gardening, then later… oof. It’s not constant, though. That’s why I said it comes and goes. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Baking and gardening… interesting. And you say it's worse after activity. Any swelling or redness in the joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Not that I've noticed, no. Maybe a little puffy sometimes, but I thought that was just… from the heat? We had a very warm June. And redness… no, I don’t think so. It just feels… tight. Like they’re not bending right. I'm not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no obvious swelling or redness. Let’s get a quick look. Can you sit up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Just… let me know if I’m doing anything wrong. My knees aren’t the best these days. Is there a place to put my purse?
DOCTOR: There. Now, can you make a fist with both hands for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It's a little hard to squeeze all the way. They feel… stiff, even when I’m trying to make a fist. Do you see anything?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Some mild tenderness on the MCP joints bilaterally. No obvious deformities. Range of motion is… limited. And a little crepitus when you flex. Now, knees. Can you bend each knee for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, knees. It's… harder on this one. Feels like it’s… catching, maybe? And it makes a little… popping sound. The other one isn't so bad, just stiff. It's not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. Do you need me to try anything else?
DOCTOR: Crepitus, limited range of motion... Look, this sounds like typical wear and tear, honestly. Probably some osteoarthritis. It’s common at your age. We can get some X-rays to confirm, but I suspect that’s what we’ll find. Now, do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had… something with my heart, a long time ago. But the doctor said it was okay. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, I think. And… oh dear, I forget. It's been a while since anyone asked me all this. I really am terrible with remembering things. Would it help if I called my daughter? She keeps a list of my medications.
DOCTOR: No, no, don’t bother your daughter. It’s likely just hypertension, managed with medication. We’ll look up your records… eventually. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get hives when I was a little girl, from… something in the garden, maybe? But I haven’t had those in years. Nothing that I’ve ever had to tell a doctor about, if that makes sense. I’m not a very good patient, am I?
DOCTOR: No, you’re not. Alright. Look, we'll get those X-rays done. In the meantime, I'm going to suggest over-the-counter ibuprofen – follow the directions on the bottle, obviously – and try to do some gentle range-of-motion exercises. If it doesn't improve, or gets significantly worse, then we'll talk. Now, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, ibuprofen… yes, alright. Gentle exercises, you said? My daughter showed me some, a long time ago, but I forgot them. Will the X-rays tell me what I should do? And… is it bad? Is it going to get worse, even with the ibuprofen? I just want to be able to play with my grandkids. That’s all.
DOCTOR: The X-rays will confirm the osteoarthritis. Whether it "gets worse" depends on… a lot of things. Weight, activity level, genetics... Look, I can't give you a crystal ball. Ibuprofen manages the inflammation, exercises maintain mobility. It’s a process. As for playing with your grandkids, try not to overdo it, obviously. I have other patients waiting. The radiology department will schedule the X-rays. Here’s a slip with the information. Any further questions, call the office. Don't waste my time with something easily found on the internet, though. Next!
PATIENT: Oh… right. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… try not to overdo it. And I'll call if it gets worse. Thank you again. .
