DOCTOR: Hello, Arbie. Welcome. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about time someone got around to seeing me. I've been… experiencing some things. Things a man shouldn’t have to deal with at my age, frankly. It's my… well, it's in my stool. Blood. Not a little, either. Quite a bit, actually. It's rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbie. That is unsettling, and I understand why you’re concerned. Blood in the stool is always something we need to investigate. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Investigate? What's there to investigate? I’m an old man. Things wear out, don’t they? But alright, alright. It’s… bright red, mostly. Sometimes it's just streaks, other times it's… more mixed in. And it’s not every time, you understand. Just… now and then. I haven't changed my diet or anything. I eat what I've always eaten. Good, solid food. Not like this newfangled stuff these days.
DOCTOR: Bright red blood, you said. And it comes and goes… not with every bowel movement. That’s helpful to know. And no changes to your diet at all?
PATIENT: No changes! Honestly, doctor, do you think I'd forget if I’d started eating… what is everyone eating these days? Kale? I stick to what I know. Steak, potatoes, a bit of salmon when I can get it. And a proper cup of tea. None of that herbal nonsense. It's just… appearing. Like a bad omen, I tell you.
DOCTOR: I understand. It feels alarming when something changes unexpectedly. Okay, Arbie, let's try to get a bit more information. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with the bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, not exactly pain. It's more of a… strain, I suppose. Takes a bit more effort than it used to, getting things… moving. And sometimes a bit of a burning sensation afterwards, but that could just be the tea, couldn’t it? It’s a strong brew. I like it strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, strain with bowel movements and a burning sensation afterward. We'll keep all of that in mind. And you mentioned the tea... It’s good to rule things out. Have you noticed any change in your bowel habits other than the blood and the strain?
PATIENT: Habits? What do you mean, habits? I go to the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom! It's not like I've been keeping a ledger, doctor. But… now that you mention it… it's been a bit… looser, I suppose. Not watery, mind you. Just… not as firm as it used to be. Everything's going downhill, I tell you!
DOCTOR: I understand, Arbie. It sounds like there have been a few changes. Looser stools along with the blood and strain. Alright. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Well, my trousers have been a bit… roomy lately. But that's just old age, isn’t it? Everything sags eventually. I haven't been weighing myself, doctor. What for? I know when I'm losing weight. I can feel it. It's not like I've been wasting away, but… perhaps I haven't been as hungry as usual. Not much appetite, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbie. Thank you for sharing that. It's helpful to get a full picture. Now, would you mind if I listened to your abdomen and did a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh, for goodness sake. Poke and prod, is that it? Honestly. Alright, alright, get on with it. But don't go digging around too much, I haven't had my nap yet. And be gentle! I'm not as young as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Arbie. Very gentle. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently press on your belly to feel for anything unusual. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. Okay, Arbie. Everything seems fairly normal, but I did notice a little tenderness when I pressed here and here It's not significant, but we should investigate further. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness no. I’ve lived a long life, doctor. I’ve taken all sorts of things. A little penicillin here, a bit of aspirin there. Never bothered me none. Though, I do get a bit of heartburn sometimes. But that's just the tea, I tell you! A strong brew, that's what it is. And sometimes, if I eat too much… well, anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And occasional heartburn. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my knees, when they’re acting up. Old age, you know. They creak and groan something awful. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, a bit of that over-the-counter stuff. You know, the one with… diphenhydramine, is it? Makes me a bit drowsy, but it does the trick. Nothing else. I'm not one for popping pills, doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, something for your knees and diphenhydramine for sleep. Thank you for telling me. Arbie, given your symptoms – the blood in your stool, the change in bowel habits, the strain, the tenderness in your abdomen, and the weight loss – I’m concerned enough that we need to do some further testing. I want to order a stool test to check for blood and infection, and I’d like you to have a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Good heavens, doctor, are you serious? Digging around there? I've heard stories! Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn't we just… try something else? Perhaps a stronger tea? I’m not sure I can handle all that poking and prodding. I'm an old man!
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Arbie. It doesn’t sound pleasant, I agree. But a colonoscopy is the best way to find out what’s causing the bleeding. It allows us to see the entire colon and rectum and take a biopsy if needed. It’s the most thorough way to rule out anything serious, like polyps or cancer. It's also important to note the weight loss. While it may be nothing, these symptoms together warrant a careful look. We can discuss the preparation process, which is the least enjoyable part, and I can answer any questions you have. We’ll take it one step at a time. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Cancer?! Now you're scaring me! I’ve lived a long life, doctor. I don't want to spend my last days worrying about… about things like that. But… alright. If you think it’s absolutely necessary… explain it to me, then. But I’m warning you, if it involves anything unpleasant… I might just walk right out of here. And don't expect me to drink anything nasty! I've got a sensitive stomach, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Arbie, and I apologize for causing any alarm. It’s better to be thorough and rule things out, and most of the time, these symptoms are not cancer. But we need to investigate. A colonoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum. The camera allows us to see the entire colon. We’ll give you medication to make you comfortable – you’ll be sedated, so you won’t feel anything during the procedure. The preparation is the less pleasant part. You'll need to follow a special diet for a day or two beforehand and drink a liquid solution to empty your colon. This is to ensure we can see everything clearly. It’s not delicious, I won’t lie, but it’s manageable. We can discuss options to make it easier for you. During the procedure, if we find anything concerning, we can take a small sample of tissue – a biopsy – for examination. The entire procedure usually takes about 30-60 minutes. Afterwards, you’ll be monitored for a short time until the sedation wears off. You may experience some mild cramping and bloating, but this usually resolves quickly. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Sedated, you say? So I won’t feel anything? That's… somewhat reassuring. And it only takes an hour? Alright. But this liquid solution… is it absolutely necessary? Couldn’t we just… skip that part? I’ve got a weak constitution, you know. And I'm not fond of strange liquids. What does it taste like, exactly? Don't tell me it's like that prune juice my mother used to force on me!
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll be sedated, so you won't feel any discomfort during the procedure. The sedation is very safe. Unfortunately, the liquid solution is essential. It's what allows us to get a clear view of your colon. If the colon isn’t completely empty, we won’t be able to see anything properly, and we’d have to repeat the procedure. As for the taste… it's not pleasant, I won't lie. It’s usually a salty, slightly sweet flavor. Some people say it tastes like sports drinks, but… not a very good one. It's important to drink it quickly, and we can give you tips to make it easier, like chilling it or drinking it with a straw. We can also discuss different preparation solutions if you have concerns about the taste. Some are more tolerable than others. We also have options for splitting the preparation into two doses to make it easier on your system. Do you think we can work with that?
PATIENT: Splitting it into two doses… that sounds… marginally better. And chilling it. Yes, chilling it is a must. And perhaps a straw. A long straw, so I don’t have to… taste it too much. Alright. I suppose I can try it. But if I’m feeling particularly unwell afterwards, I’m blaming you, doctor. And I expect a full report afterwards. No sugarcoating! I want to know everything.
DOCTOR: You have it, Arbie. We can definitely split the preparation into two doses, chill it, and provide a long straw. And I promise a full, honest report afterwards. No sugarcoating at all. I'll explain everything to you in detail, and we’ll discuss the results together. I’ll write you a referral for the colonoscopy, and the specialist’s office will contact you to schedule an appointment. They’ll also provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or persistent bleeding – please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now. Just… remind me again who I need to contact to schedule this… ordeal? And tell me their name. I don't want to end up talking to some young whipper-snapper who doesn't understand my concerns.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Arbie. Here’s the referral. You’ll be contacting Dr. Eleanor Vance at City General Hospital. She’s a very experienced gastroenterologist and is known for being patient and understanding. Her number is 555-123-4567. The office staff will guide you through the scheduling process and answer any questions you have about the preparation. I’ve also made a note in your file about your concerns, so the office will be aware of them. I hope everything goes smoothly for you, Arbie. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, doctor. Though I still think this is a bit extreme… Alright. I suppose I’ll give Dr. Vance a call. And I’m holding you responsible for her bedside manner! Good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbie. And I understand your concerns. I’m confident Dr. Vance will take excellent care of you. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a good day as well.
