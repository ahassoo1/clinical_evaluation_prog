DOCTOR: Hi Terasa, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been… acting up. And my daughter, bless her, she said I should come. Something about my family, too, but I can’t rightly remember what she said. It’s all a bit fuzzy, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, ears acting up… and a bit of fuzziness about family history, that’s alright, we can sort that out. Let’s focus on your ears first. Can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on with them?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Sometimes, all of a sudden, I just… can’t hear. Like someone turned the volume right down. Then it comes back, usually. But when it happens, I get so dizzy. Really dizzy. It feels like the room is spinning. It doesn’t last long, but it’s frightening. It’s happened a couple of times now… maybe three? I’m not sure. It’s hard to keep track, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent hearing loss with dizziness – that’s important. And you said three times now?
PATIENT: Three… or maybe four? It's been in the last few months, definitely. Not all at once, mind you. Spread out. And it’s not like a constant ringing, or anything. Just… gone. Then back. It’s just… unsettling. My husband, God rest his soul, he never had anything like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent hearing loss with dizziness, happening over the last few months. No constant ringing. I understand it’s unsettling. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. When this happens, does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm… Not that I’ve noticed, no. It just… comes on. Sometimes I’m just sitting, reading, and poof. Gone. Other times I might be walking, or doing something around the house. Doesn’t seem to matter. It’s very… random. Is that…normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, random onset is good to know. It's not necessarily normal, but it does help us narrow things down. Do you notice any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes… a little bit of nausea, maybe? Not full-blown vomiting, just… queasy. And like I said, the dizziness is the worst part. It’s a spinning feeling, like I’m on a boat. And… sometimes my ears feel a little… full? Like they’re blocked. But not always. It’s all a bit of a jumble, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea and a feeling of fullness in your ears sometimes accompany the dizziness and hearing loss. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. I see the doctor for my blood pressure, you know, keeps it under control with pills. And… I had my gallbladder out years ago. But other than that… not much, I don't think. My daughter handles most of that now. She’s very good with those things. I mostly just take the pills she gives me. Is that… enough information?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. So, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal in the past. And your daughter helps with managing your medications, that’s good. What about any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take the pills my daughter gives me, like I said, and they seem to be fine. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but I haven’t been stung in years. More concerned about the weather these days, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And you’re currently taking medication for high blood pressure, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A little white pill. I take it every morning. My daughter makes sure I don’t forget. She’s a good girl, my daughter. I’m not very good at remembering things, you see. It’s getting worse, I think. That’s why I’m glad she comes with me to these appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little white pill for blood pressure. And you've mentioned some memory concerns. I want to make sure we address everything. Do you know the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a hard one. It’s… white, as I said. And small. My daughter writes it down for me, on a list. I… I don’t remember the name. It’s… a long name, I think. Something… complicated. I’m sorry. I really wish I could remember. It’s just… gone. I’m afraid my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can look it up. Okay, it looks like you're taking Lisinopril. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Lisin… Lisinopril? Yes… yes, I think so. That sounds… familiar. My daughter must have told me that name. I just… don’t retain things very well, you see. It’s… frustrating. Thank you for finding that for me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. Good. Now, before we move on, let's briefly discuss your family history. Do you know of any hearing loss or balance problems in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, that's a tricky one. My mother… she had trouble hearing towards the end, I think. But she was very old, you see. And my brother… he had some dizziness sometimes, but he drank a lot. I don't really know. It was a long time ago. It’s just… fuzzy. I remember bits and pieces, but nothing clear. I’m afraid my memory isn’t much help. It’s all a bit of a jumble, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, some hearing loss in your mother, and dizziness in your brother. That’s helpful. Alright, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope, check your balance, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please. My ears are a bit sensitive. And… try not to startle me. I jump easily these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Terasa, everything looks reasonably normal on initial examination. Your ear canals are clear, but your eardrums are a little bit retracted, which could be contributing to your symptoms. You have some mild unsteadiness with balance, and I'm detecting a slight heart murmur. I don't think it’s anything serious, but we should investigate further. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I would like to order a few tests. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. What kind of tests? I don’t like tests. Are they… painful? And how long will they take? I have a hair appointment on Friday, you see… I just… I get nervous, easily.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Terasa. The tests aren't painful at all. We'll start with a simple hearing test – an audiogram – to see how well you're hearing different sounds. It involves wearing headphones and responding when you hear tones. Then, I'd like to order a balance test – a VNG – which measures your eye movements to see how well your inner ear is working. It might make you feel a little dizzy, but it's usually brief. And finally, an EKG to get a more detailed look at your heart rhythm, since I detected a murmur. The hearing and balance tests will take about 30-45 minutes each, and the EKG only takes a few minutes. We can schedule them for any time next week. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… a lot. My daughter usually comes with me to these things. Is it alright if she joins me for the tests? I get very flustered when I’m alone. And… will the tests interfere with my hair appointment? It’s on Friday afternoon… I just… I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Terasa. Your daughter is more than welcome to join you for the tests. It's always good to have support. And we can definitely schedule the tests for earlier in the week so they don't interfere with your hair appointment. How about Tuesday morning for the hearing test, and Wednesday morning for the balance test and EKG?
PATIENT: Tuesday and Wednesday… yes, that should be alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… will I need to do anything to prepare for the tests? Fasting, or… anything like that? I just… I want to make sure I do everything right. My daughter gets very worried if I don't follow instructions.
DOCTOR: No special preparation is needed for any of the tests, Terasa. You can eat and drink normally. Just come as you are, and we'll take it from there. I'll write down the appointment times for you, and also give you a referral slip for the tests. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I… I just hope it’s nothing serious. I don’t want to be a bother. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. I think… I think that’s all for now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to figure out what's going on. Don't worry, we'll take things one step at a time. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointments, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I'll see you on Tuesday. .
