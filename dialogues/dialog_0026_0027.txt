DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get this over with. It’s this… heartburn, I guess. And stuff coming back up. It’s quite unpleasant, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, heartburn and… regurgitation, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, regurgitation. Honestly, it’s… uncouth. And it happens after I eat, usually. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Though, I do eat quite well, I must say. Not like some people, filling up on garbage.
DOCTOR: I understand. And when you say "after you eat," how long after eating does this usually happen?
PATIENT: Oh, you want specifics, do you? Well, usually within an hour or so. Sometimes right after, sometimes a little longer. It's not exact, you know. I'm not a scientist timing my meals and… expulsions. It's just annoying. And it makes me feel… less than dignified.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It sounds quite bothersome. And you mentioned it happens regardless of what you eat… has this been a long-term issue, or is it something new?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been going on for… well, a while now. Months, at least. Probably longer, honestly. I don't really keep track of these things. I just know it's always there, lurking. And it’s getting… worse, I suppose. That’s why I’m here, finally. My wife insisted. She says I'm “grimacing too much” during dinner. Women, honestly. They notice everything.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like it’s become more frequent or intense recently. Aside from the heartburn and regurgitation, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? Like… am I turning green? No. Look, I eat a perfectly balanced diet. I don't have any… problems like that. No trouble swallowing, I suppose. And no chest pain, if that's what you're getting at. Though, my back does ache sometimes. But that’s probably just old age. And lifting heavy things. I do a lot of work around the house. Unlike some people.
DOCTOR: Okay, no trouble swallowing or chest pain, and back pain… that’s good to know. Have you noticed any bloating, nausea, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Nausea? Good heavens, no. I wouldn’t tolerate that. And my appetite is just fine, thank you very much. I enjoy my meals. Bloating… well, maybe a little sometimes. But I wouldn’t call it significant. It’s just… puffiness. I’m a big man, you see. I have… presence. Not like some of these… skinny types. Everything’s a little… expanded. But it's not a problem. Honestly, are we getting anywhere with this? This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little puffiness, but no significant nausea. And I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. We are getting there. To help me get a better picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, I've been perfectly healthy my entire life. A few colds, of course. But nothing serious. I don’t believe in coddling doctors and complaining about every little ache and pain. My father was the same way. Strong Polish stock, you know. We don’t get sick. As for medications… I take a vitamin D supplement, that's it. My wife makes me. Says I don’t get enough sun. Really, I’m wasting my time here. Do you even know what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: I understand. No major medical problems, just a vitamin D supplement. That's helpful to know. And no family history of any digestive issues that you're aware of?
