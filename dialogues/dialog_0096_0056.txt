DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Good to see you... well, as good as can be expected for a visit to the doctor, I suppose. Now, you’re 87, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… correct. Eighty-seven. Though frankly, at my age, one loses track. Are we going to get on with it? I have a rather important cataloguing project waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course. Cataloguing. Right. Well, let's not waste any time then. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s… well, it’s the students. Honestly, the students. They have no respect for knowledge anymore. And the administration… always asking me to use these… digital systems. It’s quite disruptive. It’s… stressful, you understand. I simply can’t concentrate. It’s ruining my system, my order. Is that… sufficient? I don't really enjoy discussing personal matters.
DOCTOR: Stress, you say. From students and… technology. Hmm. While I appreciate you sharing, Mr. Schlatterer, those aren't typically medical complaints. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms alongside this stress?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Goodness. I… I suppose my hands tremble a bit more than they used to. And I find myself… fatigued. Easily fatigued. Though, to be fair, one should be at my age. Is that what you mean? Honestly, I’m not one for complaining about natural processes. It’s all very… undignified. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Tremors and fatigue… alright. And how long have you been noticing these changes, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it all blurs together, you know? Perhaps… a few months? It’s difficult to say precisely. It coincides with this… initiative they’ve started at the college. Forcing us to use these… tablets. It's a dreadful distraction. I simply prefer the Dewey Decimal System. It’s… logical. Is this relevant? Because frankly, I don't see how it's a medical issue.
DOCTOR: We’ll get to the bottom of things, Mr. Schlatterer. Just bear with me. Fatigue and tremors can be caused by a number of things. To get a clearer picture, let's go through some other questions, alright?
PATIENT: Questions? Very well. But please, keep it brief. I have a great deal to accomplish today. And do try to avoid any… personal inquiries. Stick to the facts, if you please. I’m not here to discuss my life story.
DOCTOR: Understood. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Hmm. I had a touch of the flu, oh, decades ago. And my eyesight isn’t what it once was, naturally. I require glasses. But beyond that… no. I’ve always been remarkably healthy. Good constitution, you see. My mother always insisted on fresh air and a sensible diet. I doubt there's much to report, honestly. Are we quite finished with this interrogation?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, absolutely not. I’ve always avoided them. Dreadful things, surgeries. All that… cutting and stitching. Unnecessary, in my opinion. A good rest and a cup of tea have always been sufficient for me. I've managed perfectly well without resorting to such… barbaric practices. Is this truly relevant?
DOCTOR: And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no. I refuse to poison my system with those… concoctions. A little chamomile tea when I'm feeling unsettled, perhaps. But beyond that, nothing. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. All these pills people take… it's a disgrace, frankly. Are we nearing the end of this… examination? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Now that’s a question. Let me think… Dust, perhaps. A little bit of a sniffle with dust. And I don't much care for modern art. Gives me a headache, it does. But beyond that… no, I don't believe so. Though, I suppose one could be allergic to incompetence. Is that… acceptable? Now, if you'll excuse me... I have work to do. A very important project, you see. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, with all due respect, you’ve provided very little in the way of useful medical information. However, given your reported fatigue and tremors, and the lack of any other explanation, I'd like to do a quick physical examination. Just basic neurological checks, alright?
