DOCTOR: Hi Johney, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it plainly, I’ve been smoking for… a very long time. And I think it’s finally time I tried to stop. It’s become rather… troublesome.
DOCTOR: Okay, Johney, that’s a really good first step, recognizing it’s troublesome and wanting to make a change. It’s never too late to quit. And we can definitely work on a plan together. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I began when I was… sixteen, back in Lithuania. It was… common, you see. Everyone smoked. Initially, it was just a few cigarettes with friends, but it… escalated during the war. A way to… cope, I suppose. I’ve been smoking, on average, about a pack and a half a day for… sixty years, give or take. Mostly unfiltered cigarettes, if that makes a difference. I’ve tried to cut back a few times, but… it never lasted.
DOCTOR: Wow, sixty years is a long time, Johney. And that’s a significant smoking history. Yes, the type of cigarette does make a difference, unfiltered cigarettes are harsher and deliver more nicotine. It’s understandable that cutting back has been difficult given how long you’ve been smoking. Okay. And currently, are you smoking a pack and a half a day, or has that amount changed recently?
PATIENT: Actually, yes. It has changed recently. I’ve been… a bit more stressed lately, with the rising costs of everything, you understand. And I find myself smoking closer to two packs a day now. Perhaps even a bit more on particularly difficult days. I… apologize for not being more precise. It’s a habit, and I haven’t been meticulously counting, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Johney. It’s very common not to keep exact track, especially with a long-term habit. Knowing it’s increased with stress is helpful information. Okay. And have you noticed any symptoms related to your smoking?
PATIENT: Symptoms… yes. A persistent cough, naturally. Especially in the mornings. And I get… rather winded easily. Climbing stairs is… a challenge. My doctor back home – before I moved – mentioned something about my lungs, but… I didn’t pay much attention to it, to be honest. I also get these… little pains in my chest sometimes. Not severe, but… noticeable. And I tire rather quickly, even with minimal exertion.
DOCTOR: Okay, Johney, thank you for sharing that. A persistent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue are all things we need to investigate further, especially given your smoking history. I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. Then we can discuss some possible tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Please, proceed. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, far too long. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Johney. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. Again… and again. Okay. Your oxygen saturation is a little low, at 92%. Normal is usually 95% or higher. I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs, and your heart sounds a bit… distant. I also notice some slight clubbing of your fingertips. Do you see how the ends of your fingers are a bit rounded and wider than usual?
PATIENT: Yes, I… I do. My wife – may she rest in peace – used to comment on it. Said my hands looked like drumsticks. I never paid it much attention, assumed it was just… a family trait. So that’s… not normal, then? The wheezing and the low oxygen… and the hands… it doesn’t sound promising, does it?
DOCTOR: No, Johney, the wheezing, low oxygen, and clubbing of your fingertips aren’t typical and do warrant further investigation. The clubbing specifically can be a sign of long-term oxygen deprivation, often related to lung issues. I want to be upfront with you. Given your smoking history and these findings, we need to rule out some serious possibilities, like COPD – Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease – or even lung cancer. But let’s not jump to conclusions. That’s why we need to do some tests. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test, which measures how well your lungs are working. Would you be able to get to a radiology center and a lab in the next few days?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can manage that. I have a… a neighbor who is quite helpful. He drives me to the market and such. He can certainly take me. A chest X-ray and… a pulmonary function test. Of course. Whatever is necessary. I… appreciate your honesty. It’s better to know, even if the news isn't good. But… lung cancer… that is… rather frightening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Johney. And you’re right, it’s always better to know. And please, try not to dwell on the worst-case scenario just yet. We’re just gathering information at this stage. Here’s the referral form with the addresses and phone numbers of the radiology center and the lab. I’ve also written down some instructions on how to prepare for the pulmonary function test – no smoking for a few hours beforehand, and avoid strenuous exercise. While we’re waiting for the test results, let’s talk about smoking cessation. I know you’ve tried to quit before. Are you open to discussing some strategies and medications that could help?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am. I… I realize I cannot continue as I have been. The coughing, the shortness of breath… it’s… undignified. I am quite willing to try anything, within reason, to finally be rid of this habit. I have nothing to lose, really. I've tried willpower alone, and it clearly isn't enough. What options are available? And… will there be side effects? I am rather sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Johney. You’re absolutely right, willpower alone is often not enough. There are several options available, and we can tailor a plan to what suits you best. We have nicotine replacement therapy – patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, nasal sprays. These help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms by providing small, controlled doses of nicotine without the harmful chemicals in cigarettes. Then there are medications like bupropion and varenicline, which work on different brain chemicals to reduce cravings and the pleasure associated with smoking. And of course, there’s behavioral therapy – counseling or support groups – which can help you develop coping strategies and stay motivated. As for side effects, they vary depending on the method. Nicotine replacement therapy can cause skin irritation, nausea, or headaches. Bupropion can cause insomnia or dry mouth. Varenicline can sometimes cause nausea or vivid dreams. We’ll discuss your medical history and any other medications you’re taking to see which option is safest and most appropriate for you. We can always start with a lower dose and adjust as needed. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: That… is a lot to consider. The patches… they sound the simplest, perhaps. Less… intrusive than medication. But I am rather prone to skin irritations, as you mentioned. And I do have… vivid dreams already, even without assistance. Perhaps the counseling… the support group… that might be the best starting point. To speak with others who understand… that sounds rather appealing. Would you recommend a particular support group? And… how often would I need to attend?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Johney. Starting with a support group is a great idea. It’s wonderful to have that peer support and learn from others’ experiences. There's a local group that meets at the community center on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6 PM. It's called "Breath Easy," and I have their contact information here. They also have an online component if getting to the center is difficult on certain days. I can print out that information for you as well. Attendance is completely voluntary, of course. Some people attend every session, others go occasionally. It's really up to you to find what works best. So, to recap, we've ordered a chest X-ray and pulmonary function test, and we're starting with a support group. Does that sound like a good plan to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… excellent. A very sensible and measured approach. The X-ray and the tests… and the support group. I appreciate your patience and understanding. You have put my mind at ease, at least somewhat. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any particular dietary changes or exercises I should avoid while we wait for the results? Or… is it simply a matter of waiting and attending the support group?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Johney. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. For now, there aren’t any drastic changes you need to make. Avoid strenuous exercise that leaves you significantly breathless. And staying well-hydrated is always a good idea. Also, try to eat a balanced diet, focusing on fruits and vegetables. It won’t directly affect the test results, but it will help support your overall health. The most important thing is to focus on taking things one step at a time. We'll get the test results back as soon as possible, and then we'll discuss them and create a more detailed plan. And remember, I’m here to support you throughout this process. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been most thorough and considerate. I appreciate your time and expertise. I will schedule the tests and attend the support group as soon as possible. Thank you again, Doctor DeCosta. I feel… cautiously optimistic.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Johney. I’m glad to hear you’re feeling cautiously optimistic. That’s a great attitude to have. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care. .
