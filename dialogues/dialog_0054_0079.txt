DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Courtnye is fine. It's about my bruising, really. I've been getting more of it lately, and...well, I'm on blood thinners, so it's a bit worrying. I don't want to end up in the hospital, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Courtnye. It’s good to meet you as well. Bruising is definitely something we want to investigate, especially with you being on blood thinners. It’s smart of you to bring it up. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about this bruising?
PATIENT: Sure. It's... it seems to happen with almost nothing now. Like, I bumped my arm on the doorframe yesterday – just a little bump! – and there's a bruise the size of my hand. Before, I'd have maybe a tiny mark, but not this big. And it's been happening all over – legs, arms, even my tummy a couple times. It's not painful, just… there. I can show you, if you want?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do. Seeing it will be helpful. While you're showing me, can you tell me how long this has been going on, and if you've noticed any other symptoms alongside the bruising – like fatigue, bleeding gums, nosebleeds, or any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Okay. See? This one's from yesterday, and that one on my leg is from… I think Tuesday? It's hard to keep track, honestly. Um, let me think. No bleeding gums, no nosebleeds. Bowel movements are normal, I think. I have been really tired lately, though. Just really, really wiped out all the time. I thought it was just… life, you know? Work and everything. But now I’m wondering if it's connected. I haven't noticed anything else, really. Oh! Except maybe a couple of headaches, but those come and go. I get them sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for showing me. I see the bruising, and it does seem widespread. Fatigue is definitely something we should explore, especially with the increased bruising. Headaches are good to note as well, though they aren’t necessarily directly related. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Okay. Let's see… Not really. Just high blood pressure, that’s what the doctor told me a few years back. I take pills for it, but I forget what they’re called. Something with an 'A' in it? I'm terrible with names, honestly. And, um, I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was ages ago. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well, but it’s hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure is important to know. We’ll get the exact name of the medication sorted out in a moment. Having your gallbladder removed doesn't usually cause bruising, so we can set that aside for now. And just to be thorough, do you have any family history of bleeding disorders, or any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My dad had heart problems, but I don’t think it was a bleeding thing. And my grandma, on my mom’s side, she had diabetes. I don’t think anyone else… My mom always said we were a pretty healthy bunch, mostly. But she wasn’t the most… detail-oriented person, you know? I’m not sure if anyone had anything like that. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful!
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Courtnye. You’ve given me a good start. It’s common for family medical histories to be a little hazy. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. You mentioned taking something for your blood pressure. Do you take any other pills, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just the blood pressure pills, I think. Oh! And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not every day. Just when they're really bad. And… I used to take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but I ran out a while ago and haven’t gotten around to buying more. That's it, I think. I swear, I’m terrible at remembering these things!
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen occasionally is good to know. And that's helpful about the vitamin D. Now, one last quick question about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. I don’t drink, never really liked it. And definitely no smoking or anything else. I try to stay healthy, like I said. Work keeps me busy enough!
DOCTOR: Good to know, Courtnye. Okay, thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at the areas where you’ve been bruising. It'll just be a brief exam to get a better sense of what's going on.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. The quicker the better, honestly. I have a meeting later this afternoon. Let's get it done.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is currently 140/90. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to gently examine the areas where you've been bruising. Just let me know if anything is tender. I see bruising on both arms, varying in size from approximately 2cm to 5cm. The bruises are predominantly purple and blue in color, and feel soft to the touch. Similar bruising is present on both legs, with varying degrees of discoloration. There's no noticeable swelling or warmth in either area. Okay, all done. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, the widespread bruising and fatigue are concerning, especially given that you’re on medication for high blood pressure. It's important to investigate the cause of this bruising. I want to order some blood tests. They'll help us check your blood counts, clotting factors, and kidney function. We will also check your liver function as that can affect bruising. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests are good. I just hope it’s not anything too serious. When will I get the results? And… will it be expensive? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Courtnye, and it’s good you brought that up. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The blood tests should give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. The results usually take about 24 to 48 hours. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. As for the cost, I know not having insurance can be a worry. I’ll speak with the billing department and see if we can arrange a payment plan or explore any available assistance programs. We’ll do our best to make it manageable for you. I can also write a script for a basic vitamin D supplement to start, and you can pick that up at a pharmacy, that won't be expensive. While we are waiting for the results, if you experience any sudden, severe bleeding – like nosebleeds that won’t stop, bleeding gums, blood in your urine or stool, or any unusually heavy periods – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… good to hear about the payment plan. And thank you for the vitamin D. Yes, I understand about the emergency room. Stop it if it gets really bad. So, just wait for the phone call then? Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Exactly, just wait for the phone call. My nurse will contact you with the results as soon as they’re available. For now, I would advise you to avoid any activities that could increase your risk of injury or bruising – like contact sports or heavy lifting. And try to stay hydrated and get enough rest. I'm also going to write you a referral to a hematologist - a specialist in blood disorders. It’s best to have a specialist involved to help us manage this, even if the blood tests come back normal. They can do more specialized testing if needed. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A hematologist… okay. That sounds… serious. Is it… is it something really bad, Doctor? And… will they need to take lots of blood? I don't really like needles.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Courtnye, and I apologize if I’ve caused any alarm. A referral to a hematologist doesn’t automatically mean something is seriously wrong. It simply means we want to get a more specialized opinion and rule out any potential underlying causes for the bruising and fatigue. It’s a precautionary measure, really. As for the blood work, yes, they may need to take a larger sample than what we took today, but we will discuss that with the hematologist's office. They will explain the procedure and answer any questions you have. They are very good at making patients feel comfortable, and they can use techniques to minimize discomfort. We can also let them know you're anxious about needles, and they can take extra care. I’m writing the referral now. My nurse will give you the information and help you schedule an appointment. Remember, we’re taking things one step at a time, and we’ll be here to support you throughout the process. Is there anything else I can address for you before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… please make sure they know I get anxious. And thank you. You've been very patient. I guess I'll just wait for the phone call then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. I understand your anxiety, and I'll make sure the hematologist's office is fully informed. My nurse will definitely note that on the referral. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms while you're waiting for the results. We’re here to help. Here’s the referral information and a prescription for the vitamin D. I wish you all the best, and I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the blood test results. Take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
