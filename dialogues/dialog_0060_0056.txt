DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Doctor…Nooruddin, is it? Yes, well. It's…difficult to explain to someone who hasn’t spent their life amongst books. It’s the students, you see. Utterly lacking in respect for the…the sanctity of knowledge. And frankly, a dreadful amount of noise. I simply can't concentrate anymore. It's…wearing me down. Though I suspect you young people wouldn't understand.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you're feeling…stressed, then?
PATIENT: "Stressed?" Is that what you call it these days? It's more than "stressed", Doctor. It’s a… a decline. A professional indignity! I’ve dedicated my life to the preservation of literature, and now…now I'm surrounded by…well, never mind. It's a long story. And frankly, a rather depressing one. Can we simply say it’s…unpleasant? Very unpleasant indeed.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this… unpleasantness been impacting anything else?
PATIENT: Impacting? Hmm. Well, my appetite isn't what it once was. Though I suspect the quality of modern cuisine is largely to blame. And…I haven’t been sleeping as soundly. But that's hardly a new development. I've always been a light sleeper. Always been…sensitive, you see. But the students... they are the real problem. Are you taking notes? Good. Perhaps you can document the sheer…impertinence of youth.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite, some sleep disturbance… Okay. And any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Doctor, I am eighty-seven years old. What do you expect? I haven’t possessed boundless energy since… well, since before the war, probably. It’s a natural…diminishment. I simply haven’t the stamina for dealing with their…their antics anymore. Honestly, they treat the library like a common room! It’s appalling. Do you understand the value of quiet contemplation? Clearly not.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any…difficulty with concentration, aside from the noise?
PATIENT: Finally, a sensible question! Yes, Doctor, precisely. That is the crux of the matter! The noise is… distracting, of course, but even when it is quiet, my thoughts… wander. I find myself rereading the same page, and retaining nothing. It's… humiliating. I used to be able to recall entire passages from memory. Now? A complete blank. It's a tragedy, I tell you. A professional tragedy. Though I doubt you'll appreciate the gravity of the situation.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on – the difficulty concentrating and the memory issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. It’s been…gradual, you see. A slow erosion. Perhaps six months? A year? Time becomes rather…blurred at a certain age. It began subtly, a momentary lapse here and there. Then it became more frequent, more…pronounced. It's quite distressing, actually. I simply can't rely on my own mind anymore. It’s…unsettling. Though I suspect it's just the natural consequence of growing old. A lamentable fate, to be sure. Now, is there anything else you need to know? I have an appointment at the philharmonic this evening.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Medical problems? Well, I have the occasional twinge in my back. A natural consequence of years spent hunched over books, I assure you. And my vision isn't what it used to be – hence the spectacles. But nothing…serious. I've always prided myself on my good health. A robust constitution, despite my advanced years. Though I suspect these…students…are actively shortening my lifespan. Honestly, the stress is probably contributing to all sorts of ailments. Are we quite finished here? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small pill, every morning. And occasionally an aspirin for a headache. Though I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, you see. A strong cup of tea, a good night’s sleep… though neither seems to be particularly effective these days. It’s all rather… disappointing. Now, if you'll excuse me… I have a very important appointment to keep. Are we quite finished?
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no. Perfectly healthy, as I said. Though I find modern pollen particularly irritating. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Really, Doctor, I'm quite a robust individual. I simply lack the energy to deal with these…young people. And frankly, this interview is rather exhausting. Are we quite finished now? I do believe my time is rather valuable. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing some stress and possibly some mild cognitive changes related to age and exhaustion. I’d like to run some blood tests just to rule out any underlying medical issues. And perhaps a simple cognitive assessment. .
