DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Look, it's my breath. It smells. Badly. Honestly, I don’t have time for a whole lot of questions. It just…does. And people have mentioned it. Is that really so hard to figure out?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Zelina. It's certainly something we can investigate. It's good you're addressing it. While it may seem straightforward, there are several possible causes for a change in breath odor, and it’s important to determine the underlying reason. To start, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember exactly. It’s been…a while. Probably a few months, give or take. I work outside, all day. Highway maintenance. Dust, dirt, you know. It's probably just that. I don't sit around analyzing my breath, Doctor. Do you need me to list everything I ate yesterday? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Zelina, and I assure you, we’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Listing everything you ate yesterday isn’t necessary just yet. Working in highway maintenance could certainly contribute to it, but we want to rule out other possibilities. Just to get a clearer picture, has there been any change in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Change in my health? No. I mean, I got divorced last year, if that counts as a health thing. Other than that, same old. Work, sleep, try not to think about…things. I’m perfectly fine. I just want this fixed, so people stop making faces.
DOCTOR: I understand, Zelina. A difficult life event like a divorce can absolutely impact one’s well-being, and I appreciate you sharing that. We'll certainly consider all factors. Now, regarding the breath odor itself… Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's…pretty constant. Maybe worse in the morning, but honestly, I don’t usually smell it on myself. People tell me. Like my ex-husband, constantly complaining. He was a delicate flower. So, yeah. Constant, I guess. If other people are smelling it, it’s there. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. And do you experience any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I’m not…sick or anything. No cough, no fever, no…I don’t know. Just bad breath! Honestly, Doctor, are you going to ask me about every single body part now? This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem extensive, Zelina. It’s simply my responsibility to gather as much information as possible to determine the cause. I assure you, I will be as efficient as possible. Let’s try this: have you noticed any changes in your mouth recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my mouth? Like…growing a second set of teeth? No. It’s my mouth. It’s always been my mouth. Look, I brush, sometimes. Okay? I don't need a lecture on oral hygiene. I'm a grown woman. I think I can manage brushing my teeth. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Zelina. I wasn't intending to lecture you, simply to gather information. To be thorough, have you experienced any recent dental work, or any bleeding gums when you brush?
PATIENT: Dental work? No! And no bleeding gums. Look, I really need to get back to work. People are waiting on me. Is there a quick fix for this or not? I don’t have time for a full investigation. Can’t you just give me something? Mouthwash? A pill? Anything?
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Zelina. While a quick fix would be ideal, it’s important to determine the cause of the odor to ensure effective treatment. Masking the symptom with mouthwash won’t address the underlying issue. To help me narrow down the possibilities, may I ask about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Seriously? I told you, I got divorced! Is that relevant? I don't have a medical history! I work outside, I eat food, I sleep. That's it! Look, Doctor, I'm not going to sit here and recite my life story. This is ridiculous. Just give me something for the breath. Anything. I’m wasting a perfectly good day. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Zelina. However, without some basic medical information, I cannot responsibly provide any treatment. It's not simply about giving you something for the breath; it's about ensuring I don't miss a potentially serious underlying condition. I can see you are very pressed for time, and I respect that. However, I must insist on a brief examination to rule out some common causes. Would that be acceptable?
