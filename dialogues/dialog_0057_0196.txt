DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for… a long time, I think. Honestly, the days kind of blur together. I just feel… worn out, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Feeling constantly tired can be very frustrating. “A long time” is a bit vague, though – could you try to give me a sense of how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… since my husband passed, I guess. That was… two, maybe three years ago? It’s hard to say exactly. Everything felt different after that, and this tiredness just… stuck around.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. Grief can certainly take a long time to process, and it absolutely can manifest physically. So, about three years of feeling consistently tired. Has the tiredness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly constant. Some days are worse than others, definitely. Like, I can get through the morning okay, usually, if I push myself. But by afternoon… I just have to lie down. And it doesn't really help much. I just… don't have the energy for much anymore. Even things I used to enjoy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more consistent, with worse periods in the afternoon. And it's impacting your ability to enjoy things. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Sometimes my muscles ache a little, but I figured that was just from getting older. And… I’ve been a bit forgetful lately. Not like… serious forgetfulness, just… misplacing things, or forgetting what I was about to say. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Muscle aches and some forgetfulness… Okay. It’s good you’re bringing these things up. Forgetfulness can be a lot of things, so we’ll definitely want to explore that a little further. Do you have any difficulty with your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That’s… that’s a problem. I can fall asleep okay, usually. But I wake up a lot during the night. And then I don’t feel rested at all when I get up. It's like I haven't slept a wink.
DOCTOR: Okay, difficulty staying asleep. And not feeling rested even after sleeping. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Sometimes. My joints ache, mostly. Knees, hips… things like that. It’s not… sharp pain, just a dull ache. And it seems worse when it’s cold or damp out.
DOCTOR: Alright, so joint aches, especially in your knees and hips, worse with cold weather. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: No, no swelling or redness. Just… achey. Like they’re… old. I don’t know if that makes sense. I'm probably just getting old, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and it’s good you’re describing everything to me. It's important to rule things out, even if it is just part of getting older. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Um… Let me think. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. And… I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. Other than that… not really. I think. Honestly, it's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, controlled with medication, and gallbladder removal. Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s a good question. I just… take a little white pill every morning. My husband always refilled it for me. I don’t think I ever really paid attention to the name. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Janie, don't worry about it. We can look that up in your records. I'm going to take a quick look at your chart now. Okay, it looks like you're currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for your blood pressure. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril, that’s it! And… no, I don’t think so. No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Good. And just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What does that mean? I live alone now, since my husband passed. I don’t really go out much. I used to enjoy gardening, but I don’t have the energy anymore. I have a daughter, but she lives in another state. We talk on the phone sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, living alone, daughter out of state, limited social activity, and reduced gardening due to fatigue. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. And… very rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with Christmas dinner, that’s about it. I don’t really care for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use. Alright, Janie, I’m going to do a quick physical exam now. Just a routine check, nothing to worry about. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, your weight is 108 pounds, and your height is 187 centimeters. That gives you a BMI of… …23.2, which is within a healthy range. Let’s check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your joints… There’s some mild tenderness in both knees and hips, but no swelling or redness. Range of motion is slightly limited, but not severely. Overall, the exam is relatively normal, but the joint tenderness is worth noting.
PATIENT: Oh. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? My knees and hips always bother me, but I thought it was just… old age.
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, Janie, but it's good we've documented it. Given your fatigue, sleep disturbance, muscle aches, and joint tenderness, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. One thing that comes to mind is Vitamin D deficiency, which can cause similar symptoms. We should also consider the possibility of anemia, and perhaps early signs of osteoarthritis. To get a better picture, I'd like to order some blood work. It will check your Vitamin D levels, complete blood count, thyroid function, and inflammatory markers. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood work. That sounds… unpleasant. But if it will help me figure out what’s wrong… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Janie. It’s not the most pleasant thing, but it will give us valuable information. I'll write the order for the lab now. The lab will draw blood for a CBC, Vitamin D level, TSH, and an ESR. You can go to the lab at [clinic name/location] anytime during their business hours. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. I'll have the lab send them directly to me, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as you can, and stay hydrated. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. It’s… nice to finally be doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janie. I'm glad you came in. We'll get to the bottom of this. Here’s a lab requisition form. The lab is at [clinic name/location]. The phone number is [phone number]. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. You can reach us at [phone number]. We’ll see you then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. You too. .
