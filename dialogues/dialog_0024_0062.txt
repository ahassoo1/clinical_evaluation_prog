DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am here regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks and other protective equipment. I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption, if that is the correct term. I’m Rayshun Knabenshue, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Knabenshue, I see your file here. An exemption, you say. And this is… related to discomfort with the equipment, or a medical condition preventing its use?
PATIENT: It’s… not a condition, exactly. More that I find it… difficult to tolerate them. It affects my breathing, and honestly, it brings up some… old feelings. It’s hard to explain, but it feels very confining. It's not something I want to go into detail about unless necessary, if you understand. I’ve tried different kinds, but nothing seems to help. It causes a great deal of anxiety, and makes it hard to focus on my work, which is helping people, and that is important to me.
DOCTOR: "Old feelings," you say. Mr. Knabenshue, with all due respect, we are discussing a workplace safety protocol here, not a therapy session. While I acknowledge your discomfort, a vague description of "old feelings" is insufficient for a medical exemption. Are you experiencing shortness of breath?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. You are right to ask. It’s not my intention to make this about… other things. No, not precisely shortness of breath, but a tightening in my chest. A feeling like I can't get a full breath, and a racing heart. It’s not constant, it happens when the mask is on, or even thinking about wearing it for a long shift. It feels… claustrophobic. I apologize for being unclear. I just… haven't talked about this much. It relates to things from a long time ago. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: “Things from a long time ago.” Right. And have you been evaluated for anxiety or panic disorder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I've always… managed. I try to keep to myself, and focus on my work, helping others. It’s never really been necessary to seek help for… feelings. It’s just now, with this mask requirement, it’s become a problem. It's interfering with my ability to do my job. I'm a protective services worker, and I need to be calm and focused when I'm with people. This is making that difficult. Do you… need me to explain what I do, exactly? Perhaps that will help you understand why this is important.
DOCTOR: I understand your profession, Mr. Knabenshue. However, simply stating it interferes with your job is not a medical justification for exemption. Protective services requires a calm demeanor, yes, but that doesn’t preclude the need for standard safety precautions. Have you considered… techniques to manage your anxiety while wearing the mask?
PATIENT: Techniques? No, Doctor, I haven’t. I hadn’t even considered that was an option. I suppose… I’m not sure what those would be. I’ve never really… dealt with anxiety in a formal way. It’s always been more… just pushing through. I’m a practical man. I fix things, I help people. I don’t usually spend much time thinking about how I feel. Is there someone I could speak to… someone who could perhaps help me with that? Before making a decision about an exemption, I mean. I don't want to be unreasonable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, with all due respect, I am a family medicine physician, not a psychologist. While I can suggest resources, that is the extent of my ability to assist you. I recommend you consult with a mental health professional to assess your anxiety and develop coping mechanisms. Until you have documentation from such a professional indicating a medical contraindication to mask-wearing, I cannot, in good conscience, provide an exemption. I can provide you with a referral list, if you like.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. That seems… reasonable. A referral list would be very helpful, thank you. I hadn’t considered speaking with someone specifically about this. It’s… a bit daunting, honestly. But I see your point. I wouldn't want to ask you to do something you're not comfortable with, or that isn't… proper. I appreciate your honesty. I'll make some calls, and see what I can find. Thank you for your time. Would you like me to fill out any forms before I leave?
DOCTOR: Here is a list of qualified mental health professionals in the area. They can assess your situation and provide appropriate documentation, if warranted. No forms are necessary at this time. I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And Mr. Knabenshue, please remember that prioritizing your mental well-being is important. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is all. Thank you for the list, and for your time. I appreciate your patience with me. Have a good day. I believe that concludes my visit.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Knabenshue. And please, do follow up with a mental health professional. .
PATIENT: .
