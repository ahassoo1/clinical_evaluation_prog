DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Burlingham. Just for my usual shots, I guess. Routine immunization visit, like the nurse said on the phone. I try to keep up with them when I remember, you know? Nothing specific bothering me.
DOCTOR: Right. “Usual shots.” Well, it's good you try to stay on top of things. A lot of people leave it until something is bothering them, and then it's always a bigger problem. Let's have a look at your chart first… Now, just to be clear, are we talking tetanus, flu, pneumococcal… what exactly were you scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You know, I don’t really keep track of the names. The nurse just said it was time for a few boosters, and I said okay. Something to do with getting older, I think? I usually just let them know what I need and they take care of it. I'm sorry I don't have a better answer for you. Is there a list somewhere of what I should be getting?
DOCTOR: Honestly, Ms. Fornes, it is rather important to know what you're receiving. It's not just about getting a jab in the arm. There are specific recommendations based on age, health history... It's a bit concerning you haven't kept track. According to this, you're due for a Tdap booster – that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and a flu shot. You had your last Tdap ten years ago, which is past due. And it is flu season approaching. Have you had your flu shot every year?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ten years, huh? That does seem like a long time. I try to get the flu shot most years... but sometimes life gets in the way, you know? Work keeps me pretty busy. I'm a construction inspector, so I’m always running around at different job sites. I guess I haven’t been great at keeping track of dates. I'm sorry. Is pertussis… whooping cough? My granddaughter just started school, so maybe that’s why they want me to get that one?
DOCTOR: “Life gets in the way.” Yes, well, many things do. But preventative care is rather vital. Pertussis is whooping cough, and you are absolutely right to consider your granddaughter. It's highly contagious, and it can be serious for infants. A responsible grandparent would be aware of these things. Alright. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history, just to be sure there are no contraindications to these vaccines. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, I do try to be a good grandma! I don’t think I have any allergies… not to food or anything. I get a little itchy sometimes when the pollen is really bad in the spring, but that’s just seasonal. And I think I was stung by a bee once when I was a little girl, but I don’t remember having a bad reaction. Just a little swelling, I think. Nothing serious. Is swelling a bad reaction? I haven’t really had any trouble with shots before, either, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: “As far as you can remember.” That’s… not very reassuring, Ms. Fornes. Seasonal allergies are one thing, but a bee sting… that could indicate a potential for anaphylaxis, even years later. It's important to be accurate about these things. Right. Well, let’s just document “possible bee sting reaction, mild swelling” for now. And we'll observe you closely after the injections. Now, do you have any underlying medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I hadn’t even thought about it. No, nothing really. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but that’s just from work. Running around construction sites all day is hard work, you know? And my knees get a little creaky in the cold weather. But that's just old age, I guess. Doctor Burlingham, are you worried about something? You seem… concerned.
DOCTOR: “Old age.” Yes, well, it's a progressive condition, Ms. Fornes, and it's important to rule out anything more serious. "Tired" and "creaky knees" could be symptoms of various things. It’s just… frankly, you haven't been very forthcoming with information. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, nothing like that! I've never been sick much, honestly. I eat pretty healthy – mostly fish and vegetables, things my grandma used to make. And I try to get some exercise when I can, walking around job sites and all. The doctors always tell me my blood pressure is good when I go in for my annual check-up, but I don't usually remember the details. I just know they say I'm okay. Is this about the shots? Should I not get them? I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: “I don’t want to cause any trouble.” Ms. Fornes, preventative medicine is about avoiding trouble. But it's difficult when I'm receiving such vague and incomplete information. Alright. Since you say your blood pressure is routinely checked, let's see if I can pull those records from your previous physician. Do you know who that was?
PATIENT: Oh, that was Doctor… Doctor Reynolds. He retired a couple of years ago, I think. He had a little office over on Willow Street. I haven't really been to a doctor since then, except for a quick check-up at the urgent care last year when I twisted my ankle. I just went to make sure it wasn’t broken. I think they just took an X-ray and sent me home with a brace. I’m not sure they even took my blood pressure. Is it okay if they can’t find anything? I really don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: “I really don’t want to cause any trouble.” Honestly, Ms. Fornes, your consistent lack of preparation is… concerning. I'm attempting to locate your previous records, but this is proving… difficult. Alright. Before proceeding with the vaccinations, I need to perform a basic physical exam. Just to be certain. It's a standard procedure. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure myself. It's better to be safe than sorry. Can I proceed with that?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yes, that sounds… good. Yes, please. I want to make sure everything is okay. And I am sorry for not remembering everything. I just… I don't usually think about these things unless someone asks me. Please listen to my heart and lungs and take my blood pressure. That sounds very sensible. Is there anything I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit back and relax. And try to remember anything relevant. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, swelling in your ankles… anything at all. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly faint. Now, lungs… inhale deeply. Exhale. Again. Breathing sounds are clear, but a little diminished on the lower lobes. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not critically high. Reflexes seem normal. Any history of dizziness or lightheadedness?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no dizziness or lightheadedness. Sometimes I feel a little tired at the end of the day, but that's just from work, I think. Lots of walking and bending over. And, well, it’s been pretty warm lately. Maybe that’s it? It has been hard to sleep well with the heat. Do you think I should worry about my breathing? My grandma used to say a little tiredness was just part of getting older. Is it bad that my breathing is a little quiet?
DOCTOR: “A little tiredness is just part of getting older.” Ms. Fornes, with all due respect, that’s a rather simplistic view. While fatigue can be a symptom of aging, it’s also associated with a multitude of medical conditions. And diminished breath sounds, combined with your fatigue and slightly elevated blood pressure… well, it warrants further investigation. I’m not saying you have anything serious, but I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues. And I'd also like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test – just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. We will proceed with the vaccinations after we have these results. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. A chest X-ray and blood work… That sounds… serious. Is something wrong? I mean, are you saying I’m sick? My grandma always said worrying makes things worse. But I guess I should probably do what you think is best. If you think I need those tests, then yes, please. Do what you think is best. But are you sure the vaccinations can’t just wait? I don’t want to cause any trouble, and I don’t want to worry everyone.
DOCTOR: “Worrying makes things worse.” Ms. Fornes, I appreciate your sentiment, but avoiding a diagnosis does not make a condition disappear. As I stated, I’m not saying you are sick. I'm being proactive. We will postpone the vaccinations until the test results are back. However, I strongly advise you to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as possible to discuss the findings. I’ll write you a requisition for the chest X-ray and blood work. You can take it to the lab on Elm Street. And I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks. I understand your reluctance, but I assure you, this is the most responsible course of action. Now, do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Two weeks… that sounds… good. Elm Street, you said? Yes, I think I know where that is. And the nurse will schedule it for me? That's very kind. No, I don’t think I have any more questions right now. Thank you, Doctor Burlingham. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. And thank you for being so… thorough. I guess I'll just go home and try not to worry too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. My nurse will be in shortly to provide you with the requisitions and schedule your appointment. Please follow her instructions carefully. And Ms. Fornes… please try to be more forthcoming with information during your follow-up appointment. It will save us both time and ensure you receive the best possible care. .
