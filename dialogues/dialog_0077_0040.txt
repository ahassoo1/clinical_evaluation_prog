DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again. Keeps coming back, it does. And with it, those water infections. They tell me it’s something to do with my kidneys, but I must confess, it all gets a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Recurrent pain and infections can certainly be unsettling. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Now, when you say “pain in your side,” could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific. It’s mostly on my right side, lower down. Not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, that comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just a discomfort, other times it really bothers me. It feels deeper in, you know? Not on the surface. And it seems to get worse if I move about too much.
DOCTOR: Right side, lower abdomen, dull ache… and exacerbated by movement. Thank you. And how long have you been experiencing these episodes, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been going on for… well, a good few years now. I suppose it started properly about five years ago. But I’ve had little twinges and discomfort before that, now that I think about it. They just weren’t as bad. It’s the last couple of years it’s really bothered me, and the infections keep coming back. Perhaps every six months or so, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Five years, with increased frequency and severity in the last two, and recurrent infections roughly every six months… Alright. And when you have these water infections, what symptoms do you experience?
PATIENT: Well, the usual, Doctor. A burning sensation when I go to the toilet. And I need to go very often. Sometimes there’s a bit of blood, but not always. And I feel generally unwell, tired and a bit achy, you know? Like I’ve got the flu, but not quite. It’s very unpleasant. I usually end up going to the local clinic to get some tablets.
DOCTOR: Burning sensation, frequent urination, occasional blood… and systemic symptoms like fatigue and aches. You’ve been treated at the local clinic with antibiotics, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Usually a course of antibiotics. They help for a bit, get things better, but then it always comes back. That's why they suggested I come and see you, Doctor. They thought it might be something more persistent than just a simple infection. I think they mentioned something about my kidneys, but I wasn’t really listening properly, if I’m honest. Old age, you know. Things don’t stay in my head like they used to.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Espinueva. It’s good you're seeking further investigation. Let's review your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease a few years back, as I recall. That’s what the local doctor said was causing the problems. I don’t really know much about it, to be truthful. They explained it at the time, but it’s all a bit of a blur now. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. I've always been reasonably healthy, though. I used to be very active, before my knees started playing up.
DOCTOR: Polycystic Kidney Disease… Yes, I see it documented here. And knee problems limiting your activity. Thank you. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, I had my appendix removed when I was a young man, many years ago. And I had a knee replacement about ten years back, on my left knee. That went alright, but the other one’s giving me grief now. Other than that, nothing major. Just the usual scrapes and bruises over the years, nothing worth mentioning, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and left knee replacement. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Just some paracetamol for the pain, Doctor. When it gets really bad. And I take something for my blood pressure, but I can’t remember the name of it. A little white tablet, I think. My daughter helps me manage my tablets, to be honest. I’m terrible at remembering things these days. She’ll know the name, if you need it.
DOCTOR: Paracetamol as needed, and a medication for blood pressure. We can confirm the name later, if needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any problems with allergies, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. I used to be a keen gardener, and I didn't have any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I’m very lucky in that regard, I suppose. No reactions to any of the tablets I’ve taken in the past either.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Espinueva. And finally, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my father had high blood pressure, as I recall. And my mother… she had a bit of trouble with her kidneys when she got older, but I’m not sure exactly what was wrong with her. It was a long time ago, and no one really talked about these things back then. My brother is still alive and reasonably healthy, as far as I know, but we don’t see each other very often. That’s about it, really. Nothing major that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Thank you for that information. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your blood pressure, and possibly feeling your abdomen gently. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead, please. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, you know. Been to plenty over the years. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll do my best to be gentle. First, let’s listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. I note some normal bowel sounds. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s a little tender, actually. Not a sharp pain, but a bit uncomfortable. Just a dull ache, really. It’s where the pain usually is, on my right side. It's not too bad, but I can feel something there. Is that normal, Doctor? I always worry about these things, you know. Old age, I suppose. Always imagining the worst.
DOCTOR: Alright, I note tenderness in your right flank. That’s consistent with your description. And just checking here… There’s some slight tenderness here as well. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90, but not critically high. Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the examination, it sounds like your recurrent pain and infections are likely related to your Polycystic Kidney Disease. The tenderness in your flank suggests some inflammation or possible cyst enlargement. However, to get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your abdomen. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps to find out what’s going on, then please do. Blood tests and a scan, you said? Fine with me. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know when and where I need to go for them. And if it’s something serious… well, I trust you to look after me. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, you know. It’s reassuring to talk to someone who understands.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Espinueva. I understand your concerns, and we'll work through this together. I'll write the orders for the blood tests and CT scan now. The blood tests can be done at the clinic’s laboratory tomorrow morning, and the CT scan will be scheduled at the radiology center across the street, likely within the next few days. The receptionist will give you all the necessary details and appointment times. In the meantime, I’ll prescribe you a short course of antibiotics to address the possible infection. I will also advise you to drink plenty of fluids and avoid strenuous activity. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. Depending on the findings, this might involve medication to manage your blood pressure and slow the progression of the kidney disease, or, in some cases, further intervention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Antibiotics, drink plenty of fluids, and wait for the results. And I’ll see the receptionist for the appointments. That sounds fine. Thank you very much for your time and your help. It’s a weight off my mind, knowing something is being done. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results.
