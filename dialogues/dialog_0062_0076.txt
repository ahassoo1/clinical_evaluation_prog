DOCTOR: Hi Clarke, good morning. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's these… bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, mostly. And they’re really bothering me. They’re red and kinda painful, you know? Not all the time, but enough to notice. They’ve been there for a little while now, maybe a couple of months.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months of bumps on your shins that are red and painful. I understand. That definitely sounds bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: It's not a sharp pain, Doctor. More like… a really bad ache. Especially if I brush against something, or if I've been standing a lot. Like after work, you know? I do a lot of moving things around, heavy stuff sometimes. It's not constant pain, thankfully. More like when I touch them, or after a long day. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense – an ache that’s worse with touch or after activity. That's helpful to know. And just to be clear, are these bumps itchy at all, or just painful?
PATIENT: No, they don’t really itch, Doctor. That’s a good question. Just painful, really. And kinda… warm to the touch, maybe? Not feverish warm, but warmer than the rest of my leg, if that makes sense. They're just… annoying bumps. They make it hard to wear my work boots sometimes, you know? Rubbing against them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no itch, just pain and a bit of warmth, and they're interfering with your work boots. That's good information. I'm going to take a look at your legs now, if that's alright with you. Could you please have a seat on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, that’s fine. Yeah, go ahead. I hope you can see what's going on. I'm not sure what could be causing them.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see them. There are several raised bumps on both shins, mostly clustered together. They do appear red and slightly inflamed. And yes, they are tender to the touch, as you mentioned. I don’t see any signs of open sores or infection at this point. They seem to be about half an inch to an inch in diameter. Do you recall any injury to your legs recently – a scrape, a bruise, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don't think so, Doctor. Nothing that I remember. I get little knocks and bumps at work all the time, but nothing major. Just the usual scrapes and bruises, you know, from moving things around. I usually don't pay much attention to them unless they really bother me. These just… showed up, slowly. They didn't start after a specific injury, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific injury that you can recall, they just developed gradually. That's good to know. Now, have you noticed these bumps anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just on my shins. That’s what’s so strange. I’ve been checking, especially after you asked about the knocks and bumps at work, but no, just these ones. And they’re… they’re kinda hard, you know? Not soft and squishy.
DOCTOR: Okay, just on your shins and they feel hard. That helps narrow things down. Now, thinking about your medical history, do you have any underlying health conditions, like diabetes or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Let me think… not that I know of, Doctor. I went to the doctor regularly when I was younger, but it’s been a while. I have a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years ago, but I take my medicine for it. Other than that, not really. I don’t have diabetes, and my circulation… well, I get tired legs sometimes, but that’s probably just from the work, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a little bit of high blood pressure, managed with medication. And no known diabetes. That's good. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything, that I know of. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, as long as the doctor says it's okay, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. And you mentioned you take medication for your high blood pressure – can you tell me what that medication is?
PATIENT: It's… uh… let me see… Lisinopril. Yes, that's it. Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. I usually take it in the morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. Good. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, these bumps could be a few things. One possibility is stasis dermatitis – that's related to circulation issues, even if it's well-managed. Another possibility is a form of localized vasculitis, which is inflammation of the blood vessels. However, without further testing, it’s hard to say for sure. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These will check your blood sugar, kidney function, and look for signs of inflammation. We can also check your venous doppler to look at the blood flow in your legs. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmm… blood tests… okay, that sounds alright, Doctor. As long as it helps figure out what's going on. I don't like these bumps, you know? They're really bothering me. Venous… what was it? Doppler? Sounds a bit scary, but if you think it's necessary… yes, let’s do it. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: No worries, it’s not scary at all! The venous doppler is a non-invasive test – we just use a gel and a probe to look at the blood flow in your veins. It doesn't hurt. I'll have the nurse draw blood for the tests, and we can schedule the venous doppler for later this week. I'll also write you a prescription for a topical steroid cream to help with the inflammation and pain in the meantime. It's a mild cream, but it might provide some relief. Do you have any questions about the tests, the cream, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: A cream, that's good. Anything to help the pain would be nice. Topical, you said? So I just rub it on? Sounds easy enough. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now, Doctor. You explained everything pretty well. Just… when will I get the results from the blood tests? That’s probably my biggest worry.
DOCTOR: Good. The topical steroid cream - yes, you just apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice a day after you wash and dry your skin. And don't worry, it’s usually pretty effective. The blood test results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once they’re back, the nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if the pain gets significantly worse, or if you notice any signs of infection – like fever, redness spreading, or pus – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: 3-5 days, okay. And call if it gets worse, good to know. No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to look at this. It’s been bothering me for a while now, and I’m glad I finally came in. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clarke. I'm glad you came in too. It’s always better to get these things checked out. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions about the cream. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try to keep your legs elevated as much as possible. That can help with the inflammation.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you very much, Doctor. I will. Elevate my legs… I’ll try my best. Have a good day to you too!
