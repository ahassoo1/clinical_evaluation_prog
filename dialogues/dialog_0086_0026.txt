DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful tiredness. Comes on suddenly, you know? Like someone flipped a switch. And my husband keeps saying something about… numbers? The doctor before, he said something about numbers being off. I don't keep up with these things. My memory isn't what it used to be, of course.
DOCTOR: Right. “Tiredness” is… vague, shall we say. Sudden onset is important, though. And your husband mentioned “numbers”?
PATIENT: Yes, numbers. He worries so. Something about my… muscles, I think? He said the last doctor took some blood and said something wasn't right. Not dangerous, he said, but… not right. Honestly, I barely listened. I just want to feel normal again. It’s not like I’m doing anything strenuous. Just keeping the house tidy, that’s all. And sometimes, a little bit of diving.
DOCTOR: <stage>I raise an eyebrow slightly, a flicker of disapproval crossing my face. "Diving?
PATIENT: Diving? Oh, yes. Well, my husband and I, we used to do it professionally. Now it’s just a hobby, really. We check on things, you know? Our equipment, the reef… things like that. Not like the old days, of course. Though I still keep my hand in. It's good to stay active. Though, admittedly, it's getting harder. Perhaps that has something to do with the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's see what the previous doctor noted. "Professional diving"... Interesting. And you said this tiredness came on suddenly?
PATIENT: Suddenly, yes. A few months ago, maybe? It's hard to say exactly. One day I felt fine, the next… just completely wiped out. Like all my energy was just… gone. And it comes and goes, you see? Some days I’m alright, other days I can barely get out of bed. It's very inconvenient, to say the least. And my husband gets so fussed over it. Honestly, a little bit of rest and a cup of tea usually does the trick, but... it's happening more and more often.
DOCTOR: Okay. The previous doctor did note some elevated creatinine kinase levels – that's a muscle enzyme. And your white blood cell count was a little low. Did you have any recent illnesses or infections before this tiredness started?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Oh, goodness. Let me think… Not that I recall. Old age comes with its aches and pains, you know? A little cough here, a little sniffle there. Nothing serious, nothing that required a doctor. I try to stay healthy. Plenty of fruit, lots of rest. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t see what could be causing this. Perhaps it’s just the weather? It's been awfully humid lately.
DOCTOR: Humid weather is unlikely to cause sudden onset fatigue and elevated muscle enzymes, Ms. Oitker. Let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's necessary. But I assure you, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine… most of the time. Though, my joints do ache a little. It's probably just arthritis. My mother had it, you know. Runs in the family. Just get it over with quickly, if you would. I have a luncheon to attend later, and I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your reflexes and muscle strength. And I’d like to take a look at your skin. Please remove your shoes and socks. We need to rule out anything serious, Ms. Oitker. This isn't a matter of just wanting to get things "over with."
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Don't fuss so, Doctor. It's not like I haven't had a doctor poke and prod at me before. . Honestly, the younger generation, always so concerned about "ruling things out." In my day, a good cup of tea and a lie-down solved most problems. But alright, go ahead. Get it over with, then. But don't take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, though a little faint. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little diminished, and your grip strength is weak, particularly on your left side. And I notice some bruising on your forearms. Do you recall how you obtained these bruises?
PATIENT: Bruises? Oh, goodness. Probably just bumped into things, you know? I’m a bit clumsy these days. The house isn’t very well lit, and I trip over things sometimes. Or maybe my husband… he helps me with things, you know? He sometimes grabs my arm a bit firmly. It’s nothing serious, Doctor. Really. Don’t make a fuss. Honestly, you’re making me feel like an invalid.
DOCTOR: “Firmly”?
PATIENT: Oh, well, he's a strong man, you see? Used to hauling nets and equipment, that sort of thing. He means well, really. Just… a bit heavy-handed sometimes. It's not abuse, Doctor, if that's what you're thinking! He just wants to help me up, or steady me when I'm walking. I’m a bit frail, you know? I don’t make a fuss about it. A little bit of bruising never hurt anyone. Though… … he has been more insistent lately, about me slowing down. Says I’m pushing myself too hard.
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, I'm concerned about your muscle weakness and the unexplained bruising, especially in light of the elevated creatinine kinase levels we observed in your previous bloodwork. We need to investigate this further. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a Vitamin D level. And I would also like to order a creatine kinase test to see if the levels have changed. Additionally, I want to discuss the possibility of a referral to a specialist – a rheumatologist, to rule out any underlying autoimmune conditions.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… complicated. And expensive, I imagine? I'm on a fixed income, you know. And a rheumatologist? What for? My joints just ache a little, that’s all. And honestly, Doctor, I don’t see the point of all these tests. I've lived a long life, and I'm not looking for trouble. Can't we just… prescribe something for the tiredness? A little something to boost my energy?
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, I understand your concerns about cost and unnecessary testing. However, dismissing these symptoms without proper investigation could be detrimental to your health. Fatigue and unexplained bruising can be indicative of serious underlying conditions – conditions that require treatment. Ignoring them won’t make them go away. And simply “boosting your energy” with a medication will only mask the symptoms; it won’t address the root cause. We need to rule out things like polymyositis, dermatomyositis, or even… other, more concerning possibilities. I understand you're on a fixed income, and we can discuss options for financial assistance. But I strongly advise you to proceed with these tests. It’s a matter of responsible care. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Polymy-what-now? Honestly, Doctor, you’re scaring me. All these complicated names… It sounds dreadful. And you're saying… something serious? I just wanted a little something to make me feel less tired. That's all. My husband keeps saying I’m not myself anymore. I don’t want to be a bother. I don’t want to end up in the hospital. Perhaps… perhaps a referral to a different doctor? Someone who… doesn’t use such frightening words?
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, I understand your fear, and I apologize if I’ve frightened you with medical terminology. It's my job to be thorough and to ensure we’re not overlooking anything serious. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are rare inflammatory muscle diseases, but it's important to rule them out, especially given your symptoms. I assure you, we're not immediately jumping to conclusions. These tests will help us determine the cause of your fatigue and muscle weakness. And while I understand your desire for a different doctor, I am confident in my ability to provide you with the best possible care. However, if you truly prefer a second opinion, I can certainly provide you with a list of qualified rheumatologists in the area. For now, let's focus on ordering these tests. I'll also include a Vitamin D level, as deficiency can contribute to fatigue and muscle weakness. Do you have any allergies or current medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Alright, alright. You win, Doctor. Tests, then. Just… please don't use such frightening words. And try not to poke and prod too much. Allergies? No, not that I recall. I’m generally quite healthy. Medications… well, just a little something for my arthritis. Ibuprofen, mostly. And sometimes, a little something for my sleep. Just when I can’t get off, you understand? It's nothing serious. My husband keeps track of everything, really. He's much better with these things than I am. Perhaps you should speak to him directly? He's the one who made the appointment, after all.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen and a sleep aid. Do you know the name of the sleep aid?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s a little blue pill. Yes, a little blue pill. I think… Trazodone? Is that right? My husband gets it for me. He’s very good about remembering these things. Honestly, Doctor, you’re asking me far too many questions. It’s making my head spin. Can we just get the tests done and be finished with it? I have a luncheon to attend, you know. And I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Oitker. I’m ordering the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, Vitamin D level, and creatine kinase test. I’ll also send a prescription to your pharmacy for a refill of your Trazodone. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be expecting you. They’ll take a blood sample. It will take a few days to get the results back. I will call you as soon as they are available to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, severe muscle pain, or fever – please contact my office immediately. And Ms. Oitker, I would still like to discuss the possibility of speaking with your husband. It sounds like he is very involved in your care, and his input would be valuable.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Speak to my husband, then. He’s very… thorough, you see. Always worrying about everything. Just… please don’t keep him on the phone too long. He has a garden to tend, you know. And I really must get going. All this talk has made me terribly tired. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. But honestly, I still think a cup of tea and a lie-down would have been sufficient. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Oitker. Please let the receptionist know if you have any difficulty locating the lab. And do call if any new symptoms arise. Have a good day. .
