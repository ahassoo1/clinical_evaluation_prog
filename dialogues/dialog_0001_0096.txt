DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Pehrson. It’s… well, it’s kinda strange. My eyes are really bothering me in the sun. Like, really bothering me. It started a few months ago, but it’s getting worse, especially now that it's been so bright out. I feel like I need sunglasses everywhere, even when it’s cloudy.
DOCTOR: A few months, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe… March or April? Around then, I think. It’s hard to say exactly. I mostly just tried to ignore it at first, figured it was just the change in weather, you know? But now… it’s like, even looking at my phone outside feels too bright. It almost hurts. And I’m getting headaches sometimes after being in the sun. I used to love gardening, but I’m avoiding it now.
DOCTOR: Headaches… and specifically after sun exposure?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely after. Not during, usually. I’ll be out for, like, an hour or two, and then a few hours later… bam. Headache. It’s not a terrible headache, but it's enough to make me want to lie down. And… honestly, it’s kinda worrying me. I’ve never had anything like this before. I mean, I do get headaches sometimes, but not connected to the sun like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see if anything’s noted in your records… Hmm. Okay. Any family history of eye problems, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. My mom… she always wore glasses, for distance. And my dad did too, when he got older. But I don’t think either of them ever had anything… with the sun, you know? Just regular needing glasses. I have an aunt, maybe… she had something with her eyes when she was really old, but I don't remember exactly what it was. Sorry, I’m not much help on that one. It's been a while since I thought about family medical stuff, to be honest. I lost my wife a few years back, and… well, things got a little blurry after that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Been on that for a couple of years now. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not regularly. Really, that's it. I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible, if I can. I get Medicare, so I try to keep things simple, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I know of. Never been tested, never had a reaction to anything. Dust bothers me a little sometimes, but everyone gets a little sneezy with dust, right? Nothing major, definitely no hives or anything like that. I grew up in Ghana, so the climate was pretty different there, lots of humidity. Never had allergy issues there, and haven't gotten any since moving here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, then we can talk about what might be going on. I'm going to check your eyes, just a basic visual acuity test, and I'll take a look at the outside of your eyes, see if there’s anything obvious. If you could sit there for me?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Happy to do whatever you think is best. Lead the way. I hope it’s nothing too serious. I really do love my garden.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a look. First, can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Let’s see… um… is that an E? Yeah, definitely an E. And… is that a… L? Yes, L. Uh… H? I think so. And… P? It's getting a little blurry, if I'm honest. I think it’s a P.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now the left eye?
PATIENT: Okay, let me try with this eye… uh… this one’s a little worse, I think. Is that an E? Yes, definitely E. And… a little harder… L? I think so. H… Hmm… I’m not so sure about this one. It’s kinda fuzzy. I can see shapes, but it’s hard to make out the letters. Maybe a P? I’m really not sure. Sorry. It's not as clear as the other one.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your vision is slightly reduced in both eyes, but more so in the left. I’m not seeing anything immediately alarming back there… no obvious signs of macular degeneration or cataracts. Your pupils are responsive to light, and your retinas appear normal, but… there's a bit of… inflammation around the edges of your irises. It's subtle, but present. Could be a number of things. Have you been exposed to any chemicals recently?
PATIENT: Chemicals? Hmm… not that I can think of. I do a lot of gardening, as I said, but I mostly use organic stuff. Compost, manure, that kind of thing. I sometimes use fertilizer, but I always wear gloves. Nothing strong, you know? And… no, I haven't been doing any cleaning with harsh chemicals either. My wife used to do all that. It’s just me now, so I don’t really get into any of that. I haven’t been near anything chemical, as far as I remember. Wait... I did help a neighbor a few weeks ago with some weed killer. But I wore gloves! And I didn’t get any on my face. Could that be it? It was a pretty strong smell, I remember that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Weed killer… even with gloves, some can still cause irritation if it gets on your skin, and the fumes can sometimes be a problem. It's possible that caused some irritation to the surface of your eyes. Given your symptoms—sensitivity to light, headaches after sun exposure, the slight inflammation I’m seeing—and the recent exposure to weed killer, I’m suspecting a mild case of… keratitis, possibly chemically induced. It's not serious, usually, but it's important to address it. I'm going to prescribe you some eye drops, a mild steroid to reduce the inflammation. And I want you to avoid sun exposure as much as possible for the next few days, wear sunglasses even on cloudy days.
PATIENT: Okay. Eye drops… that sounds manageable. And avoid the sun… I can do that. That’s a relief it’s not something serious. How long do you think it will take to get better, Doctor? And will the eye drops sting? I don't really like anything going in my eyes. I just want to get back to my garden, you know? I've got tomatoes that need pruning.
DOCTOR: Usually, with a mild case like this, the symptoms should start improving within a few days of starting the eye drops. A week or so, and you should be back to normal, hopefully. As for the stinging… it can sometimes cause a brief, mild burning sensation when you first put them in, but it shouldn't be anything unbearable. Just a temporary discomfort. If it's really bothering you, you can try refrigerating the drops beforehand, that can help. And make absolutely certain you wash your hands thoroughly before putting them in. I'm going to write you a prescription and send it to your pharmacy. And I want you to follow up with me in a week if your symptoms haven’t improved, or if they get worse. Now, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Okay, a week… I can do that. Refrigerating them… good idea. I'll definitely remember that. Um… no, I think that covers everything. Just… it’s the sun thing, really. I do love being outside. So, it's okay to go out if I wear sunglasses, right? Even if it’s not super bright? And are there any specific kinds of sunglasses that are better? I wouldn't want to miss the rest of the summer!
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go outside if you wear sunglasses, absolutely. Think of them as a shield. But they need to be good quality sunglasses. Look for ones that say they block 100% of UVA and UVB rays. That’s the important part. Wraparound style is best, to protect the sides of your eyes as well. And try to avoid being outside during the peak sun hours, between 10 am and 4 pm if possible. I’m going to print out some information about protecting your eyes from the sun. It'll have some more details. Any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. And the information about the sunglasses is great. I'll go get some good ones tomorrow. I feel much better now, knowing what it is and what I can do about it. You have a good day, Doctor Pehrson. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Just remember to follow those instructions. And if anything changes, don't hesitate to call. Have a good day. .
