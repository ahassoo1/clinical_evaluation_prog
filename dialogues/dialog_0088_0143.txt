DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about… starting a family. My… someone I care about and I, we’re thinking about having a baby. I thought it was… good to talk to someone first, make sure everything’s alright. It’s been a long time, you see. A long time. I don't really know where to start, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Verrall. It is good to get things checked out, especially after a long time. And you're right, it's good to start with a conversation. Let's gather some information. Just to clarify, when you say a “long time”, roughly how long has it been since you've… considered fathering a child, or had a medical check-up related to fertility?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Let me think. It must be… twenty years, maybe more. I really don’t remember exactly. I was… younger then, of course. I haven’t really been to the doctor for much of anything, to be honest, not for a long, long time. Just the usual… colds and things. Nothing serious. I don't know what kind of checks I should have, even. I’m a bit lost.
DOCTOR: Alright, twenty years is a good starting point. And don’t worry about not knowing what checks are needed, that’s what I'm here for. Given the timeframe, it's wise to do a fairly comprehensive assessment. First, let's go through your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had… something with my blood pressure, a while back. The doctor said it was a little high, but he gave me some pills and it went down. I stopped taking them after a bit, though. Felt better without them, if I’m honest. Nothing else… I don’t think so. I've always been pretty healthy, really. Just… getting old now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of elevated blood pressure that resolved with medication, then discontinued. We’ll definitely want to re-check that today. And it's good you felt better, but uncontrolled hypertension can affect fertility, so it's important to address. Do you remember the name of the medication you were on, or roughly when you were taking it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the name… no, I don’t remember at all. It was a little white pill, I think. Small. I was… maybe in my forties? It was a long time ago, honestly. I don’t even remember the doctor's name very well. It was a different town, a different life, almost. I’m sorry I can't be more helpful. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Verrall. Don't worry about it. Many people don't remember specific medication names from years ago. We can certainly work around that. Let's move on. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Not that I recall. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but that was… ages ago. And I had my tonsils out when I was young. Other than that… no. Nothing serious. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. I’ve always tried to stay away from hospitals if I could.
DOCTOR: Okay, so childhood tonsillectomy and a broken arm. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… family. That’s… complicated. My… my father had something with his heart, I think. He was always tired, and then… he just stopped. Very suddenly. And my mother… she had… trouble with her stomach, always. And her brother… he had something with his mind, I think. But I don’t know much about it, really. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of heart condition in your father, gastrointestinal issues in your mother, and some kind of neurological condition in your mother’s brother. It’s alright that you don’t know specific details; anything you can recall is helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. Tried a beer or two when I was young, but didn’t like it. And… no, never touched anything else. Always been a pretty straight-laced fellow, if you don't mind me saying so. I prefer a good cup of tea, to be honest. Much better for you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s very good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment. Like I said, I stopped taking the blood pressure pills years ago. I don’t really take anything. Just a bit of ibuprofen now and then for a headache, but that’s it. I try to stay away from pills if I can. Getting old, you know. Everything aches a bit these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications. That’s helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just a quick check of your blood pressure, heart and lungs, and a general examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I understand it’s important. I trust your judgement. Just… try not to poke too much, if you don't mind. My back’s a bit sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit up straight and relax your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I’m trying to relax… it’s just… I always get a bit nervous at the doctor. It’s been so long, you see. Like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathe normally. In and out… Good. … 150 over 88. A little elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. And finally, I’ll just do a quick abdominal exam. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Overall, you’re in fairly good shape for your age, but we do need to address that blood pressure and investigate that murmur further.
PATIENT: Oh… that doesn’t sound very good, does it? A murmur… Is that serious, Doctor? I’m not very good with medical things, you see. I just want to make sure… everything’s alright. For the baby.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking, Mr. Verrall. A murmur doesn’t automatically mean something is seriously wrong. Many murmurs are harmless, called innocent murmurs. However, it’s important to investigate to rule out any underlying heart condition. I’d like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to get a better picture of your heart’s electrical activity. Also, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to check your overall health and kidney function. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. An EKG… and blood tests. Alright. I trust you. I just… I want to be sure. I’ve waited a long time for this, you see. I’d like everything to be… right. Where do I go for these tests? And how long will it take?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you feel that way. Here’s a requisition for the blood work and an order for the EKG. You can get the blood work done at the lab across the street – it’s called “City Labs”. They’re open until 5 pm today. The EKG can be done at the cardiology department on the third floor – just tell them Dr. Piet sent you. They usually can fit you in within a day or two. The results will be sent to me, and I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them, likely within a week. While we're waiting for those results, I also recommend we start a trial of a low-sodium diet and some gentle exercise to help control your blood pressure. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. City Labs… third floor for the EKG. And low sodium… and exercise. I can manage that, I think. I used to enjoy walking, before my back started bothering me. Walking and… less salt. Okay. It sounds like a lot, but… it’s worth it. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a little better, knowing we’re doing something.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It’s my pleasure. And you’re right, it is worth it. We’ll take it one step at a time. Once I have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Chest pain, shortness of breath… yes, I’ll remember that. Thank you again, Doctor Piet. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll go and get these tests done. And I'll be sure to call if anything changes. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Mr. Verrall. And please don’t hesitate to call if you do have any questions or concerns. We’ll get you sorted out.
