DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, I'm here about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? I think it's... bariatric surgery? My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don't remember all the details. It's been a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, bariatric surgery. That’s perfectly fine, Mr. Kochubey. It is a lot to take in. Don't worry about remembering everything; we'll go through it together. Just tell me in your own words what’s been going on, and we'll take it from there. So, you're concerned about your weight… and looking into surgical options. Has your weight been a long-standing issue, or is this a more recent development?
PATIENT: It's... been a while, honestly. I think it started getting really bad after... well, after I left the service. It's hard to remember exactly when, but it’s definitely been over ten years. It just... crept up on me, you know? I used to be pretty active. Now… not so much. My wife says it's affecting my health, and she’s probably right. I get tired easily, and my knees bother me. But, like I said, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for weight to fluctuate, and life events can certainly play a role. And it’s good your wife is encouraging you to address it. We’ll take our time. You mentioned getting tired easily and knee pain… are there any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes I get short of breath, even just walking up the stairs. And I think… I think my doctor said something about my blood pressure being high? It's all a bit fuzzy. Oh, and I sweat a lot, even when it's not hot. Does that… matter? I also have trouble sleeping sometimes, I toss and turn a lot. It’s hard to say what’s from the weight, and what’s just… me, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, those symptoms can be related, Mr. Kochubey. Shortness of breath, high blood pressure, excessive sweating, and sleep difficulties… those are all things we need to consider. It’s good you’re bringing them up. Your primary care doctor did note elevated blood pressure in the recent records, and some initial bloodwork flagged slightly elevated cholesterol. Nothing immediately alarming, but certainly things we want to address. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… I don’t think so. My wife would have told me. I used to get headaches a lot, really bad ones, but the doctor said it was just stress. And I had… something with my knees when I was in the service, a while back. They gave me some shots, and it got better. Nothing serious, I don’t think. I definitely don’t have any heart problems… I think. I haven’t been to the doctor much lately, to be honest. Mostly just check-ups, nothing major. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… everything feels like a blur sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. We'll piece everything together. It sounds like you had some knee issues in the past, and occasional headaches, but nothing chronic. And it's common to not remember every detail. Now, have you ever had any surgeries before, besides the shots for your knee?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. And… oh! When I was in Iraq, I had a piece of shrapnel removed. It wasn't a big surgery, just local anesthetic, but it was still surgery, I guess. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. That's all I can remember for sure. It was a long time ago. Things were… chaotic.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, and shrapnel removal during your service. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I used to take something for my headaches, but that was years ago. My wife sometimes gives me vitamins, but I forget to take them half the time. Just the usual, you know? Maybe a pain reliever if my knees are really bothering me. Nothing regularly. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. That’s good to know. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything that I can remember. My wife says I sometimes get a little itchy when I eat shellfish, but it’s not a full-blown allergy, just a little bit of discomfort. Nothing serious. That’s all I can think of. I’m usually pretty good with food, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey, thank you for answering all those questions. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to be… unpleasant. I’m not a big fan of doctors, to be honest. But I’m willing to do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll take it slow and easy. I’ll explain everything as we go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, but there’s some mild wheezing on exhale. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is elevated – 148 over 92. Your pulse is 88. As we discussed, this is a bit higher than we’d like. I’m also going to listen to your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, with no tenderness. There’s some slight fullness, but nothing concerning. Finally, I’ll take a look at your knees. Your knees have some swelling and crepitus – that's a grinding sensation – and your range of motion is slightly limited. It appears you have some arthritis. Okay, that gives us a good picture. Your weight is definitely contributing to some health concerns, and it sounds like you're experiencing some arthritis in your knees. We’ll need to run some bloodwork to get a better understanding of your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and possibly some imaging of your knees to assess the extent of the arthritis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Bloodwork and pictures are fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Honestly, I just want to feel better. I'm tired of being tired all the time. And my knees… they make it hard to do anything. So yes, let’s do the tests. When can we get them done? And… will it hurt? I get nervous about needles, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Kochubey. We'll take it one step at a time. The bloodwork is fairly standard – just a few vials of blood. And yes, there will be a needle involved, but it's usually very quick. We can also use a numbing cream if that helps ease your anxiety. As for the imaging, we'll likely start with X-rays of your knees, which are painless. If we need more detailed information, we might consider an MRI, but we'll discuss that if it becomes necessary. We can get the bloodwork done today, right here in the clinic. And we can schedule the X-rays for tomorrow morning. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, today for the bloodwork sounds good. And tomorrow for the pictures is fine too. As long as I don’t have to do anything too strenuous, I’m okay. And… about the needle… maybe the cream would be a good idea. Just to be safe. I appreciate you asking. It's… nice to have someone understand. I usually just try to grin and bear it. But it doesn’t always work.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll apply the numbing cream about 30 minutes before the blood draw. It helps significantly. And we’ll take things at your pace. No need to grin and bear it. Alright, let me get the lab requisition form for the bloodwork. I’ll also have the nurse come in and prep you for the draw. And I’ll schedule the X-rays for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being patient, and understanding. And for explaining everything so clearly. I was really worried about coming here, to be honest. But you’ve made it a lot easier. So… just let me know when you want me to do the bloodwork. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. That’s what I’m here for. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical appointments. Let’s go ahead and get that bloodwork done now. The nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to take you to the lab. She'll explain the procedure and answer any questions you may have. Just relax, and remember, we'll take things one step at a time. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any trouble getting to the lab, or do you need any assistance?
PATIENT: No, I can get there fine. It’s not far. Just a short walk down the hall, right? I think I can manage. Thank you for asking, though. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Well, then, let me just let Maria know you’re ready. And don’t hesitate to ask if you need anything at all. We’ll see you tomorrow for the X-rays. Have a good day, Mr. Kochubey.
