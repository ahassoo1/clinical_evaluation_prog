DOCTOR: “Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Don't know what to do about it.
DOCTOR: “Okay, dry eyes. That’s a pretty common complaint, especially as we get older. It can be really bothersome. When you say ‘a bit now’, how long exactly have they been feeling dry?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… maybe… three, four months now? Hard to say exactly. Time goes by. It's not always bad, but most days, yeah. Feels like sand in 'em, sometimes.
DOCTOR: “Three or four months, alright. And you said it feels like sand in your eyes sometimes – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. More when it’s windy, I think. Or if I’m… lookin’ at the TV too long. Not all day, though. Just… periods. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “That makes perfect sense, Mr. Pipolo. Wind and screen time are definitely common triggers. Do you find anything helps relieve the dryness, even temporarily?
PATIENT: Not really. I tried… blinkin' more, I guess? Doesn't seem to do much. I don't use any drops or nothin'. Never have.
DOCTOR: “Okay, no drops used before. Alright. Let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in your vision along with the dryness?
PATIENT: Vision? Not that I noticed. Everything's a little blurry these days, but that's just… gettin' old, I figure. Always been a little bad, eyesight. Never been great.
DOCTOR: “I understand. It’s good you mention the blurry vision, even if it’s been ongoing. Sometimes dryness can contribute to that, or it can be a sign of something else going on. Have you had your eyes checked by an optometrist or ophthalmologist recently?
PATIENT: No. Not for… a long time. Maybe when I was a young man? I don't really go to doctors much. Never liked 'em. Too much pokin' and proddin'.
DOCTOR: “I understand your hesitation, Mr. Pipolo. We’ll take things at your pace. Okay, so no recent eye exams. Let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or arthritis, that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothin' like that. Just… old age. Back gets a little stiff sometimes, but that’s it. I work with cement, you know? Hard on the body. Other than that, pretty healthy. I think.
DOCTOR: “Working with cement, that certainly explains a bit of stiffness! Alright, no diagnosed medical conditions. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had nothin' cut open. A few broken bones when I was younger, workin', but they healed up fine. No surgeries.
DOCTOR: “Okay, no surgeries. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or vitamins?
PATIENT: No. Just… sometimes I take somethin' for my back when it really hurts. But nothin' regular. Just when I need it. Ibuprofen, I think it is. The blue pills.
DOCTOR: “Ibuprofen as needed for your back, okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life. Not that I know of, anyway. I eat pretty much anything. Don't go for fancy stuff, but… no allergies.
DOCTOR: “That’s good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your eyes, I’d like to do a quick exam. I’ll just check your vision, look at the surface of your eyes with a light, and check your tear production. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds… alright. As long as it don't take too long. I got things to do, you know? But yeah, go ahead. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Mr. Pipolo. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Why don't you have a seat here, facing that chart?
PATIENT: Alright. Let's get this over with. What do I gotta look at? Letters? Numbers? My eyes ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: “Letters, Mr. Pipolo. We’ll start with the big ones and work our way down. Just read the smallest letters you can see on each line. Don’t worry if you can’t see them all, just do your best. Okay, starting with the top line… can you read the letters for me?
PATIENT: Uh… let's see… that looks like… E… F… P… yeah, EFP. Is that right? Hard to tell. They're kinda blurry.
DOCTOR: “That’s a good start, Mr. Pipolo. Okay, let’s move to the next line. What about these letters?
PATIENT: Uh… H… K… N… and… is that a B? H… K… N… B? I'm not sure about that last one. They're gettin' smaller.
DOCTOR: “Okay, alright. Now, let’s take a look at your eyes themselves. I’m just going to shine a light in each eye to get a better look at the surface. Please look straight ahead. Hmm… I see a little bit of dryness and some mild inflammation in both eyes. Nothing too concerning at this point, but it explains your symptoms. Your pupils are reactive to light, which is good. Now, I’m going to test your tear production. I’ll just gently place a small strip of paper under your lower eyelid to see how much your eyes are producing. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful.”
PATIENT: Okay… feels kinda cold. Just… waitin’ here, huh? Is this gonna take long? I don't like things near my eyes. Feels… exposed. Is it done yet?
DOCTOR: “Almost done, Mr. Pipolo. Just a few more seconds. Okay, all done. The results show that your tear production is a little lower than average, which supports what we’re seeing with the dryness and inflammation. So, to summarize, you’re experiencing dry eyes, likely due to decreased tear production. The mild inflammation is probably contributing to the sandy feeling. It’s not an emergency, but it’s something we want to manage to keep you comfortable and prevent any further irritation. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? What do I gotta do? Gotta take pills? Gotta get poked and prodded some more? I just want somethin’ to make my eyes feel better. Is there somethin’ I can put in 'em? Like drops or somethin'?
DOCTOR: “I understand, Mr. Pipolo. You're right to ask about drops. That’s usually the first step. We can definitely try artificial tears – they’re available over-the-counter and can provide a lot of relief. There are many different brands, some with preservatives and some without. I recommend starting with preservative-free drops, as they’re gentler on the eyes. As for pills, no, you don’t need to take any pills for this. And no, no further poking and prodding at this time. I’m going to recommend starting with the artificial tears, using them as needed throughout the day – usually 4 to 6 times a day. If those don't provide enough relief, we can consider a slightly stronger prescription drop. I also recommend trying to avoid dry environments, like windy days, and blinking more frequently when you're using screens. Does that sound manageable?
