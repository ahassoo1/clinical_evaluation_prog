DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 31 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Yes, I am 31. I've been experiencing some… well, pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. It’s not painful, exactly, but definitely uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pressure in the bladder… and you've been experiencing this for a little while. Could you tell me a bit more about that "little while"?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started, I’d say, about three weeks ago, maybe a little longer. At first, I didn’t think much of it – just assumed I was drinking too much water, or perhaps it was something I ate. But it hasn’t gone away, and it seems to be happening more frequently now. It's just…constant, in a way. Not sharp, just…present.
DOCTOR: So, it began roughly three weeks ago and has been persistent since then, increasing in frequency. You describe it as constant pressure, not sharp pain. Is it related to urination at all?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. I find myself needing to go to the bathroom much more often than usual, even when I haven't had much to drink. And sometimes, when I do need to go, it’s…difficult to start. It doesn't happen every time, but frequently enough that I’ve noticed it. It’s a little embarrassing to talk about, but I want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Please, don't feel embarrassed at all, Marialena. That's what I'm here for, and these details are very important. So, increased frequency and difficulty initiating urination… and this has been occurring alongside the bladder pressure. Is there any pain during urination, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain during urination. And no blood that I've noticed. It's just...the feeling that my bladder isn't completely empty, even after I've gone to the bathroom. And the urgency, of course. I have to plan my outings around knowing where restrooms are located, which is… inconvenient. I hadn't realized how much I take that for granted.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That certainly sounds disruptive. No pain during urination, no blood observed, and a sensation of incomplete emptying, alongside the urgency. Have you noticed any other symptoms – any fever, chills, lower back pain, or changes in your vaginal discharge?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, no. And no lower back pain. My vaginal discharge seems normal, as far as I can tell. I… honestly, I haven’t really paid much attention to that, if I'm being truthful. It’s just been this bladder pressure that’s been on my mind. I do feel a little more tired than usual lately, but I attributed that to work stress. I'm a graphic designer, and deadlines have been quite demanding.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, chills, back pain, or changes in vaginal discharge. Increased fatigue, which you attribute to work stress. That’s helpful information. Now, let’s move on to a little bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything like that. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I do have Medicare, because my husband is retired military, but I haven’t had to use it much. I've had the usual check-ups and vaccinations, but nothing major. And I’ve never had a urinary tract infection, to my knowledge. I'm quite careful about hygiene, and I drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No previous medical diagnoses, and you have Medicare. No history of UTIs. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no hospitalizations. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago and was quite routine. Other than that, nothing. I’ve always been lucky, health-wise. I do worry a bit, though, because my mother had some bladder issues when she was older, but I don't know the specifics. It wasn't something she discussed in detail.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child. And a family history of bladder issues in your mother, though the details are unknown. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue. My husband always checks just in case when he gives me something, but I’ve never had a reaction. I did have a rash once when I was a child, but it was from poison ivy. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Poison ivy doesn’t count as a medication allergy, no. No known medication allergies, then. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not currently taking any medications at all. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s very infrequent. No vitamins or supplements either. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I don’t really feel the need for those. I do drink coffee, though…a fair amount, actually. Could that be contributing to this?
DOCTOR: Coffee could be a contributing factor, as it's a diuretic and can irritate the bladder. Okay, no regular medications. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'm married, as I mentioned. My husband, David, retired from the military about five years ago, and we mostly keep to ourselves. I work from home as a graphic designer, so I don’t have a lot of social interaction during the week. We don't smoke, and we only drink alcohol occasionally – a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. And I don't have any history of sexually transmitted infections. We've been together for 15 years, and both very faithful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marialena. That is helpful. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use, and a stable, monogamous relationship. Now, let's move on to a physical exam. I’m going to need you to change into a gown, and we'll start with a basic abdominal examination and then a pelvic exam to assess your bladder and surrounding areas. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. A physical exam sounds reasonable. I was expecting that, actually. Just let me know if there's anything specific I should do, or if you need me to empty my bladder before we start. I’ll go change into a gown now. Where is the restroom?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. Yes, please empty your bladder before the exam, if you could. And feel free to take your time. I’ll be right outside when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marialena, come on in whenever you're ready. We’ll begin with the abdominal exam. Please lie back on the examination table. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. Hmm… no acute tenderness to palpation. Bladder feels…full, as expected, given your report of frequency. No masses palpated. Now I’m going to auscultate your abdomen to listen for any bowel sounds. Bowel sounds are normoactive. Now, I’m going to perform a pelvic exam. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort during this part of the exam. I’ll use a speculum to visualize the vaginal walls and then perform a bimanual exam to assess the size and position of your uterus and ovaries. External genitalia appear normal. Vaginal walls are pink and moist. No lesions noted. Cervix is intact and without obvious abnormalities. The uterus feels normal in size and position. Ovaries are… slightly tender to palpation bilaterally, but no masses detected. No adnexal tenderness besides that. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears within normal limits, although there is some bilateral ovarian tenderness.
