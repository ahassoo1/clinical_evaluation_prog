DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. I’m Angelle Shteynberg. And frankly, I haven’t got all day. I want to…ensure everything is right before I attempt another pregnancy. I don’t want any…complications. I had a perfectly good marriage fall apart because of this sort of thing, you understand. I need to be certain this time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shteynberg. Planning a pregnancy is a very important decision, and wanting to ensure everything is as healthy as possible is absolutely reasonable. It's good you're thinking ahead. To give you the best advice, I’d like to gather a bit more information. Perhaps we can start with your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history. Honestly. As if that matters. I’ve always been perfectly healthy. I cycle every day, for one. Keeps me fit. And I eat reasonably. Though, truthfully, my ex-husband was a dreadful cook, so that wasn’t always easy. Is this going to take long? I have a very precise schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that you're active and maintain a healthy lifestyle, Ms. Shteynberg. That's excellent. And I apologize if this feels repetitive, but a thorough history helps us rule out any potential factors that could impact a pregnancy. It's about being as prepared as possible. Just to start – have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Nothing worth mentioning. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, ages ago. And…a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but I recovered perfectly fine. Nothing like these…modern illnesses, I assure you. My mother always said a good chicken soup cures everything. Are we getting anywhere, Doctor? I really don’t have time for a life story.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, and a bout of the flu. That’s helpful. And I understand your concern about time, Ms. Shteynberg. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Now, how about any allergies – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I'm Hungarian! We practically live on paprika. And no, I don’t have any allergies. I eat everything. Except…well, I dislike cilantro. But that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. Honestly, are you questioning my constitution? It's rather insulting.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m simply covering all bases. Dislike of cilantro is perfectly valid! Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Just a multivitamin. You know, a basic one. For…general health. And sometimes, if I’m feeling a bit run-down, I’ll take some Vitamin C. That’s it. Nothing fancy. Are we still on this? I thought we were supposed to be discussing preventing problems, not cataloging my entire life!
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We're getting there, Ms. Shteynberg. And it's good to know you take a multivitamin. To help me understand your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Doctor, do you really need to know about my Aunt Ilona’s bunions? Honestly! It’s…complicated. There were issues. My mother didn’t talk about it much. And frankly, I’d rather not dredge it all up. It's…private. Let’s just say there were…disappointments. Can we please move on? I’m paying you for a service, not a therapy session.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shteynberg. You’re right, you shouldn't have to share anything you're not comfortable with. Perhaps we can approach it differently. Have there been any significant medical conditions – like heart disease, diabetes, or certain types of cancer – that have affected your parents or siblings?
PATIENT: My father…he had a weak heart. Always complaining about it. And my mother…she had…problems with her digestion. Very sensitive. She was a delicate woman. That’s all you need to know. Honestly, I don't see what any of this has to do with me. I'm perfectly healthy, as I’ve already stated. Is this appointment ever going to end? I have a cycling class in an hour.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing that, Ms. Shteynberg. It's helpful to know. Now, just to get a more complete picture, would you mind if I ask a few questions about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does my lifestyle have to do with anything? I told you, I cycle. I eat reasonably. What more do you want to know? Do you want to know what color cycling shorts I prefer? This is ridiculous. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. .
DOCTOR: I apologize if these questions seem intrusive, Ms. Shteynberg. I just want to ensure I have all the information needed to provide the best care. I’ll keep it brief. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
