DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Rakosky, right? Yes... well, I just need some lab work done. That's all. Medicare said I need to get it checked. Don't really remember what they want checked, though. It's all a bit of a blur these days. Just... the papers, I suppose? I'd like to get it over with quickly if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. It's perfectly alright. Medicare often requests routine lab work for patients, and it can be easy to forget the specifics. Let me see… ah, yes. It appears your primary care physician ordered a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, a Complete Blood Count, and a Lipid Panel. These are standard tests to assess your overall health, including your kidney function, blood sugar, cholesterol levels, and to check for any signs of infection. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh, those are... big words. Doctor. Kidney… lipids… Honestly, it doesn't ring a bell. I just want to get the blood taken, if that's possible. As for allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. Maybe a bit itchy if a bee gets me, but that's about it. Nothing to do with, you know, needles or anything. I don't like needles, but I'm not allergic. I hope. It's been a long time since I had blood taken… a very long time.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Croonquist. It is a lot of medical terminology, and I apologize for that. We'll get through this. So, no known drug or food allergies, just a slight reaction to bee stings. Good to know. Before we proceed, just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's... a good question. Let me see. I... I used to take something for my knees, years ago. But I stopped. A long time ago. Nothing regularly now, no. Just... sometimes I take an aspirin if I have a headache. But that's it, really. Honestly, my memory is just terrible. I probably am forgetting something, but I can't put my finger on it. I really just want to get this over with, if that's alright? I don't want to hold things up.
DOCTOR: No, you're not holding anything up at all, Mr. Croonquist. It’s very common for patients to have difficulty remembering all their medications, especially if they’re not taken regularly. Alright. Let’s proceed with the blood draw then. We'll need to collect a few vials. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to take care of that. While we wait, could you briefly describe any other health concerns you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other health concerns… hmm. Well, I get a little tired, I suppose. But who doesn't? And my knees ache, like I said. It's just… old age, I think. Nothing serious. I don’t really go to the doctor much. Never have. Just these papers from Medicare, and I figured I better get it done. I really don't want to make a fuss. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things. I’d like to get it over with quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible. Fatigue and knee pain are common complaints, and it's good you're getting them checked. To help me get a clearer picture, could you rate your fatigue on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being hardly noticeable and 10 being completely debilitating?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale? Hmm. Well, it's not… debilitating. Definitely not a 10. Maybe… a 4? On a good day, it's a 3. But some days… when it's hot, or I've been walking a lot… it can be a 5, I suppose. But usually, it's just… there. A background thing. Honestly, I don’t really think much about it. It's just… old age, you know? I don’t want to bother you with all this. Just get the blood done, and I’ll be on my way, if that's alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. You’re not bothering me at all; it's important for me to understand your concerns. Okay. And regarding your knees, is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Definitely comes and goes. Worse in the mornings, usually. And if I walk too much. Or if it's cold. Or… well, you know. It just depends. It's not… sharp pain. More of an ache. A dull ache. I've had it for years, so I'm used to it. Honestly, I don't really pay much attention to it unless it's particularly bad. Can we just… get this over with? I really need to be going. Not an emergency, just… things. I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: No, you're not wasting my time at all, Mr. Croonquist. It’s important to me to get a complete picture of your health. Alright. To finish up the history portion, have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Weight? I think I've lost a little weight, maybe? But nothing drastic. I don't really weigh myself. Appetite… not much change there. I eat when I'm hungry, don't really have a big appetite to begin with. Bowel habits… well, you know. Old age, Doctor. Things slow down. Nothing… alarming. Honestly, I'm getting a bit tired of answering all these questions. Can we please just get the blood drawn? I'm starting to feel a little faint, just from talking about all this. I really do need to get going. It's nothing serious, I assure you. Just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Croonquist. I understand your frustration, and we can proceed with the blood draw. Before the phlebotomist comes in, I’d just like to briefly perform a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It’ll only take a minute or two, and it can give us a more complete picture of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, with all due respect… I really don’t want to. I just need the lab work done. I'm not feeling well just talking about all this. My heart's probably fine. Lungs too. Blood pressure… I don’t know. I just want to get this over with. I assure you, I’m not seriously ill. Just… old age. Can we just skip that part? Please? I really need to get going. It’s a long story, but… it’s important. I don’t want to bother you with it. Just the blood work, please. That’s all I’m here for.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, I understand your reluctance, and I respect your wishes. However, as your physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your safety and provide the best possible care. While you may feel it’s unnecessary, a brief physical exam can sometimes reveal underlying issues that might not be immediately apparent. Given your reported fatigue and intermittent knee pain, and considering your age, I strongly recommend allowing me to quickly listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. It will only take a minute or two, and if everything checks out, we can proceed immediately with the blood draw. If you remain firmly opposed, I will respect your decision, but I must document your refusal in your medical record. However, I do want to emphasize that this could potentially delay a diagnosis if there is something going on. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Just… please be quick. And gentle. I really don’t like doctors. Never have. It’s just… a lot of poking and prodding. I'm telling you, it's nothing. Just old age. But… alright. Do what you have to do. Just… hurry. And please, don’t tell me anything bad. I really don’t want to hear it. Just… the blood work. That’s all I want. Just get it over with. Now. Please.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could please sit back and relax, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll check your blood pressure. It will only take a moment. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, though a little diminished breath sound, which is common with age. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. It can fluctuate, and we can monitor it more closely if needed. Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Now we can proceed with the blood draw. The phlebotomist should be here any moment. Is there anything else you would like to tell me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No. No, nothing else. Just… please, tell the lady to be quick. And gentle. And… that’s it. I really need to get going. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I appreciate it. Now… let's just get it over with. I’m starting to feel a bit dizzy. Old age, I suppose. Just… hurry. Please.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. I'll let the phlebotomist know to be as quick and gentle as possible. Please try to relax, and let me know if you feel any worse. We’re almost finished. Nurse, could you come in here and draw blood for Mr. Croonquist?
