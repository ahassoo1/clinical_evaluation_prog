DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't much time for this. It’s… my skin. It’s darkening. And I feel terribly fatigued, constantly. It’s quite bothersome, really. Is that enough detail, or do you require a full biography?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Drahota. That’s a good start. It sounds concerning, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. "Darkening skin" and fatigue are definitely things we need to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about where on your skin you’re noticing the darkening?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must you be so…precise? It’s all over, really. My hands, my arms…even my face, I suspect. It’s not a localized issue. I work with iron, you see. Rebar. Reinforcing steel. Perhaps that is relevant. Though, I’ve been doing this for… well, a very long time. It's never been this noticeable before.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Drahota. Knowing you work with iron is very helpful. It’s good you mention that you've done this work for a long time, and that this is a new development. The skin darkening combined with fatigue does prompt a few possibilities. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s…exhaustion, Doctor. Simply exhaustion. I find myself tired even after a full night’s rest. I lack the…vigor I once possessed. It's a general weariness. I don’t have the energy for…well, anything, really. Is this requiring a detailed account of my leisure activities? Because I assure you, they are quite…private.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Drahota, a detailed account of your leisure activities isn't necessary. "General weariness" and fatigue even after rest is helpful information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue and skin changes?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness. Let me see… I suppose my appetite hasn't been quite what it once was. And I've been feeling… a bit cold, even when the temperature is perfectly reasonable. Though, I attribute that to the draftiness of my home. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one to dwell on minor ailments. I have work to do. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Drahota. Reduced appetite and feeling cold despite a reasonable temperature are relevant. I understand your time is valuable. To help me rule out some possibilities, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Past conditions… Honestly, Doctor, I've lived a long life. There have been… minor scrapes and bruises, of course. Nothing of any significance. I've always been a robust individual. I don't believe I've ever required any… serious medical attention. My wife handles those sorts of things. She'd know better than I would. Though, she's… preoccupied at the moment. Is this truly necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. While it’s helpful to know about any past medical history, we can proceed without it for now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hospitalized? Absolutely not. I’ve always prided myself on my good health and physical strength. I’ve avoided doctors for most of my life, frankly. A waste of time and money, in my opinion. I've been perfectly capable of handling anything life throws at me... until recently, of course. Is this line of questioning leading somewhere, Doctor? I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Drahota, it is. We are trying to understand the cause of your symptoms. Knowing your medical history helps us to narrow down the possibilities. Now, could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Family history? Doctor, honestly. Are you attempting to construct a genealogical chart? I haven’t the slightest idea. My parents… they passed away a long time ago. And I haven't kept track of distant relatives. It’s irrelevant. I’m the one who's unwell, not my ancestors. I'm beginning to suspect this was a mistake. I believe I've wasted enough of my time. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. We can proceed without that information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
