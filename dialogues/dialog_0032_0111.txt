DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 85 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here. My wife insisted. Something about my… complexion. It's probably nothing. I’ve been working with iron and rebar my entire life – a man gets a bit weathered, wouldn’t you say? And tired, naturally. Very tired these days. If you have a moment, I really must get back to things. I have… important matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: "Weathered," you say. I understand. However, it’s always best to investigate changes, even if they seem minor. Your wife is, understandably, concerned. And I respect that. “Very tired these days,” you mention. Can you elaborate on that for me?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Well, I feel tired, Doctor. What more is there to say? It's a simple enough concept. I used to be able to work a full day, now… now I need to rest. Frequently. It’s not as though I’ve been lounging about, mind you. I’ve been quite active, despite everything. Just… slower. And this skin… it’s darker, isn’t it? A rather unsightly hue, frankly. I haven’t changed anything in my routine. It’s just… happening. Is that satisfactory? Honestly, I don’t recall the last time I felt this… helpless. It’s quite undignified.
DOCTOR: “Slower,” you say. Can you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Quantify? Good heavens. Must everything be reduced to numbers these days? Look, Doctor, I used to be able to lift… well, substantial weights. Now? I struggle with a bag of groceries. I used to work ten-hour days, six days a week. Now I manage… half that, if I'm lucky, and I require a nap afterward. Is that sufficient quantification for you? Really, this is rather… intrusive. I haven’t been feeling well, yes, but I am not a… a statistic. I’m a man who has worked hard his entire life. And now… now my body is failing me. It’s rather obvious, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is obvious you are experiencing changes, Mr. Drahota. And I assure you, I am not attempting to reduce you to a statistic. I’m simply trying to gather information to determine the cause of these changes. It is my job to understand the extent of the problem. Now, regarding this change in complexion… has it been sudden, or gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I suppose. Though, now that you mention it… it has been a bit more noticeable lately. Perhaps a month or so ago, my wife first commented on it. She’s… very observant. Always has been. I dismissed it initially, attributing it to the sun, perhaps. But it's continued to darken. And it's not just my hands, you see. It’s my face, my arms… even my neck, a little. Honestly, I haven’t been paying close attention. I have more important things on my mind. Though, I admit, it's… concerning. My wife seems quite agitated by it. And when she’s agitated… well, it’s best to simply comply.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's discuss your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I recall. A few aches and pains, naturally. Working with iron, you accumulate a few knocks along the way. A strained back here, a wrenched shoulder there. Nothing serious enough to warrant a doctor’s visit, mind you. I’ve always been a strong, resilient man. I’ve been fortunate, truly. My wife… she worries too much. She’s always suggesting I see someone for something or other. A sniffle, a cough… everything is a catastrophe. But no, no diagnoses. Nothing of note. I’ve avoided doctors for as long as possible, and I intend to continue doing so. If you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, with all due respect, avoiding medical attention is not a substitute for a proper evaluation. While I appreciate your resilience, dismissing potential health concerns can be detrimental. I understand your reluctance, but I need to know if you’ve ever been hospitalized, or had any significant surgeries. It's crucial information.
PATIENT: Hospitalized… once. A long time ago. When I was quite young. A foolish accident with a… a piece of machinery. Broke my leg, I believe. A clean break. They set it, and I healed. It was… unpleasant, naturally. But that was decades ago. As for surgeries… no. Never had a surgery. I’ve always been careful. Prudent, even. I avoid unnecessary risks. And, frankly, I’ve never trusted doctors much. My wife’s father… well, let's just say his experience with the medical profession wasn’t a positive one. It instilled a certain… skepticism in me. Are we quite finished here? I have… commitments. Very important commitments.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult question. My parents… they passed away many years ago. Both quite suddenly, I recall. My mother… a heart condition, I believe. My father… something to do with his lungs. He smoked, you see. A terrible habit. As for siblings… I had one brother. He emigrated to… America, I believe. Haven’t heard from him in decades. We weren’t particularly close. As for extended family… I truthfully couldn’t tell you. We weren’t a close-knit family. My wife… she knows more about these things. She keeps meticulous records. But honestly, Doctor, I doubt it will be of much use. It was a long time ago. And, frankly, I’m not one for dwelling on the past. It’s… unproductive. Can we perhaps move on? I’m growing rather tired. Both physically and mentally.
DOCTOR: Understood. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I don’t believe in relying on pills and potions. A good night’s sleep, a healthy diet, and hard work – that’s all a man needs. I’ve always been very careful about what I put into my body. And as for allergies… none that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. My wife… she’s a bit more sensitive. She has to watch what she eats. But me? I’m quite robust, as I’ve said. No allergies. No medications. Just… a bit tired, and a little darker in complexion. Is that all? Because honestly, I'm starting to feel quite faint. Perhaps a glass of water would be helpful? Or… perhaps I should just go home. I'm sure my wife will be anxious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your reluctance, but I must conduct a brief physical exam to assess your condition. It will only take a few moments. I'll start by checking your vital signs, and then I'd like to examine your skin more closely. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Examine my skin? Good heavens, Doctor. What precisely are you looking for? I assure you, it's just a bit darker. As I’ve repeatedly stated. I do not appreciate being prodded and poked. It’s… undignified. And, frankly, it's a waste of both our time. I’m a perfectly healthy man, despite my age and… complexion. I’ve told you everything you need to know. My wife is more than capable of monitoring my condition. She has a… keen eye for these things. I’m not inclined to submit to a… a frivolous examination. No, thank you. I’m going home. I'm quite certain my wife will be… displeased with the delay. I’ll see myself out. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, please. I understand your discomfort, but I cannot simply dismiss your concerns without a proper assessment. Your wife is understandably concerned, and I take that seriously. I'm not attempting to cause you distress. I simply need to gather more information. A brief examination is essential, and it will help me determine if further investigation is needed. If you are unwilling to cooperate, I will be unable to provide you with any medical advice. And, frankly, I would strongly recommend you reconsider. Your condition may require immediate attention. Let me check your blood pressure. That’s all. Just a simple blood pressure check. Would that be acceptable?
