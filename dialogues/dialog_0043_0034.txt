DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's nice to meet you too, Doctor Kalinski. Oh, uh... well, I just moved here. And I need to... get seen for healthcare stuff? I have Medicare. I think that's what you need to know. It's kinda new, all this. I don't really remember what they told me to do.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. It can be a bit overwhelming getting settled in a new place and navigating healthcare. Medicare is excellent, and we'll certainly get everything sorted out. We can focus on a general check-up today to establish care and address any immediate concerns you might have. Before we dive into that, could you tell me a bit about what "healthcare stuff" you were hoping to address?
PATIENT: Healthcare stuff... hmm. Honestly? I don't really know. I just… feel kinda tired a lot? And sometimes my hands ache. But I work with machines all day, so maybe that's normal? I don't know if that's something you fix, or… it might be nothing. I forget what my old doctor said, if anything.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking about these things, Emileigh. Feeling tired and experiencing hand aches are definitely things worth discussing, even if they might be related to your work. We'll explore both possibilities. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Just… sleepy, I guess. Even when I get enough sleep, it feels like I could sleep more. It’s been going on for a while, I think. A long time. Not all the time, but… most days, yeah. It makes it hard to… focus, sometimes. And the aches... they’re not bad bad, just… sore. Like I’ve been using them a lot, which, I have. But they don't go away completely, even when I rest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emileigh. So, persistent tiredness, even with adequate sleep, and some lingering soreness in your hands. That gives us a good starting point. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. I work at the factory. I’m a… a mechanical technician? I fix the machines, check them, make sure they’re running okay. It’s… loud. And I use my hands a lot. Lots of little parts, tightening bolts, stuff like that. I’ve been doing it for… a few years, I think? It's kinda hard to keep track of time sometimes. It’s mostly okay, but it can be stressful when things break down.
DOCTOR: That certainly sounds physically demanding and potentially stressful. Both of those factors can contribute to feelings of tiredness and aches. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I'd like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Um… not that I remember. I… I think I had the flu once, when I was little? But nothing serious. I don’t really go to the doctor much, even before moving here. I mostly just… deal with things. My mom… she had something, but I don't remember what. She’s… not here anymore. So I don't know if that matters.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Emileigh. It’s alright if you don’t remember specific details. We'll work with what you do know. And I appreciate your honesty about not frequently visiting the doctor; that’s perfectly okay. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospitals. I broke my arm once, when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But it healed on its own, I think. My grandma set it. She knew a lot about… stuff. It didn’t need a doctor. I think that's all. I haven't really needed a doctor, until now, I guess. This moving thing is just… a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Emileigh. No surgeries or hospitalizations. And your grandmother sounds like a resourceful woman. It's good you had that support. Now, I'd like to ask a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—anything that your mother or other relatives have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Um… I… I really don't know. My mom didn’t talk much about her family. She… it was a hard topic. And I didn’t meet any of them. I think she had a sister, maybe? But I never met her. I wish I knew more, but I don't. I'm sorry. I’m not very good at remembering things. This is probably not helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. You shouldn’t feel any pressure to remember details you don’t know. Family history can be helpful, but it’s not always available. We'll proceed without it for now. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. None of that. I don’t smoke. I don't really like the smell. And I don't drink. It… doesn’t agree with me. And definitely no drugs. Never. I just… work. And sleep, when I can. That’s pretty much it.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Emileigh. Thank you for being open with me. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. I mean, I haven't had any bad reactions to anything that I know of. Maybe… I get itchy sometimes, if I touch certain plants? Like poison ivy? But that's not an allergy, really, is it? I don't take any regular medicines, either. Just… over-the-counter stuff for headaches, sometimes. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known drug allergies and just occasional over-the-counter headache medication. That’s helpful to know. Now, Emileigh, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall health and potentially identify any underlying causes for your tiredness and hand aches. We'll start with your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature—and then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your hands and joints. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Um… okay. That’s… okay. But please be gentle? I don't like needles. Just, uh… please be quick? And tell me what you're doing, so I don't get scared. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. I understand your apprehension, and I'll be as gentle as possible. We'll go slowly, and I’ll explain everything I’m doing step-by-step. I promise to be quick, and we can stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. It’s a cuff that goes around your arm, and it won’t hurt at all. Okay, just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 122 over 78, which is within a normal range. Now, I’m going to check your pulse. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also within a normal range. Now, I’m just going to take your temperature. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, can you please extend your hands for me?
PATIENT: Okay… they might be a little sore. And dirty. I work with machines, remember? Please be careful.
DOCTOR: I see some calluses, which is understandable given your profession. There’s no obvious swelling or redness, but there is some tenderness to palpation along the knuckles and wrists. There’s some slight discomfort with range of motion, particularly with gripping and extending your wrists. It doesn't seem severe, but it’s worth noting. Overall, your physical exam findings are fairly unremarkable. Your vital signs are within normal limits, and your heart and lungs sound clear. The tenderness and slight discomfort in your hands are likely related to your work. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests. This will help rule out any underlying conditions that could be causing your tiredness, such as anemia or thyroid problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Um… are they going to take a lot of blood? And will it hurt? I don't like needles. I… I guess so, if you think it’s important. But please be quick, and tell me what you're doing. And don’t take too much, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Emileigh. It's perfectly normal to be nervous about needles. I assure you, we won't take a lot of blood—just a few small vials. The amount taken is minimal, and it shouldn't cause any significant discomfort. You might feel a brief pinch when the needle goes in, but it's usually very quick. I will explain every step of the process before I do it, and I will be as gentle as possible. I'll let the phlebotomist know about your anxiety, and they will be extra careful. We’ll be testing your complete blood count to check for anemia and infection, and your thyroid-stimulating hormone level to assess your thyroid function. Would you like me to explain anything else about the tests?
PATIENT: Anemia… is that bad? And what does thyroid… something have to do with being tired? I just… I want to feel better. I’m always tired, and it’s hard to work. Please just tell me if anything is wrong. And what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emileigh. You're right to want to feel better, and we'll work together to figure out what's going on. Anemia means you have a low red blood cell count, which can cause fatigue and weakness. It's often treatable with iron supplements or dietary changes. As for your thyroid, it's a small gland in your neck that produces hormones that regulate your metabolism—basically, how your body uses energy. If your thyroid isn't functioning properly, it can cause fatigue, weight changes, and other symptoms. The blood tests will help us determine if either of these issues is contributing to your tiredness. I’m going to write an order for the lab tests, and the phlebotomist will come in to draw the blood shortly. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we can discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… a few days. That sounds… okay. But please call me if there's something wrong, okay? Don’t just wait. I… I appreciate you explaining everything. It makes me feel a little better. Is there anything else I need to do? Or just wait for the phone call?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. I will personally review your results as soon as they are available and call you directly to discuss them, regardless of what they show. You’re right to advocate for yourself, and I want to assure you that I’m here to support you every step of the way. For now, there’s nothing else you need to do except rest and try to stay hydrated. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. They will provide you with instructions on how to care for your arm afterward. I'll also give you a printed summary of our conversation today, including the list of tests ordered. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Kalinski. For… everything. I just… hope we can figure out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I share your hope, and we will certainly do our best to figure things out. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Take care. .
