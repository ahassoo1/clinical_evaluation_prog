DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Chest…feel funny. And heart… thump-thump too much. Blood pressure… wife say high. She worry too much, always. Just…old man things, probably.
DOCTOR: Right. “Funny” how, exactly?
PATIENT: Like…tight. Not pain, pain is for weak people. Just…squeeze. And thump-thump fast, you understand? Like drum. Not good drum, bad drum. Happens when I… when I get upset. Wife makes me upset.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when your wife “makes you upset,” what exactly is happening?
PATIENT: She…nag, nag, nag! Always about garden. Garden is fine! She wants perfect tomatoes, perfect roses…waste of time. I tell her, "Let it grow, Mrs. Sobkowicz!" But she…she keep fussing. Then chest…squeeze. Thump-thump.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on – this chest tightness and fast heartbeat when you're…disagreeing with your wife about the garden?
PATIENT: Oh…long time. Maybe…ten years? Since she start with the tomatoes. Always complaining about worms. Worms are good for garden! She don’t listen. It happen…many times. Not every time, but…enough.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the chest tightness and the fast heartbeat, have you noticed any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm…sometimes…short of breath. Like…can’t get enough air. But I walk around, it go away. Old man things, probably. I not weak! I used to…strong. Very strong.
DOCTOR: Right. And does this shortness of breath happen only when you’re upset about the garden, or at other times as well?
PATIENT: No! Not always garden. Sometimes…when I watch TV. Bad news, you understand? Always fighting, always yelling. Makes my chest…tight. Like squeezing again. I change channel. But sometimes…too late.
DOCTOR: Okay. Mr. Sobkowicz, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure…wife say yes. Doctor say yes, long time ago. Pills, I take pills. Sometimes I forget. Not important. I feel fine… mostly. Heart…no problem. Never have problem. I strong!
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Old age, you forget things. I think…appendix, when I young. Very young! Maybe 60 years ago? That all. Never need anything else. I tough man.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My mother…she live long time. Very long. Never sick. My father…he strong too. Farmer. But his brother…he have…problem with heart. Not good heart. He…he die young.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never smoke. Bad for you. Stupid. My wife, she no like. Always tell me, “No smoke, Mr. Sobkowicz!” Good woman…sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's just do a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Just to get a baseline. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Sit…I can sit. But hurry. I have things to do. Garden needs… looking at. Though Mrs. Sobkowicz…she fuss too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, as your wife mentioned. Your heart rate is also a bit fast. Your lungs sound clear. Do you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. Not usually. Sometimes… a little tired at end of day. But that is old age. Mrs. Sobkowicz say I walk too much. She wants me to rest. Rest is… boring.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, can you tell me the names of all the medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. The little white pill…for pressure. And the yellow one…sometimes, for…sleep? Mrs. Sobkowicz, she give it to me. She know all the pills. I no remember the names.
DOCTOR: Alright. So you're taking lisinopril for your blood pressure. Do you take it every day, as prescribed?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… that the white pill? Sometimes…I forget. If I feel good, I no take it. What's the point? I strong.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's important to take your blood pressure medication regularly, even when you're feeling good. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to serious problems. We should probably get some blood work done to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels, and I'd like you to wear a heart monitor for a few days to see what’s going on with your heart rate. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Blood work? Heart monitor? Sounds like a lot of…fuss. What for? I feel fine…mostly. My wife will make me go? She always make me do things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, we're doing this to make sure you continue to feel fine. The blood work will help us see if your kidneys are working properly, and the heart monitor will tell us what's happening with your heart when you're at home, during your normal activities. It's a precaution, to rule out anything serious. We can discuss the results when they come back, and adjust your medication if needed. It's important to be proactive about your health. Your wife is concerned about you, and I want to make sure you're getting the best possible care. We can at least start with the blood work, if you're willing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Blood work… But hurry. I have tomatoes to inspect. And tell Mrs. Sobkowicz I said hello.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood before you leave. And I’ll be sure to tell Mrs. Sobkowicz hello. Mr. Sobkowicz, it’s also important to manage your stress levels. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you enjoy?
PATIENT: Hobbies? I used to fish. Long time ago. Now I just… try to avoid my wife. Is that a hobby?
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, we can talk about stress management at your next appointment. For now, let's focus on the blood work and heart monitor. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No. Just… tell Mrs. Sobkowicz to not fuss too much about the tomatoes. Let them grow!
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be sure to pass that along. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: .
