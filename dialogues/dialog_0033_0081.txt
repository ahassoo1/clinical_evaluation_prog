DOCTOR: Right. Jailia Chakka, 18 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… concerning, frankly. I’ve been losing weight, and not in a good way. And I’m exhausted all the time, even after sleeping. Plus, I wake up drenched in sweat nearly every night. It’s… unseemly.
DOCTOR: Losing weight despite… wanting to maintain it, I presume?
PATIENT: Precisely. I eat perfectly reasonable portions, and I wouldn’t say I’m overly active. My husband ensures I have nutritious meals, and I certainly don't skip them. It's quite baffling, and… frankly, a little insulting that it's happening. I do try to take care of myself. It's not as if I'm neglecting my health.
DOCTOR: And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… approximately three months, I’d say. It began subtly, just a slight looseness in my clothing. But it’s progressed quite noticeably in recent weeks. The night sweats, though… those started around the same time, perhaps a little later. They're quite disruptive, and really quite… unpleasant. It's making my sleep schedule a mess.
DOCTOR: Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, I have been feeling… warmer than usual, generally. Not a fever, exactly, but… flushed. And I find myself thirstier than I normally am, needing to drink water frequently. I haven’t noticed anything else… significant. Though my appetite hasn’t been the greatest recently, which is… a consequence of the weight loss, I presume. It’s all rather interconnected, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? No, not particularly. Everything is… regular, if you must know. I maintain a very disciplined lifestyle, Doctor. I assure you, I don't have any irregular habits of any kind. It's a rather personal question, don’t you think? And honestly, I fail to see how it relates to unexplained weight loss and fatigue.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Chakka. Just trying to rule things out. Any family history of… anything like this?
PATIENT: My mother always had… delicate constitution, if that’s what you mean. She was prone to bouts of weakness, but she attributed it to… emotional sensitivities. And my father’s side… they are mostly farmers in Nepal. Robust people, generally, but with limited access to… modern medical care. So, really, there’s no significant family history to speak of. It’s likely just… a temporary imbalance, wouldn't you agree? Perhaps a vitamin deficiency?
DOCTOR: Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, I do not. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. My husband is quite knowledgeable about herbal supplements, and we find they are sufficient for minor ailments. I certainly wouldn’t burden myself with unnecessary pharmaceuticals. Besides, my private insurance has a rather hefty deductible. It's simply more… economical to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick look. Please, lie down on the table.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, I find it rather disconcerting that we’re proceeding without a clear diagnosis. It seems… premature, don’t you think? But I suppose I will indulge your examination. Do let me know if you require any specific… positioning. I wouldn't want to disrupt your assessment.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear… for now. Blood pressure is… a little low. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses felt. Thyroid feels… normal. We'll need some blood work to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test.
PATIENT: Blood work, you say? Very well. Though I still maintain this is likely a minor imbalance. Is there anything immediately concerning? I dislike the prospect of undergoing extensive testing for… what may be nothing more than a dietary adjustment. And will it be a lengthy procedure? I have… commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Chakka. The tests will help rule out any serious underlying issues. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. We'll need to send it to the lab, and the results usually come back within a couple of days. Until then, I want you to try and keep a food diary, noting everything you eat and drink. And try to get as much rest as possible. I'll have the lab requisition printed for you now. And please, don't jump to conclusions. We need to gather more information before we can make any sort of diagnosis.
PATIENT: A food diary… How utterly tedious. And rest, you say? I am resting. I simply do not have the energy to do much else. Still, very well. I shall begrudgingly comply with your request for a food diary. But I must insist on a thorough explanation of the potential results, Doctor. I do not wish to be subjected to vague medical jargon. And if it is something serious… I expect a clear course of action. I have a very busy life, and I do not have time for… unnecessary complications.
DOCTOR: Here. The lab is down the hall, third door on the left. It’s routine blood work. I’ll contact you once the results are in. In the meantime, try not to worry unnecessarily. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. Though I must reiterate my expectation of clear and concise communication. I find this entire experience… unnecessarily stressful. Very well. I shall await your call.
