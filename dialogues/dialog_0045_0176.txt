DOCTOR: Alright, Ivette Redeye, 50 years old. Good. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. It’s these hiccups, really. They just won’t stop. It’s been… goodness, more than two days now, I think. Maybe three? It’s quite irritating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Three days of hiccups…right. Well, that is irritating. Most hiccups resolve on their own, but three days is a bit long. Let's try to figure out what might be going on. Can you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Oh, they’re… normal hiccups, I suppose. You know, that little jerk in your chest, then you gulp air. They come and go, not every few seconds, but maybe every minute or so. It doesn't really hurt, exactly, it’s just… disruptive. I was trying to plan a little show for the community center, and it’s hard to think when you keep… hic …doing that! It's not pleasant, I can tell you.
DOCTOR: A show, huh?
PATIENT: Yes! A little performance. I manage the entertainment bookings for the center, you see. Mostly local talent – singers, dancers, a bit of everything. We’re trying to get things going again after… well, everything. And it’s hard to arrange things when you're constantly hic interrupting yourself! It's quite embarrassing when I'm on the phone with performers, too. They probably think I'm not taking them seriously.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, hiccups for three days, interrupting daily life, and potentially affecting your work… Let's go through some other things, just to rule things out. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. I was eating lunch, I think, when it started, but I eat lunch every day! And I was talking on the phone, but as I said, I do that a lot too. I wasn’t doing anything out of the ordinary, not that I can recall. I did have a big glass of water with my meal… could that be it? Though I drink plenty of water usually. hic It’s really just random, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, random onset. And no specific triggers. Have you had any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the hiccups. No fever, no stomach pain, no heartburn… nothing like that. I feel a little tired, maybe, but that's just because I haven't been sleeping well with all this hic… interrupting me, of course! It’s not a comfortable feeling, but it’s not painful or anything. I can eat and drink normally, though it’s a bit annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other symptoms. Let's talk about your medical history a bit, just in case. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been fine since, the doctor said. Nothing else that I can think of. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose! hic I've never been hospitalized or had any major surgeries. I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, history of slightly elevated blood pressure, currently stable. No major medical conditions, surgeries or hospitalizations. Good. Any family history of anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, I think. And my father had some heart trouble when he was older. My brother is perfectly healthy as far as I know. Honestly, we don't talk much, so I don't know all the details. It's not something we usually discuss, you know? hic It was a long time ago, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of diabetes and heart trouble in the family. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's it. Really! I find fresh air and a good cup of tea usually does the trick, but this… hic this is proving difficult! I haven't been sleeping well, and I worry it's making it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, just a multivitamin. And you’re not a smoker, are you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. I find the smell dreadful, honestly. And my late husband was a smoker, so… it’s not something I ever wanted to do. hic A bad habit, if you ask me! I prefer a good strong coffee, or as I said, a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay. No smoking, no medications. So, generally healthy. Now, let’s just have a quick listen to your chest and take your pulse, just to rule out anything obvious. It's a standard procedure, don’t worry. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. hic Whatever you need. I hope it’s not anything serious. This is really interfering with… everything! It's difficult to concentrate, and it's quite embarrassing, honestly. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your pulse is a little elevated, but that could just be from the stress of dealing with these hiccups. Blood pressure is 130/80, a little higher than ideal, but nothing alarming. Let's see… hic still hiccuping, of course. Okay. It doesn’t seem to be anything obviously serious, but three days is a long time. Now, I’m going to recommend a simple blood test, just to check your electrolytes and rule out any underlying imbalances. It’s a precaution, alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I’m happy to do that. Anything to get rid of these hic… nuisances! Electrolytes… what would cause those to be off? I do drink plenty of water, as I said. But maybe it’s the tea? I do drink quite a bit of strong tea, especially when I'm stressed. Is that a possibility?
DOCTOR: Well, strong tea can have a diuretic effect, meaning it can cause you to lose fluids and electrolytes. However, it's not usually enough to cause hiccups for three days. We need to rule out other causes first, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. I suppose I do have a rather strong bladder, if you don't mind my saying so. hic Well, if a blood test is the next step, let's get it done. Where do I go? And will it take long? I have a meeting this afternoon with the performers for the community show, and I really need to finalize the schedule. It's all rather hectic!
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll write you a requisition for the lab, it's just downstairs. It shouldn’t take long, maybe 30 minutes. They'll draw some blood, and the results should be available by the end of the day. In the meantime, try to relax and drink some water. And maybe cut back on the strong tea, just for now. hic It's probably not the cause, but it's worth a try. If the hiccups don't improve by tomorrow, give the office a call, and we'll discuss further options.
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Relax, drink water, cut back on the tea… I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor Billman. hic Hopefully, this will sort things out. I really appreciate your time and help. I’ll go and get the blood test done now. Let me know if you need anything else from me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let the lab know you're here for the electrolyte panel. I'll review the results when they come in. And try not to worry too much. We'll figure it out.
