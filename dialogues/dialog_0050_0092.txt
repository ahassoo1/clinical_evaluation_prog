DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor...Paraskevopoulos, you say? Sounds fancy. Well, I’m here ‘cause I can’t…breathe right. Feels like sandpaper in my throat all the time, and my eyes are drier than…than a lizard in the sun. It’s just…awful. I don’t know why it’s happening, but it’s been getting worse, you see?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. "Fancy" is merely a matter of heritage, Mr. Guilds. It sounds as though you’re experiencing some respiratory and ocular discomfort. “Sandpaper in your throat,” you say… and dry eyes. And you’ve noticed this worsening over what period of time, precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely? Oh, geez, don't ask me to be precise. I ain’t a clock. A while now. Maybe…a couple months? Hard to say. Things kinda blur together when you get old, you know? It's not like it happened overnight, doc. It just…slowly got worse and worse. Not fun, let me tell ya.
DOCTOR: A couple of months… I understand recall can be difficult. Has anything specific changed in your environment or routine during this period?
PATIENT: Routine? What routine? I get up, I eat, I watch TV...same as always. Environment… hmm. Well, the air’s been hotter than usual, that’s for sure. But it's Florida! It’s always hot. Don't think that’s new. And...oh! My neighbor got a new dog. A little yappy thing. But I doubt that’s making me cough. It's annoying, sure, but not…this.
DOCTOR: A new canine companion nearby… interesting. While unlikely, allergies are always a consideration. Now, let’s delve a little deeper into these symptoms. Can you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Cough? It's…a dry cough. Doesn’t bring anything up, you know? Just…a tickle that turns into a hack. Feels like my lungs are…scratched. It’s worse at night, I think. Keeps me up. And the throat, oh man, it's just…always scratchy, even when I’m not coughing. Like I swallowed a whole bunch of…well, sandpaper, I guess. Just awful.
DOCTOR: A dry, nocturnal cough with associated pharyngeal irritation… Have you experienced any fever, chills, or body aches accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Don’t feel feverish. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but that's just the Florida heat, I tell ya. Chills? Nah. And aches? My bones ache all the time. That's just being old. Don’t think those are connected. I mean, I’m eighty-three, doc. Everything aches.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, age does have its…peculiarities. Do you have any history of asthma, COPD, or other lung conditions?
PATIENT: Lung conditions? Hmph. No. Never been a smoker, if that's what you're getting at. Always told me it was a bad habit. My mother…she hated smoking. And I never needed to cough back then, see? Always healthy as a horse. Until…now, of course.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No history of smoking or lung disease. Now, let's review your current medications, if you don’t mind. Are you taking anything at all, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications…let me see… Oh, right! I take a little blue pill for my…you know. For the…waterworks. And sometimes, if my knees are really acting up, I take some ibuprofen. That's about it. Nothing fancy. Oh, and sometimes a prune juice if you wanna get real technical.
DOCTOR: A medication for urinary issues, ibuprofen as needed, and…prune juice. Noted. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Never had a problem with anything. Well… I don’t like cilantro. That stuff tastes like soap. But that’s not an allergy, doc. That's just common sense. I think. Don't remember ever being allergic to a medication though.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your lungs and take a look at your throat. If you’ll have a seat…
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don’t poke too hard, alright? These old bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Another deep breath… Good. Breathing sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, with mild end-inspiratory crackles in the lower lobes. Throat is mildly erythematous with no visible exudates. No cervical lymphadenopathy noted. Alright, Mr. Guilds. Your lungs sound a bit congested, and your throat is a little irritated. We’ll need to consider a few possibilities.
PATIENT: Congested? Irritated? See? I told you somethin’ was wrong! What possibilities? Is it serious, doc? Don't tell me I got somethin’ awful, alright? I ain’t got time for all that nonsense. Just fix it.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions, Mr. Guilds. It could be a number of things, ranging from a simple upper respiratory infection, possibly exacerbated by the dry air, to bronchitis, or even early pneumonia. The diminished lung sounds could also indicate some degree of chronic lung changes, which are common with age. Given your age and the lack of fever, I'm not overly concerned about a severe infection at this moment, but we need to rule things out. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs. And I'm going to prescribe a mild cough suppressant and suggest you use a humidifier. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: X-ray? A cough suppressant? Humph. Sounds…invasive. And expensive. But…fine. If you think it’s necessary. Just get it over with quickly, alright? And make sure that humidifier don't cost me an arm and a leg. I'm on a fixed income, you know. And...what will the X-ray show? Is it gonna show somethin’ really bad?
DOCTOR: The X-ray is a routine procedure, Mr. Guilds, and relatively inexpensive with your Medicare coverage. It will help us visualize your lungs and determine if there's any consolidation, fluid buildup, or other abnormalities. We can discuss the results as soon as they are available, typically within 24-48 hours. As for the humidifier, I can provide a list of affordable options. Now, while we await the X-ray results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake—water, tea, anything hydrating—and avoiding irritants like smoke and strong perfumes. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hydrating? Smoke and perfume… I don't go around smokin’ or wearin’ perfume, doc. That's ridiculous. Just tell me, is this gonna take long? I got my stories on TV, you know. And will this cough suppressant make me sleepy? I can’t fall asleep watchin’ my stories!
DOCTOR: The cough suppressant I’m prescribing, dextromethorphan, can cause mild drowsiness in some individuals, but it’s usually not significant. If it does cause you undue sleepiness, discontinue use. As for the time involved, the X-ray itself will only take a few minutes. The inconvenience is primarily the wait for the results. I’ll have the nurse draw up the prescription, and she’ll schedule the X-ray for you. We'll follow up once the results are available to discuss the next steps. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Nurse, huh? Well... alright. Just... make sure they don’t poke me too hard with any needles. And...tell them to hurry up with those stories, see? I got a new one startin’ tonight! Alright, alright… I think that's it. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Guilds. I’ll inform the nurse to be gentle. And I will make a note of your concern regarding your television program. Thank you for your patience today. .
