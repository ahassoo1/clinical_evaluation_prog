DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Or, uh... good afternoon, actually. Time gets away from me. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Honestly, I just want to get this sorted, if we can. A friend mentioned something about… a pill you can take to prevent things. That's what I'm here about. I don't even really know what it's called, but it's for… you know… staying safe. Is this where you talk about HIV?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… that’s right. We can definitely talk about that. It's called PrEP – Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. It’s a medication you take to reduce your risk of getting HIV. Your friend is absolutely right to bring it up. Before we go further, could you tell me a little bit about why you're thinking about PrEP?
PATIENT: Well… it's complicated. I’ve been… dating. It’s new, after a long time. And honestly, I haven’t always been… the best at asking a lot of questions. You know? It feels… awkward. And it's better to be safe than sorry, especially at my age. I’m not looking for trouble, I just want to… enjoy things without worrying. Does that make sense? I’m single, been that way for a while, and I’m starting to… get back out there.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Helaina. It’s very responsible of you to be thinking about this, and it's absolutely okay to want to enjoy yourself without unnecessary worry. A lot of people find those conversations… difficult. PrEP is a really good option for you, then. Before we start, just to be thorough, do you have any known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve had the usual, like penicillin as a kid, but nothing serious. No reactions, nothing that landed me in the hospital. I've got Medicare, so hopefully, everything's covered, but I’d rather know now than later, you know? Is it a daily pill? Because I'm terrible at remembering things. Though, I can usually recall dates pretty easily…strange, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the dates! Memory is a funny thing. And yes, the standard PrEP regimen is a daily pill. There is another option available now that's taken only on the days you anticipate being at risk, but for consistent protection, daily is generally recommended. Regarding Medicare, we'll definitely check your coverage before proceeding, so don't worry about that right now. Now, just to get a good overall picture… can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Let's see… I have high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. Been stable for years, thankfully. And my knees aren't what they used to be, but that’s just age, I suppose. Other than that… no major issues. I see my primary doctor regularly for check-ups, and everything’s been good. I also get regular bloodwork done – again, because of the blood pressure. They usually call if anything's off. I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Helaina. Managing the high blood pressure is excellent. And that’s helpful knowing you have regular checkups and bloodwork done. Do you know what medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: It’s… Lisinopril, I think? Yes, Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for… oh, goodness… almost ten years now. I usually get a refill automatically from the pharmacy, so I don’t even think about it much. They know my routine. Does that interact with… this PrEP thing? Sorry, I’m probably asking a lot of silly questions.
DOCTOR: No silly questions at all, Helaina. It's my job to make sure everything is safe and appropriate for you. Lisinopril… yes, let me check. It can interact with the PrEP medication, but it's usually manageable with monitoring of your kidney function and potassium levels. We’ll need to do some baseline bloodwork to get a clear picture, just to be safe. Now, before we go any further… Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times, actually. Mostly through my primary doctor, just as part of regular checkups. And… a couple of times with partners, when things got serious. I think the last time was… maybe a year ago? Everything came back negative, thankfully. I always made sure to ask, and they always made sure to test. It’s important, you know?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Helaina. Being proactive about testing is very responsible. So, you’ve had recent negative tests, and you're aware of the importance of safe practices. Before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… oh dear. What does that even mean? I don't do much socializing, honestly. I used to, a lot, but things changed. I have a few friends, but we mostly talk on the phone. I live alone, have for many years. And… I’ve been dating, as I mentioned. It's new, and…casual, at the moment. That's about it. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, if I'm feeling fancy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Helaina. It just helps me get a full picture of your lifestyle. No smoking, and only occasional drinking is very good. And knowing that you are starting to date again is helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure you are healthy enough to start PrEP. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Get it over with, I say. I have a hair appointment later, and I really don’t want to be late. I’m not one for waiting around, you see. The faster we get this sorted, the better. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Understood, Helaina. We'll be as quick as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please roll up your sleeve. 130 over 80. That’s pretty stable. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Finally, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Everything looks good. No signs of infection. Now, we will need to draw some blood for the baseline tests, as we discussed. That will check your kidney function, liver function, and rule out any STIs. It will take just a few minutes. Would you like me to explain the blood work orders before I write them?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I like to know what's going on. Better to be informed, you know? I don't want any surprises. Especially when it comes to bloodwork. I get a little… nervous around needles. It’s silly, I know, but still. Just tell me what they’re looking for, and how long it will take to get the results. And if they’re going to poke me more than once? I need to prepare myself mentally.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's not silly at all to be nervous about needles. We’ll take it slow and steady. So, the bloodwork will be sent to the lab to check your complete blood count - that tells us about your overall health. We’ll also be checking your kidney and liver functions. PrEP medication is processed through these organs, so we want to make sure they’re working properly. Finally, we'll do a screen for any sexually transmitted infections - it's standard procedure, just to make sure everything's clear before we start. It will likely involve one needle stick for several vials of blood. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make it as comfortable as possible. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have those, we can discuss the results and determine if PrEP is right for you, and if so, write a prescription. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Three to five days isn't too bad. And one needle stick is better than multiple. As long as they're gentle, I think I can handle it. Alright. Let’s get it over with, then. Where do I go? And… will someone explain the results to me when they come back? I don't want to be left guessing.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The phlebotomy lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. They'll take good care of you. Here’s the form - just give it to the phlebotomist. And yes, absolutely, you’ll get a full explanation of the results. Once the results are back, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we'll go over everything together. We’ll also discuss any necessary precautions and answer any questions you have. Is there anything else I can clarify for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… please make sure the nurse is good at explaining things. I don’t like medical jargon. And tell her I get nervous easily. I guess… that's it. Thank you, Doctor. Hopefully, this works out. I just want to be safe.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. I will definitely make a note for my nurse to be thorough and explain things in plain language, and to be mindful of your nervousness. We'll do everything we can to help you feel comfortable and safe. If you think of any questions once you get home, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Good luck, and I'll see you in about a week once the results are back. Have a good afternoon. And enjoy your hair appointment!
