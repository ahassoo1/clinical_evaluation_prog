DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Ottaviani. I'm Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well, it’s my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of these things. Just want it fixed, if that makes sense. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Fixed” is a good goal! Let’s try to figure out what’s going on with your throat. When you say “a little while,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe a week? Or was it longer? It all feels the same, truthfully. I don’t pay much mind to dates. It’s just… sore. Makes swallowing difficult. And it feels… scratchy. Like sandpaper, almost. Is that… normal? I really just need to know what I have to do to make it go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week or so. Scratchy and painful swallowing… that gives us a starting point. It can be normal with a sore throat, yes. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I suppose. It's worse when I… well, when I eat. And when I talk for too long. Which is… inconvenient. I don't have time for this, Doctor. Is it a bug? Do I need… something strong? I don’t like feeling weak.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. We'll try to get to the bottom of this quickly. It could be a virus, or it could be something else. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? I… I don't think so. I haven't felt feverish. And no chills. My bones don't ache, no. I'm usually quite… sturdy. Though I have been a bit tired lately. But that's just from work, I assume. A lot of standing. Does that matter? I haven’t been sleeping well either, but again, work. Is it serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or body aches, just tiredness. The tiredness could be related to the sore throat, or it could be from work as you said. Let's do a quick exam of your throat just to take a look and see what we're dealing with. Can you open your mouth for me, and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Very well. There. Quickly, if you please. I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some redness and a little swelling in your throat. Your tonsils are a bit enlarged, but nothing terribly concerning at first glance. Do you notice any white spots or pus on your tonsils?
PATIENT: White spots? Pus? I… honestly, I didn’t look. I don’t spend much time examining my own throat. Sounds… unpleasant. Are you saying it’s bad? Is it something catching? I have colleagues I need to protect. I don’t want to spread anything. Though, honestly, they should be looking after themselves. Is it contagious?
DOCTOR: It's good you're thinking of your colleagues. It could be contagious, depending on the cause. We need to determine what's causing the sore throat to know for sure. Have you had any cough, runny nose, or congestion?
PATIENT: A cough… yes, a little one. Not a bad one. Just… tickly. And my nose has been… stuffy. But I assumed it was the dust at work. We handle a lot of… particulate matter. Is it related to that? I really don’t have time for a cold. Is there a test I can take to find out what it is? A quick one?
DOCTOR: Okay, a tickly cough and stuffy nose. It could be related to dust at work, or it could be a simple upper respiratory infection. We can do a rapid strep test, which is pretty quick. It involves swabbing the back of your throat. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: A swab? Must it be? It sounds… invasive. But, I suppose if it’s quick… Yes, alright. Get it over with. The sooner I know, the sooner I can get back to things. Don't take too long, please. I have important matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Alright, this will just take a moment. Tilt your head back and open wide… ah. Okay, all done. It’ll take about 5-10 minutes for the results to come back. While we wait, have you had any difficulty breathing or swallowing liquids?
PATIENT: Swallowing liquids… yes, a bit. Not terribly difficult, but it's… uncomfortable. Like sandpaper, as I said. Just a little scratchy. Breathing is fine, thankfully. I need my lungs. That's my job, you know. Standing and… monitoring. Ten minutes, you said? It feels longer already. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Some sort of… remedy?
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Ms. Ottaviani. While we wait for the results, you can try gargling with warm salt water, that can help soothe the throat. And plenty of fluids, even if it's a little uncomfortable, is important. We also have some throat lozenges at the front desk if you'd like one. Okay, the test is back… and it’s negative for strep throat. That's good. It suggests this is likely a viral infection.
PATIENT: Viral, you say? So, it’s not… serious? Nothing catching? I can go back to work? Though, honestly, I don't understand what “viral” even means. Is there anything I need to avoid? Do I need to wear a mask? My colleagues would complain, you know. Just tell me what I need to do to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: A viral infection means it's caused by a virus, like a common cold. It's usually not serious, and antibiotics won’t help. It’s self-limiting, meaning it will resolve on its own with supportive care. While it’s not highly contagious, it's always a good idea to practice good hygiene—wash your hands frequently, cover your cough, and avoid close contact with others if you're feeling particularly unwell. A mask isn’t strictly necessary, but if you want to protect your colleagues, it wouldn’t hurt. The main things are rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the sore throat and any fever. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I don’t take much. Too busy. So, rest, fluids, and… those pills. Anything else? Can I go now? I really must get back. This has taken far too long. And if it's just a “virus”, why did I even come? It sounds like something I could have just… ridden out.
DOCTOR: You came to rule out anything more serious, like strep throat, which does require antibiotics. And to get some guidance on how to manage your symptoms. Okay, so to recap: negative for strep, likely a viral infection. Rest, fluids, over-the-counter pain relief as needed. If you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or if your symptoms worsen significantly, please come back or see another doctor immediately. I'll write you a note explaining you've been evaluated and have a likely viral illness. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that's all. A note is fine. Just… get it over with. I have things to do. I suppose… thank you. Though, honestly, this has been a waste of time. You’d think a simple cold wouldn't require a doctor’s visit.
