DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor. Dashevsky, you say? A nice name. Well, it’s my leg, dear. Been botherin’ me something awful lately. At night, mostly. Just…cramps. Sharp little pains. It’s hard to explain, really. It just… hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Bilstein. Leg pain, particularly at night, with cramping and sharp pains. I understand it’s difficult to explain, and that's perfectly alright. Can you tell me a little more about where exactly on your leg you're feeling this pain?
PATIENT: Oh… where now? Hmm. It’s… hard to say precisely. It feels like… all over, really. Mostly in the calf, I think? That’s the back of the lower leg, isn’t it? But sometimes it’s higher up, closer to my knee. And… sometimes even in my foot. It sort of travels around, if that makes any sense. It doesn’t stay in one place long.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Bilstein. Pain that travels is common. So, it sounds like it’s affecting your calf mostly, but can radiate up towards your knee and even down into your foot. And you mentioned it’s worse at night?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. Much worse at night. It wakes me up, usually. I try to stretch it out, you know? Wiggle my toes, move my ankle… sometimes it helps a little. But it always comes back. It’s just…uncomfortable. I used to be able to sleep through anything, but not anymore. It’s been goin’ on for… oh, I don’t know exactly how long. A few weeks, maybe? Longer? Time slips my mind these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. A few weeks, maybe longer. That's alright, we'll try to figure it out. And it’s good you’re trying to stretch it. Have you noticed anything that makes it better during the day, besides stretching?
PATIENT: Hmm. Better during the day… Let me think. Walkin’ helps a little, I suppose. Not a lot, but if I’m up and movin’ around, it doesn’t bother me as much. Sittin’ for too long is bad. That makes it worse. And… warm baths. A warm bath feels nice on my legs. It doesn’t cure it, mind you, but it’s soothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, walking helps somewhat, and warm baths are soothing, but sitting for long periods makes it worse. That's helpful information. Now, Ms. Bilstein, have you had any injuries to your leg recently?
PATIENT: Injuries… oh dear. Not that I recall, no. I haven’t fallen or anything. I used to be quite nimble, you know? Always out and about. But… well, I’m older now. Things aren’t as easy as they used to be. I might have bumped it on somethin’ around the house, but nothin’ serious enough to cause all this pain. I just don't remember, if I did.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent injuries that you recall. And you said you’re older now, which is perfectly fine. It's good to be aware of changes as we age. Now, Ms. Bilstein, do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Doctor…well, my heart's been a little fluttery sometimes, but they told me not to worry about it. Just old age, they said. And… no, I don’t think so. I had a bit of trouble with my arthritis in my hands, but that’s all. Nothing major. I don't think so, dear. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart flutter occasionally, but nothing they were concerned about, and arthritis in your hands. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications for anything, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just a little somethin' for my arthritis, now and then. Ibuprofen, I believe it’s called. When it flares up real bad. And… sometimes I take a little vitamin D, the doctor suggested it. But that’s about it. Nothing regular, really. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and some vitamin D. Thank you. Now, Ms. Bilstein, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. I used to help my mother with her garden, and I'd get a little itchy sometimes from the flowers, but that wasn't an allergy, just a little irritation. No, I don't think so, dear. No allergies to speak of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to hear. Now, Ms. Bilstein, I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your legs to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, dear. That sounds alright. I don’t mind at all. Just be gentle, if you would. My skin is a little thin these days. But yes, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Bilstein, I'm just going to gently feel along your calves to see if there are any areas of tenderness. And I’ll check the pulses in your feet. Alright. I’m noticing some tenderness in your right calf. Your pulses are a bit diminished, which can be common with age, and there's some stiffness when I move your ankles. I also notice a little bit of swelling in your lower legs, especially on the right side. Do you notice any swelling in your legs yourself?
PATIENT: Swelling… oh, now that you mention it… yes, a little. I thought it was just old age, you know? My ankles feel a little puffy sometimes, especially at the end of the day. And my shoes feel a little tighter than they used to. But I didn't think much of it. Just put it down to gettin’ older. Yes, I suppose there is a little swelling. Mostly in my ankles and feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Bilstein, that's helpful. So, swelling in your ankles and feet, particularly at the end of the day. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of peripheral artery disease, or PAD, combined with some venous insufficiency. PAD is when the arteries that supply blood to your legs become narrowed, and venous insufficiency is when the veins have trouble returning blood from your legs to your heart. The swelling could be from the veins not working as efficiently. However, to confirm this, I'd like to order a few tests. I’m thinking an Ankle-Brachial Index to check the blood flow in your legs, and a Duplex ultrasound to look at the veins in your legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… tests? Now, that sounds a bit serious, doesn’t it? Arteries and veins… I’m not a very good reader of medical things, you know. I’m just an old woman with achin’ legs. An ABI… and a Duplex… What do those even do, dear? And will they hurt? I don’t want anything painful, you know. I just want my legs to stop hurtin’ at night.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Bilstein. It does sound a bit daunting, but these tests are very common and generally not painful at all. The Ankle-Brachial Index, or ABI, is a simple test where I use a blood pressure cuff to check the blood flow in your ankles and arms. It just involves taking a few blood pressure readings. The Duplex ultrasound is a non-invasive test where I use a gel and a handheld device to create images of the veins in your legs. It doesn't involve any needles or radiation. It might feel a little cold from the gel, but that's all. These tests will help me understand exactly what's going on and determine the best course of treatment to help relieve your leg pain. It's important to get a clear picture so we can address this properly. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… well, when you explain it like that… it doesn’t sound so bad. No needles, you say? And just a little cold gel? That I can handle. I always liked the smell of those medical things, remind me of my mother. So, no hurtin’? Just checkin’ the blood and lookin’ at the veins? Alright then, dear. Yes, I suppose I can do that. If it will help my legs, I’m willing to try. When can we do these tests?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Bilstein. No hurting, just checking the blood flow and looking at the veins. The lab is right down the hall. We can get the ABI done right away. Then, the technician can schedule you for the Duplex ultrasound. It usually takes a few days to get an appointment, but they'll try to fit you in as soon as possible. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to recommend that you elevate your legs whenever you're sitting or lying down. That will help with the swelling. And I’m also going to suggest compression stockings. They’ll help improve blood flow in your legs. Have you ever worn compression stockings before?
PATIENT: Oh… compression stockings? No, dear. Never. Sounds a bit…tight, doesn’t it? I’m a simple woman, you know? I usually just wear comfortable slippers. But… if it will help… I suppose I can try anything once. Elevate my legs… that’s easy enough. I do like to put my feet up. But these stockings… where do I get them? And are they…comfortable? I don’t want to feel squeezed all day long.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Bilstein. Compression stockings come in different levels of compression, and we can start with a mild level to see how comfortable you are. They are designed to gently squeeze your legs to help improve blood flow, not to squeeze tightly. I’m going to write you a prescription for them, and the pharmacy down the street carries a variety of brands and sizes. They can help you get the right fit. They’ll likely measure your legs to ensure they are the correct size. In the meantime, try to walk as much as you comfortably can throughout the day, as that also helps improve circulation. And we’ll discuss the test results and develop a plan once we have them. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, a prescription… that sounds proper. And someone to help me fit them? That’s good. I don’t have the best eyes these days, you know. Walking… I can do that. I like a little stroll around the garden when the weather is nice. Yes, dear. That sounds good. As long as someone is there to help me with these stockings, I’m willing to try anything to stop this achin’. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. You've put my mind at ease a bit.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. That's my job. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. Here is your prescription for the compression stockings and the order for the ABI. The lab technician will be expecting you. Just take these to the front desk, and they'll get you checked in. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your test. And we’ll see you back here once we have the results to discuss them. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Bilstein?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s everything for now. You’ve been very kind and patient with an old woman like me. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so well. I’ll go to the lab now and get this done. And I’ll try to find some of these stockings. Thank you again, Doctor Dashevsky. You’ve been a real comfort. I suppose I'll see you in a few days. .
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Ms. Bilstein. I’m happy to help. Please take your time getting to the lab, and don’t hesitate to ask for assistance if you need it. I’ll see you in a few days. Have a good day, Ms. Bilstein.
