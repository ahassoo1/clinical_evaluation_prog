DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my back, mostly. It’s been… painful, lately. Not like a sudden thing, more of a slow build-up, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A slow build-up is helpful to know. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay, let me think. It’s mostly in my lower back, right around here . It aches a lot, especially if I’ve been standing for a while. Or, uh, bending over. Lifting things is… not great. It just feels stiff, and then kinda shoots pain if I push it too far.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, worse with standing, bending, and lifting. And you described it as an ache with shooting pain when you overdo it. Has this pain been radiating anywhere – down your legs, for example?
PATIENT: You know, now that you mention it… yeah, a little. Not all the way down, but sometimes I get a tingling feeling in my right leg. Just the back of it, kinda like the hamstring. It doesn’t happen all the time though. It’s more when the back pain is really bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, tingling in the right leg, specifically the hamstring, and that seems to correlate with the severity of your back pain. And how long has this been going on for, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That’s a good question. It’s been… probably a couple of months now? Maybe three? It started off just being a little stiff after gardening, and then it just… didn’t go away. It slowly got worse, you know? I didn't think much of it at first, just figured I pulled something.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months, started with stiffness after gardening, and gradually worsened. Have you tried anything to manage the pain so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. My wife, she gave me some of those heat patches, you know, the ones you stick on? They help a little, for a bit. And I’ve been trying to stretch, but it’s hard when it already hurts! I haven’t taken any pills or anything. I try to avoid medicine if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, heat patches provide some temporary relief, and you've been attempting stretching. That's good. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you had any problems with your back before this?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not really. I mean, I've had the occasional ache after heavy lifting, but nothing like this. When I was younger, I used to play basketball, and I think I twisted my back once, but that was years ago. It healed up pretty quick, though. Nothing chronic or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior chronic back issues, just a basketball injury years ago that resolved. Do you have any numbness or weakness in either of your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or weakness. I can walk just fine, and everything feels normal there. It’s just the ache in my back and that little tingling sometimes. It doesn’t feel like it’s affecting how I use my legs, if that makes sense. I can still do things, I just don’t want to, because of the pain.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Okay, Mr. Way, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, Mr. Way, that's helpful. I'm noting some tenderness to the touch in your lower back, particularly on the right side. Your range of motion is slightly limited, and I did detect some muscle spasm. Your reflexes and strength are normal in both legs, which is reassuring. The straight leg raise test elicits some discomfort on the right side at around 30 degrees. Do you feel that discomfort as the tingling you mentioned?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s it! That’s the same feeling. It’s not sharp, more like a stretching, pulling sensation. It starts right there and goes down the back of my leg. Not all the way to my foot, but pretty close. It’s… yeah, that’s definitely the same thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on the exam, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain, potentially with some mild nerve involvement – that tingling down your leg suggests some irritation of the sciatic nerve. It’s good that your strength and reflexes are normal, which means we’re not dealing with something more serious at this point. Now, I want to be thorough. Do you have any issues with your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: No, no problems there at all. Everything’s… regular, if you know what I mean. No trouble going, no changes in anything like that. That’s good, right? That’s a good thing to hear?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very good to hear. That’s important to rule out. Okay, Mr. Way, based on everything you’ve told me and the exam, I’m leaning towards a diagnosis of lumbar strain with possible mild sciatica. Now, it’s important to remember this is preliminary. I’d like to order some X-rays just to rule out any other structural issues, like fractures or significant arthritis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds smart. If it’ll make sure we know what’s going on, then yeah, let’s do the X-rays. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to feel better, you know? How long do you think that'll take?
DOCTOR: Okay. The X-rays will take just a few minutes. We can do them right here in the clinic. After we review those results, we can discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing the heat packs, and avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity that worsens your pain. I’ll also have the nurse give you a handout with some gentle stretching exercises you can try. We'll take it slow. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Heat packs, no lifting, and gentle stretches. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a lot better already, knowing what we’re looking at. Where do we go for the X-rays?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a bit. The X-ray technician is just down the hall, in room three. I'll meet you back here once they're done. Should be about 15 to 20 minutes. I'll also have the nurse bring that handout to you.
PATIENT: .
