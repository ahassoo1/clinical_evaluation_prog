DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Reisig. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to make your acquaintance as well. Well, it’s a rather…embarrassing matter, truth be told. I’ve been dabbling in some rather…enthusiastic dietary regimes, shall we say, and I thought it prudent to get a professional opinion before I do any further damage. I’m Jarvis Vantine, by the way. Perhaps you have my file?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Vantine, I do have your file here. It seems you’ve been a patient with our clinic for some time. And you’re right to be cautious – it’s always best to discuss these things with a physician. “Enthusiastic dietary regimes,” you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. You see, my profession – special effects and animation – lends itself to… long hours and irregular schedules. And I read an article, quite a compelling one, about a rather restrictive diet. It promised quite remarkable results, and, well… I thought I’d give it a try. It involved a great deal of… cabbage, as I recall. And very little else. It’s been… a week now.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And primarily cabbage, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a great deal of it. Boiled, steamed, juiced… you name it. Honestly, Doctor, I'm beginning to dream of cabbage. It was touted as a… a rapid detoxification method. I believe it originated from a rather… eccentric online personality, now that I think about it. Rather a lot of shouting in the videos, if memory serves. I thought, “What harm could a week do?” I seem to be finding out, presently.
DOCTOR: I see. And what sort of effects have you been experiencing since starting this diet?
PATIENT: Well, the initial enthusiasm was…misplaced, shall we say. A great deal of…discomfort, primarily. Let's just say my digestive system is staging a rather vocal protest. And a distinct lack of energy. I’ve found concentrating on my work… challenging. Animation requires a certain…steadiness of hand, you understand. It’s proving rather difficult to achieve when one is preoccupied with… internal rumblings. And the smell, Doctor. The smell lingers. It permeates everything. Even my studio.
DOCTOR: I understand. Digestive discomfort, low energy, and difficulty concentrating… and a persistent odor, you say. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation alongside these symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, well, the… shall we say, elimination has been… erratic. Mostly diarrhea, if I'm being frank. And a touch of nausea, particularly in the evenings. Vomiting, thankfully, no. Not yet. But I confess, Doctor, I had a rather unsettling experience this morning. I attempted a simple sketch – a rather intricate mechanical contraption, you see – and my hand was trembling so violently I nearly ruined the entire drawing. It was quite alarming, actually. I pride myself on my precision. This cabbage diet is… undermining my artistry.
DOCTOR: I see. Tremors along with the other symptoms are concerning. And it sounds like this diet is significantly impacting your quality of life. To get a clearer picture, Mr. Vantine, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m generally quite healthy, all things considered. I’ve never been hospitalised, thankfully. No major illnesses. I had a bout of influenza in 1987, a rather nasty one, but I recovered fully. My blood pressure is usually excellent – I have it checked annually. And I've always maintained a reasonable weight, despite my rather… erratic work schedule. I did have my appendix removed in 1962, but that was many years ago and caused no lasting complications. Other than that… I’m rather unremarkable, medically speaking. A touch of arthritis in my hands, naturally, given my profession, but nothing debilitating.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major illnesses, appendix removed in 1962, some arthritis in your hands, and generally good health otherwise. And you said you have your blood pressure checked annually?
PATIENT: Yes, indeed. Dr. Ainsworth, a very competent physician, although he retired last year. He always commented on my strong pulse, which I rather attributed to copious amounts of tea. Earl Grey, primarily. I do enjoy a good cup of tea. It fuels my creativity, you see. Although, admittedly, the caffeine isn't helping with the tremors. I should probably curtail my intake. But it's a habit, Doctor. A deeply ingrained habit. And a rather comforting one. Perhaps we should focus on the cabbage first, however. It seems to be the primary culprit.
DOCTOR: We can certainly focus on the cabbage, Mr. Vantine. And we can discuss your tea consumption later. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I pride myself on avoiding pharmaceuticals whenever possible. A bit of a stubborn streak, I confess. I believe in the body’s natural ability to heal itself, within reason, of course. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, a rather basic formulation, but it’s been months, I assure you. And I haven’t taken any painkillers or other remedies for… well, decades. I’ve always been fortunate enough to avoid needing them. So, no, nothing at all. Just a great deal of cabbage, and a regrettable amount of regret.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. And no allergies that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. I can tolerate most foods, although I’ve never been particularly fond of Brussels sprouts. A rather unpleasant flavour, in my opinion. But allergies, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve even been stung by bees on occasion – a consequence of working outdoors during location scouting – and suffered nothing more than a mild local irritation. So, no, no allergies, Doctor. Just a lingering aversion to cabbage, which is rapidly escalating into a full-blown phobia, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies, just a developing aversion to cabbage. Thank you for that information, Mr. Vantine. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and assess your reflexes. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your professional judgement implicitly. I haven’t been subjected to a thorough examination in… well, decades, I suspect. I confess, I’m rather dreading the abdomen check, given my current… digestive state. But I suppose it’s necessary. Please proceed at your convenience. I’ll endeavour to remain still, despite the internal rumblings. And I apologize in advance for any… unexpected noises.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Vantine. We'll take it slowly. Alright, deep breaths in and out for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Hmm. There's some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, as expected. And I can feel some…gaseous distention. No masses detected. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Overall, the exam findings are consistent with gastrointestinal distress. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your reflexes are normal. The tenderness and distention in your abdomen likely relate to the diet.
PATIENT: That’s…reassuring to hear, Doctor. Despite the discomfort, it’s a relief to know there’s no underlying cause for alarm. So, the cabbage is indeed the culprit, as suspected. I confess, I’m rather relieved. I was beginning to envision all sorts of dreadful ailments. What is your recommendation, Doctor? Should I simply…abstain from cabbage altogether? And is there anything I can do to alleviate the…internal turbulence? Perhaps a soothing beverage? Although, given my proclivity for tea… perhaps that’s not the wisest course of action.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Vantine, the cabbage is almost certainly the primary cause of your symptoms. I strongly recommend stopping the diet immediately. Continuing it will only worsen your discomfort. As for alleviating the turbulence, hydration is key. Water is best. Avoid sugary drinks and caffeine, as you correctly pointed out. You might also try a bland diet for a few days – things like toast, crackers, and rice. Over-the-counter medications like bismuth subsalicylate or loperamide can help with the diarrhea, but use them cautiously and follow the package instructions. If your symptoms worsen or persist for more than a few days, you should contact me immediately. I'm going to document these findings and our discussion. We’ll also order a basic metabolic panel to check your electrolyte levels, just to be safe, given the diarrhea.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Hydration, bland diet, cautious use of over-the-counter remedies… and electrolytes. I shall adhere to your instructions meticulously. I confess, the thought of resuming a normal diet is rather appealing at this moment. Toast, you say? Perhaps with a small amount of marmalade? It’s been… weeks since I’ve enjoyed a simple slice of toast. And thank you for ordering the metabolic panel. I appreciate your thoroughness. Is there anything else I should be aware of, Doctor? Any warning signs I should be particularly vigilant for? Or any… long-term effects I should anticipate? I wouldn’t want to embark on another ill-advised dietary regime without being fully informed.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. It's good you're asking these questions. Regarding warning signs, please contact me immediately if you experience severe abdominal pain, high fever, bloody stools, or signs of dehydration – like dizziness, decreased urination, or extreme thirst. These could indicate a more serious problem. As for long-term effects, it's unlikely that this short-term diet will cause any lasting harm, but prolonged restriction can lead to nutrient deficiencies and other health problems. It’s always best to consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet. I'm also going to recommend a follow-up appointment in one week to check your blood work and assess your progress. We can discuss your dietary habits in more detail then and perhaps explore healthier options. And please, Mr. Vantine, steer clear of any extreme diets for the foreseeable future. A balanced and varied diet is always the best approach. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything admirably. A balanced and varied diet… yes, I wholeheartedly concur. I suspect my foray into the world of cabbage was a rather foolish endeavour. I shall heed your advice and prioritize moderation in the future. Thank you for your patience and understanding, Doctor. And for rescuing me from the clutches of cabbage. I appreciate your thoroughness and your gentle…rebuke. I feel considerably reassured. I shall schedule a follow-up appointment immediately. And I promise, no more extreme diets. Toast and marmalade, it is. .
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Vantine. I'm glad I could help. And remember, if anything changes or you have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, and enjoy your toast!
