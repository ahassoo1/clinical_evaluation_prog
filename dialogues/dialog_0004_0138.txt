DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain, really. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. There's been… well, some things happening. Mostly, it's about my side. It gets weak sometimes. And my family… we have a lot of bad luck with headaches, awful ones. That's what she was worried about, I think. I don’t remember all the details, you see. It’s just… been on my mind.
DOCTOR: Weakness in your side… alright. And headaches, you say. Can you describe this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, it's not all the time. It just… feels heavy, like it's hard to lift my arm, sometimes. Or my leg feels like it’s dragging a little. It comes and goes, you see? It’s not… constant. And it’s usually just one side, I think. Left side, maybe? Or was it the right? It’s hard to say for sure. It doesn't hurt, exactly, just… doesn’t work like it should. And it doesn't happen every day, thankfully. It just… worries me, you know?
DOCTOR: And these headaches... are they new?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… no, not new. My mother had them, terrible ones. And my sister, too. I’ve always had a bit of a sensitive head, you know? But… they haven’t been worse lately, not that I recall. Just… headaches. Sometimes a dull ache, sometimes sharper. I usually just take something for it, and it goes away. It’s just… my daughter, she got very concerned when my side started feeling weak, and she said something about… well, something about family history and needing to get it checked. I don’t remember exactly what she said. Old age, you know. It steals your memory.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try to be as precise as possible. You've mentioned weakness on one side, which comes and goes, and headaches that you've experienced for a long time. When you say the weakness “comes and goes”, how long does an episode typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a good question. Let me think… It's not like it lasts all day, certainly. Maybe… an hour? Sometimes less. It feels… off, and then it fades. It's hard to say for sure. It's not something I time, you see. It just… comes and goes. And it doesn't happen every day. Maybe a few times a week? Or less? I really couldn't say. My daughter, she's very good with details. She'd probably know better than me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the weakness and headaches, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Other symptoms… well, I’ve been a bit tired lately, but who isn’t? I sleep alright, I think. Maybe not as well as I used to, but that comes with age, doesn't it? And… sometimes I feel a little dizzy, but that might be just getting up too fast. Oh! And my vision… I don’t think it’s changed, but I haven't really noticed. I don’t read much anymore, you see. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure if any of that’s related. It's just… the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. It’s hard to know what’s important and what isn’t.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's go through some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. I used to take a penicillin when I was younger, a long time ago, but that was ages ago and I don’t remember any problems. I eat everything, thankfully! My daughter always worries about me, but I’m a pretty simple eater, nothing fancy. No, I don’t think I have any allergies, Doctor. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… Just the one. For my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called? A little white pill. I take one every morning. And sometimes, if I have a really bad headache, I’ll take Tylenol. But that’s just as needed, you know? Not every day. Just when I really need it. That’s it, Doctor. Just the blood pressure pill, and Tylenol sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Nothing to worry about, just checking your reflexes, strength, and a few other things. Could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. Old bones aren’t as cooperative as they used to be, you know. But I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Tofani, I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Is this alright? I don't want to be a bother. I'm not very strong, you know. Just a little old lady. But I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Good. And now, can you push your hands down against mine?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. There. Is that alright? I’m trying, Doctor. I don’t want to disappoint you. It feels a little… stiff, maybe? Especially on this side. Or is that normal? I’m not sure anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. I always worry about these things. Is everything alright? I haven’t had my reflexes checked in… well, I can't even remember the last time. Are you seeing something wrong?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a bit diminished on both sides, which is not uncommon at your age. However, the asymmetry is notable. Now, I’m going to check your gait. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. My balance isn't what it used to be, you know. I don’t want to fall. Just a few steps? Alright. Is that alright? I’m trying to be careful. This is a little scary, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. Please sit down. Thank you. Now, based on your history and the exam findings, I’d like to order a brain MRI to rule out any structural issues. It’s important to investigate the cause of your weakness and the asymmetry we’ve seen today. It’s likely nothing serious, but we need to get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… an MRI? Is that… is that bad? I've heard those machines are very noisy and… scary. I don’t like being closed in, you know. Is there another way? I’m not sure I can do that. My daughter, she’s always been the brave one. Is it absolutely necessary? I’m just… a little frightened, Doctor. You said it’s likely nothing serious, but… still. I get so anxious about these things.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Tofani. An MRI is the best way to get a definitive answer, and it's crucial to rule out any potential problems. The machine is noisy, and it does involve lying in a relatively confined space, but we can offer you headphones to help with the noise, and a mild sedative if you’re particularly anxious. It’s also a very quick procedure, usually less than an hour. We can discuss the risks and benefits in more detail. However, if you are absolutely opposed to an MRI, we can consider a CT scan as an alternative, although it’s not as sensitive and provides less detailed information. There's also the possibility of a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you like me to discuss those options with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a sedative? That sounds… better, I suppose. A little less scary. And a CT scan… is that as bad as the MRI? My daughter, she always said the MRI was the best, but she doesn’t get anxious like me. If the MRI is really the best way to know what’s going on… and with a sedative… maybe I could do it. It’s just… I don’t like being closed in, you know. And the noise… But if it’s important, and my daughter thinks it’s best… then maybe. Could you tell me more about the sedative? And what will happen during the scan? I just need to know what to expect, Doctor. A little reassurance would be very helpful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Tofani. Let's talk through it. The sedative we offer is a mild medication, usually a short-acting benzodiazepine, that will help you relax during the scan. It won't put you to sleep completely, but it will significantly reduce any anxiety and make you feel more comfortable. You'll still be able to hear and respond to instructions. During the scan, you'll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It's important to remain very still during the procedure, as any movement can blur the images. We'll provide you with headphones to block out some of the noise, and a technician will be monitoring you throughout the entire scan. The procedure itself usually takes about 30-45 minutes. Before the scan, we’ll need to make sure you don't have any contraindications to the sedative, like allergies or certain medical conditions. And we’ll need someone to drive you home afterwards, as you won’t be able to drive yourself. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: Oh… that does sound a little better, Doctor. Someone to drive me home, that’s good. My daughter will definitely do that. And not being completely asleep… that's reassuring. So, they’ll just give me a pill, and then I lie in the tunnel, and they take pictures? And it's noisy, but I can wear headphones? I think… I think I could do that. As long as my daughter is with me, and the technician is there… and I have the headphones. And the sedative, of course. What kind of pictures are they taking, Doctor? What are they looking for, exactly? I always want to know what’s going on. It makes me less anxious if I understand things. Just tell me, in simple terms, what they’re trying to find.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, that's exactly right. The sedative will help you relax, and your daughter can be there with you for support. As for what we’re looking for, the MRI allows us to get detailed images of your brain. We’re primarily trying to rule out any structural abnormalities, such as a stroke, tumor, or areas of inflammation. These things can sometimes cause weakness and other neurological symptoms. We’ll also be looking for any signs of bleeding or other damage to the brain. Think of it like taking an X-ray, but much more detailed. It doesn't involve any radiation, and it's a very safe procedure. The technician will be able to see the images as they’re being taken, and they’ll let me know if they see anything concerning. The radiologist, a doctor who specializes in interpreting images, will then review the scans and send me a detailed report. We’ll discuss the results together once they’re available. Does that help clarify things?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that makes much more sense, Doctor. Like a detailed X-ray… that I can understand. No radiation, that’s good. And my daughter can be with me, and the technician will be there. And you’ll explain everything afterwards. That sounds… alright. I think I can do that. So, what do we do now? Do we schedule the appointment? And do I need to do anything special beforehand? Like not eat or anything? I always worry about forgetting something important. My daughter is good with details, but I want to be prepared, too.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, let's schedule the appointment. We have availability next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you and your daughter?
PATIENT: Oh, Tuesday at 10:00 AM… let me think. Yes, that should be alright. My daughter usually has the day off on Tuesdays. Yes, that’s perfect. And what do I need to do before the appointment, Doctor? Should I stop taking any of my medications? Or anything like that? I just want to be sure I do everything right. I always want to be a good patient, you know. And is there any paperwork I need to fill out beforehand?
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I’ve scheduled the appointment for you next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Regarding preparation, please continue taking your blood pressure medication as usual. Do not stop taking it. We will review your medications again before the scan to ensure everything is safe. As for paperwork, yes, there’s a consent form and a questionnaire about your medical history that we’ll need you to complete when you arrive. It shouldn’t take too long. Also, please arrive 15 minutes early to allow time for check-in and to complete the paperwork. And, please let us know if you have any metal implants in your body, such as a pacemaker or surgical clips. That’s very important for safety reasons. Does that cover everything?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s very helpful, Doctor. Continue my medication, arrive early, and fill out the paperwork. And tell you about any metal… that’s important, yes. I don’t think I have any metal, but I’ll ask my daughter just to be sure. She knows my medical history much better than I do. Oh, and one more thing… is it okay if I bring a small blanket? I get cold easily, you know. And it might help me relax during the scan. That’s everything, I think. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Tofani. Yes, absolutely, you can bring a small blanket. We want you to be as comfortable as possible. We will do everything we can to make the experience as smooth and stress-free as possible. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We look forward to seeing you next Tuesday.
