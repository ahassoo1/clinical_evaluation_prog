DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. Good morning. I… I got a cough. Been coughin’ up stuff. Red stuff. Not good, you know? I smoke, so… maybe that? I dunno. I just want it to stop, really. It's… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A cough producing red sputum is certainly something we need to investigate. It’s good you mentioned the smoking history – that’s important information. To help me get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: More about it…? Uh… it started, I think… a couple weeks ago? Maybe more. Time kinda… slips away. It was just a normal cough at first. But then the… the red started showin’ up. Not every time, just sometimes. Mostly in the mornings, I think. And it’s… it’s a pretty bad cough. Makes my chest hurt. I try to ignore it, but… well, you see. I don't really… keep track of things like that. How long, exactly? I really don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few weeks with a cough that has progressed to include red sputum and associated chest discomfort. That's helpful, even without a precise timeline. Just to clarify, when you say "red," is it bright red, like fresh blood, or more of a darker, rusty color?
PATIENT: Uh… hmm. It’s… kinda dark, I guess. Not bright. More… old, maybe? Like… rust. Yeah, rust is a good word. Definitely not bright red, like… cut yourself red. More like… old pennies, kinda. Does that make sense? I don't know about… colors. Never been good with that stuff.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mr. Reyno. "Old pennies" gives me a much clearer picture. Darker, older blood is different than bright red blood. Now, aside from the cough and chest discomfort, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Uh… I get… tired, sometimes. Real tired. But I always been kinda tired. Workin' all day dispatchin' power... it's a hard job. And I… I guess I’ve been losin’ weight, but I haven't really been eatin’ much lately. Not feelin’ hungry. No fever, though. Definitely no fever. And… I don't know. Just… tired. Is that it? Hard to say. Everything feels kinda… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and unintentional weight loss along with the cough. That’s good information. Not feeling hungry is also relevant. Now, have you experienced any shortness of breath, or any pain when you take a deep breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… …Yeah, sometimes. Not all the time. Mostly when I… when I’ve been walkin’ up a hill, or… doin’ somethin’. Not just sittin’ here. It’s… gets harder to breathe, like I can't get enough air. And… yeah, it hurts a little when I take a deep breath. Right here. Not a bad pain, but… noticeable. It's… a dull ache. Mostly when I try to take a big breath. Does that make sense? I'm probably just out of shape.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Reyno. Shortness of breath on exertion and a dull chest pain with deep breaths are important details. Now, do you have any significant medical history that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Significant medical history… Not really. Just… the usual aches and pains. I get my Medicare checkups, but… they don’t really find anything. I mean, I’m an older guy, ya know? Things start breakin’ down. I haven't been to the hospital, nothin' like that. Just… regular checkups. And… I think I had the flu, once. A long time ago. Does that count? I don't really remember much about it. I'm not really one for doctors, to be honest. Mostly just try to tough it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy with routine Medicare checkups and a past history of the flu. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Nope. Never had any surgeries. Nope. Not that I remember, anyway. Never been in bad enough shape for surgery, thankfully. Always been pretty lucky, I guess. Just… minor stuff. Old age aches and pains, ya know? Nothing that needed cuttin’ open. No. Definitely no surgeries. I'm pretty sure about that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of lung problems, like emphysema or lung cancer, in your family?
PATIENT: Lung problems… Hmm. That’s… hard to say. My… my mother smoked, a long time ago. She died when I was young, though. I don’t really know what she died of. And my father… he didn't smoke, but he was always… kinda sick. Just general sickness, ya know? Not lung problems, exactly. My brother smokes too, but… he’s fine, as far as I know. We don't really talk much anymore. So… not really. Not that I remember, anyway. It was a long time ago. I don't keep track of that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mother who smoked and a father with a general history of illness, but no known specific lung disease. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Medications… Nope. Not takin' nothin'. Never been one for pills. Just… tough it out, ya know? And… allergies? Nope. Never had any allergies. Not that I know of. Maybe a little sniffly sometimes, but that’s just the dust, ya think? Nope. No medications. No allergies. Pretty simple, really. I'm a pretty simple guy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications and no known allergies. Thank you for that information, Mr. Reyno. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. Just… get it over with, ya know? I got things to do. Not feelin' too good, so… the quicker, the better. Lungs and heart, you said? Alright. Go ahead. Just be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Reyno. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, Mr. Reyno. I noticed some diminished breath sounds in the lower portions of both lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I did note some tenderness when I pressed on your chest. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yeah… a little. Right there, kinda. Not bad, but… noticeable. It’s like… a dull ache. Like I been coughin’ too much. Is that bad? It doesn't hurt all the time, just when you push. And… is somethin' wrong with my lungs? You said somethin' about… diminished? That doesn't sound good.
DOCTOR: The diminished breath sounds and tenderness are concerning, Mr. Reyno, but not necessarily indicative of anything immediately life-threatening. It could be a number of things, including bronchitis, pneumonia, or something related to your smoking history. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray…? More stuff…? Look, doc, can't you just… give me somethin' for the cough? I don't like goin' to hospitals and stuff. I just want it to stop coughin', ya know? Is it really necessary? Can't you tell just by listenin’? I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Reyno. I wouldn’t order it if I didn’t think it was important. While listening to your lungs gives me valuable information, an X-ray allows me to visualize what’s happening inside your chest and rule out more serious conditions, like pneumonia or even a mass. We can discuss alternatives, but without further investigation, I wouldn’t be able to provide you with the most appropriate treatment. It’s a quick and relatively painless procedure. We can do it right here at the clinic. And, to be sure, we want to rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to consider it?
PATIENT: …Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. Quick, you said? And… painless? You promise? I don’t like hospitals or… or bein' poked and prodded. But… if you really think it's necessary... Alright. Do it. Just… tell me when. And… how long will it take? I got things to do, ya know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Reyno, it will be quick – just a few moments – and relatively painless. The technician will position you between two plates, and it will only take a few seconds to capture the images. We should have the results within a few hours. I’ll have the technician come in shortly to explain the procedure. In the meantime, I’m going to write a prescription for a cough suppressant to help manage your symptoms while we wait for the results. It won’t cure the underlying issue, but it should provide some relief. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A cough suppressant sounds… okay. Better than nothin', I guess. So, wait for the technician, then… then you’ll tell me what’s wrong? Hopefully it's just somethin' simple. I really don’t like bein' sick. And I really don't like waitin'. Just… get it over with, doc. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Reyno. I will do my best to get you answers as quickly as possible. I will review the X-ray results as soon as they are available and discuss them with you thoroughly. Here is the prescription. The technician will be in shortly. In the meantime, try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as high fever, difficulty breathing, or chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before I have the technician come in?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… get it over with, right? Wait for the technician. High fever… okay. I’ll remember that. Thanks, doc. I guess. I just… want to feel better. That’s all. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Reyno. I’ll be right here when you’re ready to discuss the results. .
