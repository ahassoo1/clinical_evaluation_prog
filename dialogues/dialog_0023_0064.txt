DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay if I call you Doctor Versace? I have… a pain here, in my chest. It started a few days ago, maybe four? Not a bad pain, but… worrying.
DOCTOR: Yes, Doctor Versace is perfectly fine. Four days, you say. And can you describe this pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not sharp, not like when I fall. More… heavy? Like something sitting on my chest. And sometimes it feels… tight. Like a band around me. It comes and goes. Not all the time. Right here, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. A heavy, tight sensation, coming and going. And roughly where, specifically, are you pointing?
PATIENT: Right… around here. Not on the side, mostly in the middle. And it goes a little bit to my back, sometimes. Not a lot, but… I feel it there too. It's hard to explain. Is like… a squeezing?
DOCTOR: A squeezing sensation, radiating a bit to the back. I understand it can be difficult to articulate. Does anything specifically bring on this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I was doing the dishes yesterday and it was a little worse then, maybe? But mostly it just… happens. I was sitting and watching the television and it started. Or walking to the store. Not doing anything special. It doesn’t feel like… from anything I did. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense. No clear trigger, just seems to come and go with activity or rest. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give this pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Hmm… at worst? Not a very big number. Maybe a four? Five, sometimes. Never more than that. It's not… scary pain, just… uncomfortable. I don't like it. I worry because my husband, he had a bad pain in his chest before… but his was much worse. A ten, he said.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, particularly given your husband’s experience. We’ll certainly take this seriously. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this chest pain?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes I feel a little… short of breath when it happens. Not bad, I can still talk, still walk. But I need to take a few deep breaths. And… sometimes my arms feel a little tired. Not like after working in the garden, just… heavy. A little bit. And… I think I was a little bit sweaty yesterday when it was happening, but it was also very warm. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath, fatigue in your arms, and some sweating. It’s good you're noticing these details. Now, let’s go through some more general questions. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I eat everything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! Never had a problem with any medicine either. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but the doctor said that’s okay. I don't remember the name, though. My husband gets it for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you mentioned medication for blood pressure. Do you recall approximately how long you've been taking that medication?
PATIENT: Oh… maybe five years now? Something like that. A long time. The little white pill, I think. I just take it every morning, like the doctor said. My husband is very good about reminding me. He makes sure I don’t forget.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, besides blood pressure, do you have any other medical conditions – diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… the doctor said my cholesterol was a little high a few years ago. He wanted me to eat less… what is it called… fried food? And more vegetables. I try to eat better, but it’s hard! Other than that… no, I don’t think so. No arthritis, no diabetes. I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. High cholesterol in the past. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes. A long time ago, when I was younger. I had my gallbladder out. And… and I had a little thing on my knee, a small bump. They took it off. That was a long time ago too. More than twenty years ago, I think. Both in Colombia, before I came here.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a small bump removed from your knee, both performed in Colombia. Now, is there a family history of heart disease, stroke, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had a weak heart. He died when he was not very old. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had a stroke. But… that was a long time ago. And I don’t know much about it, really. We didn’t see them very often. It was a long time ago, and in Colombia, things were… different. We didn't talk about health much.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of heart weakness in your father and stroke in your aunt. Now, do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked. My mother would have killed me! And my husband, he doesn't like it either. Always told me it was very bad for your health. I drink a little wine sometimes, with dinner. But not much. Maybe a glass.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. Please, go ahead. I want to know what is happening. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chelberg. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your pulse is regular, but a bit fast at 88. I'm hearing some slight crackling in your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup. Your heart sounds… normal, but I’ll want to order an EKG just to be certain. I'm also going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… a little high? The blood pressure? And… crackling? In my lungs? That doesn't sound good. An EKG and a… X-ray? Is it serious, Doctor? Is something really wrong? I just want to know… what is happening. I don’t want to be scared.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're asking questions, Ms. Chelberg. It's important to be informed. The elevated blood pressure and crackling in your lungs warrant further investigation, but that doesn’t automatically mean something serious is wrong. The EKG and X-ray will help us determine the cause of these findings. It could be something relatively minor, like a mild infection, but we need to rule out anything more concerning, such as heart failure or pneumonia. Now, do you have any allergies to contrast dye, if we were to consider a CT scan later on?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh my… I don’t know about… contrast dye? I’ve never had one. No, I don’t think so. I don’t remember ever being allergic to anything. But I don’t know what… contrast dye is. Is it something they give you? Please, tell me what is happening, Doctor. I'm getting scared now.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and it's perfectly understandable you're feeling scared. Let’s take things one step at a time. Contrast dye is a liquid that sometimes used in imaging tests like a CT scan to help us see the images more clearly. It's injected into a vein. We aren’t planning a CT scan right now, but I always ask about allergies preemptively. For now, let's focus on the EKG and chest X-ray. The nurse will be in shortly to take you to the radiology department. After that, we’ll review the results and discuss a plan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild diuretic – a water pill – to help reduce any fluid buildup in your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A water pill? To help with the fluid? Okay… Yes, that sounds… good. If it can help. And the nurse will take me for the pictures? The EKG and the… X-ray? Will it hurt, Doctor? I don’t like needles very much. And how long will it take? I have to get home to my husband…
DOCTOR: The EKG is completely painless. They'll simply place some small stickers on your chest to record your heart's electrical activity. The X-ray involves a brief exposure to radiation, but the dose is very low. The technician will position you between the X-ray machine and a detector. It won't hurt, but you'll need to remain still for a few seconds. The whole process shouldn't take more than 30 minutes, Ms. Chelberg. And I'll have the nurse call your husband to let him know you'll be a little delayed. I want to reiterate that we’re taking these precautions to rule out anything serious. It’s better to be thorough. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all, Doctor. Just… thank you. For explaining everything. And for not… scaring me too much. I just want to feel better. And please… tell the nurse I’m a little afraid of needles. Maybe she can be gentle? I trust you, Doctor. I just… don’t like them.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Chelberg. We will certainly make sure the nurse is gentle. I will write a note on your chart specifically requesting that. My priority is to make you as comfortable as possible. The nurse will be in shortly. .
