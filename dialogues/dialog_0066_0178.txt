DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… gotta get this cough sorted, really. Been hangin' around too long. And I’m tired all the time, feelin’ stuffed up a lot too. It’s just wearin' me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, tiredness, and congestion. I understand. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. First, how long have you had this cough?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… a while. Probably… three, maybe four months now? Started off kinda mild, just a little tickle in my throat. Now it’s… well, it’s a productive cough, if that makes any sense. Lots of… stuff comin’ up. Sorry to be so blunt.
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s perfectly alright. It’s good to be specific. A productive cough for three to four months… okay. And is the “stuff” you’re bringing up any particular color?
PATIENT: Usually… yellowish. Sometimes it's clear, but mostly yellowish. And it's worse in the mornin', definitely. Gotta cough a good bit just to clear my chest enough to get goin’. It's not…fun.
DOCTOR: Alright, yellowish sputum, worse in the morning… that gives us a bit more to work with. Besides the cough and tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I get headaches sometimes, kinda dull ones, behind my eyes. And… yeah, my face feels kinda stuffed up a lot, pressure in my sinuses. Happens on and off, but more on than off lately. I thought it was just allergies, but…it's been a long season, you know? Longer than usual.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does sound like it could be more than just allergies. The headaches and sinus pressure are helpful to know. Have you had a fever at any point with this?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. I haven’t been takin’ my temperature or nothin’, but I don’t feel feverish. Just… run down, you know? Tired. No chills, no sweats, just… blah.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills or sweats. Let's talk about your past medical history, Mr. Pithan. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, like asthma, COPD, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been diagnosed with anythin', nothin' like that. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, up until now. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years. Doc always just told me to take it easy when I went in for checkups. Didn’t really need much.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. What about surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Not even to get my tonsils out when I was a kid. I was a lucky one, skipped all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mom… she had some breathing trouble when she got older, but I don't remember what it was exactly. Old age, mostly. Dad was healthy as a horse 'til the day he went. And my siblings…they’re all alright, as far as I know. Nobody else with a cough like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle a little. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought it was a silly habit. Air's clean enough out here, don't need to mess with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a beer now and then with supper, nothin' serious. Don't go out drinkin’ or nothin'. Maybe one or two on a Saturday, that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol use. Finally, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’ a doc gave me. I’ve always been pretty good with medicines. That's about it, I think. You want me to tell you where I live? Just in case?
DOCTOR: That’s great, no known allergies. And yes, knowing your general location is good—you said you're in a rural area, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, out past the Black Hills a bit. Small town, not much happens here. But the air’s good. Mostly. And quiet. It's... quiet. Just past the old rodeo grounds, you’ll know it. Everyone does.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your lungs, check your sinuses, and take your temperature. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine. Get it over with, please. I got things to do. Just...don't take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, deep breath in... and out. Okay, good. Okay, I’m hearing some wheezing in your lower lungs, and there’s a bit of congestion as well. Your sinuses are tender to the touch, especially around your forehead. And your temperature is 99.2 Fahrenheit—slightly elevated, but not a high fever. Based on what you've told me, and what I’m hearing, it sounds like you might have bronchitis, possibly with a sinus infection. The wheezing and congestion in your lungs point to bronchitis, and the sinus tenderness suggests an infection. It's not severe enough for an immediate emergency, but it does need treatment.
PATIENT: Bronchitis, huh? Figured somethin’ was goin’ on in my chest. So what does that mean? Do I need… shots? Pills? I just wanna get rid of this cough, you know? I got work to do. And… it's wearin’ me down.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not fun being sick, especially when you have things to do. Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from your lungs. It causes coughing, wheezing, and congestion. In your case, it seems to have been going on for a while, which is why we need to address it. It doesn’t necessarily require shots, thankfully. Usually, we treat it with a combination of things. I’m going to prescribe you an albuterol inhaler to help open up your airways and ease the wheezing. We’ll also use an antibiotic to clear up the potential sinus infection. I'll also recommend over-the-counter medications to manage your symptoms. A decongestant can help with the sinus pressure, and a cough suppressant can help you rest at night. Plenty of fluids and rest are important, too. It’s important to finish the full course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better before they're gone. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. Okay, inhaler and pills… got it. How long do I gotta take ‘em? And… what if it doesn't get better? I gotta get back to work, like I said. And I don’t wanna get any worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. The albuterol inhaler is as needed, whenever you feel wheezing or short of breath. As for the antibiotic, you’ll take that for ten days—even if you start feeling better sooner, complete the full course. It’s important to kill all the bacteria. If your symptoms don’t improve after five days of taking the antibiotics, or if they get worse at any point – if you develop a high fever, severe chest pain, or difficulty breathing – you need to call the clinic immediately. We may need to do further testing, like a chest X-ray, to rule out anything more serious. Here are the instructions for both medications, and a prescription to take to the pharmacy. I’m also going to give you a note for work explaining your condition, in case they require one. It's important to get rest and hydrate, and avoid strenuous activity for a few days. Do you have any questions about the medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Ten days… alright. And you got a note for work, good. That's a relief, actually. No, I think that covers it. Just… gettin’ rid of this cough is all I want. Thanks, Doctor. Hope this stuff works. I gotta get goin' now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pithan. I hope you feel better soon as well. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or if your symptoms don't improve. And remember to finish the full course of antibiotics. Get well soon. .
