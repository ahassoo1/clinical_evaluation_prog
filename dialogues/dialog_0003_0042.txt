DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I am Dr. Yackey. So, if you could just tell me in your own words what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, I reckon I'm here for a check-up, a good look-over. Truth is, I'm getting on in years, and my wife – bless her heart, she’s been gone a few years now – always kept me regular with these things. I figure it's time I get back in the habit. Mostly just want to make sure everything’s still workin’ like it should, you know? Men's health optimization, that’s what the lady on the phone called it.
DOCTOR: “Optimization.” Right. Well, that’s… a term. Let’s start with the basics then. Do you have any specific concerns that prompted you to schedule this now, or is this truly just a general wellness check, as you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ specific, no. I haven’t been feelin’ poorly or anything. Just… a little slower, maybe? Takes a bit longer to get goin’ in the mornin’, that sort of thing. And I forget where I put my keys more than I used to, but I always find 'em eventually. It’s just… a general feelin’ of gettin’ older, I suppose. Want to make sure it stays just that, you know? Not somethin’ worse creepin’ in. I’ve always been pretty lucky with my health, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Alright. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly?
PATIENT: Not lately, no. Like I said, my wife handled most of that for years. After she passed… well, it just kinda fell by the wayside, to be honest. I had a family doctor back in Tulsa, Dr. Abernathy, but that was… oh, twenty years ago, easy. Don’t even remember his specialty, just that he was a good man. I haven't needed much beyond that, thankfully. A broken arm when I was a boy, the usual flu shots, nothing serious. I do have private insurance, if that matters. Blue Cross, I think.
DOCTOR: Insurance is noted. Alright. Any surgeries, Mr. Kammann?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgery. Not a fan of knives, if you catch my drift. Always figured if somethin' ain't broke, don't fix it. And if it is broke... well, I try to live with it. Unless it's really botherin’ me, of course. But no, no surgeries. Never had a need for 'em, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a bit of a mixed bag, to be honest. My mother lived a long life, into her eighties, but she had some trouble with her heart near the end. My father… he didn’t live as long, passed when I was still a young man, somethin’ with his lungs, I think. Smoked a lot, he did. As for my grandparents... I didn't know 'em real well. My Cherokee side of the family… we didn't talk a lot about medical things, back then. It was more about… well, livin’ with what you got. I don't recall any major cancers or anything, if that helps. It’s not somethin’ we kept close tabs on, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I'm aware of. I can eat just about anything, and I haven’t ever had a reaction to any medicine. I’ve taken some antibiotics over the years for colds and such, but never had any trouble. I’ve always been pretty lucky, like I said. I might get a bit of a sniffle from pollen in the spring, but that’s just a regular allergy, nothin’ serious. Never carried an EpiPen or anything like that. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not a single one. I don't take nothin'. I’ve always believed in lettin’ nature run its course, as much as possible. Never been one for pills and potions, if you get my drift. I take a multivitamin every now and then, just to be on the safe side, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. Just the vitamins, now and then. I'm a pretty simple man, Doc. Don't need much to keep me goin'.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Kammann, while I appreciate your… natural approach, it’s still important to have a comprehensive understanding of your health. Now, before we proceed, I'm going to need to do a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. I figured as much. Didn't expect to just sit here and chat all day. Do whatever you need to do, Doc. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable or somethin'. I ain’t as spry as I used to be. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat on the examination table. We'll start with your vital signs. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take your temperature. Then, we’ll do a quick neurological assessment and a basic musculoskeletal exam. I’ll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Alrighty then. Sounds good to me, Doc. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m ready when you are. Hope you don’t find too many rattles in this old machine.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 86. Heart rate is 72, regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but diminished breath sounds basally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses palpated. Bowel sounds are normoactive. Do you experience any abdominal pain, bloating, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Nope. Not really. A little gas sometimes, like everyone else, but nothin’ to write home about. My bowel habits are pretty regular, if you ask me. Never had any trouble in that department. Maybe a little slower than when I was a young man, but that's just gettin' old, I reckon. No pain, no bloating, nothin' unusual. Just a good ol’ digestive system doin’ its job, I suppose. Mostly just try to eat sensible, you know? Not too much fried food, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Pulses are 2+ bilaterally in all extremities. No edema noted. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Romberg test is negative. You mentioned some difficulty with memory. Can you tell me today's date, and where we are currently located?
PATIENT: Well, let's see... today is August 2nd, 2025. And we're… …at the doctor’s office, of course. Dr. Yackey’s office, right here in… …the suburbs. That's what the lady on the phone said when I made the appointment. A nice, quiet place. Though I can't rightly recall the name of the town, if you don’t mind me sayin’. My memory ain't what it used to be. Still know who I am, though. That's what matters, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kammann, knowing who you are is certainly important. Ears are clear bilaterally. Throat is clear, no erythema or exudate noted. Overall, your physical examination is relatively unremarkable. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you report some subjective memory difficulties. I’d like to order some basic blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. We’ll also need a urinalysis to rule out any underlying infection. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Sounds reasonable, Doc. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and a urine sample, alrighty then. I trust your judgement. Just let me know where I need to go to get that done. And how long it'll take, I got a few things I need to tend to this afternoon. But if it'll help figure out what's goin' on with this memory of mine and get that blood pressure under control, then I'm all for it. I'm a patient man, Doc. Just tell me what needs to be done.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’ll need a urine sample, and they’ll draw a few vials of blood. It should take approximately 30-45 minutes. Once the results are back—typically within a few business days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home. You can purchase a home blood pressure cuff at most pharmacies. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Kammann?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doc. That all sounds pretty straightforward. Home blood pressure cuff, lab down the hall… got it. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me, and for not makin' me feel like an old fool for forgettin’ things. I reckon I'll head down to the lab then, and see what they find. Thank you again, Doctor Yackey.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will provide you with instructions for the lab. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or sudden neurological changes, please seek immediate medical attention. You're dismissed.
PATIENT: Alright. I will. Thank you again, Doc. .
DOCTOR: Good day. .
