DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac, as you know. I am here today because I am looking into moving into a senior living facility. They requested a check-up to make sure I am fit to reside there, you see. A formality, really. But a necessary one, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A check-up for facility placement… Right. Well, we want to be thorough. Even if it is just a formality, it's important to have a clear picture of your overall health. So, let's start with that. Now, you said you’re 81… have you been seeing another doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I’ve had Doctor Hemlock for… oh, goodness, nearly twenty years now. A very good man, though he recently retired. That’s partly why I am here, to establish care with someone new before I move. He’s a family doctor, mostly just keeps an eye on things. Blood pressure, cholesterol… the usual for a man my age, you understand.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, that’s good you’re being proactive about finding a new physician. We'll need to get those records transferred over, of course. But for now, let's just go through some things ourselves. Can you tell me about any major illnesses or surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me think… in my youth, I broke my arm falling from a tree – a rather silly incident, I assure you. And when I was about forty, I had my appendix removed. Nothing too serious, thankfully. Later in life, perhaps ten years ago, I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia. It kept me bedridden for a good month, but I recovered fully, praise the Lord. Aside from that… honestly, Doctor, I’ve been blessed with good health for most of my life. Just the usual aches and pains that come with age, you know?
DOCTOR: Broken arm, appendix, pneumonia… Alright. And any family history of serious illness?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother… she lived to be ninety-three, a strong woman. She had some trouble with arthritis in her later years, but otherwise, remarkably healthy. My father, sadly, passed away when he was quite young – a heart condition, I believe. And I have a sister, still living, thankfully, but she's had some difficulties with diabetes. It runs in the family, I suppose. I have always been careful about my diet, though. Trying to eat right is important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Diabetes in your sister, heart condition with your father… and arthritis in your mother. Good you're mindful of your diet. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Doctor?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Just one, actually. I take a small dose of Lisinopril, for my blood pressure. Doctor Hemlock prescribed it a few years back. Keeps things steady, you see. And I take a daily multivitamin, of course. Can’t hurt to get a little extra boost, especially at my age. Is that what you were needing to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Right. Lisinopril. And a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I have never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I've always been able to eat just about anything – though I do prefer a simple diet, myself. No fancy foods for me. But no allergies, no. Not to my knowledge, anyway. It's a blessing, truly. Having to worry about what one can and cannot eat… well, that would be a difficult life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. No known allergies. Now, let's just do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Just routine. If you could just sit up there for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No trouble at all. Please, do take your time. I am in no rush. I understand these things take a bit. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’ll cooperate fully, you see.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from talking. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A bit high, but not terribly concerning given your history. Ears look normal, throat's a little dry. Alright. Overall, everything seems… adequate. Have you been experiencing any pain, shortness of breath, or fatigue recently?
PATIENT: That's good to hear it is all... adequate. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. No, I haven't been experiencing any pain, thankfully. A little stiffness in the mornings, you know, the usual aches and pains. But no real pain, no. And no shortness of breath. I walk every day, if the weather allows, and haven't had any trouble with that. A bit of fatigue sometimes, certainly, but that's to be expected at my age, isn’t it? It comes and goes. Nothing to worry about, I believe.
DOCTOR: Right. Stiffness, fatigue... acceptable. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite has been fairly consistent. I don't eat a great deal, mind you – never have. I prefer smaller, simpler meals. And my weight… well, I haven’t weighed myself in some time, but I don’t believe it has changed much. Perhaps a pound or two, but nothing significant. I am a fairly steady weight, you see. Not prone to fluctuations. Perhaps that's a blessing as well. Keeps things predictable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like you're in reasonably good condition for your age. We’ll need to get those records from Doctor Hemlock to get a more complete picture, of course. But for now, I think we can proceed with a few basic blood tests to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. That will give us a good baseline. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly agreeable. Blood tests seem sensible. Anything to be thorough, you understand. And if you need any further information from me, please do not hesitate to ask. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. As long as it helps me get settled into a good place, you see. Where shall we begin with those tests?
DOCTOR: The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw some blood. She will explain the procedure. It’s just a routine blood draw, nothing to worry about. I'll review the results when they come back, and we can discuss them then. In the meantime, if you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask the nurse before you leave.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall wait for the phlebotomist. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience with an old man like myself. I will be sure to ask the nurse if I have any questions before I leave. Have a good day.
