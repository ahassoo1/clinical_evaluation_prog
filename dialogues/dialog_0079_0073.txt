DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're with us today for a consultation. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? I’ve got things to do. It’s my stomach. Been…well, it's been awful. Just constantly going to the bathroom. Everything I eat goes right through me. I’ve tried a bunch of stuff, and nothing’s working. It’s been going on for weeks, and frankly, it’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say. Very well. “Awful” is rather nonspecific, Ms. Woodring. Could you be more precise?
PATIENT: Precise? What do you want me to do, count every single trip? It's…a lot. Watery. And it’s not just once or twice a day, alright? It’s…constant. I’m losing weight, and I’m tired all the time. Honestly, I’m surprised I even bothered coming in here. I usually just deal with things myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. However, a proper medical assessment requires specifics. "A lot" doesn’t assist with diagnosis. Are we talking six times a day?
PATIENT: Six? Sometimes. Maybe more. Look, it’s not a scheduled thing, okay? It just…happens. I don’t carry a diary of my bathroom trips. And honestly, it’s not like you’re the first doctor I’ve seen about this. They all ask the same questions, and nothing ever changes. It's just…diarrhea. Severe diarrhea. Is that specific enough for you?
DOCTOR: Severe diarrhea for weeks. And you’ve consulted other physicians about this previously?
PATIENT: Yes. A couple. They gave me…I don’t know…something for it. Pills. Didn’t work. Said it was probably just a bug. Told me to drink more water. Like I hadn’t thought of that. Honestly, they didn’t seem to take me seriously. I’m a grown woman. I know my own body. It’s not just a bug. It feels…different. Worse.
DOCTOR: I see here there are records of two previous visits – one with Dr. Miller six months ago, and Dr. Chen a year prior. Both listed “acute gastroenteritis” and prescribed loperamide. And you say this feels…different. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Ugh, loperamide. That stuff did nothing. And “acute gastroenteritis”? They just glanced at me for five minutes and slapped a label on it. This isn't just a quick stomach bug! It’s…it’s cramping, really bad cramping. And it’s not just right after I eat, it happens even when I haven't. And I’m just…weak. I haven’t had the energy to paint in days, and that's…that’s not right. That’s never happened before.
DOCTOR: Cramping, persistent even when fasting, and fatigue impacting your usual activities... painting, you mentioned. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No, not really vomiting. Sometimes I feel a little queasy, like I might, but it doesn’t usually happen. Mostly just the…the urgency. And the cramping. It’s just…it’s exhausting. I’m constantly worried about where the nearest bathroom is. It’s humiliating, frankly. I’m not some delicate flower. I can handle things, but this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No. No blood. Look, if there was blood, wouldn't I have said something? I’m not stupid. Just…constant, watery diarrhea. And cramping. And exhaustion. Is there anything else you need to know? Because honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Woodring, I am attempting to gather sufficient information to arrive at a sensible assessment. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing chronic. I've always been healthy. A little stressed, maybe, since my husband passed, but that's it. Never had any major illnesses, no surgeries, nothing. Just…this. And it’s not “just this,” is it? It’s ruining my life. Can we please just figure out what’s wrong and fix it? I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any family history of gastrointestinal issues – Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, or any cancers affecting the digestive system?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history… my mother had… something. Stomach problems. I don’t remember exactly what. She didn't talk much about it. She passed away years ago. My father… he was healthy as a horse. Never sick a day in his life. Honestly, I don’t see what this has to do with anything. I have diarrhea, not a family reunion.
DOCTOR: I see. And regarding your social history – do you smoke, consume alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Seriously? Are you implying I’m the problem? I run a painting business, I don’t sit around… Look, no. No smoking, minimal alcohol – a glass of wine with dinner maybe once a week. And absolutely no drugs. I'm a professional. This is ridiculous. Are we getting anywhere, or are you just going through a checklist?
DOCTOR: I am attempting to establish a comprehensive understanding of your overall health profile, Ms. Woodring. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. Look, I eat everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Can we just… skip the twenty questions and do some tests? A blood test, a stool sample, something? I’m starting to feel lightheaded, and frankly, I’m not enjoying this. I need to get back to work. And this constant questioning isn’t helping.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with some investigations. I'm going to conduct a brief physical examination first. Please lie down on the examination table. I will listen to your abdomen and palpate it gently. This will help me assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. Afterwards, we will order a comprehensive blood panel, a stool sample for analysis, and possibly a C-reactive protein test to assess for inflammation. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Finally. Just…please be quick about it. And try not to poke too much. I don't like being touched. And no, I don’t have any questions. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on your back, knees bent. I will begin by auscultating your abdomen. Normal bowel sounds, though somewhat hyperactive. Tenderness in the lower quadrants, particularly on the left. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Abdomen soft, but with some discomfort upon palpation. Lower quadrant tenderness noted.
PATIENT: Ugh. That's…uncomfortable. It feels…sore. I told you it hurt. Is that it? Can I sit up now? I really need to use the restroom again, if you don't mind. This whole thing is just making it worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, you may sit up. I understand this is unpleasant. The physical examination confirms some degree of abdominal discomfort, as you’ve described. I will write the orders for the blood work and stool sample now. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the samples. In the meantime, I'm also considering a possible referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation, depending on the results of these tests. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: A specialist? Seriously? This is getting ridiculous. Look, I just want this fixed. I don’t need to see a parade of doctors. I just want to know what’s wrong and what to do about it. But…fine. If you think it’s necessary. But I’m not spending weeks waiting for appointments and getting poked and prodded. I have a business to run. Just…make it fast. And don’t expect me to be thrilled about it. Honestly, this whole experience is…degrading.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. We will expedite the referral process as much as possible. I'm ordering the tests now, and the nurse will be in shortly. While we await the results, I recommend maintaining a bland diet, staying well-hydrated, and avoiding any potential irritants. We will discuss the results and further options once they are available. Do you have any further questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No. Just… get the nurse. And hurry. I really need to go. This has been a complete waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I will inform the nurse to attend to you promptly. .
