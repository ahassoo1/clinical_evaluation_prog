DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It's nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Rakosky, is it? Hmm. Well, it’s about a letter. A letter for… a pet, I think. Something about owning one. Honestly, I can’t quite recall all the details. My ex-husband, he was always the organized one. He handled all these things. I just need a piece of paper saying it's alright, I suppose. Is that what you do here?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wrye, I understand. It sounds like you may have received a notice regarding pet ownership, and you're seeking documentation to confirm it's in order. We do handle medical documentation, and sometimes that involves verifying compliance with local ordinances regarding animal care – particularly rabies vaccinations and licensing. Just to be clear, is this letter from the local animal control, a boarding facility, or perhaps another organization?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those words... licensing, ordinances… It’s all a blur, really. Let me think… I think it came with some paperwork from… the apartment building? Yes! The new building I moved into. They said something about needing proof before they let me keep… well, it's a small dog. A fluffy one. Not a big dog, thankfully. I hate big dogs. It was in a welcome packet, I believe. Honestly, I just skimmed it. My ex-husband always said I don't pay attention to details. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like the apartment building is requesting documentation related to your pet – likely vaccination records and potentially a license. It’s not uncommon for rental properties to have these requirements. To confirm, do you have any existing records of your dog’s vaccinations – perhaps from a previous veterinarian?
PATIENT: A veterinarian… hmm. Now that is a name I haven't heard in a while. I used to take him – the dog, I mean – to someone… back in the city. But honestly, everything is a mess since the divorce. I moved so quickly, I just grabbed what I could. I don’t think I have anything like that anymore. I vaguely remember a blue folder, but… who knows where that ended up. Probably with him. Is this a problem? I really don't want to have to deal with this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wrye. It's alright. We can certainly work through this. Let me check our records to see if we have anything on file for you, or perhaps a previous veterinarian was listed. Hmm… It appears you registered with the clinic three months ago, but there's no record of any pet information associated with your account. Do you recall providing any information about your dog during that registration?
PATIENT: Three months ago? Oh, yes. I came in for… a check-up. Or maybe it was a flu shot? Everything runs together, you know? I just filled out a lot of forms and they poked me with a needle. I definitely didn't mention the dog then. Honestly, I was probably just trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. This whole medical thing… it makes me anxious. So, no, I didn’t say anything about him. Is this going to be… difficult?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Wrye, it doesn’t have to be difficult. It simply means we'll need to verify your dog’s current vaccination status. To do that, we may need to perform a physical examination and potentially run a rabies titer test, just to be certain. This is primarily to ensure your dog – and the community – is protected. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit more about your dog?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests? Physicals? This is more than I bargained for. Well, he’s… small. Like I said, fluffy. A little white dog. A Bichon Frise, I think? Or maybe a Poodle mix? Honestly, I’m terrible with breeds. He doesn't bite, if that’s what you're wondering. He's a bit yappy, though. He gets excited easily. And he sheds. A lot. He's a good dog, really. Just… high maintenance. Is that helpful? Are you sure you need to poke him with needles? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Wrye. A Bichon Frise or Poodle mix is a good start. And it's good to know he's generally friendly, despite the yappiness. Regarding the needles, the rabies titer test isn’t always necessary, but it provides us with definitive proof of immunity, which is what the apartment building is likely requesting. If we can verify his recent vaccination history with a previous veterinarian, we might be able to avoid it. To start, let’s take a quick look at him. We’ll just check his overall health, look at his teeth and gums, and listen to his heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. As long as it’s quick. I really don't like doctors. And he’s a bit skittish around strangers. He’ll probably hide under the chair. Or try to bite your ankles. Just kidding… mostly. He’s in the carrier over there. Be gentle, please. He’s a delicate little thing. Honestly, I don't know what I even do with him sometimes. He's a lot of responsibility.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. We’ll be very gentle. I'm used to nervous dogs. We'll take things slow and just get a quick look. Okay, let's see… He's a lovely little dog, and his heart and lungs sound good. His gums are a little pale, which could indicate mild anemia, but it’s not immediately concerning. His teeth could use a cleaning, but that’s common. I don’t feel any unusual lumps or masses. His weight appears to be appropriate for his size, approximately 15 pounds. Overall, he seems to be in relatively good health. Do you know when he last received a rabies vaccination?
PATIENT: Oh, fifteen pounds? That sounds right, maybe even a little heavy. He loves treats. Too much, probably. Rabies vaccination… hmm. Now that’s a good question. I honestly have no idea. It was… before I moved? Back in the city? With him? I think he took care of all that. I vaguely remember a certificate, but… where it is now? That’s a mystery. I’m terrible with dates, you know. And paperwork. Everything just blends together. This is hopeless, isn't it? I knew this was going to be a disaster.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Wrye. It's not uncommon to lose track of records during a move. We'll do our best to figure it out. Since we don’t have a verifiable vaccination history, I recommend we proceed with a rabies titer test. It’s a simple blood test that will determine if he has sufficient antibodies to protect him from the virus. It’s the safest way to ensure he’s protected and to satisfy the apartment building’s requirements. Would you like to proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh, a blood draw? Great. Just what I needed. Another needle. And for a tiny little dog! Honestly, I feel terrible even thinking about it. Is it going to be painful for him? He's such a sensitive little thing. Will he cry? I hate seeing animals in pain. Is there… is there any other way? Can't you just… write a note saying he looks healthy? Or maybe I can call him and ask? He must have the records somewhere… even if he is impossible. Honestly, this is all just too much. I just wanted a letter, not a whole veterinary examination!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wrye. It's perfectly natural to worry about your dog’s comfort. The blood draw is very quick, and we use a small needle designed to minimize discomfort. Most dogs barely react at all. We'll also make sure to distract him with treats and gentle praise. Unfortunately, a note stating he looks healthy won’t be sufficient for the apartment building, as they require verifiable proof of rabies vaccination. While contacting your ex-husband is an option, it may not be a reliable or timely solution. However, before we proceed with the blood draw, let’s try one more thing. Do you happen to have any old veterinary records, even if they’re not recent?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. There was a box of old papers in the car… I was meaning to sort through it. Mostly bills and junk mail, I think. But maybe, just maybe… Oh, wait! Here. This came from the old vet’s office. A little plastic key chain. It has the name of the clinic on it… “City Animal Hospital.” And… Oh my goodness. It’s a vaccination card! It’s faded, but… yes! Rabies vaccination… dated June 15, 2024. It’s a little over a year old. Is that good enough? Oh, please tell me that’s good enough!
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, this is excellent! Yes, this vaccination card is perfectly acceptable. A rabies vaccination within the last year is all the apartment building requires. It appears we were able to resolve this without the need for any additional testing. I'll write a letter confirming your dog’s rabies vaccination status and provide a copy to you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness! You have no idea the stress this has caused me. A letter is all I needed! No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Just the letter, please. And thank you. Truly. You were very patient with me. And you didn't even make him get poked with a needle! .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wrye. I’m glad we could resolve this quickly and without any unnecessary discomfort for your dog. I'll have the letter ready for you in a few minutes. Please feel free to schedule an appointment anytime if you have any other concerns regarding your dog’s health. Have a wonderful day! .
