DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on… a while now, I think. Honestly, dates… they slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, “always tired.” That’s a good starting point. It’s very common, and we’ll figure out what’s going on. You mentioned it’s been going on for a while. Can you tell me a little more about how tired you are?
PATIENT: How tired… hmm. It’s not like… a normal tired after a long day, you know? It’s… deep. Like I haven’t slept in weeks, even when I have. I just… don’t have the energy for much. Even simple things… getting dressed, making food… it feels like too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly draining. It’s good you’re able to describe it like that – “deep tiredness” even with sleep. Okay. And has this tiredness been gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Yes, gradual. It wasn’t one day I woke up feeling this way. It just… slowly got worse. At first, I thought it was just getting older, you know? But it hasn't stopped.
DOCTOR: That’s a reasonable thought, Janie. It is easy to attribute things to age. Okay, so gradual onset. Now, besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms that seem to go along with it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Oh! My muscles ache sometimes. Not all the time, but… yeah, aches. And… I get headaches. Dull ones, mostly. Not terrible, but annoying. I… I don't know if those are connected. Honestly, I’m just a mess of things these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches and dull headaches alongside the tiredness. That does give us a few things to consider. Are the muscle aches all over, or in specific areas?
PATIENT: All over, I think. Mostly my back and shoulders… and my legs feel heavy sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain, just… a constant ache. Like I’ve been doing too much, even when I haven’t.
DOCTOR: I understand. A constant ache, even with rest. Now, let's talk a little bit about other things going on in your life. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it’s not great. I don’t really feel hungry much. I eat… because I know I should. But not a lot. And… I think I’ve lost a little weight? I haven’t weighed myself in a while, but my clothes feel… looser.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some weight loss. That’s good information. Now, have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I know of. I haven’t taken my temperature. Chills… sometimes I feel a little cold, but it’s usually just the air conditioning. And night sweats… no, I don't think so. I sleep… okay, usually. It's just… hard to keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or night sweats. It's perfectly alright that it's hard to keep track of things, Janie, that's why we're here. Let’s shift gears a little. Are you having any trouble sleeping – difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested even after a full night's sleep?
PATIENT: Well, I do wake up a lot during the night. Not every night, but… often. I don’t always know why. Sometimes I just… jolt awake. And then I have trouble getting back to sleep. And like I said, even when I do sleep, I don’t feel rested. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent awakenings during the night and not feeling rested despite sleep. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes in your mood recently – feeling sad, anxious, or irritable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely more irritable. Everything just… gets on my nerves. And… I don’t really enjoy things like I used to. I just… feel blah, mostly. Not really sad, just… empty. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, irritability and a loss of enjoyment. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… I have high blood pressure, I think. The doctor put me on medicine for it. Other than that… not that I remember. It’s been a long time, and I don’t always remember appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and high blood pressure. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don’t. I just… take a little white pill every day. The doctor sends it to the pharmacy automatically. I don't really pay attention to the name, I just take it. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Janie. We can look that up in your records. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken lots of different medicines over the years. Oh! Except… I get a little itchy sometimes when I take penicillin. Not a bad itch, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild itch with penicillin. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or close relatives – who have any medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother had… something with her heart, I think. She was sick for a long time before she passed. And my brother… he has diabetes. Yes, that’s right. Other than that… not that I remember. It's hard to recall so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mother with heart problems and a brother with diabetes. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, and I certainly don’t do drugs. Never have, never will. I’m a very simple woman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, and this is important, what is a typical day like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, a typical day… Well, I wake up, slowly. It takes me a while to get going. I have a little breakfast, usually just toast and coffee. Then I try to do a little housework, but I get tired easily. I watch some TV in the afternoon, mostly. I used to go out more, but… I just don't have the energy anymore. I make dinner, and then I go to bed. It’s very… quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet day with limited activity. That gives me a good picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam. It won’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s wrong with me. Let’s get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is a bit elevated at 148/92. Your reflexes are normal, and your balance seems good. I’m also going to palpate your thyroid. Your thyroid feels normal, no enlargement or nodules. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable, but the elevated blood pressure and slightly fast heart rate are worth noting.
PATIENT: Okay. So… what does that mean? Is something seriously wrong? Is it my heart?
DOCTOR: Okay, Janie, let's not jump to conclusions. The exam didn't reveal anything immediately alarming, but the elevated blood pressure and fast heart rate, combined with your symptoms of fatigue, muscle aches, headaches, and decreased appetite, suggest a few possibilities. It could be related to your high blood pressure not being well-controlled, but we need to do some further testing to be sure. I'm going to order some blood work to check your complete blood count, thyroid function, electrolytes, kidney function, and vitamin levels – particularly vitamin D and B12. I’m also going to order an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. These tests will help us narrow down the cause of your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. When will I get the results? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The blood draw itself will be a small pinch, nothing major. It shouldn’t hurt much at all. The lab usually gets the results back within 2-3 business days, so I expect to have them by early next week. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible, and stay well-hydrated. Are you able to walk comfortably?
PATIENT: Yes, I can walk. A little slow, maybe. It's just... tiring, everything. So, just wait for the phone call? Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Okay, just wait for the phone call. And yes, there are a few things. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend trying to maintain a regular sleep schedule – going to bed and waking up around the same time each day, even on weekends. Also, gentle exercise – like walking for 15-20 minutes a day – can help with fatigue. Focus on a balanced diet, if you can, even small improvements are helpful. If your fatigue gets significantly worse or you develop any new symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness – please don't hesitate to call the office immediately. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Sleep schedule, walking, try to eat better. I can try. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you listening to me. I’ve been feeling so lost and confused lately.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janie. It’s my job to listen, and I’m glad you came in. It’s completely understandable to feel lost and confused when you’re not feeling well. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we'll figure out a plan to get you feeling better. The nurse will give you instructions on how to schedule the blood work before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little better just knowing someone is trying to help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janie. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the blood work instructions with you. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
