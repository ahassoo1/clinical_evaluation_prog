DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I am Dr. Yackey. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you. Well, my grandson… he’s applying for something… a visa, I believe. And they need proof of certain shots. He's coming from overseas, and I’m helping him with all the paperwork. I just want to make sure he has everything the government requires, you understand? It’s a bit confusing, all these rules.
DOCTOR: A visa, yes. Right. So, you're not experiencing any medical issues yourself, you simply require documentation of vaccinations for your grandson’s application?
PATIENT: That's right, Doctor. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you. It’s all for him. He's a good boy, trying to build a life here. I just want to be sure we don't miss anything with the shots… and all the forms. I don't want any delays for him, you see. Is this something you can help with?
DOCTOR: We can review records, yes. Do you have any prior medical documentation for him?
PATIENT: Well now… that’s a good question. He brought some papers with him from his country, but they're in… well, not English. And honestly, I haven't looked at them too closely. He said something about his doctor there, but I don’t have a name or anything. He’s still unpacking, bless his heart. Would copies of those papers be enough, or do you need something official translated? I didn’t want to bother with that until I knew if it was even necessary.
DOCTOR: Unofficial records are… problematic. We really need verifiable proof. Do you happen to know where exactly he received these vaccinations?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s…difficult. He came from a small village, far from the capital city. He mentioned a clinic, but it wasn't a big one. He said the doctor was… well, just the village doctor, if you know what I mean. I don’t think they have much in the way of official records, Doctor. This is all new to me, you understand. I've never dealt with anything like this before. Would a letter from his doctor, even if it’s not in English, be of any help? I could try to get him to contact them. It might take some time, though.
DOCTOR: A letter, unverified, from an unknown physician… unfortunately, that likely won't suffice for visa purposes. These requirements are quite strict, Mr. Skarbek. Is he current on standard vaccinations—tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound promising. Well… he said he had all his shots as a child. It’s just… it was a long time ago, and I don’t recall specifically which ones. He’s a grown man now, you see. He wouldn't have discussed it with me then. I suppose… perhaps he needs to get them again, just to be safe? Would that be the easiest thing to do? I just want to get this right for him. He's worked so hard.
DOCTOR: Retesting and revaccination may be necessary. Given the uncertainty and lack of documentation, it's the most practical course of action. We can draw titers to see if he has immunity to certain diseases, but that will require multiple blood draws and may not be accepted by the visa officials. Would you like me to proceed with a basic panel of blood tests, or would you prefer we simply begin the vaccination series now?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Blood draws? That sounds… unpleasant. And if they won’t even accept the results… well. I suppose the shots are the better option then. If that’s what you recommend, Doctor, let’s go ahead and start the vaccination series. What does that involve, exactly? And… will it be expensive? I have private insurance, but I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Standard series includes tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis – a Tdap booster – measles, mumps, rubella – MMR – and varicella. We’ll assess his record for influenza and COVID as well. Your insurance should cover the majority of it, but there may be a copay, and the cost of the varicella vaccine can vary. I'll have the nurse review your coverage details precisely. Let’s start with a physical assessment to ensure there are no contraindications. Please have a seat, and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. That sounds sensible. A physical assessment is a good idea. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And please, don't hesitate to let me know if there’s anything I need to do or any forms I need to fill out. I just want to make sure everything is done correctly for my grandson. Lead the way, if you would.
DOCTOR: If you'll please lie back. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. Reflexes are within normal limits. No obvious physical contraindications to vaccination. Next, we'll need to document your allergy status. Any known allergies to medications or vaccines?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of. Never have. I eat everything put in front of me, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. My wife… bless her heart, she used to worry about that, but I always told her I was as sturdy as an oak tree. Not much bothers me, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies documented. Now, before we proceed with the vaccinations, I must inform you of potential side effects. Mild fever, soreness at the injection site, fatigue... these are common and typically resolve within 24-48 hours. Rare but serious reactions are possible—allergic reaction, nerve damage... but these are extremely uncommon. Do you understand and consent to receiving these vaccinations?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Side effects… well, everything has risks, doesn’t it? A little soreness… I can handle that. And you say serious reactions are very rare. I trust your judgment. Yes, I consent. Let's get this done. My grandson is counting on me, and I want to get him settled. Where shall we begin?
DOCTOR: We'll start with the Tdap booster. It may sting for a moment. There. That’s the first one. We’ll need to wait 30 minutes to observe for any immediate adverse reactions. The nurse will be in to check on you shortly.
PATIENT: Ooh. That did sting a bit. But… it's done. And if it helps my grandson… it was worth it. I suppose waiting 30 minutes is a good idea. Is there anything I should be looking out for specifically? Just so I know… you said something about reactions?
DOCTOR: Any signs of severe allergic reaction—difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, hives—seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, mild discomfort is expected. The nurse has been notified to monitor you. I have other patients waiting, so I'll have her return shortly to assess your condition and administer the remaining vaccinations.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. Difficulty breathing… swelling… I’ll keep an eye out. Thank you. I suppose I’ll just sit here quietly then and wait for the nurse. I appreciate you fitting me in today. For my grandson. It’s always for my grandson.
