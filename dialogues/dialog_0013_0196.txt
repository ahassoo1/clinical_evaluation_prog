DOCTOR: Hi Janie, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It's… well, it’s this tiredness. Just always feeling worn out, you know? It’s been going on… a while now, I guess. Hard to say exactly how long. Everything feels… blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "Blurry" is a good way to put it, and constant tiredness is definitely something we want to look into. When you say "a while," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… months, definitely. Maybe… six? Or more? It’s hard… my husband, he… he usually kept track of things. It’s all a bit mixed up since then. Sorry, I’m not very helpful. Everything just feels… slow.
DOCTOR: No, you're perfectly helpful, Janie. It's completely understandable that things are mixed up, especially with everything you've been going through. Six months or more of tiredness… Okay. And would you describe this tiredness as being present all day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… pretty much all the time. Some days are worse than others, of course. But even when I do rest, it doesn't really… help much, you know? I wake up tired, and I stay tired. It's just… there. It makes it hard to… do things. Especially at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s persistent, and rest doesn't seem to significantly improve it. And you mentioned it's affecting your work – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I’m a pharmacy tech. It’s… detail work. Counting pills, making sure people get the right medications. When you’re tired, it's… hard to focus. I worry I’ll make a mistake. And the standing… oh, the standing all day. It just… wipes me out. My boss has been understanding, but… I don’t want to be a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, detail work requiring concentration and a lot of standing… that definitely paints a clearer picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel… achy. Like my muscles are always sore. And… I’ve been forgetting things a lot more lately. Not important things, usually. Like… where I put my glasses. Or what I went to the store for. But it’s… frustrating. It feels like my brain is slow, too. Like trying to think through mud.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches and increasing forgetfulness… and that sensation of “thinking through mud”. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I eat… about the same, I guess. Maybe a little less, now that I don’t have much energy to cook. And my weight… I don’t really check. I’m… always skinny, anyway. Always have been. It's never been a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant changes in appetite or weight. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, the doctor told me I had high blood pressure, a few years ago. I was taking pills for it, but… I stopped. I didn’t like how they made me feel. And… I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. Other than that… not really. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure – and you stopped taking medication for it. And a gallbladder removal previously. Do you remember when you were diagnosed with the high blood pressure, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. It was… before my husband got sick, definitely. Maybe… five years ago? Six? It was… a while back. He helped me keep track of appointments and things then. I’m sorry, I really wish I could be more precise. It's just… everything feels so distant.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Janie, you’re doing just fine. Knowing it was before your husband’s illness is helpful. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies. Though… now that I think about it, sometimes my skin gets itchy. But I just put lotion on it. It's probably the dry air. We had a really hot summer last year. It's probably just that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you manage the occasional itchy skin with lotion. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my arthritis sometimes. It's an over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think? Just when my hands really bother me. And… that lotion, of course. But that's it. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen for arthritis and lotion. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had heart trouble, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my father… he was healthy as a horse, really. Never sick a day in his life. My husband’s side… his mother had diabetes, maybe? I don't really know. I wasn't very close to his family.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble on your mother’s side and possible diabetes on your husband’s side. Let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! I don’t smoke. My husband… he used to smoke a little, but he quit years ago. And I don’t drink, not even a glass of wine. Too hard on the system, you know? And… definitely no drugs. Never been interested.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Now, before I do a quick physical exam, I just want to ask one more question. Are you experiencing any emotional distress or feeling overwhelmed at the moment, given everything you’ve been through?
PATIENT: Well… it’s lonely. Very lonely. I miss him terribly, of course. And… I worry about things. About the house, about work, about… everything. I try to stay busy, but… it’s hard. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, Janie, that answers it perfectly. It's completely understandable that you’re feeling that way. Alright, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a brief physical exam just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your hands and feet. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to feel better. I just want to have some energy again.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly reasonable, Janie. We'll do our best to figure things out. Please have a seat, and I'll get started. Deep breaths in and out… Okay. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I hear some slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases of your lungs. Nothing alarming, but we'll keep that in mind. Blood pressure is 142/90. A bit on the higher side, considering you were previously diagnosed with hypertension. Your joints in your hands feel a bit tender and swollen. Consistent with arthritis. Skin appears normal, no signs of rash or discoloration. Okay, Janie, everything seems to be within normal limits, but some findings warrant further investigation. Your elevated blood pressure, slightly diminished breath sounds and hand swelling, coupled with your fatigue and forgetfulness, lead me to suspect a few possibilities. It could be related to your previous hypertension, worsening arthritis, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work. It will check your thyroid function, complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and vitamin levels, including Vitamin D and B12. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… blood work. I don’t like needles. But… if it will help, then yes. Yes, please. I just… I want to know what’s wrong. I’m tired of feeling like this.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Janie. Needles aren't pleasant for anyone. But it's a relatively quick procedure, and the information we get from the blood work will be very helpful. We'll take it one step at a time. Okay, I’m just ordering the lab work now. It should be ready within a couple of days. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to manage your arthritis with over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. I also want you to try to get some gentle exercise, even just a short walk each day, if you’re able. And make sure you’re staying hydrated and eating a balanced diet. Given your elevated blood pressure, I'd also like to discuss options for managing that. We can revisit medication if you’re comfortable, or we can explore lifestyle modifications first, such as reducing salt intake and stress management techniques. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh… medication… I don’t know. I didn’t like feeling… sluggish when I took the pills before. Maybe… maybe the lifestyle changes first? I suppose I could try to cut back on the salt. And… I do worry a lot. I just don’t know where to start.
DOCTOR: Okay, lifestyle changes first sounds like a good plan. It's often a great place to start, and we can always revisit medication if needed. I'm printing out a handout on dietary changes for hypertension, including tips for reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium-rich foods. I'll also include some resources for stress management techniques, such as deep breathing exercises and mindfulness practices. There are also some free stress management workshops offered at the community center. I can give you the contact information if you’re interested. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or vision changes, please seek immediate medical attention. Don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room if you’re concerned. We’ll review the lab results as soon as they’re available, and we’ll come up with a plan together. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very… kind. I just hope we can figure out what's wrong. It’s just… draining, you know? Always being tired.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janie. And I understand completely. It is draining, and we will do our best to figure things out. I'm confident we can get you feeling better. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I'll be here, and we’ll take it one step at a time. Have a good day, and try to get some rest. Alright, if there’s nothing further, I need to see my next patient.
