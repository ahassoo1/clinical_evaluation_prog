DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Kingan, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. Just...the tryouts. For the team. They need a physical, you know? Gotta make sure I'm still good to go. Don't want to collapse on the field, haha.
DOCTOR: Right, a sports physical! Good idea to get checked out before tryouts – safety first. I see here you’re 62 years old. That's fantastic you're still active. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a little bit about the team you're trying out for?
PATIENT: Sixty-two years young! It keeps me going, that's for sure. Uh, it's a...a Mongolian wrestling team. Not a professional thing, more of a local group. We compete in a few tournaments, mostly for fun. A lot of older guys, honestly, but still pretty competitive.
DOCTOR: Mongolian wrestling, wonderful! That sounds…intense. Okay, so we're doing a physical to make sure you're cleared for participation in a competitive wrestling environment. Have you been training regularly for this?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty regularly. Three times a week, usually. Mostly practicing holds, some cardio, you know, the usual. Nothing too crazy, but enough to keep in shape. I’ve been doing this…well, most of my life. Still feels good, mostly. Just want to make sure everything's still working okay, haha.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear! Experience definitely counts for something. Just to get a baseline, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or a persistent cough recently?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing like that. A little winded sometimes during practice, but that's normal, right? Just getting old, I guess. No pain or anything. Been feeling pretty good, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. “A little winded” is worth noting, we’ll definitely talk about that later. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 78. A little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on it. Have you been monitoring your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Never really bothered with that sort of thing, to be honest. Is that…bad? I just figured if I felt okay, I was okay.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad”, but it’s good to know your baseline. 140/90 is a little higher than we'd like, and keeping track of it at home can help us see if it fluctuates. We can talk about options for that later if needed. Now, let's move on. Any joint pain or stiffness?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit in my knees, mostly. Old wrestling injuries, I guess. Nothing that stops me, but they ache sometimes, especially after practice. And my shoulders aren’t what they used to be, either. You know, the usual getting older stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and shoulders, expected with your history. Can you bend them both fully for me?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. Like this? It’s a little creaky, sorry. There's a bit of a pop sometimes, but it doesn't hurt hurt. It’s just…old.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There’s some crepitus – that’s the popping sound – and a slight limitation in range of motion, but no obvious swelling or redness. Any pain with pressure here?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. A little sensitive, maybe, but not pain, pain. Like I said, just old. Wrestled a lot of years, took a beating. I just…hope they don’t fall apart completely. Haha.
DOCTOR: We’ll do our best to keep them in good working order. Now, let’s check your shoulders. Can you raise both arms above your head?
PATIENT: Uh…like this? It’s a little tight. Gets sore pretty quick if I push it too much. I can get them all the way up, but it's not comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion and some discomfort with elevation. Any specific areas of pain with pressure?
PATIENT: Right...around here, on the front of the shoulder. It's just a dull ache, nothing sharp. And…maybe a little bit on the back too. It’s been like this for years, honestly. I'm used to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on both the anterior and posterior aspects of the shoulder. Alright, Mr. Kingan, I’m going to listen to your abdomen and check your reflexes. Then we'll talk about what we've found and what your options are. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, sounds good. Just...try not to find anything too terrible, haha. I still wanna wrestle.
DOCTOR: I’ll do my best. Everything sounds normal here, no unusual bowel sounds. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Overall, everything seems stable, but we do have a few things to discuss.
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, I figured they weren't what they used to be, haha. So...what does it all mean? Am I too old for this?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kingan. You're in pretty good shape for 62, honestly. But, we did find a few things that need attention. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, your knees have some crepitus and limited range of motion from previous injuries, and your shoulders are tight with some discomfort. Your reflexes are also a little diminished, which is normal for your age, but worth noting. Being “too old” is less about a number and more about how your body is responding to the stress of activity. You’ve clearly been doing this a long time and know your limits, which is good. However, pushing through pain or ignoring these issues could lead to injury. Before you start tryouts, I recommend a few things. First, we should monitor your blood pressure at home for a week to get a better idea of your baseline. Second, I’d like you to start a gentle stretching and strengthening program for your knees and shoulders. I can provide you with some exercises, or you could consult with a physical therapist. Finally, listen to your body! Don’t push yourself too hard, and stop if you feel any sharp pain. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds...reasonable. I can probably handle some stretches. Blood pressure monitor, okay. Listen to my body…I’ve been doing that for years, I guess. Physical therapist...that sounds expensive. Is this gonna keep me from wrestling? That's the important thing.
DOCTOR: No, I don't think it has to keep you from wrestling. It's about being smart about it. Addressing these issues proactively will help prevent injury and keep you doing what you love longer. The physical therapist is an option, and it can be very helpful, but it's not mandatory. We can start with the stretches and see how you respond. If you're not seeing improvement, then we can revisit the PT option. I’m going to write down some instructions for the stretches, and a log to track your blood pressure. I also want you to promise me you'll stop if you feel any sharp pain. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Sharp pain…got it. I promise. I’m not looking to break anything. Just wanna see if I still got it, you know? Thanks, Doctor. You've been...helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kingan. And I understand. It's good to have goals. Please follow up with me in a week or two to let me know how you're doing. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Here's my contact information. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that’s everything. Thanks again, Doctor. I gotta go before I get too old to remember where I parked. Haha. .
DOCTOR: Haha! You take care, Mr. Kingan. And good luck at tryouts! Stop.
