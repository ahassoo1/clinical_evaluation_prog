DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's… a bit silly, really. My daughter, she thinks I need… a card. A “get well” card, she says. I feel perfectly fine. But she insists I come see a doctor to get one. From you. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: That's… unusual, yes. But we’re happy to help, even if it’s just to reassure your daughter. So, let’s just talk through things to be sure everything is alright. You said you feel perfectly fine?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Perfectly fine. I been working, you know? Down at the plant. Boilers, mostly. Keeps me busy. No aches, no pains, no… nothing. She worries too much, that girl. Always has. Thinks a little tiredness is the end of the world. She means well, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a quick run-down. Have you noticed any changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think. Well… the plant changed their coffee. It’s… weaker now. That’s a change. Not a good one, if you ask me. But health changes? No. No changes there. I eat the same, sleep the same… work the same hard. Maybe even harder, now that they got that new fella who doesn't know a wrench from a… well, never mind. Everything is as it always is.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Good. Very good. I like a good plate of rice and beans, you know? And a little roast pork on Sundays. My ex-wife used to make a very good roast pork. Not as good as my mother’s, of course, but… good. I eat plenty. Never lost my appetite. Not even when… well, that’s not important now. I eat good.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Trouble sleeping? No, sir. I sleep like a log. Always have. Even with the noise from the plant sometimes. I’m used to it. A good, solid eight hours, usually. Sometimes even more if I don't have to get up too early. I need my sleep. It’s a hard job, running those boilers. A man needs his rest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to cover all the bases, have you noticed any changes in your… bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Doctor, with all due respect… Is this really necessary? I came for a card. My daughter insisted. I’m telling you, I feel fine! I don’t see how… well, never mind. Everything is… regular. Perfectly regular. Can we just get the card now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration. I assure you, I'm just trying to be thorough. It's standard practice. And you're right, it sounds like you are in good health. Let's do a quick physical exam just to confirm everything looks alright, then we can certainly discuss getting you that card for your daughter. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? For a card? Look, Doctor, I respect your profession, but… this is getting ridiculous. But… my daughter. She'll be very happy. Alright. A quick exam. But quick, Doctor. I have things to do. Boilers don't run themselves, you know. But I'm telling you, you won't find a thing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kammer. Quick and thorough. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and a brief look in your ears and throat. We'll start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't take too long, Doctor. And try not to poke too hard. This whole thing is just… unnecessary. But a daughter's love, eh? What can a man do? Just be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is within a normal range. Now, if you don't mind, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Heart… lungs… I suppose I should be grateful for having them, eh? Everything sounds alright to me, but I'm no doctor, am I? Just hurry up, Doctor. This is… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear, Mr. Kammer. Heart rate is regular, lungs are clear. Now, just going to quickly look in your ears. Ears look perfectly fine. And finally, just open your mouth for me. Say "Ahhh". Throat looks good as well. Overall, everything appears to be perfectly normal, Mr. Kammer. You seem to be in excellent health. So, I'm happy to write you a note for your daughter. Something that says you're healthy and doing well. Would that be sufficient?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, that would be perfect, Doctor. Absolutely perfect. Just… a simple note. Saying I'm healthy. That's all she wants. You wouldn’t believe the fuss she made. A daughter's love, eh? You have a good day now, Doctor. And thank you. Truly. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have boilers to run. A man’s work is never done.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kammer. I’m glad I could reassure you and your daughter. I'll have the nurse print that note for you right away. Here's a copy of your visit summary for your records as well. And you're right, a man's work is never done. You have a good day as well, and please be careful with those boilers!
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You're a good man. Have a good day to you too. And thank you for… everything.
