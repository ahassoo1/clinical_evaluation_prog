DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Annesley, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… needing to go to the little boy’s room. A lot. More than I used to, anyway. It’s just… bothersome, really. I don’t recall exactly when it started, just that it’s… frequent. My wife keeps telling me to come see someone, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination can certainly be bothersome. And it's good you came in to get it checked out. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. When you say “a lot,” could you give me a rough estimate of how often you're needing to urinate during the day?
PATIENT: Rough estimate? Oh, goodness. You youngsters and your exact numbers. I… I don’t keep track, Doctor. Let's see… more than usual. Before, I’d go, maybe… three, four times a day? Now? Seems like every couple of hours. Perhaps even sooner. It’s hard to say, truly. I’m not one for counting.
DOCTOR: Alright, "more than usual" is helpful. And every couple of hours is a good starting point. Do you find yourself needing to go during the night as well?
PATIENT: Oh, the night. Yes, that's the worst of it. Waking up… two, maybe three times? Sometimes more, if I drink something before bed. My wife gets annoyed, naturally. Says I’ll shake the house with all my shuffling around. It’s just… inconvenient, Doctor. Really inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand your wife’s frustration, and it definitely sounds inconvenient for both of you. Okay, so frequent urination both day and night. When you do go, do you feel like you’re able to empty your bladder completely, or do you feel like you still need to go shortly after?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that’s a good question. Let me think… usually, it feels… mostly empty. But there's always a little bit left, I suppose. Not a lot, just… a lingering feeling. I don’t strain or anything, mind you. It just doesn't feel completely done, if that makes sense. Like a glass that’s mostly empty, but still has a bit of liquid at the bottom.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A lingering feeling. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself – the color, the smell, or any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain or burning? No, thankfully not. It's not painful, just… frequent. As for the color… well, it’s yellow, isn’t it? Sometimes lighter, sometimes darker, depending on how much I drink, I suppose. Nothing unusual that I’ve noticed. Old age, you know. Things change color, things don’t work as well… It's just part of getting older.
DOCTOR: You're right, things do change as we age. But we still want to rule things out. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all – like increased thirst, fatigue, or swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling, you say? Hmm… My ankles are a bit puffy sometimes, now that you mention it. But I always thought that was just from sitting too long. I do a lot of reading, you see. And reading, well, it requires sitting. Increased thirst… perhaps a little more than usual, but I drink a lot of tea, so it’s hard to say. Fatigue… well, I’m 74, Doctor! I’m always a little tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little swelling in the ankles and perhaps some increased thirst. And, understandably, some fatigue. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… No, I don’t think so. My wife would have mentioned it, she’s very diligent about my health, bless her heart. High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something about it years ago, but I’ve been taking a little pill for it, so it’s under control, I believe. Heart problems… nothing serious that I recall. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old. I've always been a sturdy man though, never had much trouble with my heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled high blood pressure, and otherwise generally healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized... let me think. Oh! Years and years ago, I had my appendix taken out. And when I was a young man, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. Silly thing to do, really. Besides that… no, not that I recall. A few bouts of the flu, of course, but nothing that required a stay in the hospital. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and a broken arm many years ago. Do you have a family history of any medical conditions like diabetes, kidney problems, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Prostate issues… Hmm. My father… he didn't talk much about his health. My mother… well, she lived to a good old age, but I don't recall any specific illnesses. As for kidney problems, I don't believe so. We weren't a family that talked a lot about medical things, if you understand what I mean. Mostly just… dealt with whatever came up.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the pill for my blood pressure. A little white one. I take it every morning with my tea. Sometimes, if my joints are acting up, I’ll take an over-the-counter pain reliever, but that's about it. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can help it. They never sit right with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I'm aware of. I’ve always been able to eat anything, touch anything… never had any trouble with allergies. My wife sometimes worries about it, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m a pretty sturdy man, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological check. It will just take a few moments. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well, alright. If you must. I haven't had one of those in… well, I can’t remember the last time. Just be gentle, Doctor. Old bones, you know. And try to be quick about it. I have a book waiting for me at home.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could just lie down on the table, that would be great. Your heart sounds regular, a slight murmur, but nothing concerning given your age. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness, but I do feel a slightly enlarged bladder. Reflexes are a little slow, but within normal limits for your age. No other neurological deficits noted. Everything seems generally normal, but given your symptoms and the enlarged bladder, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a blood test to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels. This will help us rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A urinalysis and a blood test, you say? Seems a bit much, but… alright. If you think it's necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… try not to take too much blood, if you don’t mind. I get a little lightheaded sometimes. And let me know what you find, will you? I don’t like being kept in the dark.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll only take a small amount of blood, and I’ll make sure you're comfortable. The lab technician is very good. I’ll let you know as soon as the results are back, usually within a day or two. In the meantime, I’d also recommend keeping a bladder diary for the next few days – just write down how often you urinate, how much you drink, and if you experience any urgency or discomfort. This will give us a better understanding of your pattern. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A bladder diary… Writing down everything I drink and… well, everything else. Sounds like a lot of work. But alright, I’ll try. My wife will probably help me with it, she’s good at keeping track of things. Just… don’t expect a masterpiece, Doctor. I'm not much of a writer.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no masterpiece required! Just a simple record will be helpful. Okay, so we’ll get the lab tests ordered, and you’ll keep a bladder diary. Based on the initial information, it could be a number of things – a urinary tract infection, an enlarged prostate, or simply age-related changes in bladder function. We’ll have a better idea once we get the test results back. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… Let me think. Will these tests hurt? And how long will I have to wait for the results? I don't like waiting, you know. I have a good book I want to get back to.
DOCTOR: The tests themselves shouldn’t hurt. The blood draw is quick, and the urinalysis is just a simple sample. As for waiting, I understand your frustration. The results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side, please call the office immediately. Otherwise, just focus on keeping the bladder diary, and we’ll go from there. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. No fever, chills, or pain. Got it. And I'll try my best with this… diary. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. It’s my pleasure. And please, don’t think of yourself as “just an old man.” You're a patient seeking help, and I'm here to provide it. The nurse will come in shortly to take your blood sample and give you instructions for the urinalysis. If you have any questions or concerns before you leave, please don’t hesitate to ask. Otherwise, have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. A good day to you too. I appreciate your help.
