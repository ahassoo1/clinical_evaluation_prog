DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's my skin. It's been so itchy, especially my arms and back. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, and it's driving me crazy. I've tried lotion, but it doesn't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Itchy skin, you say. A couple of weeks… and lotion isn't providing relief. Hmm. Is it just itchiness, or is there a rash as well?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… there is a little bit of redness. Not a full-blown rash, more like… little bumps, really. They come and go. Sometimes I don’t even notice them, just the itch. It’s worse at night, though. Makes it hard to sleep!
DOCTOR: Worse at night, you say. Interesting. And these bumps… are they all over, or mostly confined to your arms and back?
PATIENT: Mostly the arms and back, yes. A few on my chest, but not many. And… honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure if it’s related, but I started using a new laundry detergent a few weeks ago too. A store brand, to save a little money.
DOCTOR: A new detergent… that could be relevant. Alright. And just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any other changes – any fever, fatigue, weight loss, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no fever or anything like that. I'm tired sometimes, but that’s just… getting old, I think! Weight? Probably lost a pound or two, but nothing drastic. I've been eating a little less since this itch started, honestly. It’s hard to enjoy a meal when you're so uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. Let's take a look at your skin. Could you please turn around and lift your shirt a bit so I can examine your back?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Here you go, Doctor. Be careful, my skin is a little fragile, you know. Old age again!
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some scattered, small papules… some mild erythema. Nothing alarming, but definitely irritated. And yes, your skin is quite thin. Same on your arms. A bit of dryness as well. It appears to be a mild dermatitis. It could be related to the new detergent, as you suggested, or it could be something else entirely. Do you have any known allergies, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. Not to food, not that I know of. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. I haven't been stung in decades. Aside from that, no, I don't think so. I haven't had a reaction to anything new, not until this detergent.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, aside from a childhood bee sting allergy. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, Doctor. It's called… let me see… naproxen. I take one a day, when my joints are acting up. And sometimes Tylenol for the pain, but not regularly. That’s it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Naproxen as needed for arthritis, Tylenol occasionally. Alright. Given the timing, and the fact that it's localized, I suspect it is a contact dermatitis related to the detergent. However, we can't be certain without ruling out other possibilities. I'd like to start you on a topical corticosteroid cream to reduce the inflammation and itching. Have you ever used one of those before?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Cortico… what was it? A cream, you said? I’ve used plenty of lotions, but not a special cream like that. What does it do exactly? And is it…safe? I always worry about putting things on my skin.
DOCTOR: A topical corticosteroid. It's a medication that reduces inflammation in the skin. Think of it as calming down the irritation causing the itch. It’s applied directly to the affected area. It is generally safe, but prolonged use can thin the skin, so it’s important to use it as directed. I'm going to prescribe a mild potency cream. Apply a thin layer to the itchy areas twice a day for two weeks. And, importantly, stop using the new detergent immediately. Go back to whatever you were using before. Now, let me get this prescription sent to your pharmacy. Do you have a preferred pharmacy?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds good. Stopping the detergent makes sense. Yes, I have one just down the street. It’s Rodriguez Pharmacy, on Main Street. And thank you, Doctor. It’s just so bothersome, this itch! I'm hoping this cream will help.
DOCTOR: Alright, the prescription has been sent to Rodriguez Pharmacy. It should be ready within the hour. Now, if the itching doesn't improve after two weeks of using the cream and avoiding the new detergent, or if it gets worse, I want you to schedule an appointment to come back in. We may need to consider other possibilities, such as an allergic reaction or another skin condition. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Two weeks, stop the detergent, and come back if it doesn’t get better. Sounds good. Thank you very much, Doctor Korrell. You’ve been a big help.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
