DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Parascandola. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my foot’s been swellin' up something awful. It started a few days ago, and it just keeps gettin' bigger, you know? It’s my right one. Feels kinda tight, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your right foot is swelling and feels tight, and it’s been getting worse over the last few days. Can you tell me a little more about when it started exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… Tuesday, I reckon. Yeah, Tuesday morning. I was walkin' to the bus stop, normal like, and noticed it felt a little funny. Didn’t think much of it at first, just figured I walked a bit funny or somethin'. But by Tuesday evening, it was definitely bigger. Wednesday it was worse still, and today… well, you can see it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see. And was there any specific injury that happened when you were walking to the bus stop on Tuesday?
PATIENT: No, nothin' that I recall. I didn’t trip or twist it or nothin’. Just walkin’ normal. Same route I always take. It’s a bit of a walk, maybe ten minutes, but I do it every day. I was wearin' my regular shoes, too – nothin' new or different. It just… started. That’s what’s botherin’ me, really. Shouldn't just start swellin' for no reason, right?
DOCTOR: You're right, it shouldn't just start swelling without a reason. Okay, so no injury, same shoes, normal activity. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. Work’s been the same, same hours. I haven’t been eatin’ nothin’ different. Oh! Wait a minute. My sister, she brought over some mangoes last week. Really sweet mangoes. I ate… maybe four or five of ‘em over a couple of days. Could that do somethin'? I don’t know… I eat fruit all the time.
DOCTOR: That's good information, thank you. It is possible, though less common, for certain foods to contribute to swelling. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, besides the swelling and tightness, are you experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, there's a bit of pain. Not awful, but it's there. It kinda aches, especially when I try to put weight on it. And if I move my foot around… there's a little sharp pain on the inside. Not all the time, just when I really move it a certain way. It's not like a sudden, bad pain, more of a dull ache with a little poke now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache with a sharp poke when you move it a certain way, and it's worse when you put weight on it. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the foot?
PATIENT: No, not really. It looks normal, color-wise. Maybe a little bit paler than my other foot, now that you mention it, but nothin’ drastic. And it doesn't feel particularly warm. I touched it earlier to see, and it felt the same temperature as my other foot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Feel perfectly normal, apart from this foot, that is. No cough, no sniffles, no nothin'. Just this swellin’ and the ache. It's just… weird. I’ve never had anything like this happen before.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam of your foot and ankle. I'm going to gently feel around to see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain and assess the swelling. I'll also check your pulses to make sure your circulation is good. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. Just be gentle, alright? It’s a bit tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some tenderness along the inside of your ankle, right here. Your pulses are present, but a little weaker than on your other foot, and you have some limited range of motion with pain. The swelling is noticeable, and seems to be concentrated around the ankle and midfoot. It feels warm to the touch, but not overly so. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it's possible this is a sprain or strain, but the diminished pulses are concerning, and we need to rule out a blood clot, called a Deep Vein Thrombosis, or DVT. Do you have any history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? No, never. Nobody in my family has ever had one, as far as I know. That sounds… scary. What do we do about that? Is that serious?
DOCTOR: It can be serious, yes, which is why we need to check it out. A DVT is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg, and it can cause pain, swelling, and potentially travel to the lungs, which is very dangerous. However, it’s not always a clot, and we need to investigate further. I’d like to order a D-dimer blood test and an ultrasound of your right leg to rule out a DVT. The D-dimer will help us see if there’s evidence of recent clotting, and the ultrasound will visualize the veins to check for any blockages. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. If you think it's best to check for that, then yes, let's do it. Blood test and the… ultrasound, right? Is the ultrasound… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I got work tomorrow, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The ultrasound isn’t painful at all. It uses sound waves to create an image of your veins, and a technician will simply move a probe over your leg. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the results, the lab can usually get the D-dimer results back within a few hours, and we should have the ultrasound results by tomorrow afternoon. I'll have my nurse draw your blood right away, and we can schedule the ultrasound for sometime tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your foot as much as possible and applying ice packs for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. That will help reduce the swelling and pain. Also, avoid putting too much weight on it. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. Elevate, ice, don't put weight on it. I can do that. So, blood test now, ultrasound tomorrow. And then you'll tell me what's goin' on?
DOCTOR: Exactly. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of treatment. If the D-dimer is elevated or the ultrasound shows a clot, we’ll need to start you on blood thinners immediately. If everything comes back negative, we can explore other possible causes for your swelling, such as a ligament injury or tendonitis. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… I hope it's nothin' serious. Thanks, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Parascandola. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of this. Sarah will be in shortly, and please don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or if your pain worsens. I’ll see you tomorrow to discuss the results.
