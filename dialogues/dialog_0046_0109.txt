DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head... the back of my head... it hurts. Been hurting for maybe... three days now, I think. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Feels like a... a tight band, maybe? I don't know good words for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head for about three days, coming and going, and you describe it as a tight band. That’s helpful. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: More? Hmm. It's not... a bad, bad pain. Like, I can still work. I have been working. Down at the rail yard, you know? But after a long day... it feels worse. And sometimes, when I bend over... it feels a little... sharp? Not always, though. Mostly just the tight band. It doesn't make me sick, if that's what you're asking. No blurry vision either.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not debilitating, you've been able to continue working at the rail yard, and it worsens after a long day. You also mentioned a sharp pain when bending over, but that's intermittent. No nausea or vision changes, which is good. Just to clarify – when you say “bending over,” what exactly are you doing?
PATIENT: Ah. Good question, Doctor. I operate the dinkey. Small engine, moves the rail cars around. Lots of getting down low to connect the couplings, you see? And sometimes, gotta check under the cars, make sure everything's okay. That's when I bend over. It’s not a fast bend, slow and careful. Old man's bend, you know? Not like I'm lifting heavy things, just... looking.
DOCTOR: I understand. Operating the dinkey involves getting down low to connect couplings and checking under the cars, requiring slow, careful bending. That gives me a better picture. Now, have you noticed anything else that seems to make the headache better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Resting helps a little. Sitting quiet. And sometimes, if I rub the back of my neck... that feels good for a bit. But it comes back, always comes back. Nothing really makes it go away completely. And I haven't noticed anything that makes it worse, besides working, maybe. Like, being tired makes it feel worse quicker.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting and rubbing the back of your neck provide some temporary relief, but it always returns. Being tired seems to exacerbate it. Mr. Brum, have you experienced any similar headaches in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A few times. Not this long, usually. Maybe once or twice a year, for a few days. Always thought it was just... old age, you know? Or the work. Never bothered a doctor before. This one just... lasted longer. And it worries my daughter. She said I should come see someone. Smart girl, that one.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you've had similar headaches before, but this one is lasting longer and your daughter is concerned – that’s very thoughtful of her. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I've been pretty healthy, for an old man. A few aches and pains, of course. But no doctors, no pills. Just work hard and try not to fall down. My wife… she was the one with the doctors. She had… something with her heart. But that was a long time ago. I don't even remember the name. I’m sorry. I'm not good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Brum. It’s more important that you’ve generally been healthy. And it’s understandable that you don’t remember details about your wife’s condition. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. Broken a few bones when I was a boy, climbing trees. But nothing serious. Just a cast and a scolding from my mother. No hospitals, no cutting. I'm a simple man. Just the rail yard, mostly. And my daughter, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. A little coffee in the morning, that's all. And sometimes, a glass of water when it's hot. That's it. My wife... she had a whole cupboard full of things. I don't understand all that. I just… avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements, just coffee and water. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had an allergy. I eat everything. Well, maybe not snails. But that's just a preference, not an allergy. I’ve never had a rash or trouble breathing from anything. Lucky, I guess. My daughter always worries about that too, but I’ve always been fine.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Brum. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a hard one, Doctor. My father… he worked on the railroad too. Died young, from a fever, I think. My mother... she lived a long time, but I don't remember her being sick with anything special. Lots of aches and pains, like me. And my daughter's father... well, he wasn't around much, so I don't know anything about his family. It wasn't a close family, you see? Mostly just hard work and keeping quiet. I'm sorry I can't be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Brum. It’s not always possible to know a lot about family history. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean, Doctor? I work on the rail yard. I live in a small house. I have a daughter who visits sometimes. Is that what you want to know? I don't go to bars or parties. Never really liked crowds. Mostly just quiet evenings and working hard. I’m a simple man.
DOCTOR: That's exactly what I want to know, Mr. Brum. It helps me understand your lifestyle. So, you live a quiet life, primarily focused on your work and spending time with your daughter. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. Tried it once, when I was a young man, but didn't like it. Made me cough too much. My wife didn't like it either. She always said it was bad for your health. I agree with her. Fresh air is better. And a good cup of coffee, of course.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you drink alcohol, even occasionally?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. Maybe a little beer with my father, a long time ago. But I don't like the taste. Makes my head feel funny. I prefer water. Or coffee. That's all. My wife... she liked a little wine sometimes, but I always just had water.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, and very little to no alcohol consumption. Now, Mr. Brum, let's move on to the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your neck and head. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need. Just tell me if it's going to be cold. Old man gets cold easy, you know? And if it will hurt. I'm not afraid, but... I don't want to fall down.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. I'll make sure everything is comfortable. I'll explain each step as I go. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that's not uncommon, especially with a bit of stress. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, although a bit faint. Your lungs are clear, which is good. Now, I’m just feeling your neck. There's a little tenderness in the back of your neck, which may be related to your headache. I’m examining your head now. I don’t see anything unusual. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your neck. Just try to look up, down, left and right, as comfortably as you can.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I'll try. That feels… tight. Especially when I look to the side. Not a sharp pain, just… tight. Like a rubber band pulling. And it makes my head hurt a little more when I do that. Not too bad, though. I can still do it. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. There is some restriction in your range of motion, and it does seem to exacerbate your headache. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it seems like you're experiencing a tension headache, likely related to muscle tightness in your neck and shoulders, possibly from the repetitive movements and postures involved in your work. The slightly elevated blood pressure could be a contributing factor, or unrelated. However, given your age and the persistence of the headache, I would like to order a few tests to rule out other potential causes, just to be safe. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests, Doctor? I don't like hospitals, you know. And I don't have much money. Just want to feel better, that's all. Are they expensive? And will they take long? I need to get back to work… my daughter worries when I'm gone too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brum. You're right to ask. We're not talking about a hospital stay. We can do these tests right here at the clinic, or at a lab nearby. I'm thinking a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes. We’ll also do a simple X-ray of your neck to rule out any underlying structural problems. The X-ray will be the most expensive, around $150. The blood tests are usually around $100 total. We may be able to get a discount since you don’t have insurance, let me check with the billing department. As for time, the blood draw will take about 15 minutes, and the X-ray won't take long either. We can schedule them for tomorrow morning. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I can prescribe a mild muscle relaxant and recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers. What do you think?
PATIENT: $150… and $100… Hmm. That’s a lot of money. But… if it makes sure nothing bad is happening… maybe it’s worth it. You think it’s important? And… the muscle relaxant… will that make me sleepy? I need to be able to work. And... what if something is wrong? What if it's something serious? My daughter... she'll worry so much.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Mr. Brum. It is a significant expense, and your concerns are valid. I understand your worry about your daughter as well. I’m ordering these tests not because I believe anything serious is definitely wrong, but as a precaution, given your age and the persistence of the headache. It's always best to rule out any other possibilities. The muscle relaxant I’m considering is a low dose, and many people experience only mild drowsiness. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it makes you too sleepy, we can adjust it or choose a different approach. If, by chance, something is wrong, we’ll discuss it openly and honestly. I’ll explain all your options and work with you and your daughter to create a plan that’s best for you. I can also provide a referral to a specialist if needed. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule the tests and write a prescription for the muscle relaxant?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Go ahead. Schedule the tests. And write the prescription. I trust you. Just… please, be quick. And please, tell me if anything is wrong right away. Don't keep me waiting. My daughter… she'll want to know. And… thank you. For listening. It's nice to have someone listen.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brum. I understand. I’ll get the tests scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. I'll also write a prescription for cyclobenzaprine 5mg, take one tablet at bedtime as needed for muscle relaxation. I'll personally review the results as soon as they’re available, and I promise to contact you immediately if anything concerning is found. You can reach me directly at the clinic, or my nurse will call. In the meantime, try to rest as much as possible, apply a warm compress to your neck, and stay hydrated. I'll also give you a handout with instructions on proper posture and neck exercises. Here are the instructions for the medication and the handout. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you. For everything. You’ve been very kind. And… tell your nurse to be gentle with the blood draw, okay? Old man’s veins aren’t what they used to be. I guess I’ll see you tomorrow. Goodbye, Doctor. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I’ll make a note for the nurse to be gentle with the blood draw. We'll take good care of you. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good evening, and get some rest. Goodbye, Mr. Brum. .
PATIENT: Goodbye, Doctor Glowka. Thank you.
