DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Particia Shely, and I'm a family medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Shely. It’s… pleasant to meet you. Hmm. Well, to be frank, I’ve been going to the restroom rather frequently lately. More than usual, you understand. It’s a bit… disruptive, really. I wouldn't say it's painful, exactly, just… constant. I apologize for being vague; my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Verbos. It's perfectly alright to take your time and explain things as clearly as you can. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about this?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… when did this start, you ask? That’s a good question. It feels like… several weeks, perhaps? Or maybe a month? It’s difficult to pinpoint. I do recall noticing it more consistently after… well, after that trip to the countryside with my nephew. We were hiking, you see, and I drank a considerable amount of water. Though, I’ve continued the frequent trips to the restroom even after returning home. And it's not just during the day, either. I find myself waking up a few times each night to… well, you understand. It's quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Mr. Verbos. So, it started several weeks ago, possibly a month, and became noticeable after a hiking trip with your nephew where you increased your water intake. It's also occurring at night, causing you to wake up. To clarify, would you say the amount of urine each time is normal, small, or large?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a… a thoughtful question. I believe it’s… normal. Yes, normal is the appropriate word. Not a torrent, certainly. Just… frequent. It’s not the volume, it’s the number of times, you see? I suppose that’s a crucial distinction. I apologize if I'm being… imprecise. My nephew keeps telling me I need to drink less water, but I find it difficult to resist, particularly on a warm day.
DOCTOR: You're being very clear, Mr. Verbos. It's helpful to know it's the frequency, not the amount, that's the primary concern. And it’s perfectly reasonable to drink water, especially in warm weather. Now, aside from the increased urination, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me ponder that for a moment. I… haven’t noticed anything drastically different, no. Perhaps a bit more… thirsty than usual, but I attributed that to the warmer weather and the increased restroom visits. Oh! And I believe I’ve been… a little more fatigued, perhaps? Not debilitating, certainly, just… a general sense of weariness. It's difficult to say if that’s related, or simply due to my age, you understand. I do enjoy a good nap, if I may add.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. Increased thirst and fatigue are good things to note. It's helpful to try and piece everything together. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Let me see. I was diagnosed with… mild hypertension several years ago, but it’s been well-managed with medication. I take a small dose each morning. Otherwise, no, nothing significant that I’m aware of. No heart problems, no kidney issues. I used to have a troublesome back, but that’s mostly settled down with physiotherapy. I believe that’s all. I apologize if my recall is… lacking. It’s frustrating, truly. My wife – she passed away some years ago – always kept meticulous records. I, unfortunately, am not so organized.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Verbos. It's perfectly alright. Managing mild hypertension is good, and it's helpful to know that's your only existing condition. I understand losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it's understandable that keeping records may not have been a priority. Could you please tell me what medications you are currently taking, and the dosage, if you know it?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… as I mentioned, I take medication for my hypertension. It’s… Lisinopril, I believe. Ah, here we are. Ten milligrams, once daily. That’s all. Just the Lisinopril. And… occasionally, I take a paracetamol for a headache, but that’s infrequent. Perhaps once a month, or less. I'm not one for taking many pills, you understand. I prefer a good cup of tea if I'm feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. Lisinopril 10mg daily, and occasional paracetamol for headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That's a good question. I do not believe so. I’ve never knowingly had a reaction to anything. No food allergies, no drug allergies. I used to get a bit of hay fever as a child, but that hasn’t bothered me for many years. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to dust, but nothing severe. I wouldn't say I have any significant allergies, no. Though my nephew is terribly allergic to cats, and I always steer clear of them, just in case.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father suffered from… heart disease, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t recall the specifics. My mother lived to a good age, but she had… arthritis, quite severely. And my sister, she had… diabetes, yes. Type 2, I believe. Other than that, I don’t recall any significant medical conditions in the family. It’s… difficult to say, truly. My family wasn’t particularly forthcoming about such matters, you understand. They preferred to focus on… happier things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. That’s helpful to know. Finally, let’s briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I have never smoked a day in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not! I’m a retired environmental engineer, you see. We prefer… rational pursuits. I enjoy gardening, reading, and the occasional classical concert. A quiet life, you understand. I assure you, no illicit substances involved.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. That provides a very clear picture. Now, with all that information, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor Shely. Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, of course. Do let me know if anything feels… unpleasant. I'm not particularly fond of medical examinations, but I understand they are necessary. Please, proceed at your own pace. I shall do my best to remain still.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'll check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so, given your history of hypertension. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply as I listen. Your heart sounds are regular, though I do detect a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Finally, I’ll do a quick neurological assessment. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor Shely. I shall do my best. Yes, I can see it quite clearly. It's… a bit mesmerizing, actually. Is this a standard procedure? I apologize for my… curiosity. It's merely that I find the workings of the human body rather fascinating.
DOCTOR: Very good. Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, could you please squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: Certainly. Is that sufficient? I trust I applied the appropriate amount of pressure. I’m not particularly strong, you understand. A retired engineer, as I mentioned. More accustomed to… delicate work.
DOCTOR: That was perfect, Mr. Verbos. Your grip strength is within normal limits. Based on the physical examination and your history, I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. This is a common condition in men your age, and it can cause frequent urination, especially at night. The slightly elevated blood pressure is also something we should monitor closely. To confirm this diagnosis, I’d like to order a few laboratory tests, including a urine analysis and a prostate-specific antigen test. We may also consider a kidney function test to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia… hmm. That sounds… rather complicated. Frequent urination, you say? Well, that certainly aligns with my symptoms. Laboratory tests… yes, of course. If that’s what you deem necessary, Doctor Shely, then please proceed. A urine analysis and… a prostate-specific antigen test. And a kidney function test, just to be safe. Yes, that sounds… thorough. I trust your judgment entirely. Are these tests… painful? I apologize for my constant questioning. It’s merely that I… dislike surprises.
DOCTOR: You're not at all bothersome with your questions, Mr. Verbos. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to know what to expect. The urine analysis is a simple, non-invasive test. You’ll simply need to provide a sample. The PSA test involves a small blood draw, which is usually quick and relatively painless. You might feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn’t be significant. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and you can provide a urine sample in the restroom. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your fluid intake before bedtime and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as they can worsen your symptoms. Do you have any questions about the tests or the recommendations?
PATIENT: Limiting fluids before bedtime… yes, that seems… sensible. And avoiding caffeine and alcohol. I rarely indulge in either, thankfully. A small glass of wine with dinner on occasion, but I can certainly abstain. A small blood draw and a urine sample… yes, I believe I can manage that. No, I don’t believe I have any further questions at this time, Doctor Shely. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. You’ve been most… reassuring. Please, let me know when I can proceed with the tests.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Once the results are back, usually within a few days, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any significant pain, fever, or inability to urinate, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Shely, I believe that covers everything. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. And thank you for being so… understanding. I shall refrain from excessive fluid intake and avoid caffeine and alcohol. And I shall certainly seek immediate medical attention should any… complications arise. I believe I am prepared for the tests. Thank you again for your assistance. It’s… a relief to have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbos. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, and we'll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Shely. You have a good day as well.
