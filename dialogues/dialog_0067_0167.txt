DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot is… bothering me. A sore, you see. A very painful sore. It’s been there a little while now, and it’s not getting better. I think it’s from the sugar sickness, the diabetes. It hurts to walk, especially.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been causing you pain, and you suspect it might be related to your diabetes. I understand. That’s a very common concern with diabetes, so you’re right to think of that. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s right. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes, on this one… It started small, like a little cut, maybe from a stone in my slipper. But it just… didn’t heal. Now it’s… well, it’s a hole, almost. It’s red around the edges, and sometimes it… weeps a little. It’s very tender to the touch. And the pain goes up my leg sometimes, not all the time, but it does. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Stoegbauer. A sore that started small and hasn't healed, is red, weeps a little, and is tender to the touch, with pain radiating up your leg… that definitely warrants a closer look. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or swelling in your foot or leg?
PATIENT: No, no fever, Doctor. I haven’t felt hot or anything like that. And no chills. My foot… well, it’s a little puffy sometimes, at the end of the day, after I’ve been walking. But not much. It’s not really… swollen, like a balloon. Just a little bigger than usual, I think. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Stoegbauer. A little puffiness at the end of the day, especially after walking, is good information. Now, let’s talk a little about your diabetes. Do you check your blood sugar regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. My daughter, Leilani, she helps me remember. I check it every morning, right after breakfast. Sometimes it’s a little high, sometimes it’s okay. I try to eat good food, you know? Not too much sugar. But sometimes I like a little sweet bread with my coffee. Leilani writes down the numbers for me, and she takes them to the doctor when I go for my check-ups. I don't really understand the numbers myself. They just tell me if it's good or bad. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s very good that you're checking your blood sugar and Leilani is helping you keep track of things. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t focus on the numbers themselves, as long as you have someone helping monitor them. Do you know approximately what your blood sugar readings usually are?
PATIENT: Um… Leilani says they're usually between… well, she says a lot of numbers. I think she said sometimes they go over 200, and sometimes they're around 100 or 150. But I don't really pay attention, to be honest. I just try to take my medicine like she tells me. It's a little pill, orange color. I take two of them every day. Is that helpful? I don't want to confuse you. I forget things so easily these days.
DOCTOR: No, you're not confusing me at all, Mr. Stoegbauer. It's helpful to know, and it's perfectly normal to forget things sometimes. Readings between 100 and 200 are what we would expect with diabetes, and taking your medication regularly is very important. Now, have you ever had any problems with your feet before, like ulcers or infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think… yes, a long time ago, maybe ten years ago, I had a little sore on my heel. It was small, and the doctor gave me some cream to put on it. It healed pretty quickly, I think. But this one… this one is different. It’s much more painful, and it’s not getting better with just resting it. I try to keep it clean, you know? Wash it with soap and water. But it still hurts. A lot. Does that help? I’m sorry I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mr. Stoegbauer. That information is very helpful. Having a previous foot sore is important to know. Alright, I'd like to take a look at your foot now, if you're comfortable with that. We'll need to do a quick physical exam to assess the sore and see what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Please, have a look. It hurts, but I’m used to it. I’ll try to be still. Just tell me if you need me to move it or anything. I’m not so good with bending anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer, I see the sore here on the plantar surface, near your metatarsals. It appears to be approximately 1.5 centimeters in diameter, with some surrounding erythema and mild edema. There's a small amount of purulent drainage present. I'm palpating your foot now... there is tenderness to the touch, and you’re right, the pain radiates up your leg somewhat. I'm checking the pulses in your foot... dorsalis pedis pulse is present, but diminished. Posterior tibial pulse is also present, but weaker than expected. I'm also checking sensation in your foot… it feels somewhat diminished, particularly in the toes. It appears we have a developing foot ulcer, and the diminished pulses and sensation are concerning, given your diabetes. It’s important we address this quickly to prevent complications.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Complications? What kind of complications? Is it serious, Doctor? I just want to be able to walk again without pain. I like to go to the park with my grandchildren, you see. And I help Leilani in the garden sometimes. I don't want to lose my foot!
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s good that you’re bringing this up. With diabetes, poor circulation and nerve damage can lead to slower healing and increased risk of infection. If left untreated, these infections can become serious, potentially leading to the need for more extensive interventions. However, we’re catching this early, and that's very positive. I want to be clear: I’m not saying you will lose your foot. But we need to take this seriously and implement a plan to promote healing and prevent further complications. This may involve wound care, medication, and potentially referral to a podiatrist and/or vascular specialist. First, I want to order some lab work to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and white blood cell count to assess for infection. We’ll also need to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Anything to help. Lab work and an X-ray… Leilani can help me with that. She’s very good at taking me to appointments. And she’ll know what to do with the results. I just want this pain to go away. And I don’t want to lose my foot, no. I need my feet to walk with my grandchildren. Please, do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m glad to hear that. I’m going to write up the orders for the lab work and X-ray now. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw some blood, and then we’ll send you over to radiology for the X-ray. In the meantime, I’m going to start you on a course of oral antibiotics to help prevent infection. I’ll also prescribe a special dressing for your wound to keep it clean and protected. I'm going to give you a detailed wound care plan to follow at home. It’s very important to follow these instructions carefully. And I want you to avoid putting any weight on your foot as much as possible until we get the results of the tests and see how the wound is responding to treatment. Do you have any questions about any of this so far?
PATIENT: Oral antibiotics and a special dressing… yes, that sounds good. And no weight on my foot… that will be difficult, but I’ll try. Will the antibiotics make me sick? Sometimes those pills upset my stomach. And what kind of special dressing is it? Is it hard to put on? Leilani is good with these things, but I don't want to bother her too much. And… when will I get the results? I'm always so worried when I have to wait.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. The antibiotics can sometimes cause mild nausea or stomach upset, but it’s usually manageable. We’ll start with a lower dose and see how you tolerate it. If you do experience any significant side effects, please let me know immediately, and we can adjust the medication. The special dressing is a hydrocolloid dressing. It’s designed to keep the wound moist, which promotes healing and helps prevent infection. It's relatively easy to apply - you simply clean and dry the wound, and then apply the dressing. Leilani can easily learn how to do it, and I’ll have the nurse go over the instructions with her before you leave. As for the results, the lab work usually comes back within 24-48 hours, and the X-ray results should be available within a few hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them to discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you notice any signs of infection – increased pain, redness, swelling, pus, or fever – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit. I’m still worried, but I feel better knowing we’re doing something about it. I guess I should go get the blood drawn now? And then the X-ray? Leilani is waiting for me in the waiting room. She's very good at reminding me what to do. I don't think I would make it through all this without her.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right, Mr. Stoegbauer. The lab technician is ready for you whenever you’re ready. And then you’ll go over to radiology for the X-ray. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. And it’s wonderful to hear you have such a supportive daughter. It's important to have someone helping you through this. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And please, remember to follow the wound care instructions carefully. Get well soon, Mr. Stoegbauer. And give Leilani my regards.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. She worries about me so much. I'll tell her you said hello. I think I can find the lab now. It was nice meeting you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. It was nice meeting you as well. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon. .
