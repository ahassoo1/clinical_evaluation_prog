DOCTOR: Alright, have a seat. So, Liza, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a little hard to explain, really. I’ve been thinking about trying mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I hear good things, and I was hoping you might have some thoughts on it, or if it's something that could be helpful. I’m just… looking to feel a little more grounded, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. I understand it's about focusing on the present moment, being aware of your thoughts and feelings without… judging them, I think? It’s not something I’ve ever done before, but I’ve read a few articles and a friend mentioned it helped her with stress. I just wasn't sure if it was… a real thing, or just a fad, and if it would be good for someone like me. Do you know anything about it?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Sugino, with all due respect, you’re coming to a doctor about meditation?
PATIENT: Oh. I… well, I suppose I thought it might be something you could advise on. I mean, you deal with… with people’s well-being, and stress is part of that, isn't it? I wasn't sure if it interacted with anything, or if it was appropriate given… well, given my age, or anything. I’m sorry if it seems like a silly question. I just didn’t know where else to ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, look. You’re 47, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. August 12th, if you need the full date. I remember things pretty well, you see. But yes, 47.
DOCTOR: Right. And what do you do, Mrs. Sugino?
PATIENT: I’m a Signal and Track Switch Repairer. It's… it's a practical job, mostly outdoors. Lots of problem solving, making sure everything runs smoothly, you know? It can be a bit stressful at times, especially when there are delays or… well, it doesn't matter. The point is, it keeps me busy. Why do you ask?
DOCTOR: Look, I'm a doctor, not a life coach. You're a… a switch repairer. You're coming to me, a medical professional, to discuss… relaxation techniques?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. I really do. It just… sometimes, with the job, and being on my own a lot… I find it hard to switch off, if you’ll pardon the pun. I suppose I was hoping you might know if something like mindfulness could help with… with the constant thinking, or if there were any physical reasons why it wouldn’t be a good idea. I didn't mean to waste your time, or come across as… frivolous. Perhaps I should have gone somewhere else.
DOCTOR: Alright, look. You're 47, 161 centimeters, weigh 136 kilograms. Medicare. We'll run a basic metabolic panel, check your thyroid. Stress can manifest physically. But honestly, Mrs. Sugino, I suspect this is more about… needing a hobby.
PATIENT: That… that makes sense, actually. I hadn’t really thought of it that way. The tests sound… sensible. And yes, you’re probably right about the hobby. It’s just… difficult to know where to start, I suppose. Thank you for being honest with me, Doctor. Even if it's not quite what I hoped to hear, it’s helpful. Would the results take long to come back?
DOCTOR: Should be a couple of days. We’ll have the nurse call you. In the meantime, try… gardening. Or knitting. Something with your hands. And if you're still feeling overwhelmed, perhaps… a support group?
PATIENT: Gardening… or knitting. Knitting… my grandmother used to knit. That’s a nice thought. And a support group… I hadn’t considered that. Thank you, Doctor Billman. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things. I’ll wait for the nurse to call. Is there anything else I need to do now?
DOCTOR: Nope. Just try to relax. And avoid switching tracks without proper authorization. Next.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Safety first. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day. .
