DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don't quite recall all the fuss. My daughter, bless her heart, scheduled this. Something about... not wanting things done? I keep telling her, I know what's best for my body. It's been perfectly fine for eighty-three years, hasn't it? Though these feet… they’re getting the better of me, I’ll say that much.
DOCTOR: Right. So, your daughter initiated this appointment… and you are experiencing some foot discomfort. Can you elaborate on that discomfort, please?
PATIENT: Discomfort? That’s a polite way of putting it, Doctor. They ache. All the time, really. Especially when I try to do anything… you know, around the house. Standing, walking… even just thinking about standing! And they’re… well, they look a fright, I’m sure. All bunched up and… knobbly. Though I used to have lovely feet, you know. Used to wear the prettiest sandals. It's just… everything hurts more now.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll address the feet. And this… general increased discomfort. Now, Ms. Gunasekara, when did you first notice this aching in your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice? That’s a tricky one. It wasn't sudden, you see. It was… gradual. A little bit more ache here, a little bit more trouble there. Probably… oh, a year or so ago, maybe? It’s hard to say. Time just… slips away, doesn't it? I suppose it started when I stopped wearing my good shoes as much. All this sensible footwear… no support, none of it helps, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. A year, gradually worsening. And this is primarily with ambulation, I assume?
PATIENT: Am-… what now? Walking, Doctor. It hurts when I walk. Honestly, sometimes I think you doctors just like to use big words to confuse people. It's a simple ache, it doesn’t need a fancy name! I used to be able to walk for miles… now, just getting to the mailbox is an ordeal. It’s just… not the same. Not the same at all.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, precise terminology is important for accurate documentation. Very well. Do you experience any pain in other areas of your body besides your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere aches a little, Doctor. Eighty-three years will do that to you! My knees aren’t what they used to be, and my back… don’t even get me started on my back. But I manage. I always have. It’s just… these feet are the worst of it right now. They make everything else harder, you understand? It’s like carrying around two lead weights. And I don't want anyone poking and prodding at them, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm, no numbness, tingling, or swelling in your feet or legs?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. And swelling… sometimes, maybe, at the end of the day. But nothing serious. I put my feet up. Always have. A bit of swelling is just… part of getting older, isn't it? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve lived a long life. I’ve had aches and pains come and go. This is just… a particularly stubborn ache, that’s all. I’m not about to let someone cut into my feet over it.
DOCTOR: Very well. I would still like to perform a brief physical exam, just to assess the situation. It will be quick. I need to document my findings, regardless. Can you please remove your shoes and socks so I can take a look?
PATIENT: Now, see, that’s what I was afraid of. Poking and prodding… absolutely not. I’m perfectly capable of knowing what my feet look like, thank you very much. I don’t need you telling me they're knobbly. And I certainly won’t be taking my shoes and socks off in front of a… a stranger. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t see the point of that at all. It won't change a thing, I assure you. I just want to be left alone to manage my own discomfort, thank you.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, with all due respect, a physical examination is a standard part of any medical consultation. I need to assess the condition of your feet to provide appropriate medical advice. I understand your reluctance, but I cannot proceed without it. Are you refusing the examination?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s exactly what I’m doing. I’m refusing. I’ve told you, I don’t want anyone poking around. I’m perfectly aware my feet aren’t pretty, and I don’t need a diagnosis telling me what I already know. Frankly, I think you’re trying to bully me into something I don’t want. I’m not a child. I’m leaving. I'll just stick to elevating them, thank you very much. And I suggest you find a patient who wants to be examined. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. If that is your wish. I would, however, strongly recommend a podiatry consultation for a more thorough evaluation. You may want to reconsider. Regardless, I wish you the best. .
