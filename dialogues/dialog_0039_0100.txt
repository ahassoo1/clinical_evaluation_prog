DOCTOR: Hello, Lytisha. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think? Honestly, things are a little fuzzy these days. I'm here for… a test, right? Something about making sure I'm alright? My memory isn’t what it used to be. It was the paperwork… I filled something out, but I don't quite recall all the details. Something about drugs, I think?
DOCTOR: Yes, the paperwork. That’s alright, it happens. It’s very common. We’re just going to talk through things, and don’t worry if you can’t remember everything perfectly. We can take our time. You mentioned a test… and something about drugs?
PATIENT: Right, right. A drug test. Yes. I… well, I work with heavy machinery, you see? Paving and all that. It’s just… routine, I suppose? To make sure I’m safe on the job. Though, honestly, I don’t remember why they specifically needed it now. It just seemed important, the letter said. Is it… is it something I should be worried about? My husband… he always took care of things like this. Now… it’s all a bit much.
DOCTOR: Okay, routine drug screening for your work with heavy machinery. That makes sense. No, it’s not necessarily something to be worried about, especially if you haven’t been taking anything you shouldn’t. It’s just a standard procedure for safety, as you said. Now, to clarify a little… do you currently take any medications – even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I used to take something for my arthritis, but… that was a while ago. My husband, again, he handled the pills. Now, I think… maybe just a multivitamin sometimes? When I remember. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I don’t really keep track, you see? It feels like a lifetime ago since I worried about things like that. Do I need to remember exactly what I take?
DOCTOR: It’s okay if you don’t remember exactly. We can work with what you do recall. Knowing about anything you take, even occasionally, helps us make sure there aren’t any interactions with other things, or explain any unexpected results. So, a multivitamin sometimes… and arthritis medication in the past. That's helpful. Now, besides medications, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmmm… not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little sniffly when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that’s everyone, isn't it? I don’t think I’ve ever had a proper allergy, like to… food or anything like that. My husband always said I had a strong constitution. He was very particular about what I ate, though… everything had to be just so. It feels like a lifetime ago. Is this important? Are we getting to the test now?
DOCTOR: It is important to check, but it sounds like you likely don't have any significant allergies. Just confirming. And yes, we are getting closer to the test. Before we do, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, just to get a better picture of your overall health. Now, have you been feeling unwell recently?
PATIENT: Unwell… Well, I'm always a little tired, you know? Being my age… and, well, without Harold… it takes a lot out of you. But nothing specific. No cough, no fever, no aches… just… tired. And a bit forgetful, of course. But that's just… me, these days. I suppose I'm as well as can be expected, considering. Is being tired a reason for concern?
DOCTOR: No, being tired isn’t necessarily a reason for concern, especially given your age and recent loss. It's very common to feel that way. And the forgetfulness, as you said, is something we’ve already discussed. To get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… that's… a long story. Harold always kept track of all that. I had… something with my gallbladder, years ago. They took it out. And arthritis, as I mentioned. I used to see a specialist for that. But honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I went to the doctor regularly with Harold, you see? Now… I mostly just see him when something feels really wrong. I can’t really remember all the details. Is it important to know exactly what I’ve had? It was so long ago…
DOCTOR: No, it’s not about knowing exactly everything. Just getting a general idea is helpful. So, gallbladder removal and arthritis in the past. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think… Harold had a knee replacement, I remember that clearly. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy, a long time ago. Before we were married, I think? Yes, that’s it. Just those two, as far as I can recall. It’s all so long ago, you see? It feels like a different lifetime. Everything was so much easier when Harold was here to remember things… He always knew all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, hysterectomy in the past, and your husband had a knee replacement. That’s helpful to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Harold was my whole family, really. I had a sister, but we… we didn’t speak much towards the end. She moved away a long time ago, and we just… drifted apart. I don’t know anything about her health, or her children. She had two, I think? Boys. I haven’t seen them since they were little. It’s a long story. And… he never really liked my sister, Harold, so… we didn’t talk about her much. Is this important for the test, Doctor? It feels like we’re getting very far afield…
DOCTOR: It's alright, Lytisha. We're just gathering information. Family history can sometimes be helpful, but it's okay that you don't have much to share. We can move on if you prefer. Now, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Harold always said it was terrible for your health, and I listened to him. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. He was a bit of a worrier, Harold, always looking out for me. He would have been very pleased to hear me say that. He hated smoking. Is he needing a test too? Or are we still talking about me? I get so confused sometimes…
DOCTOR: We're still talking about you, Lytisha. It’s alright to get confused. We're just making sure everything is alright with your health today. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Harold liked a glass of wine too. It helped us relax, you see? Nothing heavy, just a small glass. Maybe a couple on special occasions. It’s been… less since Harold passed, though. I don’t really enjoy it as much on my own. It reminds me too much of him. Is that important? Should I stop? It doesn’t really bother me, but I’m happy to if it’s best…
DOCTOR: No, a glass of wine with dinner occasionally is perfectly fine. No need to stop. Just good to know. Now, one last thing before we get to the test. Are you currently taking any vitamins or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Vitamins… oh, I think I have some multivitamins in the cupboard. But I don't take them regularly, honestly. Sometimes I remember, sometimes I don't. And herbal supplements… no, I don't think so. Harold wasn't really one for those sorts of things. He preferred a good, healthy diet. Unless… did he sneak something in? He did like trying new things… But I honestly can't remember. It was so long ago. Is this all important? Are we almost done? I'm starting to feel a bit tired again.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’re almost done. It’s alright that you don’t remember exactly. We've gathered enough information for now. So, to recap, you had a gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy in the past, a husband who had a knee replacement, you don’t smoke, you have a glass of wine occasionally, and you take multivitamins sometimes. You're currently feeling tired and a bit forgetful, and you have some sadness over the loss of your husband. Now, about the drug test… it’s a routine urine test to screen for certain substances. Do you have any concerns about taking the test?
PATIENT: A urine test… oh, right. The drugs. No, no concerns. I haven't taken anything… well, not anything that would show up on a test. I just don’t understand why they need it, really. I work hard, I’m careful, I’ve always been a good employee. It just seems like a lot of bother, to be honest. But if they need it, I suppose I’ll do it. Where do I go? And what exactly will they be looking for? It's all a bit… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lytisha. It can feel unsettling. Your employer likely requires it as a safety precaution for operating heavy machinery, as you mentioned. It’s standard practice, and it doesn’t mean they don't trust you. The test screens for substances that could impair your ability to work safely, things like illegal drugs or certain prescription medications that could cause drowsiness or affect your judgement. There's a restroom just down the hall. I'll give you a collection cup and instructions. It's a private process, and the results will be sent to your employer. It's just a simple urine sample, nothing to worry about. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: A simple urine sample… alright. No questions, I suppose. Just… it all feels a bit strange. And… is there any chance it could be a mistake? That it could show something that isn't there? I’ve always been very careful. I just want to make sure everything is alright. And get back to work. This is all taking up a lot of my time… Do I need to wait for you after, or can I just go straight home?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about a potential mistake. It’s rare, but it can happen. If the results are unexpected, there is a process for further testing to confirm the accuracy. We can discuss that if it becomes necessary. You don't need to wait for me after, you can go straight home. I'll review the results when they come in and contact you if there are any concerns. Here is the collection cup and instructions. Take your time, and please let the nurse at the front desk know if you have any difficulties. Do you feel comfortable proceeding with the test now?
PATIENT: Alright… yes, I suppose so. I just want to get this over with. It's all a bit overwhelming, honestly. Thank you, Doctor. .
