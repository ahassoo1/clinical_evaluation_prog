DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this…problem. It’s been going on for weeks now, and nothing seems to help. It's just…constant. And embarrassing, frankly. I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: "Constant" and "embarrassing"… right. Well, let's get to the bottom of it. Can you be more specific about the problem?
PATIENT: Look, do I have to go into detail? It’s…diarrhea. Okay? Severe diarrhea. And I’ve tried everything the drugstore sells. Pepto, Imodium, all that stuff. Nothing stops it. It’s just…flowing. And it's been happening for, like, three weeks. Three weeks of this! I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Three weeks of severe diarrhea, despite over-the-counter remedies. Alright. And you said "flowing"—is that frequent?
PATIENT: Frequent? Yes, it’s frequent! Like, more than normal. A lot. I don’t even want to leave the house, which is a problem because I have jobs to get to. It’s not like I can just…stay here. I paint houses, you know? It's not exactly a job you can do remotely when you're glued to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Right. Painting houses. And is there anything else accompanying this?
PATIENT: Accompanying? What do you mean? Like, am I feeling sick otherwise? Not really. Just…weak, I guess, from not being able to eat properly. And tired. Mostly just annoyed. It’s exhausting, constantly worrying about where the nearest bathroom is. It's not a glamorous life, you know?
DOCTOR: No fever, no chills, no nausea or vomiting, just weakness and fatigue related to the diarrhea. Any abdominal pain or cramping associated with it?
PATIENT: Some cramping, yes. Not horrible pain, but uncomfortable. Like, a dull ache that just…doesn’t go away. Especially before…well, you know. It comes and goes. Honestly, I’m not one to complain, but this is really interfering with my work. It’s costing me money.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Really? Do I look like I enjoy talking about this? Yes, sometimes there’s…blood. Not a lot, but enough to make me worry. And, yeah, sometimes mucus too. It's disgusting, honestly. Is that serious? Is that why I'm still sick? I just want a solution.
DOCTOR: Blood and mucus are…concerning, Ms. Woodring. Let's perform a quick physical exam, and then we'll discuss some possible causes and testing. Do you mind if I listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness?
PATIENT: Look, I guess. But don’t take all day. I have a job to get to this afternoon. And please be gentle. I don’t need any extra discomfort right now. Honestly, the whole thing is just…humiliating. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: It will be a brief examination, Ms. Woodring. I understand your discomfort, and I will be as efficient as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen in four quadrants, and then gently palpate to check for tenderness. Please let me know if anything is particularly painful. Normal bowel sounds…though slightly hyperactive. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain. Starting here, on your right lower quadrant…
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just…do it quickly. Ow! There. That hurts. Not terribly, but…yeah. That’s uncomfortable. A little lower, to the left too. It's…a dull ache, but definitely there. Honestly, it feels like everything hurts right now. Is this going to lead to anything useful, or are we just establishing that I’m miserable?
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation in the right and left lower quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Alright. Based on your symptoms and the brief exam, this could be a number of things. We need to rule out some infections, and possibly consider inflammatory bowel disease. I’m going to order a stool sample for analysis—to check for bacteria, parasites, and inflammation. I’ll also order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to assess for dehydration and any signs of anemia. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. I don’t like taking pills, if that matters. Honestly, I just want to know if this is something serious. Is it something I need to worry about? I have a life to live, you know? I can’t just sit around waiting for this to…go away. And what about work? I’m going to lose money if I can’t paint.
DOCTOR: It's reasonable to be concerned, Ms. Woodring. The presence of blood and mucus, along with the duration of your symptoms, warrants investigation. While it's unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, we need to determine the cause to ensure you receive appropriate treatment. The tests will help us differentiate between infectious causes, such as bacterial or parasitic infections, and inflammatory conditions like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. I’m going to write you a referral to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Lee, for a colonoscopy if the initial tests are inconclusive. A colonoscopy will allow for a direct visualization of your colon and rectum to identify any abnormalities. In the meantime, I'll prescribe you a short course of loperamide to help manage the diarrhea, but I want you to be aware it’s just symptomatic relief. It won’t address the underlying cause. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Seriously? You want to…look inside me? No. Absolutely not. That sounds…awful. I don't like the sound of that at all. And I really don't want to take any more pills, even if it's just for a few days. Honestly, I think I'd rather just deal with it than go through all that. Is there anything else I can do? Some kind of…natural remedy? I've heard things. I don't want to be poked and prodded and have someone…look at my insides. It's ridiculous. And who’s going to pay for all this?
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, while I understand your hesitation, a colonoscopy is often the most effective way to diagnose the cause of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms like yours. I respect your autonomy, but I strongly advise against declining it without a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits. As for “natural remedies”, they are rarely effective for conditions like this and can sometimes be harmful. However, I can order the stool sample and blood work as you requested. If the results are significant, I will strongly encourage you to reconsider the referral to Dr. Lee. As for costs, your insurance should cover most of the expenses, but you may have a copay or deductible. Our billing department can provide you with a detailed cost estimate. I will write the orders now. I also recommend staying well-hydrated and following a bland diet—avoiding fatty, greasy, or spicy foods. Do you have any questions before I proceed?
