DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… this weakness. It’s getting harder to do things, you see? Not all at once, but little by little, everything feels… heavier. It started in my legs, I think, but now my hands feel it too sometimes. It’s… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Astores. A gradual onset of weakness is certainly something we want to investigate. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention. To help me understand a little better, could you tell me when you first noticed this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It wasn’t a sudden thing, you understand. Maybe… six months ago? No, longer. Perhaps eight, nine months? It was just… a little harder to get up from the chair. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it hasn’t gone away, and now it’s more.
DOCTOR: Eight or nine months ago, starting with difficulty getting up from a chair. That’s helpful to know. And you said it’s gradually gotten worse since then. Can you describe how it’s gotten worse?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not just getting up. It’s… holding things. Like a cup of tea. Sometimes my hand shakes a little, and I worry I’ll spill it. And walking… I don’t fall, but I feel like I have to think about each step more. It used to be… natural, you see? Now, it takes effort. A lot of effort sometimes.
DOCTOR: So, increased difficulty with both legs and hands – holding objects, walking, and a feeling of needing to consciously focus on each step. That's important information. Have you noticed any pain associated with this weakness, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain. Not really. It’s not a hurting feeling. It’s more… tired. Like my muscles are always worn out. Even when I’ve been resting. That’s the strange part, you see? Tired, but no pain. Sometimes a little… numb, maybe, in my feet, but not always.
DOCTOR: Fatigue without pain, and some intermittent numbness in your feet. Okay. Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in your balance, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: Balance… hmm. Not falling, like I said. But… I feel a little unsteady sometimes. Especially when I turn my head quickly. It’s not a big wobble, but enough to make me hold onto something. Like the kitchen counter. My wife noticed it too, she says I’m a little more careful now, reaching for things.
DOCTOR: So, some unsteadiness, particularly with quick head movements, and your wife has noticed you being more cautious. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I'm going to ask you some questions about other areas of your health, if that's alright. Have you noticed any difficulty with your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision… Well, now that you mention it… things seem a little blurry sometimes. Not all the time, and I thought it was just my old glasses. I haven’t had them checked in a while, maybe that’s it. But yes, a little blurry, especially when I’m tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision, potentially related to your glasses. We can certainly take a look at that as well. Now, have you had any difficulty with swallowing, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: Swallowing… no, not really. I haven’t had any trouble with that, thank goodness. Everything goes down alright. I eat my fish and taro like always.
DOCTOR: Good, that's reassuring. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: Well, I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been alright since. Other than that… nothing much. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, you know? My wife does all the remembering of the details, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which is currently managed with medication. That’s good to know. Do you recall the name of that medication, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. It’s a little white pill… I think it starts with an “A”? No, maybe a “B”? My wife knows for sure. I’m sorry, Doctor, I can’t quite remember. It's been a long time, and I take a few different pills.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Astores. We can easily look that up in your records. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my arm playing rugby. But other than that, no, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and a broken arm in the past. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes, I take something for my joints, for the aches and pains. And sometimes a little something to help me sleep. My wife gets them for me. I don’t know the names, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, something for your joints and something to help with sleep. We'll definitely take a closer look at those. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, take anything… well, almost anything. Never had a problem with that.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had trouble with her heart when she got older. And my brother… he had some trouble walking, like me, but it wasn’t quite the same. He went to see doctors in Honolulu, but I don’t know what they said. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble and a brother with walking difficulties. That’s helpful to know. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I used to be very active. Played rugby for many years. But now… I mostly take it easy. I like to garden, when the weather is nice. And I enjoy spending time with my family. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little bit of beer sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. So, you're a former rugby player, enjoy gardening, and don't smoke. You drink alcohol in moderation. Now, Mr. Astores, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I’m an old man, you know, things creak a little.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Astores. We'll take things slowly and gently. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: There you go, Doctor. Is that alright? Anything I can do differently?
DOCTOR: That’s good, thank you. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning at this stage, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 86. We may need to adjust your medication if this continues. Now, I’m going to check your pulse. Your pulse is 72, which is normal. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. Everything looks alright there, although I notice some mild cataracts developing in both eyes. That's very common with age. Now, I want to assess your strength and reflexes. Could you please extend your arms straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It feels a little… heavy, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, like that. And now, try to push against my hands. Okay, a little weakness there. Now, let's try your legs. Could you please try to lift each leg up while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: This is harder, Doctor. It feels like I’m pushing through water. It’s not a sharp pain, just… heavy and slow.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Some difficulty there as well. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon with age, but we’ll want to investigate the cause further. Now, I want to check your balance. Could you please stand up and try to balance on one foot for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s… tricky, Doctor. I need to hold onto something, I think. My balance isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Some difficulty with balance. Alright, Mr. Astores, that completes the physical exam for now. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, I’m concerned about possible neuropathy, which is nerve damage, or a possible early sign of Parkinson's disease. However, we need further testing to confirm. I would like to order some blood tests and an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Neuropathy? Parkinson’s? Oh dear. Those sound… serious, Doctor. Blood tests and an MRI… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. But… will it be painful? And how long will it take?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Astores. It’s good that we’re investigating this now. The blood tests are relatively straightforward, just a simple sample taken from your arm. The MRI is non-invasive, meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or incisions. You’ll lie inside a large machine, and it uses magnetic fields to create detailed images of your brain. It can be a little noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-40 minutes, but it’s not painful. We’ll schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning, and the MRI can be arranged for later next week. We’ll contact you with specific times and instructions. While we wait for the results, I would recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and continuing to take your medications as prescribed. I also want to refer you to a neurologist, a specialist in nerve and brain disorders, for a more detailed evaluation once we have the results from the tests. Would you like me to arrange that for you?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable, Doctor. No strenuous activity, blood tests, MRI… yes, alright. And a neurologist… yes, please. That sounds wise. I trust your judgment. Will… will I be able to drive? After the MRI?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Astores. For the MRI itself, you shouldn’t have any restrictions. However, depending on the results of the tests and the neurologist’s evaluation, they may advise against driving temporarily. We’ll have a clearer understanding after the neurologist’s consultation. It’s best to err on the side of caution. In the meantime, could you arrange for someone to drive you to and from the MRI appointment?
PATIENT: Yes, I can ask my daughter. She lives nearby, she’s very helpful. Doctor… is this… is this something serious? Will I… will I need a wheelchair?
DOCTOR: Mr. Astores, it’s too early to say definitively whether this is something serious. The symptoms you're experiencing – the weakness, the balance issues – could be due to a number of things, and we need the test results to get a clearer picture. It’s important not to jump to conclusions. Regarding the wheelchair, that is certainly not something we’re considering at this point. We’re investigating this now to understand the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan. We’ll work together, step by step, to manage this and maintain your quality of life. I want to reassure you that we’re taking this seriously, and we’ll do everything we can to help you. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I trust your judgment, and I’m grateful for your help. Thank you, Doctor Chagaris.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We’ll schedule the blood tests and MRI as soon as possible and get you in to see the neurologist. Here's a summary of our plan: 1. Blood tests tomorrow morning. 2. MRI of the brain next week. 3. Referral to a neurologist for evaluation after we have the test results. I will have my nurse schedule those appointments for you. In the meantime, please take it easy and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you need a ride back home, or have you already made arrangements?
PATIENT: My daughter is picking me up. She should be here any minute now. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I feel a little better now, knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s good to hear, Mr. Astores. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and I’ll see you tomorrow for the blood tests.
PATIENT: .
