DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Secondi. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, it's my pee. It's… orange. I noticed it a couple days ago. Not all the time, but… yeah, orange. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine. That’s good you brought it up. It can be a sign of a few different things, so we’ll figure out what’s going on. First, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More like… how orange? Is it dark orange, like… juice? Or just a little bit different than normal? And is it always orange, or just sometimes? I try to drink a lot of water, you know? Maybe that helps? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So it's not consistently a dark, juice-like orange, which is good. More intermittent, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, intermittent. Not every time. Sometimes it’s normal color, sometimes… like, a lighter orange. Like, you know, when you drink a lot of carrot juice, but not that bright. And I haven’t had carrot juice, actually. I don’t really like it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. And you mentioned you drink a good amount of water – that’s good. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Nothing like that. It just… looks funny. And I worry. My wife, she said to come see you. She’s always right about these things. No burning, no hurting, just… the color.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain or burning is good. Have you noticed any changes in how often you're urinating, or the amount you're passing?
PATIENT: No, not really. Same as always, I think. Maybe… a little more, because I’m trying to drink more water, but that’s just me trying to be healthy. Not like, a big change. Normal, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. No fever. No stomach pain. I’m a little tired, but I work long hours, you know? Engineering… it’s hard work. Maybe just tired from that. Nothing else I can think of. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no stomach pain, just general tiredness from work. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m pretty healthy. I had the flu a couple of times, but that’s it. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. Just… normal stuff. I try to eat right, exercise when I can. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had one. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but they just put it in a cast. Nothing serious. No cutting or anything like that. Just the cast. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father, he had some problems with his knees when he got older. Nothing… terrible. They’re both okay now, mostly. Nothing that I… inherited, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just water and… trying to eat good food. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a long time ago. Too many chemicals, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Last question for now: Do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can eat anything. No problems with pollen, no food allergies, nothing like that. My wife makes me try new things all the time, and I haven’t had a reaction yet. So, no allergies. I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen, just to make sure everything sounds normal. Then I'll check your reflexes and take your blood pressure. It shouldn’t take long. Sounds good. Bowel sounds are normal. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s within a normal range. Now, I'm going to take a quick look at a urine sample. Can you please provide a sample for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There’s a bathroom right there. I’ll go do that now. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Take your time.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. Sorry if it took a minute.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, let me just run a quick dipstick test on this. It will give us a basic idea of what's going on. Okay… the results are showing slightly elevated urobilinogen and a trace of blood, but everything else looks normal. The color is definitely orange. Now, elevated urobilinogen and trace blood with the orange color…it could be a number of things, but it's often related to dehydration, certain medications, or even some foods. It could also be a sign of a mild liver issue, though it’s less likely given your other symptoms, or lack thereof. I’d like to order a full metabolic panel and a liver function test to get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. A full test… is it expensive? I have insurance, but… my wife and I, we’re trying to save for a trip.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question. It shouldn’t be too expensive with your insurance, but I can have the billing department give you an estimate before we proceed, so you know exactly what to expect. We can also discuss the results as they come in, and prioritize further testing if needed. For now, let’s get the blood work ordered. I’m also going to recommend increasing your water intake even further for the next few days. And if you notice any changes – like pain, fever, or changes in your bowel movements – please call us right away. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you. Water, more water. And call if anything changes. I’ll remember that. And the estimate from billing… that would be very helpful. Thank you again for your help. I feel a little better just knowing what we're looking at now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Secondi. I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. I'll have the lab order sent over immediately, and the billing department will contact you with an estimate. We'll get these results back as quickly as possible, usually within a couple of days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then, or I can give you a call if you prefer. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. Thank you again for your time and your help. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Secondi. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day. .
