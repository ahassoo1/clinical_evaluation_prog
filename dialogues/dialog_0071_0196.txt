DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Janie. I'm Dr. Galena. Welcome to the clinic. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…well, I’m just so tired. Always tired. It’s been going on… a long time, I think. Honestly, the days kinda blur together. Chronic fatigue, that’s what someone told me to mention. Is that right? I just… want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Chronic fatigue… yes, that's a good starting point. It is frustrating when things just… blur. Alright. “A long time” is… helpful, but perhaps we can narrow it down a little?
PATIENT: Ugh, narrowing it down… Maybe… after my husband passed? It got worse then, definitely. Before that, I was just… regular tired, you know? Like after a long day at work. Now… now it’s like I never get enough sleep, even when I do. Does that make sense? I work at the pharmacy, still. But even getting through that is… a struggle.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense. And I'm very sorry for your loss… that's a significant life event, and it’s common for things to change after something like that. So, it's been consistently worse since your husband passed?
PATIENT: Yes, consistently. I don’t even remember what it felt like before. It’s… everything. Just everything feels harder. Getting out of bed, making food… even talking sometimes. And I just feel… foggy. Like my brain isn’t working right. I keep forgetting things, too. Little things mostly, but… it’s worrying. It's just… exhausting, Doctor. Truly exhausting.
DOCTOR: “Foggy” is a good way to describe it. And exhaustion, yes, I understand. Alright, Janie. Just to get a clearer picture, let’s talk a bit more about these symptoms. Aside from the tiredness and brain fog, are you experiencing any other physical changes?
PATIENT: Physical changes… Hmm. Well, I’ve been getting headaches more often. Not terrible, just… there. And… I think I’ve gained a little weight? My clothes feel tighter, but I haven’t really… weighed myself lately. I don’t really pay attention to that stuff anymore, to be honest. Does that count? And…sometimes my muscles ache, like I’ve been working out, but I haven’t. I just feel…old, I guess. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s all helpful, Janie, thank you. Headaches, weight gain, muscle aches… those could all be related. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… It comes and goes, really. Some days I could eat a horse, and other days I just can’t stomach anything. It’s very… unpredictable. I mostly just eat whatever is easiest, to be honest. Soup, toast… things like that. I don't have much energy to cook. It's better than nothing, I suppose. Is that…normal? I don’t even remember what a normal appetite feels like anymore.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable appetite is certainly common with chronic fatigue and can be part of the overall picture. Okay, Janie, just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits…? Oh. Well, um… everything is a little… off, I suppose. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… not. It’s very irregular. I haven't really… talked to anyone about it before. Is that important? I feel like I'm just listing all my problems now. Sorry.
DOCTOR: You're not listing problems, Janie, you're providing information, and it is important. Changes in bowel habits can tell us a lot. And don't apologize – it’s my job to listen. Alright. Now, what about sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… Oh, sleep. I go to bed at a reasonable hour, usually. But I wake up a lot during the night. Sometimes I can’t get back to sleep for hours. And even when I do sleep, I don’t feel rested. I just… toss and turn. And sometimes I have… strange dreams. Not nightmares, just… odd. I feel even more tired when I wake up than when I went to bed, if that makes sense. It’s… frustrating. Truly frustrating. And I get these… hot flashes sometimes, at night, mostly. Is that…normal for someone my age? I don’t even know anymore. .
DOCTOR: Alright, waking up frequently, unrefreshing sleep, odd dreams, hot flashes… that's all very helpful, Janie. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot for quite some time. Okay, I think it’s time to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be alright?
