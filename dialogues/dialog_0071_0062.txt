DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I am here regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the requirements for wearing masks, and…well, a possible need for an exemption. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and it’s been…difficult adjusting.
DOCTOR: Protective Service Worker…right. Difficult adjusting… can you elaborate on that for me, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not that I disagree with the idea of keeping everyone safe, Doctor. Not at all. It's just…the masks themselves cause me some trouble. Specifically, I find it very hard to breathe comfortably while wearing one for extended periods, and it impacts my ability to do my job effectively. I need to be able to react quickly, and the feeling of restriction makes that hard. It also…well, it makes me anxious, truthfully. I hadn't experienced that before, and it's concerning.
DOCTOR: Anxiety… okay. And how long have you been experiencing this difficulty, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: It began roughly three months ago, Doctor, when the mask policy became firm. At first, I thought it was just something I needed to get used to. I tried different types, looser fits, tighter fits… nothing seemed to help. The anxiety grew along with the discomfort. It’s been steadily worsening each week, truthfully. I'm worried about the impact it will have on my performance, and more importantly, on the people I serve.
DOCTOR: Three months… alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the difficulty breathing and anxiety?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Hmm… well, I’ve been a bit more fatigued than usual, yes. And I’ve noticed some… a sort of lightheadedness sometimes, particularly after being in stressful situations while wearing a mask. Nothing severe, mind you, but noticeable. I've also had trouble sleeping a few nights, mostly because I'm worrying about wearing it the next day. I haven't seen a doctor about these things specifically, I wanted to discuss the mask issue first.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, lightheadedness, trouble sleeping… okay. And have you had any prior history of lung problems, asthma, or anxiety issues, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I've been remarkably healthy my entire life, truthfully. I’ve never been diagnosed with any lung conditions, and I’ve never experienced any significant anxiety before this. It’s quite a surprise to me, I assure you. I’ve always been a rather calm individual. This seems directly related to the mask requirement. I’ve never felt this way before, and I can’t find any other explanation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, I want to be thorough. Have you had a recent COVID test, just to rule that out as a possible contributor to any breathing difficulties?
PATIENT: That is very thoughtful of you, Doctor. Yes, I had one about a month ago, just as a precaution. It came back negative. My employer required it for all staff, thankfully. I can provide documentation of that if you'd like. I always make sure to follow all guidelines, of course, but this feeling...it's not like being ill, it's more like a restriction, a panic.
DOCTOR: Negative test, good. Okay, Mr. Knabenshue, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. It'll just be a few minutes, alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I'm happy to cooperate in any way that might help. Please, proceed at your own pace. I trust your expertise, and I want to be sure we cover everything thoroughly. I'll just… relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out… again… good. Lungs sound clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles detected. Pulse is a bit elevated, 88 beats per minute. Blood pressure is 140/90. Reflexes are normal. Balance appears stable. No obvious neurological deficits detected. Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Everything appears normal on initial examination, but the elevated pulse could be related to the anxiety, or the recent stress you've been experiencing.
PATIENT: That's…reassuring, Doctor, to hear my lungs are clear. I appreciate the thoroughness. I understand the pulse elevation could be anxiety-related. I do tend to feel anxious in stressful situations, and this mask…well, it is stressful. I'm glad there aren't any obvious physical causes detected. What are our options from here, Doctor? I'm hoping to find a solution that allows me to continue my work safely and effectively. Is an exemption possible?
DOCTOR: An exemption is possible, Mr. Knabenshue, but it requires documentation. Given your negative COVID test and normal lung exam, we'll need to rule out any underlying conditions contributing to your anxiety and breathing difficulties. I'm thinking a basic blood panel to check for anemia or thyroid issues, and possibly an EKG to rule out any cardiac concerns. Also, I’d recommend a consultation with a mental health professional to assess the level of anxiety and determine appropriate coping mechanisms. Would you be amenable to those tests and consultation?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need for thoroughness and want to provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision. I’m happy to undergo the blood panel and EKG, and I have no objection to seeing a mental health professional. I'm willing to do whatever is necessary to address this situation. When can we schedule those tests, Doctor? I'd like to resolve this as quickly as possible. It’s starting to impact my work, and that is concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can get the blood work and EKG scheduled for tomorrow morning, first thing. I'll send the orders to the lab. And I’ll have my assistant schedule you an appointment with Dr. Anya Sharma, a mental health specialist. She has good experience with workplace anxiety. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds excellent, Doctor. Tomorrow morning works perfectly. And Dr. Sharma sounds very capable. Please, proceed with scheduling those appointments. I appreciate your thoroughness and willingness to help. It puts my mind at ease knowing we are taking a systematic approach to this problem. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? Should I avoid anything before the blood work, for example?
DOCTOR: Just fast for eight hours before the blood work, nothing to eat or drink except water. And for the EKG, just wear comfortable clothing. No need to do anything special otherwise. I'll also have my assistant provide you with a form to complete detailing your symptoms and concerns. It’ll help Dr. Sharma prepare for your consultation. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is perfectly clear. Eight hours fast, comfortable clothing, and a symptom form. I believe that covers everything. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, and for scheduling the appointments so quickly. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I feel much more confident now, knowing we have a plan of action. I truly do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. We’ll get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, try to manage your stress as best you can. Deep breathing exercises and mindfulness techniques can be helpful. If your symptoms worsen significantly before your appointments, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We will follow up with you after you see Dr. Sharma and have the test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. I will certainly attempt the breathing exercises, and I will keep your office informed if anything changes. Thank you again for your kindness and professionalism. I appreciate your willingness to help me navigate this difficult situation. I believe that's all I need for today. Have a good afternoon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. We’ll do our best to help. You have a good afternoon as well. And please, don’t hesitate to call if anything concerns you. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will certainly keep that in mind. Goodbye.
