DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know more about where my people come from, long time ago. My grandkids, they ask me, and I… I don’t really know what to tell them. I heard about tests now… DNA tests, to find out. That’s what I want to ask about.
DOCTOR: I see. You’re interested in learning more about your ancestry and potentially using DNA testing to explore your family history. That’s a very common request, Mr. Scobie, and a worthwhile pursuit. Before we discuss the tests themselves, let’s talk a little bit about your background, if you don't mind. Knowing more about your family’s history as you know it can be helpful in interpreting any results we might get. Could you tell me a little about where you and your family have lived for the past few generations?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Well, I was born on Majuro, that’s one of the big islands in the Marshall Islands. My mama and papa, they were born there too. And their mama and papa… same thing. Always Majuro. My people, we always been on the islands. Fishing, building things… wood things. I make models now, little boats, little houses. That's what we do. Not much traveling, you know? Just stay on Majuro. Some went to America, I think, after the war. But not my family, not right away.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Scobie. It's good to have that context. So, several generations of your family have lived on Majuro in the Marshall Islands, with some potentially migrating to America after the war. That's very helpful. Now, regarding these DNA tests, there are several companies that offer them. They analyze your DNA and can estimate your ethnic origins and potentially connect you with relatives who have also taken the test. However, it’s important to understand their limitations. The accuracy can vary depending on the company and the specific regions being tested. Additionally, ancestry tests primarily trace maternal and paternal lineages, and results are estimates, not definitive answers. Do you have any allergies or medical conditions I should be aware of before we consider proceeding with any testing?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I eat everything. Old man food, mostly. Fish, coconut, breadfruit… nothing fancy. And no, I don’t have any sickness. Just old. My back gets a little sore sometimes when I bend down too long for the wood work, but that’s it. No doctor stuff. Medicare takes care of the little things, you know? You think these tests are okay for an old man like me?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Scobie. No known allergies or major medical concerns is excellent. And yes, absolutely, these tests are generally safe for people of all ages, including someone as young at heart as yourself. They usually involve a simple saliva sample, collected either at home or here in the clinic. Just to be thorough, let’s quickly go over your current medications, if any. Are you taking any vitamins, supplements, or prescription drugs regularly?
PATIENT: No pills, Doctor. Never been much for taking medicine. I take a little coconut oil sometimes for my skin, keeps it from getting too dry in the sun, but that’s it. And maybe a little turmeric in my food, my daughter sends it from America. She says it’s good for everything. But no doctor pills. Just old man stuff. I just want to know about my people, Doctor. Is that hard to do?
DOCTOR: No pills, that's good to know. You simply want to learn more about your ancestry, and you're hoping DNA testing might help. That's perfectly reasonable, Mr. Scobie. The process itself isn't hard, but interpreting the results can be a little complex, as I mentioned. There are many factors to consider. Before we proceed, I'd like to do a brief physical exam just to get a baseline assessment. It’s standard procedure, and it will help us ensure there are no underlying health conditions that might affect how you perceive the information from the tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A little check-up? Yes, okay. That’s good. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time, I think. Just making sure I’m not too broken for the tests, right? Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. My grandkids will be happy to hear I’m looking after myself!
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mr. Scobie, just making sure everything is as it should be. It’s a quick check. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please remove your shirt and shoes, and have a seat here?
PATIENT: Okay. Careful now, Doctor, I don't want to fall over! Old bones, you know? Just tell me when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Scobie. And don’t worry, I’ll be right here. Your blood pressure is 145/90. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your age and a little bit of exam room anxiety, perhaps. We can monitor that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another… that’s good. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing. Do you have any history of asthma or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Wheezing? No, never. Not asthma. I used to swim a lot when I was younger, out in the lagoon. Good for the lungs, you know? Maybe it’s just… old air. The air here isn’t as good as it used to be. We used to have more trees. Just a little cough sometimes, especially when the wind is blowing. Nothing much. I’m a fisherman, Doctor, not a fancy swimmer anymore!
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Mr. Scobie. It could very well be related to the air quality or simply be a normal finding with age. We'll keep it in mind. Now, I'd like to quickly check your reflexes and your strength in your arms and legs. Could you please extend your arms out in front of you?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Be careful now, Doctor! Don’t want to fall off the table. Old man muscles, you know? Not as strong as they used to be. Still can hold a fishing line though! Best hands on Majuro, I tell you!
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Your grip strength is a bit weak, but adequate for daily activities. Finally, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your ears are clear, but your throat looks a little dry. Alright, Mr. Scobie, that completes the basic physical exam. Overall, you seem to be in stable condition for your age. There are a few minor findings, which we'll keep an eye on. Now, do you have any questions for me before we discuss the DNA testing options?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You checked me good. Just… the DNA tests. What kind are there? Which one will tell me the most about my people? Which one will make my grandkids happy? That’s all I really want, Doctor. To know where I come from, and to tell my grandkids a good story.
DOCTOR: That's a wonderful goal, Mr. Scobie, and a perfectly valid reason to consider these tests. There are several companies that offer ancestry DNA testing, the most popular being AncestryDNA, 23andMe, and MyHeritage DNA. AncestryDNA has the largest database, which means it's more likely to connect you with relatives and provide a more detailed ethnic breakdown. 23andMe also provides ethnicity estimates, but it also includes health reports, which you may or may not be interested in. MyHeritage DNA focuses on European ancestry, so it may not be the best choice for your Marshallese background. For your situation, I would recommend AncestryDNA. It has a growing database of Pacific Islander DNA, and it's known for its accuracy in connecting people with relatives. They also offer a family tree building tool, which could help you tell a good story to your grandkids. The cost is around $99 for the basic test, and it usually takes a few weeks to get the results. Does that sound like a good option for you, Mr. Scobie?
PATIENT: Ninety-nine dollars? That’s… not too bad. A few weeks, you say? And it will tell me about my people? And help me find family? Yes, Doctor, I think that sounds good. Let’s do the AncestryDNA test. Maybe my grandkids can help me build the tree. That would be nice.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Scobie. That’s a great decision. I’m happy to help you get started. Here is some information about AncestryDNA, including the website address and instructions on how to order the kit. You can do it online, or I can help you if you prefer. It involves a simple saliva sample that you send back in a prepaid envelope. Once you receive the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and see if they reveal anything interesting. Do you have any questions about the process or the results?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I understand. I can order it online, send in the spit, and then we talk later. My daughter, she’s good with the computer. She can help me order it. And then we can all look at the results together. That would be… very nice. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… hopeful now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. It’s wonderful to see you feeling hopeful. I’ll make a note in your chart about the AncestryDNA test, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or need assistance. Here's a printed copy of your exam summary for your records, and I'll see you for a follow-up appointment once you have your results. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Scobie, and enjoy spending time with your grandkids!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Bye now.
