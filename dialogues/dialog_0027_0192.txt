DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I’m here for this… exam. For the army. They want me to get checked out first. Seems like a waste of time, honestly, but rules are rules. Don't see what they need a doctor for, I’ve been building engines since I was a kid. Perfectly healthy, I am.
DOCTOR: Right, the army physical… Yes, I understand. Even those of us who feel perfectly well need to satisfy certain requirements. It's good to be thorough. So, just to confirm, this is a general check-up for enlistment purposes?
PATIENT: Yep. General. That’s it. Just gotta prove I’m… what do they call it? Fit for duty. Seems silly, really. I can lift more than half the guys trying out, probably. And I haven't called in sick in... well, I don't even remember the last time. Don't get colds, don't break bones. Solid as a rock, I am. You got all the forms they sent?
DOCTOR: Yes, I have the forms here. Thank you for bringing them. It’s good to have a baseline of your medical history, even if it’s limited. To start, could you tell me a little more about… any current symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms? Look, I told you, I feel fine. No aches, no pains, no… nothing. I don’t have symptoms. I'm here because they made me come. Seriously, is there a question here or are we just going in circles? I haven't been feeling sick, I’m not coughing, I’m not sneezing... I’m perfectly alright. Do I need to repeat myself?
DOCTOR: No, no, you're perfectly clear. My apologies. It’s just… routine to ask. Sometimes symptoms are subtle. Alright. Let’s try this a different way. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my weight? Look at me! Do I look like I’ve gained or lost weight? I've been the same for… decades. Maybe a pound or two around Christmas, but that’s it. Good Swedish stock, you know. We don't fluctuate. Solid. I haven't been eating different or anything, still got my usual lunch, still got my dinner. It’s not like I've been starving myself or anything. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. Are we getting anywhere with this or...?
DOCTOR: Right, consistent weight. Good. Okay… and how about your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy levels? What kind of a question is that? I build engines all day! That takes energy! I’m up and moving, lifting, tightening, working… all day. I’m not sitting around doing nothing. I could work another ten hours if I had to. I’m not tired, I don’t get fatigued, I get things done. Honestly, I feel like I’m answering a questionnaire for a kindergarten class. Is this what army doctors do all day? Ask silly questions? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. I assure you, I'm not trying to waste your time. It’s just… important to cover all bases. Let's move on then. Any issues with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? What issues could I possibly have with my sleep? I sleep like a log! Eight hours, solid. No tossing, no turning, no… waking up in the middle of the night. I'm out. And I sleep well. I wake up refreshed, ready to go. It’s simple. You go to bed, you close your eyes, you sleep. What’s complicated about that? Honestly, this is starting to feel like you’re looking for something that isn’t there. Are you sure you’re a real doctor? I'm starting to seriously doubt this whole operation.
DOCTOR: Yes, I assure you, I am a doctor. We just need to go through the standard questions. Alright. Let's try something different. Do you have any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Absolutely not. Look, I told you, I'm solid. Like a rock. I don't have aches, I don't have pains, I don't have… anything. I build engines! You think engine building is done sitting still? I'm lifting, I'm bending, I’m stretching all day. If I had pain, I wouldn’t be able to do my job. It’s common sense. I've never broken a bone, never pulled a muscle, never had a serious injury. Seriously, is this all you're going to ask me? Are we done here? I’ve got things to do, you know. This is a complete waste of my afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I understand your frustration. Just to be thorough, let me quickly perform a basic physical examination. It'll only take a few minutes. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… just the basics. Would that be alright?
