DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Firestone, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s my legs, Doctor. They just… gave out on me. It was after a really bad cold, you see. Not just a cold, mind you, a proper one. But now my legs feel like jelly. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I’m a tour guide, you know. Can’t very well show people around if I can’t stand to show them around.
DOCTOR: A cold… and now leg weakness. Hmm. And this happened after the cold cleared?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. The cold itself was… well, it was unpleasant, but manageable. A few days of feeling awful, lots of tea. But then, a couple of days after I started feeling better, I just… couldn't stand up properly. It felt like they wouldn’t hold me. It’s… concerning. I haven’t felt this unsteady in years. And I need to be reliable. People are paying good money, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long ago was this "couple of days after"?
PATIENT: Let me think… the cold really hit me around July 28th, I’d say. So, that would make it… August 1st, yesterday, that I noticed it. It wasn’t instant, mind you. It started as a little wobble, then by this morning… well, I needed help getting out of bed. Honestly, it’s ridiculous. I keep thinking it’s just some lingering effect, but it’s not getting any better.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the weakness, any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… No fever now, thankfully. Not much pain, just a sort of… ache, deep in my thighs. And my feet feel a little tingly, like they’ve been asleep. Though that could just be from sitting around worrying, I suppose. I haven’t noticed anything else… although, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t these days? It’s probably just stress about the tours.
DOCTOR: Tingling in the feet, fatigue… and the weakness. Have you noticed any difficulty with bladder or bowel control?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. That… that sounds dreadful. No, everything is perfectly normal in that department, thank you very much. I wouldn’t be sitting here discussing my legs if that were happening. I mean, really. That’s a very… personal question, Doctor. And quite unnecessary, I think. I just want to know why my legs won't cooperate!
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Firestone. We need to rule things out. Any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Heavens, no. My mother had it, but I've always been very careful with my diet. Lots of fruits, vegetables… well, I do enjoy a sweet now and then, but nothing excessive. I have always been a healthy woman. This is all very unsettling, you know. It’s not like me to be… incapacitated. I pride myself on my independence.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick physical exam. Can you stand for me, please?
PATIENT: Well, I can stand, but not for long, I’m afraid. It’s more of a… precarious wobble than a proper stand. There. See? Not ideal, is it? And please, be careful. I don't want to fall and cause a scene.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are… diminished. Strength in your legs is noticeably weak, particularly in your thighs. Do you feel any numbness or pain when I do this?
PATIENT: There's a bit of a tingling sensation now, yes. Not sharp, just… a sort of coldness. And it’s… uncomfortable, I suppose. Not painful, exactly, but not pleasant either. Really, it feels like my legs aren’t even mine anymore. It’s quite frightening, honestly. Are you sure it’s not just… a vitamin deficiency or something? I do eat quite a lot of fruit, but maybe it's not enough.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be a simple vitamin deficiency given the degree of weakness and diminished reflexes. I'm going to need to order some blood work. Complete blood count, electrolytes, vitamin B12, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. And… I'm also ordering an MRI of your spinal cord. We need to rule out any nerve compression or other structural issues.
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. Is it that bad? I mean, I just had a cold! Are you saying this could be something… permanent? I have tours booked for the next three months! I simply can't afford to be laid up for weeks. This is… quite upsetting. And expensive, I imagine. Is Medicare going to cover all of this?
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, please. I understand your concerns. We are simply being thorough. An MRI will give us a clearer picture of what’s happening. As for the cost, Medicare should cover the majority of it, but you’ll need to verify your coverage with them. I will write you a referral for the MRI, and the lab order for the blood work. The lab is just down the hall. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, avoid any strenuous activity, and if the weakness worsens or you experience any loss of bowel or bladder control, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Though I still think this is all a bit excessive. But fine, I’ll get the tests done. Where exactly is this lab? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a tour scheduled for next week, and I really need to know if I’ll be able to… you know… stand to do it. Honestly, this is ruining my entire summer.
DOCTOR: The lab is right down there, first door on the left. They will take your insurance information, and draw the blood. As for the results, it usually takes a few days for the blood work, and the MRI could take a week or more to schedule and get read by the radiologist. I will have my assistant contact you as soon as we have everything. Try not to worry too much, Ms. Firestone. We’ll figure this out. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… please do hurry. And make sure they don’t lose my insurance card. It’s always a disaster. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. .
