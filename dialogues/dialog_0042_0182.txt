DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Vodzak. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, let’s get this over with. I need a sign-off for… the thing. The surgery. My daughter insisted I come. Says I need clearance. Honestly, it’s probably unnecessary fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, a pre-operative clearance. I understand. Your daughter sounds very thoughtful. Just to be sure I have everything correct, what surgery are you scheduled for, and when is it planned?
PATIENT: It’s… a face lift. And I don't appreciate being called “thoughtful” on her behalf. She means well, I suppose. It’s scheduled for the 15th of August. As soon as possible, really. I’ve already paid a good chunk of money for it. Don’t want that going to waste.
DOCTOR: Of course. August 15th. A facelift. Well, let’s get this clearance sorted out for you, then. I certainly wouldn’t want any financial concerns adding to your stress. To start, can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Health? Fine. As fine as can be expected for an eighty-one-year-old. I still manage the garden, you know. Terrazzo work keeps a man fit, even if I don’t do much of it anymore. Used to be the best in the county. Don’t get sick much. A little arthritis, naturally. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, but who’s is at my age? I've got private insurance, good stuff. Should cover everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Orwin. Staying active with the gardening and terrazzo work is excellent. Arthritis and some changes to your vision are very common, as you said. And good to know you have excellent insurance coverage. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Diagnosed with… hmm. Let me think. The arthritis, obviously. And years ago – must be forty years ago now – I had my gallbladder out. That was a bit unpleasant, but recovered fine. Nothing else that I can recall. I’ve never been one for going to doctors unless absolutely necessary. Waste of time, most of it.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Orwin. Arthritis and a gallbladder removal forty years ago. It sounds like you’ve been quite healthy overall. Did you have any complications with the gallbladder surgery, or a long recovery?
PATIENT: No, no complications. In and out, quick as you please. Different times back then, I suppose. They didn’t fuss about like they do now. A few days in the hospital, a bit of discomfort… but nothing major. I was back to work within a couple of weeks. Terrazzo doesn’t wait for a man to feel sorry for himself.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear it was a straightforward recovery. It sounds like you’re a resilient man, Mr. Orwin. Now, have there been any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I told you, just the gallbladder. And I’m getting rather tired of repeating myself. Are we getting anywhere with this “clearance” or are we just going to sit here all day listing off things that happened decades ago?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask, Mr. Orwin. I apologize if I’m being repetitive. I just want to be thorough for your safety. No other surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. My father lived to be 92, stubborn old Norwegian he was. Heart gave out eventually. Mother… she had some sort of… weakness in her legs, I think. Needed a cane the last few years. Cancer… I think my aunt had something, a long time ago. But honestly, I don’t keep track of all that. It's all very… morbid.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a father with heart disease, a mother with leg weakness, and an aunt with cancer. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to ask about any medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements.
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for the arthritis. Celebrex, I think it's called. And sometimes I take Tylenol if it’s really acting up. That’s it. No fancy vitamins or anything. I eat a sensible diet. Mostly. Oh, and I take something for my blood pressure, but the name escapes me. My daughter handles all that. She brings it over with her groceries.
DOCTOR: Alright, Celebrex for the arthritis, Tylenol as needed, and a medication for blood pressure that your daughter provides. We can clarify the name of the blood pressure medication later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. Nothing. I’ve eaten everything. Tried everything. Norwegian food, Italian food, you name it. No problems. And I’ve never reacted to any medication, as far as I know. Are we almost done here? I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. That's very helpful. We are getting close, Mr. Orwin. Just a few more questions. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I told you, I garden. And I used to do terrazzo. Now I mostly supervise. I don’t smoke. Never have. Drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive. And I get plenty of fresh air. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Orwin. Gardening, occasional wine, no smoking. Very good habits. Alright. Now, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Get it over with, then. The sooner this is finished, the better. Don’t poke too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, with a slight murmur, which is common in people your age. Your lungs sound clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Your ears look clear. Your throat looks fine as well. No redness or swelling. Your pulse is regular and strong. Overall, everything sounds and looks good for your age. </stage>
PATIENT: Good. I knew it. Perfectly fine. So, can I go now? Is this “clearance” finally granted? I have tomatoes that need staking.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Orwin. Everything sounds and looks good. Based on this exam and your history, I don’t see any reason why you shouldn't proceed with your surgery on August 15th. I am going to recommend a brief follow-up with your primary care physician to discuss managing your blood pressure, but that’s a routine precaution. So, yes, you are cleared for surgery. This is a summary of our visit for your surgeon. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. None at all. Just… thank you. And tell your daughter she worries too much. Now, if you’ll excuse me… tomatoes await.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Orwin. You have a wonderful day, and enjoy your tomatoes. And I’ll be sure to pass along your message to your daughter. .
