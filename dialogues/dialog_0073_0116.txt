DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my legs. They bother me at night, you see. Cramping. Terrible cramping. It wakes me up, it does. I don’t… I don't rightly recall when it started starting, just that it’s been happening for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Leg cramping at night. And it wakes you up, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. Quite a start it gives me! It’s… a tightening. A squeezing. Hard to explain. It doesn’t… it doesn’t last long, thankfully. But it’s frequent. Several times a week, I believe. Though, my memory isn’t what it used to be, dear. I apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Several times a week… alright. And is this cramping in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it… I think it’s mostly the left one. Sometimes the right, but usually the left calf, I believe. It’s… hard to say for certain. They both feel a bit achy sometimes, even when they aren’t cramping, but the bad cramping is usually just the left. Do you… do you need me to be more specific? I'm sorry, I’m not good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. Mostly the left calf, several times a week. Is there anything that seems to trigger the cramping?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a trigger? Let me think… I don’t believe so. Not that I’ve noticed. I mostly just… sit, you see. I used to do a lot of walking, but… not so much anymore. I proofread work from home. Lots of sitting. And… perhaps I drink too much tea? I enjoy a good cup of tea in the evenings. But I can't imagine that's it, honestly. It just happens.
DOCTOR: And when you say "tea," what kind of tea are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, just… regular tea, dear. Black tea, mostly. Sometimes herbal, if my daughter brings it over. But usually just a nice cup of black tea with a little milk. Nothing fancy. It’s a habit, you see. Been drinking it for… well, a lifetime, practically. Do you think that could be the cause? It sounds silly, doesn’t it? An old woman bothered by tea!
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily silly. Caffeine can have an effect. However, it’s unlikely to be the sole cause. Let’s move on. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My daughter always asks me that. I… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And…arthritis, I suppose. Just a bit of stiffness in my hands, mostly. Nothing serious. The doctor never said anything too worrisome, just told me to take it easy. And… I’m sure there’s something else, but it’s just… gone from my mind. I truly apologize. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal, arthritis. And you take medication for the arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Not really. Just… a little cream sometimes, for the stiffness. My daughter brings it over. It has… menthol in it, I think. Helps a bit, but not much. I mostly just try not to use my hands too much. That, and… hot water bottles. They’re quite soothing, you see. Not a medication, exactly. Just… comforts. Is that… is that alright? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your circulation and reflexes. Could you lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, of course. If you think it’s necessary. Just… please be gentle. I’m not as spry as I used to be. Is there a step? I can’t quite see…
DOCTOR: There's a stool. Just take your time. I'll be right over. Alright. Let’s start with your pulses. Pulse is…weak, but present bilaterally. Reflexes are diminished, but not absent. I’m also noticing some slight swelling in your ankles. Is this new?
PATIENT: Oh… swelling? Well, now that you mention it… perhaps a bit. I thought it was just the heat, you see. It's been so warm lately. I don’t remember it being this bad before, though. Not usually. It comes and goes, mostly. I've been trying to keep my feet up when I can, but… it doesn't seem to make much difference. Is that… is that worrisome, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Diminished reflexes, weak pulses, and some swelling. I'd like to order a few blood tests just to rule out anything serious. Specifically, a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a D-dimer. And I’m going to recommend a referral to a vascular specialist. It's best to get a proper evaluation of your circulation.
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood tests and a specialist? That sounds… rather involved. Is it… is it serious, Doctor? I don't want to be a bother to everyone. And I don’t do well with… needles, if you understand. I apologize. I’m probably just being silly. Is there something else we can try? Perhaps… a stronger cream for my legs? Or a different kind of tea?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bilstein, it's not about silly. The tests will help us rule out a blood clot, which is serious. And the specialist will be able to properly assess the blood flow in your legs. Avoiding a proper diagnosis is never a good idea. As for a cream… it's unlikely to resolve the underlying issue. I understand you dislike needles, but it's a necessary inconvenience. I will write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever in the meantime. But I strongly urge you to follow through with the blood work and the referral. It's for your own safety. I will have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they can schedule the appointment for you. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. A blood clot… that does sound worrisome. Very well. If you think it’s necessary, I suppose I can do the blood tests. And see the specialist. Though I’m not sure what they can do, at my age. Will it… will it be expensive? I’m afraid I don’t have much money. And my daughter… she’s already helped me so much. I apologize for being such a bother. I truly do. Is there anything else I should know? Or… anything I should do before the appointment? Perhaps stop drinking tea altogether?
DOCTOR: I will have the front desk staff check for financial assistance programs, Ms. Bilstein. And as for the tea… it won't hurt to cut back, but it’s unlikely to make a significant difference. I would recommend elevating your legs whenever possible and wearing compression stockings, if you can tolerate them. The lab results should be back in a few days, and the specialist's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I will provide you with a written summary of our discussion and the lab orders. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… compression stockings. I don’t know… those sound awfully tight. Very well. I will… try to remember all of this. And I’ll see what my daughter says about the stockings. I suppose that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I appreciate your time. And your patience.
