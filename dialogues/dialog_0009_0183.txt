DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Grumman is fine. Doctor… Petrimoulx, you say? Yes. Well, I am… tired. Always tired. It’s not a new thing, you understand. Been this way a while now. They told me to come see about it. Something about my… liver.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Grumman. "Always tired" is a good place to start. And you mentioned something about your liver being a concern?
PATIENT: Yes. They did tests. At the… the other place. Said it wasn’t good. Not failing, but… not good. I don’t understand all the numbers. They just told me to come here. You probably know more. It makes everything feel… slow. Like walking through water. Even getting out of my chair is hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's frustrating when you don't have a clear explanation, and those numbers can be confusing. We'll definitely take a look at those test results together. It sounds like this fatigue is significantly impacting your daily life – the feeling of walking through water, the difficulty getting up… that's important information. Before we dive into the tests, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to say? I am tired. All the time. Doesn’t matter if I sleep eight hours, ten hours… still tired. Wake up tired. Go to bed tired. Even when I am sitting and doing nothing, I am tired. It's just… there. My wife complains I nap too much. She thinks I am lazy. But it's not laziness, you see. It's this… this feeling. A heavy feeling. And it’s been this way for… oh, maybe five years now? Longer, maybe. I don't keep good track of time.
DOCTOR: Five years… that is a long time to be dealing with this. And it's understandable that it would be frustrating for both you and your wife. It’s good you’re seeking answers. It definitely doesn’t sound like laziness. Okay. Besides the fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Well, sometimes my stomach feels… puffy. Bloated, maybe? And I don't have much of an appetite. Food doesn't taste very good anymore. My wife makes nice stews, but I just pick at them. She gets upset. And… sometimes my legs swell a little. Not bad, but I notice it, especially at the end of the day. Oh, and I’ve been a little more… forgetful lately. Though, I always had a bad memory. Hard to keep track of things, you understand. Not important things, just… things.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy stomach, decreased appetite, food not tasting as good, some leg swelling, and increased forgetfulness. That’s helpful information, thank you. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that have been diagnosed?
PATIENT: Well, the liver thing, of course. That’s what brought me here. Before that… I had high blood pressure for a while. They gave me pills for it. I take them every day. And… oh, years ago, I had some problems with my… my gallbladder, I think it was. They took it out. That was a long time ago. I don’t remember much about it. Other than that… not much. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. Mostly just tired. And old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal in the past. I see those notes here. And you mentioned the liver concern. Do you know what specifically was flagged on those tests?
PATIENT: No! That’s what I told you. Numbers. Lots of numbers. They said something about… enzymes? And bilirubin? I don’t know what those are. They just said it wasn’t good. And that I should see a specialist. Which is you, I suppose. I don’t understand medical talk. Never have. It’s all Greek to me. Honestly, I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Grumman, that is not too much to ask at all. And I completely understand your frustration with the numbers. It's my job to translate those numbers into something we can understand. You're right to want a clear explanation. Let me pull up those test results now. Okay, here we are. I see some elevated liver enzymes – ALT and AST are a bit high. And your bilirubin is also slightly elevated. That can cause fatigue, and explain some of the other symptoms you’re experiencing. It also explains the swelling you've noticed. Now, these levels aren’t critically high, but they are enough to warrant further investigation. Before we discuss possible causes and next steps, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. A little white one. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And… sometimes, if my joints are bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. But not every day. Just when I need it. My wife buys it at the store. The orange kind. I don’t know the name. I don’t pay much attention to those things. She handles all that. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication daily, and ibuprofen as needed for joint pain. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… That’s a hard one. My family… they’re mostly back in Ethiopia. I haven’t seen them in many years. My mother… she had some problems with her stomach, I think. But I don’t know what kind. It was a long time ago. And my father… he was a strong man. Never got sick. As far as I know. My wife’s family… they all seem healthy enough. Lots of colds, maybe. But nothing serious. Honestly, I don’t know much about it. We didn’t talk about those things much. It wasn’t considered polite. Does that help? I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Grumman. It's not always easy to recall family history, especially if you haven't been in close contact or it wasn't commonly discussed. Knowing that your mother had some stomach issues is helpful, though. Now, let's briefly touch on your social history. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Not much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. My wife likes it. I drink it to be polite. Not every night, though. Maybe once or twice a week. And I don’t drink very much. Just a small glass. I don’t really care for it, to be honest. It makes me feel… funny. And I don’t smoke. Never have. My wife smokes, but I don’t mind. I’m used to it. I don’t like the smell, but I don’t say anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use, and wife smokes. Thank you. Now, one final question for now: do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always asks when they give me pills, but I always say no. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I eat everything. She worries too much, sometimes. I’ve lived a long life, and I haven’t had any problems with allergies. I’m pretty tough, I think. Besides this… tiredness. That’s the worst thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Mr. Grumman. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, let’s talk about what could be causing your fatigue and the slightly elevated liver enzymes. Based on what you’ve told me, and the test results, there are a few possibilities. It could be non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is common, especially with a history of high blood pressure. It can also be caused by medication, although it's less likely in your case. There are other, less common causes as well, which we’ll need to investigate. I'd like to order some additional blood tests to get a clearer picture. These will check for things like hepatitis viruses, autoimmune markers, and your iron levels. I also want to order an ultrasound of your liver to get a better look at its structure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Of course. It’s always tests. Fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Ultrasound… that sounds… complicated. But if you think it’s necessary, then do it. I just want to feel better. I’m tired of feeling tired. Will these tests tell me what’s wrong? And can we do something about it? I don't want to just keep taking tests forever. I want a solution. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Grumman, that is absolutely not too much to ask. You deserve a solution, and that’s what I’m here to help you find. These tests will give us more information to pinpoint the cause of your fatigue and the elevated liver enzymes. The ultrasound is non-invasive – it uses sound waves to create an image of your liver, and it doesn't hurt. It will help us see if there’s any damage or fatty build-up. Once we have the results of these tests, we can discuss treatment options. Depending on the cause, treatment could involve lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, or medication. We’ll work together to find a plan that’s right for you. I’ll have the lab order and referral for the ultrasound sent to the front desk. They’ll schedule those appointments for you. Do you have any questions about the tests or the appointments?
PATIENT: Appointments… more appointments. Fine. I’ll just go when they tell me to go. I don’t understand all this, but I trust you, Doctor. You seem to know what you’re doing. Lifestyle changes… that means diet and exercise, right? I don’t know… I’m not very good at exercise. And my wife… she likes to cook rich food. It’s going to be hard. But I’ll try. I just want to feel normal again. Will these tests be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you understand. My Medicare… will it cover everything? I don’t want a big bill. That would just make me more tired.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Grumman. That’s a very valid point. Medicare should cover the majority of the costs for these tests, but there may be a co-pay or deductible. Our billing department is very good at working with Medicare and will let you know the estimated costs before the tests are performed. I will also make a note in your chart to alert the billing department to your concerns about the costs. And you’re right, lifestyle changes can be challenging. We can start small – even a little bit of walking each day can make a difference. And we can work with a registered dietitian to create a meal plan that’s both healthy and enjoyable. It doesn’t have to be drastic. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests scheduled. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… get the tests done. And hopefully, they’ll tell us something. I’m tired of being tired, Doctor. Really tired. Thank you for listening. And thank you for not making me feel… stupid. Some doctors… they don’t listen. They just talk at you. You seem… nice. I suppose I’ll go wait for the phone call. Hopefully, it won’t be too long. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Grumman. I’m glad I could help, and I appreciate you sharing your concerns with me. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon.
