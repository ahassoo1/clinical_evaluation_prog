DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come see you. It is not… a lot, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is certainly cause for concern, and you did the right thing by coming in to get it checked out. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it started maybe a week ago? At first, it was just a little bit, like… streaks in the mucus when I cough. But yesterday, it was… more noticeable. It is bright red, not dark. And it happens mostly in the mornings, when I first wake up. I don't feel any pain, though. Just… worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information. Bright red blood, appearing mostly in the mornings, and no associated pain… those details are important. Now, to get a clearer picture, could you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Yes. Um… it is not a dry cough. It brings up… stuff. Mucus, like I said. Sometimes it is clear, sometimes it is… a little bit yellow. I do not smoke, if that is important. It is not a bad cough, not really. Just… persistent. It happens a few times a day. Mostly when I lie down, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the smoking – thank you for mentioning that. And the fact that it’s a productive cough – meaning you’re bringing up mucus – is also helpful. Persistent, productive cough, worse when lying down, with streaks of bright red blood... Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the cough?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I have been a little tired lately, but I thought that was just because of work. I am a physical therapist, so I am on my feet a lot. No fever, no chills. No chest pain at all. I have not lost any weight. Oh! Sometimes I feel a little short of breath, but only when I am doing something strenuous, like climbing stairs. Not just walking. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fatigue, being a physical therapist, could easily be attributed to your work, but it's good to note. No fever, chills, or chest pain is reassuring. And shortness of breath only with exertion... Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I had pneumonia when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. And I had my appendix removed when I was in college. Other than that… no, not really. I have high blood pressure, and I take medication for that. Other than that, I am pretty healthy, I think. My husband… he passed away last year. It was very sudden. He had a heart problem. I have been feeling okay, considering.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. Okay, so you have a history of childhood pneumonia, an appendectomy, and currently managed hypertension. Do you recall what medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… hard. Um… let me see… I have it right here. It is Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. And I take a multivitamin, but that is it. I do not have any allergies to medications, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Lisinopril 20mg daily, and a multivitamin. No known allergies. That’s good information. Now, a few questions about your family history. Is there anyone in your family with a history of lung problems, like asthma, COPD, or lung cancer?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My father… he smoked for many years, but he never had lung cancer. He died of a stroke. My mother… she had some heart problems, like me. And my sister… she is healthy, I think. No lung problems that I know of. My grandparents… I do not really know. They lived in Japan, and we did not see them very often. So, not really. I don't think so. I'm sorry, I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. You’ve given me a good overview. No significant family history of lung problems that you're aware of. Finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… I live alone in a small house. I work full-time as a physical therapist. I try to eat healthy, but it is hard sometimes. I walk a lot at work, but I do not do much other exercise. I do not drink or smoke. And I sleep about seven or eight hours a night. I try to keep busy, but I get lonely sometimes, to be honest. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, thank you. A full-time job as a physical therapist, healthy diet, no smoking or alcohol, and adequate sleep. It sounds like you're generally very conscientious about your health. Okay, Ms. Weichers. Based on what you've told me – the coughing up of bright red blood, productive cough, no fever or chest pain, history of hypertension, and your overall lifestyle – I'd like to perform a physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine, Doctor. That sounds good. I trust your judgement. What will you do?
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'll listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to check for any unusual sounds like wheezing or crackles. Then, I’ll listen to your heart. I'll also check your blood pressure and pulse, and take your temperature. I will also feel your lymph nodes. Finally, I’ll take a look in your throat and ears. It's a fairly standard examination, and it will help me narrow down the possible causes of your symptoms. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful. Take a deep breath in… and exhale… good. And again…
PATIENT: Okay. It is okay. I am breathing.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect at this time. Heart sounds are regular, normal rate. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Your throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Ears are also normal. Lymph nodes feel normal in size and consistency. Based on the physical exam, your vital signs are stable, and there are no obvious signs of infection or other acute problems. However, the coughing up of blood is still concerning and requires further investigation. It could be a number of things, from a minor irritation to something more serious. Do you have any pain when you cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any pain when I cough. It just… startles me, because of the blood. Sometimes I feel a little tired afterwards, but that is probably just from coughing. No chest pain, no back pain, no pain at all, really. Is it… serious? I am a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Weichers, and it's perfectly reasonable to be worried. The fact that you have no pain is somewhat reassuring, but we still need to determine the cause of the bleeding. Given your symptoms – the coughing up of bright red blood, productive cough, normal physical exam, and no associated pain – the most likely possibilities include bronchitis, a minor airway irritation, or less commonly, a small bronchiectasis. However, to rule out more serious causes, such as pneumonia, a pulmonary embolism, or even lung cancer, I'd like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to have a chest X-ray and a complete blood count ?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. If it will help find out what is wrong, I will do whatever you think is best. A chest X-ray and a blood test… yes, that is fine. I trust your judgement. What does a blood test show? And the X-ray… will it hurt? I am a little anxious about it.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you, Ms. Weichers. Thank you. A complete blood count, or CBC, will give us information about your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help us look for signs of infection, anemia, or other problems. As for the chest X-ray, it won’t hurt at all. You’ll simply stand in front of a machine, and a small amount of radiation will pass through your chest to create an image of your lungs and heart. It's a very quick and painless procedure. The technician will explain the process to you in detail before we begin. I'll order those tests for you now. The lab is just down the hall, and the radiology department is on the second floor. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No, I think that is everything, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. I am a little nervous, but I feel better knowing we are doing something to find out what is wrong. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. And thank you for being so kind. I guess I will go get the tests done now? Should I schedule a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I understand your anxiety, and I'm glad I could put your mind at ease a little. Yes, please go ahead and get the tests done. The lab technician will let me know when the results are available, which should be later today or tomorrow at the latest. And yes, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. How does next Tuesday at 10:00 AM sound?
PATIENT: Next Tuesday at 10:00 AM is perfect, Doctor. I will make a note of it. Thank you again for everything. I will go get those tests done now. Have a good day, Doctor Abady.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. You have a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment. .
