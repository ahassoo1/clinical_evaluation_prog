DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Rakosky, you say? Yes, yes. It's... well, it's my chest. Hurts when I take a deep breath. Been happening a little while now. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Old age, I suppose. Everything hurts these days. Can we just… get it over with? I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. We'll certainly try to be efficient. But to make sure I understand what's going on, and to provide you with the best care, I do need to ask a few questions. “A little while now” is quite vague; could you perhaps give me a range?
PATIENT: A range… hmm. Maybe… a month? Two months? It's hard to say. I’ve been busy with the house… always something to fix. And the garden. I don't really pay attention to how long things bother me, if you understand. Just try to ignore it 'til it gets too bad. Is that helpful? I really don't remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Ruocco. It’s common to dismiss discomfort, especially when you're active. So, about a month or two of chest pain. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp. Feels like… a weight. When I try to take a big breath, like when I’m lifting something, it gets worse. And sometimes, when I cough. Not a bad cough, just a little one, but it makes it hurt more then. It's not constant, you know? Comes and goes. And it's mostly on this side. <points to his left chest> Though sometimes I feel it across here too. <points to his right chest>
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, mostly on the left side but sometimes radiating to the right, worsened by deep breaths and coughing. Does anything make the pain better?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Sitting still helps a little, I suppose. But I can’t just sit all day! I have things to do. Lying down doesn’t really change anything. Maybe… if I lean forward a bit, it feels okay for a few minutes. But it always comes back. It’s just… a nuisance, really. I've lived a long life, you know? A little pain isn’t going to stop me. But it’s… worrying. I don’t want to fall behind on the house.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about staying active, Mr. Ruocco. It's good you’re mindful of changes. Leaning forward offering some relief is a useful detail. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this chest pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, no cough like a bad cold. I’ve been… a little tired lately. But who isn’t? I’m eighty years old! My appetite is okay. Maybe a little less than usual, but I’ve always been a small eater. And I haven’t lost any weight, that I know of. My clothes fit the same. No swelling in my legs or anything like that. Honestly, Doctor, I’m pretty sure it's just old age catching up to me. I'm not one to complain. Is there anything else you need to know? Because I really have to get back to the garden. The weeds are taking over.
DOCTOR: No, that’s a good start, Mr. Ruocco. Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and gently feel your chest wall. Just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Examination… yes, alright. As long as it doesn’t take long. I have a lot to do today. I guess a quick listen won’t hurt. Just… be gentle, please. Everything’s a little… sensitive these days. And if I wince, it doesn't necessarily mean it really hurts. Just… old. Very old. Is that alright? You can just hurry up and get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I'll be as gentle as possible and take my time. It won't take long. Your breath sounds are a little diminished on the left side, but overall relatively clear. I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Your heart rate is regular and a little slow, which isn't uncommon at your age. I don't hear any murmurs. There’s some mild tenderness to palpation on the left side, where you described the pain. No significant crepitus. Okay, Mr. Ruocco. Based on what you've told me and the brief examination, there are a few possibilities. Given your age and description of the pain, it could be musculoskeletal – meaning related to your muscles or ribs. However, diminished breath sounds are concerning, and we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any history of smoking?
PATIENT: Smoking? Oh, goodness. Yes. A long time ago. When I was younger. Before… well, a long time ago. Before it was… frowned upon. I quit… oh, maybe thirty years ago? I don't really remember exactly. A pack a day, for… a long time. Before my wife… well, never mind. It was a long time ago. Does that matter? I haven’t touched a cigarette in decades. I thought I’d gotten rid of that bad habit. Is it… serious? Is something bad going to happen? I really don't have time for serious. I have things to fix.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Ruocco. A history of smoking is relevant, as it increases your risk for lung problems. Given your age, past smoking history, and diminished breath sounds, I'm concerned about a few possibilities, including bronchitis, pneumonia, or even something more serious like a lung mass. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. It will help us visualize your lungs and identify any potential problems. Would you be able to go to the imaging center today?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Oh, goodness. More tests. I really didn’t want to spend all day here. Is it absolutely necessary? I feel fine, mostly. Just a little ache. Is it going to take long? And is it… expensive? I don't really have insurance, you see. I just… hoped it was something simple. Something I could ignore. Will it keep me from working on the house? Because if I can’t get to the garden, everything will be overgrown. <sighs> Fine. If you really think it’s necessary, I suppose I can go. But please, make it quick. And tell me where to go. I don't know this town very well.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco. I wouldn't order the X-ray if I didn't think it was important. It’s the best way to determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out anything serious. It doesn’t take long – usually just a few minutes. The cost… I’m aware you’re uninsured. Let me see if we can arrange for financial assistance. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, speak with you after this consultation about that. The imaging center is located at 14 Maple Street, about a ten-minute drive from here. I’ll write down the address and phone number for you. They take walk-ins, but it's always best to call ahead. While you’re waiting for the X-ray, please try to avoid strenuous activity. Once the results are back, we'll discuss them and develop a plan. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I haven't taken much medicine in my life. A little aspirin for a headache now and then. But nothing serious. My wife used to take all sorts of pills, but I never needed any. Just a strong work ethic and a little common sense. That’s all I ever needed. No, no allergies. Just… old. And tired. This whole thing is just… a nuisance. Can I go now? I really need to get back to the garden. The weeds won't pull themselves. <rubs his chest lightly> And this ache… it's getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ruocco. No known allergies. Alright. I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever – acetaminophen – to help with the discomfort. And as I mentioned, Sarah will speak with you about financial assistance for the X-ray. Please, if you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, or coughing up blood, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen… alright. Pain reliever. Good. Shortness of breath… fever… blood… Yes, yes. I understand. But I highly doubt any of that will happen. I’m a tough old man. Always have been. I’ll try to remember… but you know how it is. Old age. Things slip your mind. Thank you, Doctor. I guess. I really need to go now. <starts to slowly stand up> Can Sarah find me in the waiting room? I just want to get home and pull some weeds before it gets too dark. This whole visit has taken up my whole morning. Is it alright if I just… leave now? I don't want to be a bother. <looks hopefully at Dr. Rakosky>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Ruocco. Sarah will find you in the waiting room. Please don’t hesitate to ask her anything. And please, take care of yourself. It was a pleasure meeting you. And remember, if anything changes, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Have a good day, and I hope you can get those weeds pulled. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. Weeds… have to pull the weeds… everything's getting overgrown… old age… .
