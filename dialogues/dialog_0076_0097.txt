DOCTOR: Right. Marija Chilla, 44. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Ruocco. It’s…well, my husband, Farid, suggested I come. He’s been rather insistent, actually. He wants me to…put things in writing, regarding my wishes, should something…unforeseen happen. I believe he called it an “advance directive” or a “POLST form”? Honestly, I find the whole thing rather morbid, but he worries so.
DOCTOR: An advance directive…yes, yes. People get fixated on these things. Look, I’m a medical doctor, not a…life coach. But, alright. So, you’re here because your husband is concerned about you making healthcare decisions if you’re…incapacitated?
PATIENT: Precisely. Though, I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions. I teach literature, you know. Critical thinking is rather essential to my profession. It’s simply…unnecessary to dwell on such unpleasant hypotheticals. Farid, however, has been reading articles online and…well, he's convinced I need to document everything. He said something about…not wanting to be burdened with difficult choices. It’s all very dramatic, frankly.
DOCTOR: Online articles. Of course. Look, it's a simple form. It mostly just clarifies who you want making decisions for you, and what you want…or don’t want. Let’s just get through it, shall we?
PATIENT: Well, if you insist. I suppose the sooner it's done, the sooner Farid will cease his…nagging. But I must confess, I haven’t the slightest idea where to begin. It’s not as though I’ve given any thought to…what I want if I were, heaven forbid, unable to express my wishes. Do you simply…ask a series of questions? And then write down my responses? It seems…rather informal for such a serious matter.
DOCTOR: Yes, essentially. We’ll go through some scenarios. Basic things. Do you want life-sustaining treatment if there’s no reasonable hope of recovery?
PATIENT: Life-sustaining treatment… That sounds rather bleak, doesn't it? Honestly, Doctor, I find the very phrasing…distressing. I suppose, if there truly is no hope… and a qualified medical professional—yourself, of course—determines that it is futile… then, yes. I wouldn’t wish to be kept alive artificially. But it must be a very definitive determination. Not some…premature assessment based on fleeting optimism. I’ve always believed in fighting for life, where possible.
DOCTOR: Right. “Qualified medical professional.” Noted. And what about CPR, should your heart stop?
PATIENT: CPR…well, that seems…less intrusive than some of the other options. I suppose, if it’s a simple matter… and unlikely to cause further discomfort… then yes, I would want that attempted. Though, I must add, I have read articles—reliable articles, mind you—suggesting that CPR can be…rather traumatic. It’s not as effective as they portray on television, is it?
DOCTOR: Television. Look, it's a reasonable chance of survival in certain situations. If your heart stops in the office, we’ll attempt it. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, nothing significant. A slight reaction to certain perfumes, perhaps, but nothing that would interfere with medical treatment. And, truly Doctor, I don’t understand why we’re discussing perfumes. We are talking about life and death here, not social etiquette. Are you quite finished with these…scenarios? This is rather exhausting, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just a few more. Do you have a designated healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: A…healthcare proxy? Is that the person who makes the decisions for me, should I be unable to? Farid insisted on that as well. He believes he should be it, naturally. He says he knows me best. I suppose it’s…logical. Though, I must say, he can be rather…emotional under pressure. He’s a good man, truly, but not always the most…rational. But yes, I suppose he can be my healthcare proxy. If you insist. Is there paperwork involved?
DOCTOR: Yes, there’s a form. Just needs signatures. I’ll get it for you. Honestly, people…all this fuss. It's a simple directive. It shouldn't take an hour.
PATIENT: Well, I trust it won't be too lengthy. I have a rather full schedule, you see. And frankly, this whole exercise has been rather unsettling. It’s not as though I’m expecting to…require such drastic measures anytime soon. But if it appeases Farid… I suppose I can endure a few more minutes of paperwork.
DOCTOR: Here. Just sign where it says "Patient Signature" and "Witness Signature." I'll find someone to witness it. Don't overthink it.
PATIENT: Honestly, the print is rather small. And the legal jargon… It's hardly accessible, is it? Very well. Let's get this over with. Farid will be…pleased. Now, about a witness…? And then, may I be excused?
DOCTOR: Nurse Patel! Could you witness this, please?
PATIENT: Thank you, Nurse Patel. I trust this won’t take long. Honestly, the whole ordeal has been rather…draining. Is there anything else, Doctor? Or may I finally depart? I have a rather important lecture to prepare for, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s it. I’ll file this. Just try not to think about it too much. And I highly recommend you avoid reading any more articles online. You're free to go. Next!
PATIENT: Very well. I shall endeavor to heed your advice, Doctor. And I sincerely hope I won't have occasion to return anytime soon. Goodbye. .
