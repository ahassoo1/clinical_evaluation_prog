DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this sleepiness, you see. Even with the machine, I’m just… tired all the time during the day. It’s not like I’m falling asleep everywhere, but I have no energy, and I find myself dozing off in my chair after lunch most days. It's been going on for a little while now, maybe six months or so.
DOCTOR: Six months, alright. And you said you're using a machine… is that a CPAP machine for sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A CPAP machine. The doctor at the hospital – Dr. Ramirez – he diagnosed me with sleep apnea about a year and a half ago. He fitted me with the machine, and I’ve been using it every night, as he told me to. I really try to, anyway. It’s… well, it’s not the most comfortable thing in the world, but I understand it's important.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've been on CPAP for a year and a half, and the tiredness started about six months ago. And you mostly use it every night… can you give me a rough estimate of how many nights a week you'd say you’re actually using it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Most weeks, I’d say… maybe five or six nights. There are a couple of nights when I travel to see my daughter, and sometimes I forget to pack it, or the hotel doesn’t have a good outlet nearby. And occasionally, I just… can't be bothered. I know, I shouldn't say that, but it happens. It's a bit of a hassle, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Five or six nights a week. And when you don't use it, do you notice a significant difference in how you feel the next day?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. Definitely. I wake up feeling much more… groggy, I suppose is the word. And a bit more irritable, if I'm honest. It's not a pleasant way to start the day. My wife – well, my ex-wife – used to complain about it, even. She said I was much easier to live with when I used the machine regularly. She had a point, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get to the bottom of this. Aside from the tiredness and grogginess, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, sometimes I wake up with a dry mouth. And my nose feels a bit stuffy in the mornings, even with the humidifier on the machine. And I wouldn't say it's painful, but my jaw feels a little sore sometimes, especially when I first wake up. Other than that… no, I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. I still enjoy my work, thankfully. I teach a couple of courses at the community college. Keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: And what about snoring?
PATIENT: Snoring? Well, that’s a tricky one. My ex-wife certainly used to complain about that! Before the machine, it was… legendary, apparently. Now? I honestly don't know. I sleep alone these days, so I don't have anyone to tell me. I suppose it's possible I still snore a little, but it's definitely not as bad as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That's probably not a good thing, to be honest. I've put on a few pounds over the last year or so. Not a huge amount, maybe ten or fifteen, but enough to notice it in my clothes. It’s hard to exercise regularly these days, you see. My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, some weight gain, occasional knee pain… let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other conditions that Dr. Ramirez or other doctors have diagnosed you with?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I have high blood pressure. Dr. Evans has been treating that for years. I take a pill for it every morning. And I had my prostate removed about ten years ago. That’s all, really. Nothing too serious. Oh, and I had a bout of shingles a few years back, but that cleared up pretty quickly.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, prostatectomy ten years ago, shingles… Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I've had the usual vaccinations, of course, but no allergies. I take the blood pressure medication regularly, and it seems to be doing its job. Doctor Evans checks it every six months, and it’s usually under control.
DOCTOR: And you said you’re mostly compliant with your medications, but you admitted to sometimes skipping the CPAP… is there anything else you're not telling me about your lifestyle or habits?
PATIENT: Well, now… you’re a thorough doctor, aren’t you? I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner most nights. Maybe two, on occasion. And I have a bit of a sweet tooth. I enjoy a small piece of chocolate after my meal. I wouldn’t say it’s a problem, but… yes, I suppose those are habits I haven’t mentioned.
DOCTOR: Alright. We've established you're not always as diligent with your health as you could be. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Then we’ll discuss possible next steps. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Sounds sensible to me. Let's get it over with. I’m happy to cooperate, Doctor. I just want to feel better, you see. This tiredness is really wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly muffled. Lungs are clear, but with some diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Blood pressure is 148/88… a little elevated, but not drastically so. Throat is clear, some mild redness at the back of the palate. No obvious signs of infection. Thyroid feels normal. Alright. Based on my initial assessment, and your history, we need to investigate why your CPAP isn't fully controlling your sleep apnea. We’ll start with a sleep study to reassess your apnea severity and see how well the machine is working. Also, given your occasional non-compliance with both the CPAP and your medication, a referral to a nutritionist might be beneficial. Lifestyle changes are going to be important, Mr. Paske. We need to address the wine, the sweets, and your overall consistency with your health regimen. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. It sounds like a lot, but… yes, I suppose you’re right. I haven't been looking after myself as well as I should. A sleep study and a nutritionist… alright. I’m willing to try. It’s just… it’s difficult to change old habits, you see. But I appreciate your honesty, Doctor. I really do. What happens next with the sleep study? Do I need to go somewhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to go to the sleep lab at St. Jude’s Hospital. It's a one-night study, and they’ll monitor your brain waves, breathing, and other vital signs while you sleep. They'll adjust your CPAP machine settings if needed, or recommend a different mask if the current one isn't fitting properly. I’ll send the referral electronically to the lab, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. Also, I'll write a prescription for a multivitamin, as you seem to have a less than ideal diet. In the meantime, try to be as consistent as possible with your CPAP use. And consider reducing your alcohol intake and limiting sugary snacks. Small steps, Mr. Paske. Small steps. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds very clear. St. Jude’s Hospital, the sleep study, the multivitamin… and try to be better about everything. Easier said than done, but I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor Press. I appreciate your time and your, shall we say, directness. I’ll go and see what St. Jude’s says about scheduling an appointment.
DOCTOR: Good. I expect a follow-up appointment in four weeks, regardless of the sleep study results. We'll discuss the findings and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. And Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Don't underestimate the importance of taking responsibility for your own health. It’s not just about the machine or the pills. It's about making conscious choices. Now, you have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
