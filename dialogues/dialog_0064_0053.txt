DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my waterworks, really. I’ve been having a bit of trouble going to the bathroom lately. It just… takes a long time, and feels like it doesn’t all come out, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Trouble with urination… taking a long time, and a sensation of incomplete emptying. That can be frustrating, certainly. Let's try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Can you tell me, roughly, when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it’s been getting worse for maybe… three months now? It started small, just noticing I needed to push a little more. But the last month, it’s been… more noticeable, I suppose. I don’t really keep track of dates, but I’d say around May it started becoming a real bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, around May. Three months… That’s helpful. And would you describe it as a weak stream, or more difficulty starting the stream?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not weak, not exactly. It starts alright, but then it kind of… sputters, and I have to push to keep it going. Like a garden hose with a kink in it, maybe? Does that make sense? I have to really concentrate to get everything out. And sometimes, even then, it doesn’t feel like everything comes out.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense—a sputtering stream, requiring effort, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: No, not really. It looks pretty normal, I think. You know, the usual pale yellow. I haven’t noticed anything different about the smell either. I drink plenty of water, so it’s usually pretty clear. I make sure of that, at least. I used to work on a farm, so I know the importance of staying hydrated!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the hydration. Working on a farm definitely teaches you that lesson! Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning while you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. It’s not uncomfortable, not like that. It just… takes effort, like I said. No burning, no stinging, nothing like that. Just… frustrating, mostly. And a little worrying, you know? I don’t like feeling like something isn't working right.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good that there's no pain or burning, that’s a positive. Alright, Ms. Yadao, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check things out. It will involve listening to your abdomen and a brief external examination. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I don’t mind. It’s good to know what’s going on, and I trust your judgment. I've lived a long life, I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding! Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable, or anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. I appreciate that. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all, but please do let me know if anything feels odd. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay… everything sounds normal from listening. And externally, I don’t feel any obvious masses or tenderness. Your bladder doesn't feel particularly full at the moment. Now, just to get a better understanding, I'd like to order a simple urine test—a urinalysis—to check for any signs of infection or other abnormalities. We can also do a quick check of your kidney function with a blood test, just as a precaution. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A urine test and a blood test… alright. That’s no problem at all. Whatever you think is best. I’d rather be safe than sorry. Will I need to… prepare for anything special for the blood test? Do I need to fast? I always forget those things.
DOCTOR: That's a good question! Yes, for the blood test, I would like you to fast for about eight hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We'll schedule the blood draw for first thing tomorrow morning, so you can have breakfast after. I’ll also give you a container for the urine sample, and instructions on how to collect it. Do you have any questions about that, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Eight hours of fasting… and the urine sample. I can manage that. I’ll set a reminder on my phone. Breakfast tomorrow morning, that sounds good. Actually… is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Any symptoms that would mean I need to come back sooner? I don't want to worry needlessly, but it's always good to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Yadao. Yes. If you develop a fever, chills, lower back pain, or if you notice any blood in your urine, please contact the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Those could be signs of an infection. Also, if you suddenly become unable to urinate at all, that's something we need to address right away. Otherwise, just continue to drink plenty of fluids, and we’ll review the lab results when they come back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s very clear. Fever, chills, back pain, blood in the urine… and being unable to urinate. I'll keep an eye out for those things. And I’ll try not to worry too much until we have the results. Thank you, Doctor Smetak. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get those tests ordered and scheduled for tomorrow. The nurse will come in shortly to go over the instructions with you. In the meantime, do you have any other concerns or questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve answered all my questions. I’ll see you again after the tests. Thank you again for your time and patience. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. Yadao. We'll be in touch soon.
