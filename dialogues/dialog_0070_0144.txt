DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Abady, was it? Yes, yes. Well, honestly, I just… thought I’d pop in. My daughter kept telling me I should get a check-up. She worries too much, that one. I feel perfectly fine, really. Just curious, I suppose. It’s not like anything hurts.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Calvery. It's always good to be proactive about your health, and daughters often have good instincts. Even without specific complaints, a routine check-up is a valuable way to assess your overall well-being. To get a good starting point, could you perhaps tell me a little bit more about how you’ve been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Hmm. Well, I sleep alright, I think. Though I do get up a couple times in the night. Old age, you know. And I eat… reasonably. Not as much as I used to, but who does at my age? I mostly keep to myself these days. My husband… well, it’s been a while. Everything just feels a bit… slow, if that makes sense. Not bad, just… slow.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Calvery. Those are all important things to consider. It sounds like you’re experiencing some normal changes with age, but we want to make sure everything is as it should be. Could you tell me a bit about any past medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking things I don’t rightly remember. I had… something with my gallbladder, years ago. Needed a surgery, I think. And my blood pressure, Doctor told me it was a little high at one point. But that was… a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. My daughter handles all the paperwork, usually. She’s very organized, bless her heart. I mostly just go to the appointments when she tells me to.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Calvery. We can certainly look through your records to get a more complete picture. Do you recall approximately when you had the gallbladder surgery, or perhaps what year your blood pressure was elevated?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Years… I really couldn't say. It was after my husband retired, I think. That was… oh, goodness. Maybe fifteen years ago? Or twenty? It all blurs together. It was a small hospital, not this fancy place. And the doctor... he was a nice young man. Very polite. But I don't remember much about the specifics. Honestly, it's just a jumble in my head these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. Let me see if I can find some information in your chart here. Ah, yes. It appears you underwent a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – in 2008 at St. Joseph’s Hospital. And there’s a record of slightly elevated blood pressure readings around 2012, which were managed with lifestyle changes at the time. Now, are you currently taking any medications for any condition, or do you take any vitamins or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know it’s all written down somewhere! Yes, yes, 2008 sounds right. Lifestyle changes... I think I just tried to eat less salt. As for medication… let me think. I take something for my knees, I think. A little white pill. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, my daughter gives me something else. It helps with the pain. But other than that… I don't really take much. I prefer not to, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you happen to know the names of those medications, Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no. Names? I don't think so. I just take what my daughter gives me. She labels the bottles, but I usually just toss them in the cupboard. I'm terrible with remembering those things. She gets them from the pharmacy, you see. And I trust her judgment completely. She's very sensible. I really just let her handle all the details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. We can try to clarify the medications with your pharmacy later if needed. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Well, my mother lived to be a good age, I think. Eighty-something? She had a bit of trouble with her heart towards the end. And my father… he passed away when I was young. I don’t really remember much about his health. He worked very hard, that man. Lots of farming. My sister, she has… something with her bones. Arthritis, maybe? She complains about the pain a lot. But other than that… I don't really know much about my family’s health. It wasn’t something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. My husband smoked, a little, when he was younger. But I always made him smoke outside. Terrible habit, I always said. I can’t stand the smell of it. It just… makes me cough. No, I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little wine with dinner, sometimes. Mostly on special occasions. My husband liked a good glass of red wine. I usually have a sip or two with him, but I don’t really drink much on my own. It doesn’t really appeal to me, if I’m honest. I prefer a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Calvery. Now, finally, could you tell me about any allergies you may have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't think I have any major allergies. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s not a true allergy, is it? And I can’t eat shellfish. Makes me terribly sick. But other than that… no, I don’t have any known allergies. My daughter always asks, but I always tell her no.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery, that’s very helpful. Thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a quick look at your throat and ears.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's necessary. It’s not like I’m expecting anything alarming. But yes, go ahead. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. Though I do get a little cold easily, you know. And I don't like having things stuck in my ears.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. It's just a routine check, and it shouldn't take long. Your blood pressure is 138 over 76, which is slightly elevated. We can monitor that over time. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear, but I do hear a very mild wheeze on the exhale. Any history of asthma or bronchitis, Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A wheeze? That doesn’t sound good. Asthma… no, I don't think so. I do get a bit of a cough in the winter, especially when it's cold and damp. And sometimes, when I have a cold, it feels a little tight in my chest. But I've never been diagnosed with asthma. My mother used to say it was just “a touch of the catarrh”. Old-fashioned remedy, she used to say. Warm tea and a bit of honey.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. It could be related to seasonal allergies or a mild form of reactive airway disease. We can keep an eye on it. Now, let me just take a look at your throat and ears. Your throat looks clear. Now, opening your ears… A little wax build-up in both ears, but nothing significant. No signs of infection. Alright, Ms. Calvery. That completes the physical exam. Overall, everything seems relatively stable, but we have a few things to monitor – your blood pressure and the mild wheezing.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Stable is good. That’s all I ask for, really. So, what do you think I should do about the blood pressure? Should I be taking pills? I really don’t like taking pills, you know. They always make me feel so… sluggish.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, Ms. Calvery. Before we jump to medication, I'd like to try a few lifestyle modifications. Sometimes, small changes can make a big difference. I recommend a low-sodium diet – avoiding processed foods and adding less salt to your meals. Regular, moderate exercise, even just a 30-minute walk a few times a week, can be very helpful. And maintaining a healthy weight is also important. I’d like to recheck your blood pressure in one month to see if these changes are making a difference. If it’s still elevated, we can discuss medication options at that time. We'll find something that works for you, if needed. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… manageable, I suppose. Walking, I can do. I used to walk a lot more when my husband was still around. And I can certainly try to eat less salt. Though my daughter makes such lovely casseroles… she puts so much flavor in them. I’ll have to ask her to be a bit careful, I suppose. A month… yes, a month sounds alright. I’m glad you’re not rushing to give me pills right away, Doctor. That’s very reassuring.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It’s always best to start with the least invasive options first. I’ll write down some information about low-sodium diets and the benefits of regular exercise for you to take home. I also want to keep an eye on that mild wheezing. If you notice any worsening shortness of breath, chest tightness, or a persistent cough, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. And very patient, I might add. I do tend to ramble on a bit, don’t I? It's just… getting old, I suppose. Things aren’t as clear as they used to be. I think that’s all for now. Just the blood pressure and the breathing to keep an eye on. And maybe a bit less salt in my casseroles. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Calvery. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don't worry about rambling—it's perfectly normal. I'm here to listen. Our office will call you in a month to schedule a follow-up appointment to check your blood pressure. In the meantime, if anything changes or you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to call. I'll have the nurse print out some educational materials for you on low-sodium diets and exercise. Have a lovely day, Ms. Calvery. And try to enjoy those casseroles—just in moderation!
