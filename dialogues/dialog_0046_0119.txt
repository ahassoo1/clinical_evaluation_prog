DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It's August 2nd, 2025. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But it’s something I simply must address. It's a… discharge. A rather unpleasant one, really. And not my discharge, if you catch my meaning. It's… a man's problem, but he refuses to come with me. He says it’s ‘too personal’— honestly, the nerve! So, I’m here on his behalf. I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. It’s perfectly alright, and quite common for patients to seek care for loved ones. We'll do our best to help. So, this discharge… could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, the details are… distasteful. But if you must know… it’s… yellowish. And sometimes there’s a… a bit of odor. Not his usual scent, that’s for certain. He’s been… trying to keep it clean, but it’s persistent. It's been going on for… oh, a week or so, I believe. He hasn’t been feeling quite himself either – a little… subdued, you understand. Though, men rarely admit to anything, do they?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Wartick. It’s helpful to have those details. A yellowish discharge with odor, present for about a week, and some general feelings of being unwell… I appreciate you being so forthcoming despite it being a sensitive topic. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if he's experienced any burning or pain with urination?
PATIENT: Pain? Honestly, Doctor, he's not one to complain. But now that you mention it… he did seem a little… agitated when he went to the restroom this morning. And perhaps a slight grimace. But men are stoic, you know. He wouldn't admit to pain unless it was absolutely dire. I suppose it could have been a little discomfort. But truly, Doctor, he's a very… private individual. Do you really need all these… specifics?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. It’s perfectly alright if he's not comfortable sharing all the details. Any information you can provide is helpful, and we can work with that. The agitation and slight grimace this morning are useful to know. Now, has he noticed any fever, chills, or body aches along with this?
PATIENT: A fever… now that you mention it, he was a bit flushed yesterday evening. He attributed it to the paella, naturally. He eats rather liberally, you see. But no chills, no. And certainly no body aches. He does complain about his joints sometimes, but that's just… old age creeping in, I suppose. He's not a young man anymore, Doctor. Though, he insists he’s still quite spry. Honestly, men and their egos. Is this truly necessary, all these questions? It’s rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wartick, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. It’s completely reasonable to feel a bit uncomfortable discussing these things, but these details help me to understand what might be going on and ensure we get him the best possible care. Okay, so yellowish discharge with odor for about a week, slight agitation with urination this morning, and a flushed complexion yesterday. No fever, chills, or body aches reported. Now, let’s move on to his medical history. Does he have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… well, he insists he’s perfectly healthy. But he’s a bit of a… stubborn one. He used to have some trouble with his blood pressure, years ago, but he refuses to take medication. Says it makes him feel “sluggish.” And his knees… oh, his knees are always acting up. But no formal diagnosis, nothing serious. He does have a bit of trouble… keeping regular, if you catch my meaning. And he snores, terribly. Does that count? Honestly, Doctor, he’s a bit of a mess, but he’s my mess. Is this all terribly important? I do wish we could just get this sorted quickly.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Wartick. All of this is helpful. It gives me a more complete picture. High blood pressure in the past, trouble with regularity, and snoring… yes, those details are all relevant. Now, has he ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. He had his appendix out when he was a boy, a very long time ago. And he broke his wrist falling off a bicycle, also when he was young. Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. He’s quite fortunate, really. Avoids doctors whenever possible, which, frankly, is probably for the best. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel rather flustered. Are we nearly finished? I have a luncheon appointment shortly.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting close, Ms. Wartick. Just a few more questions, and then we'll discuss a plan. Now, is he currently taking any medications at all – even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely not. He loathes pills. He takes a multivitamin occasionally, if I nag him enough, but that’s it. And perhaps some ibuprofen for his knees when they’re particularly bothersome. But nothing regularly. He prefers natural remedies, you see. Garlic, mostly. Honestly, Doctor, he’s a very… stubborn man. Can we please conclude this interview? I’m afraid my time is rather valuable.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. I understand your time is valuable. Just a few final questions regarding his family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in his family - things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Family history… honestly, Doctor, that’s a bit of a mystery. His parents are both… deceased. And he wasn't particularly close to his siblings. I believe his mother had some trouble with her… digestion, but that’s about all I know. No heart disease, no cancer, nothing significant. Really, he comes from a very… robust lineage. He's always been quite proud of that. Can we please finish now? I have a very important appointment. Honestly, this is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wartick. Thank you for providing me with this information. It's understandable that you're pressed for time. Based on what you’ve described – the yellowish discharge, odor, slight agitation with urination, past history of blood pressure issues, and general preference for natural remedies – it sounds like he may be experiencing an infection, possibly a sexually transmitted infection or a bacterial infection of the urethra. However, it's important to remember that this is just a preliminary assessment. To determine the exact cause and the best course of treatment, we would need to perform a physical exam and collect a sample for laboratory testing. Would you be comfortable with me performing a basic exam now?
