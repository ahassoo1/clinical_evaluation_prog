DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I’m Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe it’s a… clearance appointment? To make sure I’m healthy enough, that is. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I lost my husband a few years back and things haven’t been the easiest to keep track of since then. I apologize if I seem a little… scattered.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Brightful. Losing a spouse is… profoundly disruptive. It's perfectly alright if things aren’t perfectly clear. We’ll take our time and sort everything out. So, this surgery… do you recall what type of surgery you’re scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That is the question, isn’t it? It’s… something to do with my face. I think… it’s to fix some things I don’t particularly like. It was something my husband and I talked about… he was very supportive. I’m so sorry, I wish I could be more precise. Was there paperwork sent over detailing it? Perhaps that would jog my memory.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Brightful, I see here you are scheduled for a blepharoplasty and rhinoplasty – that’s surgery to reshape the eyelids and nose, respectively. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes… yes, that sounds right. Eyelids and… the nose. That’s it exactly. It’s been… a long time since the initial consultations. I’m relieved to hear you have the details. It feels good to have that confirmed. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. It’s not uncommon to forget details over time, especially with the circumstances you’ve described. Now, to ensure you are a suitable candidate for surgery, we need to review your medical history. Let's start with your past medical problems. Do you have any significant medical conditions – such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, thyroid issues, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don’t believe so. I was generally quite healthy. My husband always insisted on regular check-ups… he was very diligent. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing major. I did have a bout of… the flu, terribly bad, a couple of years ago. But that’s about all I can recall. I had bloodwork done regularly, though. Would that be in your records?
DOCTOR: I see some bloodwork from approximately six months ago. Those results appear within normal limits. However, it's helpful to have your recollection. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than routine procedures?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Not that I recall, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, naturally, and… a wisdom tooth removed as a young woman. But nothing… serious. No extended stays in a hospital. I’ve always been lucky in that regard. Honestly, I mostly just worried about keeping up with my garden. My husband built me a beautiful greenhouse.
DOCTOR: Very good. And what about surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Well, the tonsils, as I mentioned… and the wisdom teeth. Oh! And a rather nasty fall when I was travelling in Colombia, many years ago. I broke my wrist, I believe. It required a cast, and some physiotherapy afterwards. But other than those… I can't think of anything else. It’s all… so long ago. I do hope that’s not too confusing. I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. After my husband passed, I tried to simplify things as much as possible. I stopped taking the occasional pain reliever… I don’t think I’ve needed anything regularly for quite some time. Just… a lot of tea. Chamomile, mostly. And sometimes a little lavender to help me sleep. Does that count?
DOCTOR: I wouldn't classify tea as a medication, Ms. Brightful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – food, pollen, latex, etc.?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. I’ve always been rather fortunate. I can tolerate most foods… no shellfish, perhaps, but that’s more of a preference than an allergy. And I’ve never had a reaction to pollen or insects, thankfully. I live in a pretty rural area, so I encounter a fair amount of both! I suppose a little bee sting now and then, but nothing serious. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Brightful, that is helpful. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a little harder. My family is… quite large, and scattered. We don’t keep in close contact, sadly. My mother had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had some sort of heart condition, but I don't recall the specifics. Beyond that… honestly, I'm not sure. It’s difficult to remember, and we didn’t really discuss these things openly. I wish I could be more helpful. It feels like I’m failing a test!
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Brightful. We’ll proceed as best we can. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, as I mentioned, I was married… to a wonderful man. We lived a quiet life, mostly. He was a carpenter, and I tended to the garden. We didn’t have children. He passed away three years ago, after a short illness. Since then… I've kept mostly to myself. I enjoy reading, and, of course, gardening. I don't really have many visitors. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on special occasions. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Brightful, that is sufficient. Now, I’m going to perform a physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your face. Please remove your shirt and bra, and drape yourself with the provided sheet.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. If you don’t mind my asking… is this standard procedure for this type of surgery? I wasn’t aware… I apologize if I'm being naive.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure to assess your overall health prior to any surgical intervention. We need to ensure there are no underlying conditions that could compromise your recovery. Please take deep breaths for me. I’ll start with your lungs.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As you wish. I do hope everything is alright. I haven't been feeling unwell, but… you can never be too careful, can you?
DOCTOR: Your lungs are clear, Ms. Brightful. Normal breath sounds bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular, normal rate and rhythm. No murmurs detected. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Skin appears healthy. Some expected age-related changes, but no concerning lesions. Symmetry is relatively intact. Now, I'm going to examine your nose. Please don't be alarmed. I will gently palpate the nasal bones and cartilage.
PATIENT: Oh! Is everything alright? It’s… a little sensitive, I suppose. I haven’t injured it, if that’s what you’re thinking. Just… a little tender. Perhaps it’s the weather. It’s been quite humid lately.
DOCTOR: The sensitivity is noted, Ms. Brightful. It’s likely normal variation. Nasal bones are intact. Cartilage feels firm and resilient. No obvious deformities. Examination complete. Alright. I have all the information I need for now. I’ll review your chart and determine if any further testing is required. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh… well. I suppose my question would be… what are the chances of… of something going wrong? I know it’s a silly question, but it’s been on my mind. And… what sort of recovery time should I expect? I don’t have much family to help me, so I need to plan accordingly. Thank you for your patience, Doctor. I realize I’m not the easiest patient.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, all surgical procedures carry inherent risks. However, blepharoplasty and rhinoplasty are generally considered safe when performed by a qualified surgeon. Potential complications include infection, bleeding, scarring, and asymmetry. We will discuss these risks in detail before the procedure and take all necessary precautions to minimize them. As for recovery time… you can expect swelling and bruising for approximately two to three weeks. Full recovery, including final results, can take several months. You should avoid strenuous activity and follow all post-operative instructions carefully. Considering your limited support system, I would strongly advise having a friend or family member stay with you for at least the first week. I will also have my nurse provide you with detailed post-operative instructions and schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your progress. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that answers everything. Thank you, Doctor. If you don't mind, could I have a copy of those post-operative instructions in writing? And perhaps a list of things I should have on hand before the surgery… just to be prepared? I apologize for all the questions. I just want to make sure I’m doing everything right. Thank you again for your time, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: My nurse will provide you with those materials before you leave. She’s quite thorough. I believe that concludes our consultation. You’ll receive a call to schedule a pre-operative appointment and discuss the surgery in more detail. Here is some general information about post-operative care. Have a good day, Ms. Brightful. And do try to arrange for assistance after the procedure. It will make your recovery much smoother.
