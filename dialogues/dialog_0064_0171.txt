DOCTOR: Good morning, Lacreasha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yeah, hi. It’s... the nails. My nails. They look… funny. Not good funny. I don't even know why I'm here, really. Just... they changed. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly enough to start. You mentioned your nails have changed. Can you describe what you mean by “changed”?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s hard to explain. They're… not shiny anymore, I think? And kinda… thick? Not like, really thick, but… not normal. And one of ‘em… I think it’s got a stripe. A dark stripe. It's probably nothing. I don’t pay much attention to my nails, honestly. I just noticed it when I was… doing something. I forget what.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. It’s helpful you noticed the changes, even if the details are a bit hazy. You said not shiny and thicker… and a dark stripe on one nail. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it something recent?
PATIENT: Recent, I think. Maybe… a few weeks? Hard to say. I don’t look at my hands, you know? Except when I'm… doing things. Like painting. Or when I’m… I don’t know. It just… showed up. Probably from all the… stuff I use. Cleaning stuff. Or paint. Something like that. It's not a big deal, is it?
DOCTOR: It's good you’re getting it checked out. We'll figure out what's going on. Let’s just go through some general questions, if that’s alright. First, do you notice any pain or discomfort in your nails or around them?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. Maybe a little… ache sometimes? But I think that's just my hands. I do a lot with them. I'm always busy. No, no pain. Unless… if I hit it on something. Then it hurts. Like anyone else. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright, that makes sense. No, I meant any pain specifically with the nails themselves, aside from bumping them. Okay, next question. Have you noticed any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm… Let me see. It's… dry, I guess? Always is. I use lotion sometimes, but… I forget. It doesn't itch or anything. Just… normal dry skin. Old lady skin, I guess. Is that helpful? What are you looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. We're just trying to get a complete picture. Dry skin is common, especially with the weather. Okay, let's move on. Have you noticed any changes to the nail shape itself?
PATIENT: Shape? Well… they're kinda… rounded, I think. They used to be… longer, maybe? I don't really remember. I don't get manicures or anything fancy. Just… nails. Normal nails. They haven’t fallen off or anything. You’re making me think about my nails too much. It’s stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not meant to be stressful, just thorough. Rounded shape… that’s good to know. Okay, one more question about your nails before we move on to other things. Have you noticed any pitting, ridges, or small dents in the nail surface?
PATIENT: Pitting? Ridges? Ugh, I don’t know what any of that means. Are you talking about like… holes? No holes. Just… skin. And nail. And… stuff. They’re just nails, Doctor! I’m starting to worry now. Is it something bad? I don’t want to lose my nails.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Lacreasha. I completely understand your concern. It’s perfectly normal to worry when you notice changes in your body. We’re not at a point where we need to worry about losing your nails, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… good. Because I need my hands. I… do things. Important things. I forget what, exactly. But important. So, if I lose my nails, I’m… in trouble. Maybe. So, what is it? What’s wrong with them? Just tell me straight, Doctor. I don't like all these questions. I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. We're not at a point where we can say definitively what is wrong, but it's good we’re talking about it. To help me figure things out, I’m going to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Old age, probably. That's a condition, right? And… my back hurts sometimes. But that's just… getting old. I don’t think I have anything serious. The doctor before… he never said anything. Just told me to take some pills for the pain. That’s it. I take pills. Lots of pills, probably. I forget what they're for. Is that helpful? I can't remember names, you know. Everything goes in one ear and out the other.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. We'll figure out what those pills are later. And we’ll get a better understanding of your back pain. Let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. I used to… cook everything. Now I mostly just… heat things up. I don't remember ever being allergic to anything. Maybe dust? Sometimes I sneeze. But everyone sneezes, right? No, I don’t think I have allergies. My mother… she was allergic to cats. But I don’t have cats. Is that helpful? Honestly, I just want to know if my nails are going to fall off. It’s very upsetting.
DOCTOR: No, no allergies that you know of. That’s good to know. Okay, Lacreasha, I’m going to take a look at your nails now, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Then I might check your hands and skin, just to be thorough, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Just… be gentle, okay? And don’t poke too hard. It’s… sensitive. And hurry, please? I have things to do. Important things. I forget what. But important. Just… look at the nails. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a look. I’m being very gentle, I promise. I notice the nails are slightly thickened, and there's a loss of shine. The shape is somewhat rounded, as you mentioned. And I do see a longitudinal streak on the third nail of your right hand – a dark, brownish streak. It's not particularly wide, but it’s definitely there. I don't see any pitting or crumbling. The nail beds appear intact, but the skin around the nails is dry and slightly flaky. Do you feel any tenderness when I gently press around the base of the nails?
PATIENT: Tenderness? Ouch! Yes! A little. Just there. That one. It kinda… stings. Not a lot, but… yeah. That’s the one with the stripe, right? Everything feels… weird now. You poked it. Stop poking it, please. Is it bad? Is it… cancer? My neighbor got cancer. She lost all her nails. I don't want to lose my nails.
DOCTOR: Okay, I've stopped. I’m very sorry if that caused any discomfort. It's good you told me. Now, let's address your concerns. The dark streak can be a sign of several things, and it's important to investigate it properly. It could be a benign finding, like a pigmented nevus, or it could be something else that needs attention. It doesn't automatically mean it's cancer, okay?
PATIENT: So… it’s not definitely cancer? Not like my neighbor? She had to have them… removed. It was very upsetting. What do we do? Do I need… tests? Will it hurt? I don't like tests. And I don’t want them… removed. I need my hands. Important hands. What are you going to do, Doctor? Just tell me straight. No confusing words, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're right to be concerned, and I want to assure you we’re going to figure this out together. It’s not definitely cancer. We’re going to take some steps to determine what that streak is, and we’ll do it in the least invasive way possible. I'm going to order a nail fold capillaroscopy. It's a simple, painless procedure where we look at the tiny blood vessels under your skin using a microscope. That will help us understand if there’s any underlying condition affecting your circulation. We may also consider sending a sample of the nail for a fungal culture, just to rule out a simple infection. I'll also want to check your medical history and medication list again to make sure there's nothing contributing to this. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Capillar… what? And a sample? Like… cutting it off? No cutting! I just want to know if it's bad. And if I’m going to lose it. The nail. I need it. Is the capillar thing… painful? Will it leave a mark? And what about my pills? Do you think they’re doing this? I forget what they’re for. My head is spinning. Just… simple, you said? No cutting? Definitely no cutting.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths. Let’s break it down. The capillaroscopy is not painful at all. It’s like taking a close-up picture of your skin. We use a special microscope, and it doesn’t involve any needles or cutting. It won’t leave a mark. As for the sample, it's just a tiny clipping from the nail – not the whole nail, just a small piece. It won’t affect its growth or appearance. And yes, it's possible your medications could be contributing to this, which is why it’s important we figure out what they’re for. I'll need a complete list, even if you can't remember what they are for, we can check with your pharmacy. I'll also document everything carefully and explain each step before we take it, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… a tiny clipping. And a picture. No needles. And you’ll find out about the pills. My pharmacy is… down the street. Okay. But what if it is bad? What if I need… treatment? I don’t want treatment. Just tell me if it’s bad, Doctor. Straight. No confusing words. And no cutting. Please. Is that too much to ask? Just… tell me the truth. And no cutting. .
DOCTOR: No, that is not too much to ask at all. I understand your concerns, and I promise to be completely honest with you every step of the way. I will explain everything in plain language, and we will explore all possible options before making any decisions. And I assure you, we will avoid any unnecessary procedures, especially cutting. I’ll start by ordering the capillaroscopy and contacting your pharmacy to get a list of your medications. Once we have those results, we'll sit down together and discuss them in detail, and then we can decide on the best course of action. Does that sound okay?
