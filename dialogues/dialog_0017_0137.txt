DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My… how you say… the place for old people? I need paper say I okay for go there. My husband, he say I need.
DOCTOR: Ah, a form for assisted living placement. Very well. So, your husband is requesting documentation of your current health status for that purpose. To properly complete this, I’ll need a comprehensive understanding of your medical history and current condition. Let’s start with the basics. Have you been seeing any other physicians recently?
PATIENT: Other doctors? Hmm… not really. Just… the one when I break my arm, long time ago. Not see doctor since then. Maybe… the eye doctor, last year. Small thing. Not important, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, primarily you’ve been without regular medical care for some time. And the eye doctor visit was for… what specifically?
PATIENT: Just… blurry. Old eyes, you know? He give me drops. Make it little better. Not big problem. I see okay for cook, for… everything at home.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to any current medical issues you are experiencing. Are you having any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my knees. When it cold. Or when I walk too much. But it okay. I take little pills sometimes. White ones. Husband give me. For the pain.
DOCTOR: "Husband give me," you say. Do you know the name of these pills, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I no know name. He get them… from the store? Maybe? He always take care of everything. I just… take them when I need. They help the knees.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, it's crucial we have a complete list of all medications you are taking, even those obtained without a prescription or provided by someone other than a physician. We need to ensure there are no potential interactions or contraindications. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don't think so. Never have. I eat everything. Husband cook everything! Maybe… sometimes itchy when mosquito bite. But that not allergy, yes? Just mosquito.
DOCTOR: Right, mosquito bites. Let’s focus on anything more significant. Have you been experiencing any difficulty breathing, chest pain, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I breathe okay. No pain in chest. Ankles… sometimes little puffy when I sit too long. But it go away. I put my feet up. Everything okay. I feel… good for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, with all due respect, "feeling good" isn't enough for a comprehensive medical assessment. We need to be thorough. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, weight, or bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Hmm… maybe little less hungry. Not eat so much rice now. And… I no know about weight. Husband say I still too big! But… everything the same, yes? I go to bathroom… normal. Sometimes little hard, but… old age, yes?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam then. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular, though a bit elevated at 88 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Blood pressure is 142/90. Blood pressure is a little high, Ms. Abdollahi. We’ll need to monitor that. Now, let me check your reflexes and a basic neurological assessment. Please lie back.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Ow! That cold.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are present but slightly diminished, and there is some sensitivity to the stimulus. Now, can you please tell me if you have any difficulty with your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes I forget things. Small things. Where I put my glasses. What I was going to say. Old age, yes? Husband always remind me. He has good memory. I no worry about it. Everything okay. I remember cooking, I remember my family… important things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, just a few more questions. Have you experienced any recent falls or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No falls. Sometimes… little dizzy when I stand up too fast. But I hold on to something. Husband say it just old age. He say… blood pressure maybe? I no know. Everything okay. I careful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, with all due respect, “everything okay” is not a diagnosis. Your husband is not a physician. We need to address these concerns properly. Given your elevated blood pressure, slightly diminished reflexes, and reports of dizziness, I recommend a full blood workup, including a complete metabolic panel and a thyroid panel. Additionally, I suggest a neurological consultation to further evaluate your cognitive function and rule out any underlying issues. I'll put in the orders now. We also need to get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Oh. So many tests. Is… is it bad, Doctor? Is something wrong? I just want the paper for the place. I no want all this… trouble.
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, it’s not about “trouble.” It’s about ensuring your safety and well-being. I cannot, in good conscience, simply sign a form stating you are “okay” without a proper evaluation. It would be irresponsible. These tests will provide me with a clearer picture of your overall health. The lab work and EKG can be done here at the clinic. I'll schedule you an appointment with Dr. Ramirez, the neurologist, for next week. Here are your lab orders and the referral to Dr. Ramirez. Please schedule your appointment as soon as possible. Once I have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Now, do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: So many doctors… so much… waiting. I just want to go to the nice place. Is there… is there anything you can write now? Just say I okay for try? Maybe they let me try and I can get the tests later? I no want to wait so long. My husband… he wants me there.
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, I understand your frustration, but I simply cannot compromise my professional ethics. Providing incomplete or inaccurate information would be a disservice to you and potentially jeopardize your health. I will not sign the form without a proper assessment. I have outlined the necessary steps to ensure your well-being. Please follow through with the lab work and neurological consultation. Once I have the results, we can revisit this matter. Have a good day.
