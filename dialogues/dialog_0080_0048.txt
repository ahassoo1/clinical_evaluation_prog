DOCTOR: Hi Colt, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though I must say, this clinic is… rather small, isn’t it? Anyway, it’s these little… episodes. I forget things, you see. Not important things, usually, but… disconcerting. My wife, she's the one who really insisted I come. She says I ask the same questions twice, sometimes within the same hour. It’s… irritating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when memory starts to feel unreliable, and even more so when it worries loved ones. So, these "episodes"—when did you first start noticing them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It's been… maybe six months now? Hard to say exactly. It wasn't sudden, you understand. It crept up on me. At first, I just thought I was getting more… absent-minded, as one does with age. But my wife, she's very observant. She pointed it out. Said I was repeating myself. And asking where I put my glasses… even when they're on my head. It's… embarrassing, really. I used to have a very sharp mind. Still do, most of the time. It’s just… these lapses.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months. And it sounds like it's been gradually worsening. You mentioned repeating questions – can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Well, just yesterday, we were talking about the garden. I asked her if we’d planted the tomatoes yet. She’d just told me, five minutes before, that she’d done them that morning! And then, later, during the news, I asked her again! Honestly, it’s infuriating. It’s not like I’m losing my whole mind. I know what day it is, I can still do my work… I set tile, you know. A very precise profession. Requires a good memory for measurements, angles… all sorts of things. It's just… these little things. And she keeps fussing over it. Honestly, she worries too much.
DOCTOR: It sounds like these repetitions are the most concerning part for both of you. And it's good to hear you’re still able to manage your tile work—that is a good sign. Now, besides the repetition, are you noticing any other changes in your memory or thinking?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really, no. I wouldn't say so. Sometimes… sometimes I have trouble remembering names. But honestly, who doesn't? I’ve always been bad with faces. My wife remembers everyone, it’s uncanny. But other than that… I can still balance my checkbook, I can still follow the news… I haven’t gotten lost or anything like that. I still know all my regular customers, too. So no, I wouldn’t say there’s anything else. It’s just these confounded repetitions. And my wife’s fretting, of course. She reads too many articles online, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you mentioned your wife is concerned about articles she reads online – is she worried about a specific condition?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Alzheimer’s, mostly. She keeps bringing it up. Says my grandfather… on her side, not mine… he had it. Terrible thing, she says. Completely lost his marbles, she tells me. She's convinced I’m headed down the same path. It's… frankly, insulting. I'm perfectly capable. I just have a few… lapses. It's not the same thing, I assure you. I may be getting older, but I’m not losing my mind! Though she won't listen to reason. She's a very… determined woman.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s good that you’re able to articulate that, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. Knowing your family history is helpful, though, and we definitely want to explore what’s going on. Now, have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality recently?
PATIENT: Mood? No. Not at all. I'm the same grumpy old man I've always been. My wife might disagree, naturally. She’d say I'm more irritable, but that's just because she keeps asking me if I’ve taken my medicine! Honestly, she treats me like a child sometimes. Personality… well, I haven't suddenly started tap dancing or anything. No, nothing like that. I still enjoy my work, still enjoy watching the baseball games… still complain about the government, same as always. No, my personality hasn't changed a bit. It’s just… this memory business. And the constant worrying from my wife. That's what’s changed.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. It sounds like your core personality and interests haven’t been affected. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medications. Do you take anything regularly, besides the medicine your wife reminds you about?
PATIENT: Well, just the one thing for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it is. Small white pill. I take it every morning. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s only when it really hurts. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills. Never liked them much. And honestly, I don't see the point in going to the doctor unless it's absolutely necessary. But my wife… well, she has a different opinion. She’s always trying to get me to take something for this or that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. That's good to know. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I'm aware of. Never had a problem with anything. I used to work outdoors a lot, setting stone… sometimes got stung by bees, but that was just a sting. Didn’t swell up or anything like that. No food allergies, no allergies to plants… no allergies at all, really. I'm a pretty hardy fellow. My wife keeps trying to get me to take allergy medicine during pollen season, just in case, but I refuse. Waste of money, I say. And honestly, I think she just enjoys fussing over me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline and rule out any obvious causes for your memory concerns. That’s just standard procedure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Well… I suppose so. I’m not a fan of doctors poking and prodding, but if it will get my wife off my back, I guess I can tolerate it. Just be quick about it, if you please. And try not to make it too uncomfortable. I have a very bad back, you know. Setting stone is hard work.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam – check your reflexes, coordination, and balance. We’ll also do a brief cognitive assessment - just a few simple questions to help me get a better understanding of your memory and thinking. It shouldn’t be too uncomfortable, and we'll take it slow. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. Just get it over with, then. I’m not fond of being poked and prodded, as I said. And try not to use that cold thing on my back, if you please. My back’s been bothering me lately, you know. And don’t worry about my heart. It’s perfectly strong. I still do a lot of physical labor, despite my age. Always have been a strong fellow, I am. Just a bit… forgetful, is all.
DOCTOR: Everything feels normal so far. Now, let’s check your reflexes. This might be a little surprising, but it shouldn’t be painful. Okay, good. Now, let's do a quick balance test. Could you please stand up for me, and try to stand with your feet together, and your arms at your sides?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Enough with the poking and prodding. This is ridiculous. I’m perfectly healthy, I tell you. Just a bit… absent-minded, is all. There. Happy now? It's not easy standing on one leg, you know. Especially with a bad back. And my wife always tells me to be careful, so I’m always a bit unsteady. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Colt. That was helpful. Just a little unsteadiness, which isn't uncommon, especially with your back issues and your wife's concerns prompting extra caution. Now, for the brief cognitive assessment. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. Don’t worry about getting them right or wrong – I just want to get a baseline understanding of your memory and thinking. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? …August… the second? Yes, August the second. 2025. Yes, that's right. 2025. My wife always keeps track of these things. See? I remember. Perfectly fine. Just a bit… preoccupied sometimes, is all.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: What city…? …Well, it’s… a small town. A very small town. I don't really pay attention to these things. My wife drives, you see. She knows all the places we go. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a tile setter, not a geographer!
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s okay. Let’s try something else. Can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words…? Alright. Let’s hear them.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please try to remember them, and I’ll ask you to repeat them later.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Yes. Got it. Apple, table, penny. Hopefully, I’ll remember those. It's a bit much, asking an old man to remember things, you know.
DOCTOR: <stage>I make a note of his repetition of the words. I then ask a series of simple orientation questions, such as "What year is it?
PATIENT: What year is it…? It’s… 2025, isn’t it? Yes, 2025. My wife keeps reminding me. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I’m being tested!
DOCTOR: Alright, one more simple test. Can you spell the word “world” backwards for me?
PATIENT: Spell “world” backwards…? …Well, that’s… difficult. Let me see… D-L-R-O-W…? No, that’s not right. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a tile setter, not a spelling bee champion! This is ridiculous. My wife will be so proud when she hears about this. She always said I should have paid more attention in school.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. That’s enough for now. I appreciate your patience. Based on this brief assessment, there does seem to be some difficulty with recent memory and recall. However, this could be due to a number of factors – stress, anxiety, even just the normal changes that come with age. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI, to get a better look at your brain structure and rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and brain scans…? Honestly, Doctor, this is all a bit much. I just came in here because my wife said I was repeating myself! Now you want to poke and prod me with blood tests and… and scan my brain? Look, I’m a simple man. I set tile, I watch baseball, I complain about the government. I don’t need blood tests and brain scans! My wife is going to be thrilled. She always said I was falling apart. Honestly, Doctor, I think I just need a good rest. And maybe a stronger cup of coffee.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Colt. It does seem like a lot, and I apologize if I’m causing you any anxiety. However, it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory issues. The blood tests are relatively simple, and the MRI is a painless procedure. If we don’t investigate, we won’t know what’s going on, and that could lead to further problems down the line. However, I respect your decision. If you’re not comfortable with blood tests or an MRI at this time, we can proceed with a "watchful waiting" approach. I would recommend keeping a journal of your memory lapses, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment in a few months to see if your symptoms are worsening. If your symptoms do get worse, or if you start experiencing any other concerning symptoms, such as confusion or difficulty with daily tasks, please come see me right away. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A “watchful waiting” approach…? Well… that’s… better. I suppose I can handle keeping a journal. My wife will be thrilled. She’s always telling me to write things down. Alright, Doctor. A “watchful waiting” approach. But no blood tests and no brain scans! And if my wife starts fussing too much, I’m blaming you! Now, can I go home? I’m starting to feel a bit tired. All this poking and prodding and testing has worn me out.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Colt. You've been very patient, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. No blood tests, no brain scans. We’ll monitor your symptoms and see how things progress. I’ll have my nurse give you some instructions on what to look for and how to keep a journal. She’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in three months. Here's a referral to a local neuropsychologist, should you or your wife decide you'd like a more in-depth cognitive assessment. It’s just an option. It was a pleasure meeting you, Colt. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Now, let me help you to your feet and get you headed home.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. Honestly, I’m glad it’s over. This has been… a bit stressful. My wife will be thrilled with the journal, I’m sure. She’s always been good at keeping things organized. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need a strong cup of coffee… and maybe a nap.
DOCTOR: You take care now, Colt. And remember, if anything changes, don’t hesitate to call. .
