DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It’s… the back of my head. It hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now? Not all the time, but… comes and goes. Like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: I see. A dull ache at the back of your head, coming and going for about three days. Thank you for clarifying. To help me understand this better, could you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a bad pain, you know? Not like when I fall, or something. It’s… heavy. Like someone put a weight on the back of my skull. And sometimes it goes up a little, to the sides. Not my forehead, though. Just the back and… the sides of the head. Does that make sense? I worked with the trains, lots of bumping and shaking… maybe it’s from that?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Brum. A heavy, weighted sensation at the back of your head, sometimes radiating to the sides, but not the forehead. And you suspect it might be related to your previous work with the trains, due to the bumping and shaking. That’s helpful information. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if anything specifically makes the pain worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. It doesn't get worse when I move, or when I eat. Maybe… when I get really, really tired? Yes, I think so. If I don't sleep good, it’s worse the next day. And… when it’s very hot, like yesterday, it felt… tighter. But mostly, it’s just there. Not a sharp pain, just… annoying. I try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It seems to be exacerbated by fatigue and heat, but generally a consistent, non-sharp ache that you find more annoying than debilitating. Thank you for sharing that. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… No dizziness. No… blurry vision. I haven’t thrown up, if that’s what you mean. My neck… sometimes it feels a little stiff, but I think that's just from getting old, you know? And… no, nothing else I can think of. I eat okay, I sleep… well, not great sleep, but I sleep. No fever, no… strange things happening. Just the headache. It’s just… worrying me, because it doesn't go away.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Brum. No dizziness, blurred vision, nausea or vomiting, no fever, and the neck stiffness you attribute to age. And you’re understandably concerned that it’s persistent. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh boy. Well, I worked on the railroad for… almost fifty years. Lots of bumps and bruises, a few broken bones when I was young. Nothing serious. I had a bad flu when I was a kid, almost died, but that was a long time ago. The doctor gave me some medicine, and I got better. I haven’t been to a doctor much since then, to be honest. Just… little things. And… my wife, she passed away five years ago. Heart trouble. That was… sad. I don’t have any other… problems, I think. No diabetes, no… big illnesses. No insurance, either, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Brum. A long career on the railroad with some injuries, a severe childhood flu, and the loss of your wife. I am very sorry for your loss. And thank you for letting me know about your insurance situation. That is relevant information. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had any. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but they just put it in a cast. And… nothing else. I always tried to stay healthy, you know? Worked hard, ate good food… avoided getting hurt too much. I didn’t like hospitals. My wife… she had a lot of trouble, lots of doctors, lots of hospitals. I didn't want that. So, no surgeries. Never needed them.
DOCTOR: I understand. No surgeries, just a broken arm as a child that was treated with a cast. You preferred to stay healthy and avoid medical intervention when possible. That's admirable. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had trouble with her heart, like my wife. And my father… he got very forgetful when he got old. They said it was his brain, but… I don't know much about it. Lots of brothers and sisters, but… I don’t remember anyone having anything bad. Just… old age problems. Heart trouble and… forgetfulness. Nothing like… cancer, or something. Just… the usual.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Brum. Heart trouble and age-related memory issues in your family. That’s helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your current living situation and lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I live alone now, in the same house I lived in with my wife. It's a small house, but it's comfortable. I have a garden, I like to grow tomatoes and peppers. I walk a little, not much anymore, my knees bother me. I mostly stay home, watch television, read the newspaper. I eat… simple food. Soup, rice, chicken. I try to stay busy, but… it gets lonely sometimes. My neighbors are nice, they check on me. But… mostly I’m on my own. I used to go to church, but… it's hard to get around these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Brum. You live alone in your home with a garden, enjoy simple activities, and have supportive neighbors. It sounds like you maintain a relatively quiet lifestyle. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any. I can eat anything. I can take any medicine. My wife… she was allergic to some things, but I wasn’t. No, no allergies. Doctors always ask that, don't they? I always tell them no. Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Yes, doctors do ask that routinely, Mr. Brum, and it’s good to know you have no known allergies. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills, if I can help it. I used to take something for my knees, a long time ago, but it didn’t help much. So I stopped. Now, I just try to take it easy. No pills, no supplements, nothing. Just… me. Is that okay? Do I need to be taking something?
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Mr. Brum. No current medications. Alright, Mr. Brum, thank you for providing me with such a comprehensive overview of your medical history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind, to get a better understanding of what might be causing your headache. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a neurological exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want this headache to go away. I haven't had one this long in… a long time. Go ahead. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your neurological examination was largely normal, although I did note some slight diminished coordination. I also palpated your head and neck muscles and found some mild tenderness in the occipital region—the back of your head. I didn't find any signs of fever or meningitis. Based on what you've told me and my examination, it seems most likely that your headache is a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by fatigue and stress. The mild tenderness in your neck muscles and the slightly diminished coordination could be related to your age and previous work history. However, given your age and slightly elevated blood pressure, I would like to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work is good. Better to be safe, right? I don’t want anything… serious. So, yes, order the blood work. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. And… thank you. You’ve been very patient with an old man. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Brum. It’s my pleasure. And you are absolutely right—better to be safe. Alright, I’ve ordered the blood work. The lab technician will come up shortly to draw some blood. It shouldn’t take long. In the meantime, I’m going to write a prescription for a mild pain reliever—ibuprofen—which you can take as needed for the headache. I’m also going to recommend that you try to get more rest and manage your stress levels. I will also provide you with a handout on tension headaches, including tips on self-care and stress management. Once the blood work results are back—usually within a few days—we can discuss them and determine if any further action is needed. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No, I think… that covers everything. Ibuprofen is good, I used to take that for my knees. And rest… I’ll try. It's hard to rest when you get old, things ache all the time. But I'll try. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your time and patience. And… thank you for not thinking I was just an old man complaining about nothing.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Brum. It’s my pleasure to help. And please, don't ever hesitate to share your concerns with me. I understand that aging can bring about aches and pains, and I’m here to listen and provide the best possible care. The lab technician should be here shortly. Once they’ve drawn your blood, you can go home and rest. Please call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Brum. Take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
