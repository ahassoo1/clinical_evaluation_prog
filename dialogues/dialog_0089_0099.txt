DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I received some results back from a test… a GI Endo Test, the paperwork called it. And it seems there was something… abnormal detected. I must admit, I’m a little worried, and I hoped you could explain what that means, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Denis. I understand your worry. Abnormal findings are certainly concerning, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Let me pull up those GI Endo Test results now... Okay, I see it here. To help me understand the situation and explain everything clearly, could you tell me a little more about why you had the GI Endo Test done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. My primary care physician, Doctor Ramirez, ordered it because of some… discomfort I’ve been experiencing. It started, oh, perhaps three months ago? It’s mainly in my stomach, a sort of cramping feeling, and I’ve had some… changes in my bowel habits, if you understand. Not consistent, mind you, but enough to cause me concern. And Doctor Ramirez thought it best to investigate further. He mentioned something about ruling things out, but I confess, I didn’t fully grasp what he meant at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful, Denis. Three months of cramping and changes in bowel habits… and Doctor Ramirez was thinking about ruling things out. Could you describe these changes in your bowel habits a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… difficult to explain precisely. Sometimes I feel quite constipated, needing to strain… other times, it’s… the opposite, if you follow. A little too loose, shall we say? And the frequency varies quite a bit. Some days perfectly normal, others… several times a day, and then others where it’s… less frequent. It’s not a consistent pattern, which is what worries me, I think. It’s not predictable. And sometimes… there's a little blood, but only a small amount, and not every time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Denis. Inconsistent bowel habits – ranging from constipation to diarrhea – with occasional small amounts of blood. And you mentioned cramping. Can you tell me about the cramping?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It's mostly in my lower abdomen, Doctor. It comes and goes… not constant pain, but more like… waves of discomfort. Sometimes it's mild, just a dull ache, and other times it’s quite sharp, almost like a twisting feeling. It doesn’t radiate anywhere, as far as I can tell, it stays localized in my lower stomach. It seems to come on after I eat, sometimes, but not always. And it doesn’t seem to be related to anything specific I’ve consumed, at least not that I’ve noticed.
DOCTOR: Okay, localized lower abdominal cramping that comes and goes, sometimes sharp, sometimes dull, and doesn’t seem consistently related to eating. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside these issues?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… Well, I have been feeling a little more tired than usual, yes. Just a general lack of energy. And my appetite hasn't been quite as strong, either. I haven’t lost any weight that I’m aware of, but I haven’t been feeling as… hungry, I suppose. Oh, and sometimes, after eating, I feel a little bloated, very uncomfortable, like I’ve overeaten, even when I haven’t. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Denis. Fatigue, decreased appetite, and bloating after eating. The results do show some inflammation and a few polyps were detected. Now, polyps aren’t always a cause for concern, but we do need to investigate further to determine their nature. Have you ever had a colonoscopy before?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? No, Doctor, I have not. That sounds… rather invasive, if I may say so. What exactly is involved? And what do you mean by ‘determine their nature’? Are these polyps… serious? I apologize for all the questions, but I’m rather anxious about this.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Denis, and please, ask as many questions as you need. A colonoscopy is a procedure where we use a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end to examine the entire colon. It allows us to visualize the lining and take small biopsies – tiny tissue samples – from any areas of concern, like these polyps. “Determining their nature” means we send the biopsies to a lab to see what kind of cells they are. Most polyps are benign – not cancerous – but it's important to rule out any potential for malignancy. It is an invasive procedure, you are right, but it’s also the gold standard for diagnosis and prevention. We’d need to prep your colon beforehand – a special diet and laxative to clear it out – and you’d be sedated during the procedure so you wouldn’t feel anything. Before we discuss scheduling a colonoscopy, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever had any other gastrointestinal issues in the past?
PATIENT: That… that sounds rather daunting, Doctor. The sedation is reassuring, I suppose, but the idea of having a tube inserted… Well, it’s not pleasant. As for previous gastrointestinal issues… Not really, no. I've always had a fairly sensitive stomach, prone to a little indigestion now and then, but nothing serious. I did have a bout of food poisoning many years ago, perhaps twenty years ago, but that was a one-time occurrence. And I had my gallbladder removed about thirty years ago, but Doctor Ramirez said that shouldn’t be relevant. Other than that, nothing significant that I recall. I’ve always been quite careful about what I eat, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant prior GI issues other than a sensitive stomach, food poisoning years ago, and gallbladder removal thirty years ago. And how about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a good question. My mother passed away when I was quite young, from pneumonia, I believe. And my father… he had some heart trouble in his later years. As for colon cancer or other gastrointestinal issues… I don’t recall anyone in my immediate family having those problems, no. My paternal grandmother, perhaps, had some sort of stomach ailment, but I don’t have many details. It was a long time ago, and my family wasn’t one for discussing such things openly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of colon cancer or significant gastrointestinal issues. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion. I certainly don't drink regularly. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I've always led a very… temperate lifestyle, you might say.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Denis. Given your symptoms, the findings on the GI Endo Test, and your overall medical history, I believe the most prudent course of action is to proceed with a colonoscopy. It will allow us to get a clearer picture of what’s going on and rule out any serious concerns. Would you be open to scheduling that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not what I want to do, Doctor, but I understand your reasoning. If you truly believe it’s the best course of action… then, yes, I suppose I am open to scheduling a colonoscopy. I must admit, I’m quite apprehensive, but I trust your professional judgment. When would be a suitable time? And could you perhaps explain the preparation process in a little more detail? I want to be as prepared as possible.
