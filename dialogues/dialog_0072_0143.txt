DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 66 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, sixty-six, that’s right. Hmm… let me think. It’s… about starting a family. Or, well, thinking about starting a family. It’s a bit complicated, and honestly, I don’t really remember all the details why I'm here now. My… someone suggested I talk to a doctor first. Is that right? Pre-… something counseling?
DOCTOR: Preconception counseling, yes. It's… unusual for someone of your age to be considering starting a family, Mr. Verrall, but certainly not impossible. However, it is important to understand the potential risks involved. To clarify, you said "someone" suggested this?
PATIENT: Yes, someone. A… a friend, I think. A newer friend. Look, I’m not very good with remembering names these days. She… she thought it was a good idea to be prepared, you know? Before… well, before anything happens. Risks? What sort of risks are we talking about? I just… I want to be sure everything is okay, if… if it should happen. It’s a little scary thinking about it all, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Verrall, at your age, there are several considerations. Increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities in a developing fetus is a primary concern. Also, the likelihood of complications during pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and preeclampsia, is significantly higher. Your overall health status plays a crucial role, and we need to assess that thoroughly. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Chromosomal… what now? And all those other things… I… I don’t think so. No, I don’t think I have any of those things. I had a bit of a cough last winter, but that cleared up. I try to eat fairly well, mostly. I walk a bit, too. But… I haven’t really been to the doctor in a long time. I’m not sure what all those words even mean, to be honest. Is there a simpler way to explain it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, “chromosomal abnormalities” simply means there’s a higher chance of the baby not developing correctly, potentially leading to serious health problems or even miscarriage. The other conditions – diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia – are all conditions that can develop during pregnancy and pose risks to both you and the baby. It’s important to establish a baseline of your current health. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Anything… I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, a long, long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling off a bicycle. Does that count? Really, I haven’t been seriously ill. Just the usual colds and things. I feel… okay. Mostly. My knees ache a bit sometimes, getting up and down. But I thought that was just… old age. Is that helpful? I'm sorry I'm not very good at this. It’s all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and a broken arm are not relevant to preconception counseling, Mr. Verrall. The knee pain is something we should note, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a serious underlying condition. To get a clearer picture of your health, I’d like to perform a physical exam and order some blood tests. This will help us assess your overall health, check for any underlying conditions, and determine if you’re a suitable candidate for attempting pregnancy. Do I have your consent to proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. A check-up sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests… okay. I… I don’t mind. As long as it tells us what’s going on. Yes, you have my consent. What exactly will the blood tests be for? And… will it hurt? I'm a bit nervous, if you don't mind me saying.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will assess your basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and screen for certain infectious diseases. It's standard protocol. As for pain, the blood draw itself is usually minimal discomfort—a quick pinch. We’ll start with that, and then I’ll conduct a brief physical exam—listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick neurological assessment. Please have a seat on the examination table, and we’ll get started.
PATIENT: Okay… a quick pinch. I can handle a quick pinch. A neurological… what now? Right. Okay. Just tell me what to do, Doctor. I'll try my best. Is there a way to lie down, or is sitting alright?
DOCTOR: Sitting is fine for now, Mr. Verrall. A neurological assessment simply involves checking your reflexes and basic motor skills. It's a quick check to ensure there are no underlying neurological issues. Please relax your arms. I'm going to test your reflexes now. This may feel a little strange.
PATIENT: Oh… strange? How strange? I… I don't have very good reflexes, if I'm honest. I'm not very coordinated these days. Okay… just tell me when you're ready. And… don't hit me too hard, please. This is all a bit… unnerving.
DOCTOR: Minimal response on the right. Let’s try the left. Weak response bilaterally. Now, please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can.
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It’s… it’s not very strong, I’m afraid. My hands aren’t what they used to be. I used to be very strong, working with… well, I can't quite remember what I worked with. But not anymore. Is something wrong, Doctor? It feels like my hands are… clumsy.
DOCTOR: Weak grip strength bilaterally. Reduced reflexes. We'll need to investigate this further, Mr. Verrall. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale.
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels a bit… strange having someone listen to my chest like that. My chest feels a little… tight, sometimes. I thought it was just the dust in the house. Is that what you're listening for? Anything wrong with my heart? It hasn't been beating very regularly lately, if I'm honest. It sort of… skips a beat sometimes. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Irregular heart rhythm auscultated. Auscultation reveals some mild wheezing. This is… concerning, Mr. Verrall. Given your age, the irregular heart rhythm, reduced reflexes, weak grip strength, and slight wheezing, I recommend a comprehensive cardiac work-up, including an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. Additionally, I’ll order a complete blood count with differential, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. I’m also referring you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. Attempting pregnancy in your current condition would be… highly inadvisable.
PATIENT: Highly inadvisable…? So… you’re saying… I shouldn't? I… I just thought… I thought it might be nice. A little bit of… something. But… if it’s dangerous… What does all that mean? Cardiac work-up… echocardiogram… It sounds… serious. Is it very serious, Doctor? And… will I have to stop thinking about… about a family altogether? I'm so confused.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, a cardiac work-up will help us determine the cause of your irregular heart rhythm and assess the overall health of your heart. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of your heart; it's non-invasive and will provide a detailed image. Your current symptoms, coupled with the physical exam findings, raise significant concerns about your ability to safely carry a pregnancy to term. It does not necessarily mean you will have to abandon all thought of starting a family. However, it does mean we need to address these underlying health issues before we can even consider that possibility. For now, I strongly advise against attempting to conceive until we have a clear understanding of your cardiac status. We need to prioritize your health, Mr. Verrall. I will have the lab draw blood now, and schedule you for an ECG and echocardiogram with Cardiology as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I think so. Prioritize my health. Yes. That makes sense. I… I just wanted to… to have someone. To share things with. But not if it’s dangerous. What if… what if the cardiologist says I can't? What if my heart isn't strong enough? I’m scared, Doctor. Really scared. And… I don't even remember what I’m supposed to do anymore. Just… what should I do now?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, it is understandable that you’re feeling frightened. We will address each issue as it arises. We will begin with the cardiac work-up, which will provide a clearer picture of your heart’s health. I will personally review the results with you and discuss all available options. For now, I will have the lab technician draw the necessary blood samples. Once that's complete, the scheduler will contact you to arrange the ECG and echocardiogram appointments. Please refrain from making any significant life changes until we have a comprehensive assessment of your health. Do you have any questions before I have the lab technician come in?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. I just hope… I just hope it’s not too late to… to be happy. You can… you can just call me Smith, if you like. It feels… less formal.
