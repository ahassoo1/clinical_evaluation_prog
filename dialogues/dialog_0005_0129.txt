DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s this… this stool business. Been happenin’ a bit now, and frankly, I haven't got all day to sit around talkin' about it. It’s black, you see. Not normal black, but… well, black. And I take those pills for my joints, the red ones. Been on ‘em for years, Doctor… Cabel, is it? Years.
DOCTOR: Years, yes. I see. Black stools aren't something to ignore, regardless of how busy you are. And you said red pills for your joints… What are those, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t you worry your head about the specifics. They’re for arthritis, alright? The kind that makes everything ache. The pharmacy knows what I’m talkin’ about. I just keep gettin’ refills. Ibuprofen, I think? Something like that. Honestly, I don't bother memorizin' names. It's the effect I care about. And now this… black business. It's probably nothin', is it? I’ve always been… regular, you know.
DOCTOR: “Regular” is good. But black stools can indicate something serious, Ms. Hatchard. It's often related to bleeding in the upper digestive tract. Ibuprofen can cause that, actually – it irritates the stomach lining. Even if you’ve been on it for years, it doesn't eliminate the risk. Do you experience any stomach pain?
PATIENT: Oh, bleeding? Now see, that sounds awful dramatic. I haven’t been bleeding, Doctor. Just… black. And stomach pain? Sometimes. A little rumble, a little ache. But I’m 73! Everything aches. It’s part of bein’ old. I don't go runnin' to the doctor for every little twinge, you know. I have things to do. And frankly, this is probably just somethin’ I ate.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, I understand you’re busy, and I appreciate you coming in. But dismissing this as "something you ate" is… unwise. A little rumble and a little ache with black stools isn't typical for a benign cause. We need to investigate. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Investigate? What’s there to investigate? It’s a stool! Look, I take pills, I’m old, and now it’s black. It's a simple equation. And I don't appreciate bein’ talked down to. I’ve lived a long life, and I know my own body. No, I haven't noticed any other changes. Just… the black. Are you going to poke around in it or what?
DOCTOR: We will need a stool sample, yes. And I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Hatchard. I also want to check your vitals. And I'm going to ask some more detailed questions, and I need you to answer them honestly, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. A stool sample and poking around? Honestly. Fine. Get it over with. But I warn you, I don’t have a lot of patience. And don’t expect me to remember every little detail about what I ate last Tuesday. I have a life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's start with the stool sample. There are instructions on the table. It's a fairly simple process. After that, I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. And please, try to recall anything unusual you've eaten recently. It helps to narrow things down. Now, if you’ll just step over here… and try to relax, Ms. Hatchard. It'll be quicker if you do.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright. Don't fuss so much. It's just a stool. Honestly, you’d think I was on my deathbed. Just get it over with, Doctor. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can go home. And don’t expect me to sing you a song about my diet, either. It’s mostly sensible things. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Sensible things are good. The bathroom is just through that door. There’s a container and instructions inside. Take your time, and when you’re finished, just bring it back to me. I’ll be right here, reviewing your chart. And Ms. Hatchard?
PATIENT: What now?
DOCTOR: Please try to be as forthcoming as possible with your answers. This isn’t about “fussing,” it’s about ensuring your health. The more information you provide, the better I can understand what’s going on. We’ll get through this quickly, I assure you. Now, go ahead when you're ready.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright. You’ve made your point. Honestly, the things I put up with…
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It’s in there. Don’t expect any miracles.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hatchard. Now, if you’ll have a seat on the examination table, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then palpate your abdomen. Just a routine examination. Please lie back and relax. And perhaps, while I listen, you can tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing, even if they seem minor. Anything at all.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to talk? Fine. But don’t expect a novel. I get a little tired, you know. And don’t poke too much. It’s just… tiredness, mostly. And my joints ache. Like always. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Tiredness and joint pain, yes. Those are common. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Deep breath in… and out. Do you experience any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. Not really. Sometimes I puff a little going upstairs, but that’s just old age catching up with me. I used to be able to run up those stairs two at a time, you know. And don’t poke around too much. I bruise easily. Honestly, you young doctors are always so… thorough. It’s a bit much, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Slightly tense, yes. And that’s understandable. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little… a little rumble sometimes. But like I said, I’m 73! Everything rumbles. Don't make such a fuss. It’s probably just gas. Honestly, I’ve had better examinations. You’re poking around like a… well, never mind. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Bowel sounds are present, although a little diminished. Now, Ms. Hatchard, can you tell me about your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, here we go again with the diet. Like I said, mostly sensible things. Toast, eggs, a bit of chicken. Sometimes a biscuit with jam. I don't eat a lot of red meat anymore. It gives me… trouble. And I like a little glass of wine with dinner, if that bothers you. It helps me relax. Is that what you want to know? Every single crumb I’ve eaten for the past week? Honestly!
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have a complete picture, Ms. Hatchard. The wine is good to know. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea? No. Vomiting? Heavens, no. I haven’t been sick in years. I’m not a delicate flower, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve got a strong stomach. I told you, mostly sensible things. Really, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's just black stool, and you’re treating me like I’m on my deathbed.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I seem to be making a fuss. However, black stool, especially in someone your age, requires investigation. It's not necessarily a sign of something serious, but it could be. And ignoring it wouldn't be prudent. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a stool occult blood test - to confirm the presence of blood in the stool – and a basic metabolic panel. And I’m going to recommend an upper endoscopy.
PATIENT: An… endoscopy? What's that? Is that where you poke a camera down my… No. Absolutely not. I am not having a camera shoved down my throat. I refuse. It sounds awful. I told you, it's just a bit of black stool. It'll pass. Honestly, this is ridiculous!
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, an upper endoscopy allows us to directly visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum – the first part of your small intestine – to identify the source of the bleeding. It’s a relatively safe procedure, and we would sedate you to ensure your comfort. It's the most effective way to determine the cause of your black stool and rule out any serious conditions like ulcers, polyps, or even cancer. It's not a decision to be taken lightly, I understand. But based on your age, your symptoms, and your Ibuprofen use, it’s the most responsible course of action. We can discuss the procedure in detail, address any concerns you have, and schedule it at your convenience. But I strongly recommend it. Are you willing to consider it?
PATIENT: Cancer?! You think I have cancer? You didn’t say anything about cancer before! This is outrageous! I am not having a camera shoved down my throat because of a little bit of black stool! I’m going home. I’ve wasted enough time here. I’ll just… deal with it myself. And I’ll tell everyone what a fright you gave me! Honestly, you young doctors... just jump to the worst conclusions.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, please sit down. I did not say you have cancer. I said the endoscopy would rule it out. It's a preventative measure. And I apologize if I caused any alarm. I understand your anxiety. However, dismissing this without proper investigation could be detrimental to your health. I'm not trying to frighten you. I'm trying to provide you with the best possible care. Perhaps you would like to speak with another physician?
PATIENT: Another physician? You mean, someone who won’t try to scare me with talk of cameras and cancer? Yes. Yes, I would very much like to speak with another physician. This has been a complete waste of my time. And frankly, I’m appalled.
