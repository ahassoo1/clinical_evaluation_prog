DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, I been getting this... flushing. It happens on my face, you know? Like, red. Happens sometimes, not all the time. It's been going on... maybe a month now? I don't know exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing on your face for about a month. I see. And can you describe when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm... when it happens... that's a good question. It doesn't seem to be after eating anything special. And not after exercise, no. Sometimes it just… happens. Like, I'm sitting and reading, and then… warm face. Sometimes after talking to people, maybe? But not always. It's very strange. I don't know why it happens.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds a bit unpredictable, which can be concerning. So, it doesn’t seem reliably linked to food or activity, and sometimes it occurs even when you’re relaxed, or even during conversation?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Relaxed, talking... doesn't matter. And it's not a bad feeling, just… warm and red. Makes me a little embarrassed, but not painful or anything. My wife... she would laugh about it, say I looked like a tomato. But she... she passed away last year. So now it just feels… strange.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Withycombe. That must be incredibly difficult. And you're right, it is strange. Okay, besides the flushing, have you noticed any other symptoms happening around the same time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… a long time ago, but I still miss her. Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes, maybe a little bit… shaky. Not all over, just in my hands sometimes. And… I forget things now and then, but I always forget things! I have a very bad memory, always have. But I don't think that's new. No, I don't think so. Oh! And sometimes I feel… tired. Very tired. But everyone gets tired, right? It's hard to say what's new and what's just… me.
DOCTOR: You're right, it is hard to say what's new. Okay, so we have flushing, occasional shakiness in your hands, some forgetfulness—which you’ve always experienced—and tiredness. Let's talk about the tiredness for a moment. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days I feel fine, and can do things. Other days… I just want to sit. Just sit and do nothing. It’s not like I'm sick in bed, just… low energy. Like a battery is running down. And it's worse in the afternoon, maybe? I don't know. I mostly just sit and read when I'm tired. That doesn’t take much energy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, worse in the afternoon, and doesn't completely prevent you from functioning, but leaves you feeling low energy. I’m making notes here. Now, let’s move on to some general questions. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. Never been allergic to anything. My wife… she had allergies to pollen, but not me. Never had a problem with medicines either. I take nothing regularly, just… sometimes a pain pill for my back, when it hurts. But that's not often. No allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. And you mentioned a pain pill for your back sometimes. What kind of pain pill is that, and how often would you say you take it?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It’s… a white one. Small. I get it from the pharmacy. I don’t know the name. My wife always handled the medicines. I only take it when my back really hurts, maybe once or twice a month. Sometimes not even that. It helps a little. Just a little. I don't take it every day, no. I try not to.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll try to get the name of that pill later, if possible. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. I had high blood pressure, many years ago. The doctor put me on medicine for it. I took it for a long time. But then... I switched doctors, and he said I didn't need it anymore. So I stopped. That was… maybe ten years ago? And... I had a problem with my heart, a long time ago. They fixed it with… something. A tube, I think? But that was a long time ago too. I’ve been okay since then. I don't see the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, which was discontinued by a previous doctor, and a heart issue that was addressed with a procedure sometime in the past. I’ll need to get more details on both of those, if possible. Do you remember what kind of procedure you had for your heart?
PATIENT: That’s a hard question, Doctor. It was… a long time ago. I think… they put a tube in my leg, and then pushed it up to my heart. They said it was blocked, and they opened it up with the tube. It wasn’t surgery, I don’t think. It was… an angiogram, maybe? My wife told me. She always remembered these things. I just remember being very tired afterwards. It was many years ago, at the old hospital.
DOCTOR: An angiogram to address a blockage. That’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family... Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, I think. She was sick for a long time. And my father… he had problems with his heart. He died when he was young. And… my sister, she had something with her brain. Alzheimer’s, maybe? It was a long time ago. I don’t remember much about it. My wife… her mother had arthritis, very bad arthritis. That's all I can remember. Not a very healthy family, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes, heart problems, Alzheimer’s, and arthritis. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked. Never liked it. And I don't drink alcohol. Not even a little bit. My wife didn’t like it, so I never started. And no… no recreational drugs. Never been interested. I mostly just sit and read. A quiet life. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. Primarily a quiet lifestyle. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and generally see how you're doing. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need. I haven’t seen a doctor in a long time, so… whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I'm not very strong these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Withycombe. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given you haven't been checked in a while. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. I'll note that. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are a bit weak in your feet, but present. Reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Overall, everything seems relatively stable, but there are a few things I want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… complicated. A murmur? And weak pulses? What does that mean? Is it serious? I just want to know if it's something to worry about. I don't want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Withycombe. It does sound like a lot when I list everything all at once. The murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes when blood flows through it. It doesn’t always mean there’s a problem, but it’s something we need to investigate to be sure. The weak pulses in your feet could be due to a number of things, including circulation issues. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to order a few tests. I'm thinking an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, a blood test to check your overall health and look for any underlying conditions, and an ankle-brachial index to assess the circulation in your legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, okay. Whatever you think is best. An EKG… is that painful? And a blood test… I don't like needles. But… if it will help, then yes. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I just want to know what's wrong. And… how much will it cost? I don't have much money, you see. I'm not insured.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Withycombe. The EKG is completely painless – it involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. No needles involved at all. The blood test will involve a small needle prick, but it’s usually quick and not very painful. We can try to make it as comfortable as possible. Regarding the cost, I understand you are uninsured. Let me check the approximate cost for each test… The EKG will be approximately $150, and the blood test will be around $200. We may be able to work out a payment plan with the lab, or perhaps they have a financial assistance program. I can also see if there are any local resources that offer reduced-cost testing for uninsured patients. I will have my staff look into those options for you. For now, let's focus on getting the tests scheduled. Would you like me to schedule them here at the clinic, or would you prefer to go to a different lab?
PATIENT: Okay, $350… that’s… a lot. But I guess I have no choice. A payment plan would be good. And thank you for looking into help. Yes, please schedule them here, if that’s alright. It’s easier than going somewhere else. When can I come? And… will I need to fast for the blood test? My wife always remembered these things… but I don’t.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll get everything arranged. Yes, you will need to fast for the blood test. That means no food or drink for at least 8 hours before the appointment. I’ll give you a slip with detailed instructions. Let’s see… we can schedule the EKG for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM, and the blood test for tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… yes, that's fine. 9:00 and 2:00. I will remember that. No food, you said? Not even water? I drink a lot of water. I guess I can try. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I feel a little better now, just knowing what's going on. I just hope it's not too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. Yes, no food or drink for at least 8 hours before the blood test – water is included in that, unfortunately. It's important for accurate results. My staff will contact you to confirm the appointments and provide you with detailed instructions. We’ll get the test results back as quickly as possible, and I'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness – please don't hesitate to call the clinic or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. You've been very thorough. Thank you again. I appreciate your kindness. I guess I'll see you… tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good rest of your day, and try not to worry too much.
