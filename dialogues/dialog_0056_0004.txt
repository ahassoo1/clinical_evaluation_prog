DOCTOR: Hi Teah, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. It’s just a check-up, really. Routine immunizations, you know? I like to keep up on those if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Staying up-to-date on immunizations is really important. I see here you're 53, is that right?
PATIENT: Yep, that's right. Fifty-three this year. Feels older some days than others, ha!
DOCTOR: Ha, I hear that! Okay, well, before we get to the immunizations, let's just do a quick check-in. Have you been feeling generally healthy?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. No big complaints, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I guess. Nothing I can’t work through. I’m a building inspector, so I’m on my feet a lot. Keeps me moving, at least!
DOCTOR: Okay, a building inspector – that sounds physically demanding! Any specific aches or pains that are bothering you more than others, or anything that’s new?
PATIENT: Well, my knees sometimes bother me after a long day on a site, especially if it's been a lot of crouching or climbing. But that’s been going on for a while. Hmm… actually, now that you mention it, my shoulder has been a little stiff lately, on my right side. It’s not bad, just… there. I thought it was just sleeping wrong, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the shoulder. And the knees – how would you rate the pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. On a scale… hmm. The knees, on a bad day, maybe a 6? It doesn't stop me from working, just… makes it less enjoyable. The shoulder, it's more like a 2 or 3, just a little ache. Doesn't really interfere with anything yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, 6 for the knees and 2-3 for the shoulder. And is that pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. The knees are worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet all day. And the shoulder is… I notice it more when I reach for things up high, or when I’m trying to sleep on that side. It's not always there, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Any numbness, tingling, or weakness in either your hands or arms?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No numbness or tingling, and no weakness that I’ve noticed. Everything feels pretty normal in my hands and arms, aside from just feeling a little tired sometimes after a long day.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s quickly go through some other things. Do you have any chronic medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. I had a little scare with my blood pressure a few years back, but it went down with some diet changes and exercise. Doctor keeps an eye on it, but it’s been good for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, way back when. And I broke my wrist once, when I was learning to ride a horse. But other than that, nothing major. No serious hospital stays or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils as a kid and a broken wrist. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, if they get bad. But that's it. I try to avoid taking anything unless I really need it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no known allergies. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't had any bad reactions to any medications in the past, as far as I know. I think I might be a little sensitive to bee stings, but it's just a little local swelling, nothing serious. Not like an anaphylactic reaction or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, just mild sensitivity to bee stings. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Well, my mom had heart trouble later in life. She had a pacemaker put in, eventually. And my grandfather on my dad’s side had diabetes. Those are the big ones, I think. A couple of aunts had breast cancer, but that’s about it. Nothing too widespread.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mom and diabetes in your grandfather. And breast cancer in a couple of aunts. Last question for now – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I don't really drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner every now and then, on special occasions. Definitely no recreational drugs. I like to stay pretty healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know. Thanks for answering all those questions, Teah. It gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees and shoulder. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not terribly concerning given you mentioned a previous issue. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Could you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Sure. There we go. A little creaky, but they still work! I can feel a little stiffness there, definitely. And a bit of tenderness on the inside of both knees.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some mild swelling on both knees and there's some tenderness when I palpate the medial joint line. Range of motion is good, but it sounds like there’s a bit of crepitus. Now, let's check that shoulder. Can you lift your arm up, and then rotate it inward and outward?
PATIENT: Okay. It's a little stiff going outward, definitely. Feels…tight. And there's a bit of discomfort when I rotate it that way. Not sharp pain, just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some mild tightness in your rotator cuff muscles and there's some discomfort with external rotation. No obvious signs of injury, but it seems like you might have some mild tendinitis or bursitis. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you have some mild osteoarthritis in your knees and some possible tendinitis or bursitis in your shoulder. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which we should keep an eye on. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That makes sense, honestly. My mom had trouble with her knees too. So osteoarthritis… is that something I’ll just have to…deal with? And what about the shoulder? Will that just go away on its own, or do I need to do something about it? And what about the blood pressure? Should I be worried? I feel fine, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, those are all excellent questions. Let's tackle them one by one. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition, meaning it gets progressively worse over time, but it's very manageable with lifestyle changes and treatment. It doesn’t mean you’ll be in constant pain. We can focus on things like weight management, low-impact exercise, and over-the-counter pain relievers when needed. Physical therapy can also be very helpful. As for your shoulder, mild tendinitis or bursitis often resolves on its own with rest, ice, and over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication. I recommend avoiding activities that aggravate it. If it doesn’t improve within a couple of weeks, we can consider a cortisone injection. And finally, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not at a level that requires immediate medication. I’d like you to monitor it at home for a week and keep a log. We'll also repeat it during your next visit. I also recommend continuing the healthy diet and exercise that have helped you in the past. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Monitoring the blood pressure at home makes sense, and I can definitely lay off the heavy lifting for a bit. And I will look into some gentle exercises for my knees. I've got a friend who does water aerobics, maybe I'll give that a try. So, what about the immunizations? What do I need today? I think I’m due for a tetanus booster, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, great! Water aerobics is a fantastic option for your knees. You’re right, you are due for a tetanus booster. And it’s also time for your annual flu shot, even though it’s early in the season. And I also recommend getting the updated COVID-19 booster. Would you like to get those all today?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Let's get them all done. The sooner the better, I figure. I'd rather get it over with than worry about catching anything.
DOCTOR: Great. Alright, all done. You may experience some mild soreness at the injection site for a day or two. Over-the-counter pain relievers can help with that. I also recommend staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly, and I feel much better knowing what’s going on. It was a good visit. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teah. I'm glad I could help. Here's a summary of our visit, including instructions for monitoring your blood pressure and information about managing your knees and shoulder. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to discuss your blood pressure readings and how you’re feeling. If you experience any worsening pain, fever, or other concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a great day!
PATIENT: Thank you, you too. I will. .
