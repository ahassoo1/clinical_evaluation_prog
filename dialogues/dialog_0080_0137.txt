DOCTOR: Hi Lindra, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My husband… he think I need… paper for the old people place? For live there. He say I need checkup first. I am Lindra.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lindra, that’s perfectly understandable. It sounds like your husband is wanting to make sure you’re healthy enough before considering a move to an assisted living facility, and that requires a check-up. That's very thoughtful of him. So, just to clarify, he’s suggesting assisted living, and they need some paperwork from a doctor confirming your overall health. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Paperwork. He worry… he say I fall sometimes. Not too bad fall, but… he worry. I feel okay mostly. Old, but okay. He do all the thinking now, my husband.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good he's looking out for you, and it’s smart to get things checked out, especially with the falls. We'll do a thorough assessment to see what’s going on. Okay, Lindra, let's start with a little bit about the falls. Can you tell me more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm… how many? I don’t know exactly. Maybe… three times this year? One time in the garden, trip on the hose. One time in the kitchen, reaching for… what was I reaching for? Oh, the sugar. And… I think one time in the bathroom. Small falls. I not break anything. Just… scare me. My husband get very upset. He yell a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, three falls this year, no broken bones, but they’ve been upsetting for both of you. That gives me a good starting point. And it’s helpful to know your husband gets worried. We'll definitely look into why these are happening. Now, besides the falls, are you having any other health concerns?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My knees, they bother me sometimes. When it rain, very bad. And… I get tired easily. Walking to the store… hard now. Used to walk everywhere. Now… not so good. And… I forget things. Not all the time, but… like what I eat for breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we’ve got knee pain, especially with the weather, fatigue, and some memory issues. That’s helpful to know. The memory issues – can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: It's small things, Doctor. Like names… sometimes I forget names of people I know. Or… where I put my glasses. I find them later, always. But… I worry it will get worse. My sister, she had… problems with her mind. Very bad. I don't want that.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Lindra, especially with your sister’s history. It's good you're being proactive about getting this checked out. We'll do some simple tests to assess your memory and figure out what’s going on. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that I should be aware of, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor told me many years ago. I take the little white pills. Every morning. I think it’s okay now. He say it is controlled. No… no diabetes. I like sweet things, but no diabetes. And… I had a problem with my heart, a long time ago. They put a little… thing in my leg. For the heart. I don’t remember what it's called.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a history of a heart condition with a procedure involving something in your leg—likely a stent or a bypass, but we can check the records. That’s very useful information. Do you remember when you had the heart procedure?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time ago. Maybe… fifteen years ago? Maybe longer. I was in the hospital for many days. Very sick. My husband… he was very worried then too. He sleep in the hospital with me. It was a big surgery. I don't remember much else. It was before we move here.
DOCTOR: Okay, about fifteen years ago, a significant heart procedure. We'll definitely look up the details in your medical records to get the specifics. Now, have you had any other surgeries or hospital stays besides that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I break my arm once, when I was a little girl. Fall from a tree. And… my gallbladder. They take it out many years ago. Very sick after that. But… that was a long time ago. I don’t think I have been in the hospital for anything else. Mostly just… doctor visits.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, gallbladder removal, and otherwise regular doctor visits. That's good to know. Now, let's talk about medications. You mentioned the little white pills for your blood pressure—can you tell me the name of those, if you know it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I don’t know the name. My husband, he get them for me. I just take them. They are small and white. And… I take a little purple pill sometimes, for my knees. When they hurt very bad. I think it's for the pain. That one, my daughter get for me. She is a nurse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so small white pills for blood pressure, and a purple pill for knee pain, as needed. We'll check your medication list in the records to confirm exactly what those are. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. No allergies. I eat everything. My husband, he is the one with the allergies. He can't eat shrimp. But me… everything is okay. No problems. I like to cook, you know.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, no allergies. Okay, Lindra, we’ve covered a lot of important information. To finish up this part, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had… the high blood pressure too. And my father… he had problems with his heart. Like me. And… my sister, like I say, she had the problems with her mind. Very sad. And… my brother, he had the diabetes. So… high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes… and the mind problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes, and memory issues. That's helpful information. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently smoking, drinking alcohol, or using any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, no! I don't smoke. Never smoke. My husband, he used to smoke, but he stop many years ago. And… I drink a little wine sometimes, with dinner. Just a small glass. And… no, no drugs. I am a good woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drugs. That’s good. Now, Lindra, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes that is okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then take a look at your reflexes and check your balance. It won’t take long. First, let's check your blood pressure. 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds regular, but there's a slight murmur, which we’ll note. Your lungs sound clear, but a bit diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes.
PATIENT: Okay. Murmur? Diminished? Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good you asked. The murmur isn't necessarily bad – many people have innocent heart murmurs that don’t require treatment. It just means there's a slightly unusual sound when your heart beats. We’ll want to keep an eye on it. The diminished breath sounds could be related to your age, or potentially some mild congestion. We’ll want to look at a chest x-ray just to be sure everything is clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little slow, but that's not uncommon. Now, I'd like to check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly and try to balance on one leg for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Okay… one leg… Oh… I can’t do it very well. I feel… unsteady.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lindra. It’s common to have some difficulty with balance as we get older. This confirms some of my concerns. Now, I’m going to do a very quick cognitive assessment to check your memory and thinking skills. It's just a few simple questions. Are you okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, yes questions are okay. I will try my best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, first, can you tell me what today's date is?
PATIENT: Hmm… today… August… the second? August second, 2025. I think.
DOCTOR: That's right. Good. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Oh dear… in the… doctor’s office? In the… Rural clinic? Yes, I think so. It is a long drive from my house.
DOCTOR: That's right, you're doing great. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words back to me. Listen carefully: Apple, table, penny. Repeat those three words back to me when I’m finished. Apple, table, penny.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny… …Apple… penny… um… was there another one? I forget…
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It’s normal to have some difficulty with recall. Based on the physical exam and quick assessment, Lindra, I am concerned about some cognitive decline, and the balance issues. I want to order some blood work to check for any underlying causes of cognitive changes. I also want to get a chest x-ray to evaluate those diminished breath sounds. And finally, I'm going to order a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Neurologist? Chest x-ray? Oh dear… that sounds… serious. Is it very bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking, and I understand your concern. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is very bad, Lindra. These tests are just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The neurologist will be able to assess your memory and thinking skills in more detail, and the chest x-ray will rule out any lung problems. We're being proactive here, and early detection is always best. I also recommend physical therapy to work on your balance and strength. Would you be open to a referral for that as well?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… I think that sounds good. I am always falling, my husband say so. I want to be steady. The other things… the neurologist… I will do what you say, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will write the referrals for the neurologist and physical therapy now. The lab orders will be sent electronically to the lab at Rural Hospital. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. I'll also write you a prescription for a Vitamin D supplement. It's often low in people who don’t get much sun exposure and can contribute to weakness and balance problems. As for today, I'm recommending you continue with your usual activities, but avoid situations where you might fall. And please, let your husband know about the results and our plan. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… will I be okay, Doctor? Will I… lose my mind, like my sister?
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable fear, Lindra. I can’t guarantee anything, but we are taking steps to figure out what’s going on and address it. Many things can cause memory problems, and not all of them are progressive. We'll get the results of the tests back as soon as possible, and we’ll talk about them in detail. And we’ll have a plan in place to support you and your husband every step of the way. I understand this is scary, but you are not alone in this. We are here to help you, and we'll work together to ensure you receive the best possible care. Would you like me to write a note to your husband summarizing everything we discussed?
PATIENT: Yes… please, write the note. He worry so much. He needs to know everything. Thank you, Doctor Rosanova. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindra. It's my pleasure to help. Here you go. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with me in about a month, so we can discuss the results of the tests. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Take care of yourself, Lindra, and remember, we’re here for you. .
