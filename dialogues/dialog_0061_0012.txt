DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Velda! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. My name is Velda Squiers. I'm hoping you can help me with a wee bit of paperwork, if you don't mind. I'm planning a cruise – a lovely one to the Mediterranean – and they require some medical information before I can go. Just a few things filled out, I expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, Velda, that's perfectly alright. We can definitely get that paperwork filled out for you. It's good you're being proactive about that – cruise lines often have specific requirements. Let me pull up your chart here... Ah, yes, Velda Squiers, age 45. I see you're of Scottish descent. And your height and weight are listed as 171cm and 109lbs, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly correct, Doctor. 171 centimetres and 109 pounds. I haven’t changed much in years, thankfully. It’s good to know everything is still accurate on your end. Is there anything specific you need me to confirm, or shall we just move on to the forms?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear! Alright, before we jump into the forms, just to be thorough, I'd like to ask a few questions – just a quick overview of your general health. It helps me fill out the paperwork accurately. First, are you currently experiencing any health problems or have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not as far as I'm aware, Doctor. I've been generally quite well, touch wood. I had a bit of a cold last winter, like everyone else, but nothing serious. I don’t take any regular medication, if that’s what you’re asking. My late husband, God rest his soul, he had a touch of high blood pressure, but that was years ago, and I don't have that problem myself. Is there anything in particular you are concerned about?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. No current health problems and no medications – excellent. And a family history of high blood pressure, noted. Just to be complete, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, actually, when I was a young woman – maybe twenty-two or so – I had my appendix removed. A very routine operation, thankfully. And, oh, when I broke my wrist a few years back. Just a clean break, a plaster cast for six weeks, and it healed up perfectly well. Nothing major, I assure you. Is that the sort of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly the sort of thing I need to know, thank you. Appendectomy and a wrist fracture, noted. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I eat almost anything, thankfully. My husband used to say I had a cast iron stomach! I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. And no allergies to things like pollen or dust, or animals either. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. I suppose I'm pretty plain, really, when it comes to allergies.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful! No known allergies is excellent. Now, just a couple more questions to get a good overall picture. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor. I've never touched a cigarette in my life! My mother smoked, sadly, and it wasn't a pretty sight. I’ve always been strongly opposed to it. My husband didn't smoke either, thank goodness. It’s just never appealed to me, and I try to stay away from being around others who do. A bad habit, I always thought.
DOCTOR: That’s great to hear, Velda. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a wee bit, Doctor. A glass of wine with my dinner maybe, a few times a week. Nothing excessive, I assure you! And I certainly wouldn't drive after having even a single glass. It's mostly just for enjoyment with a nice meal. My husband and I always enjoyed a good red wine. But I wouldn't say I drink heavily, not at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass of wine a few times a week – noted. Alright, Velda, that gives me a pretty good overview of your health history. Now, we can move on to filling out the forms for the cruise line. Do you have them with you, or would you like me to print some out?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful news, Doctor. I do have them right here, thank you. They’re a bit… extensive, as you might expect. I believe they came as a PDF attachment in an email. I just wasn't sure what they needed me to write in particular. Here you are, if you wouldn't mind taking a look?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Velda. Let's see... Yes, quite detailed! They're asking about recent hospitalizations, major illnesses, medications, allergies... all the things we covered, thankfully. And some questions about your travel plans - any chronic conditions that might be exacerbated by travel. We can just go through this section by section. Do you want me to read each question aloud, and you can tell me what to write, or are you happy to fill it out yourself, and I can just review it at the end?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. I think perhaps if you read the questions, that would be best. My eyes aren't what they used to be, and I wouldn't want to misunderstand anything. It’s awfully thoughtful of you to offer. It's just a bit… fiddly, with all the boxes and small print, you understand. Starting at the top, if you wouldn’t mind?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Velda. That’s what I’m here for. Let’s start at the top. “Have you been hospitalized or required emergency care in the past five years?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t, Doctor. Not at all. As I said, the wrist was years ago, and that was just a straightforward fracture. Nothing serious requiring hospitalisation in the last five years, thankfully. A bit of a cold, perhaps, but nothing more than a few days in bed with a cup of tea. Shall I write 'No' in that box, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, please write 'No' there. Alright, next question: "Do you have any chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, kidney disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. Thankfully, I’ve always been quite healthy. My husband used to say I was as strong as an ox! No heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, kidney disease, or cancer, as far as I am aware. I've had the usual check-ups with the doctor, of course, and everything has always been perfectly fine. 'No' again, I presume?
DOCTOR: Yes, 'No' is correct. “Are you currently taking any medications, including prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As I've mentioned, I don’t take anything at all. Not even a vitamin tablet! I try to get all my nutrients from a healthy diet, and it seems to be working quite well. ‘No’ it is. I do hope I’m not being too repetitive, but I really am quite a healthy person, you see.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Velda! It's good to be thorough, and it's perfectly fine to repeat yourself. It helps me to get a clear picture. “Do you have any allergies to medications, food, insects, latex, or other substances?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely none. As I said earlier, I eat almost anything, and I've never had a reaction to anything at all. I’ve never been stung by a bee or anything like that, thankfully. It’s just one of those things – I’ve always been very lucky, I suppose. I shall write 'No' once more, if you don’t mind? I’m starting to feel rather silly repeating myself, but I want to be absolutely certain I haven’t missed anything.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Velda. It’s good to be careful, especially with something like travel. “Please list any surgeries or hospitalizations you have had in the past…”. You mentioned your appendectomy and wrist fracture earlier – would you like me to write those down here for you, including roughly when they were?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be wonderful. The appendectomy… let me think… that must have been around 1983, I think. I was about twenty-two years old. And the wrist fracture was… oh, goodness… 2018, I believe. A silly accident – tripped over the rug, unfortunately. Everything healed up perfectly, thankfully, but yes, please write those down. Thank you so much for taking the time to do this for me. It's a bit of a relief to get it all down in writing, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, I have "Appendectomy - 1983" and "Wrist Fracture - 2018" noted. The next section asks about travel plans – specifically, if you have any conditions that might be affected by travel, like motion sickness, difficulty breathing, or heart problems. Since you don’t have any of those, we can mark ‘No’ there as well, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly correct, Doctor. No motion sickness, no difficulty breathing, no heart problems at all. I'm a fairly robust traveller, if I may say so myself! I've been on a few holidays over the years, and I’ve never had any trouble. I enjoy a good long journey, as a matter of fact. Yes, please mark 'No' on that section as well. I'm just glad to be getting this paperwork sorted, so I can finally confirm my cruise booking. It’s a Mediterranean one, you see, and I’ve always dreamt of going.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s most of the medical history questions completed. The next section asks for your emergency contact information – name, phone number, relationship. Do you want me to leave that for you to fill in, or would you like me to write it down now?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please, Doctor, if you wouldn’t mind. That would be very kind of you. My daughter, Fiona, is my emergency contact. Her number is 0141 555 1212 – it’s a mobile number. And she is my daughter, of course. I'll need to double-check the area code to make sure it’s correct. It's a Scottish number, you see. Just a moment... Yes, that's right. 0141 555 1212. Fiona is very reliable, you see, and she lives fairly close by.
DOCTOR: Alright, I have Fiona’s number – 0141 555 1212 – noted. And you said she’s your daughter. That completes the medical information section. The last page is just a consent form, giving the cruise line permission to contact you in case of an emergency and to seek medical care if needed. Would you like me to read that over with you, or are you happy to just sign it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please, Doctor, if you wouldn’t mind reading it over with me. It’s always best to be certain about these things, you see. I'm perfectly happy to sign it, of course, but I'd like to understand exactly what I'm consenting to. I'm a bit old-fashioned, perhaps, but I like to know the details before I commit to anything. It's just a bit of peace of mind, you see.
DOCTOR: “This form provides consent for [Cruise Line Name] to obtain and share your medical information with healthcare professionals as needed during your voyage. This includes the authority to seek medical care, including emergency treatment, if you are unable to provide consent yourself. It also allows the cruise line to contact your emergency contact in case of a medical situation…” Does that sound reasonable to you, Velda?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Absolutely. It makes perfect sense, of course. I would expect them to be able to seek medical care if I were unable to do so myself. And contacting my daughter in an emergency is the sensible thing to do. It's all very straightforward, really. Yes, I'm happy to sign that. It’s just good to know they’re prepared for anything, you see. A responsible cruise line, I expect.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please sign and date it at your convenience. Wonderful. That completes all the necessary paperwork. I’ll make a copy for your records, and you can take the original with you. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful news, Doctor! Thank you so much for your help with all of this. You’ve been very patient and kind. No, I don’t think I do have any further questions, thank you. You’ve covered everything so thoroughly. I suppose I should just get this back to the cruise company, and then I can finally relax and start packing! Is there anything you need from me, before I leave? A payment, perhaps?
DOCTOR: No payment is needed, Velda. There's no charge for completing this form for you. I'm just glad I could help. And no, I don't need anything further from you. You can simply take the original form back to the cruise company. Enjoy your cruise to the Mediterranean! It sounds like a wonderful trip. If you have any health concerns before your trip, don't hesitate to call the clinic and schedule an appointment. And, of course, if anything happens during your cruise that requires medical attention, don't delay in seeking help from the ship's medical staff. Safe travels!
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. I really do appreciate your help and your time. I shall certainly keep that in mind, thank you. I will be sure to contact the ship's medical staff if anything arises, and I'll remember your clinic if I need anything beforehand. It’s very reassuring to know you're here. Thank you again for everything. Have a lovely day, Doctor! I expect I'll be far too busy enjoying myself on the cruise to worry about anything medical, but it’s good to know I’m prepared, just in case! Goodbye!
DOCTOR: You too, Velda! Enjoy every moment of your cruise. And don't forget your sunscreen! Goodbye, and safe travels!
