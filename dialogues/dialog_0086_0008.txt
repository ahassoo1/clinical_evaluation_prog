DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… my ear. It feels… full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? It’s been… a while, I think. Honestly, dates… they slip my mind these days. It’s just… annoying, mostly. Makes it hard to hear things.
DOCTOR: "Annoying," right. Well, we should certainly investigate. “A while,” you say… can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… Hmm. Not really, no. Weeks, maybe? Possibly months? It came on slowly, I think. Not a sudden thing. I mostly just… ignore things until they bother me too much. My wife… she used to handle all this sort of thing. It’s difficult now, without her. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss can certainly disrupt routines. Alright, let’s focus on the ear for now. Is there any pain associated with this fullness?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Not a sharp pain, anyway. More like… pressure, sometimes. A dull ache, if I really concentrate on it. But usually, it's just… muffled. Like I'm underwater, a little bit. Does that make sense? It’s not hurting me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: "Underwater," yes, I suppose I can visualize that. And has this affected your balance at all?
PATIENT: Balance… Now that you mention it… maybe? I’ve been a bit clumsy lately, I guess. Knocked over a flowerpot the other day, which was… unfortunate. I just thought I was getting old! I work outside a lot, checking fields… uneven ground, you know. Hard to say if it's the ear or just my feet.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, clumsiness can have many causes. Let’s rule out anything ear-related. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any discharge?
PATIENT: Ringing… Sometimes. A very faint ringing, mostly at night when it’s quiet. It's not constant, thankfully. And no, no discharge. Just… full. That’s the main problem. A blocked feeling. It’s really quite irritating when I’m trying to talk to people. I have to ask them to repeat themselves a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look inside your ear, then. Please sit up and face me. I'm going to use this instrument to examine your ear canal and eardrum. It might feel a little cool. Just try to remain still.
PATIENT: Okay. Still… yes, I can do still. It’s not the most comfortable chair, but I can manage. Just… get it over with quickly, if you don’t mind. I have a lot to do today. Fields don’t inspect themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there's quite a bit of cerumen—earwax—present, obstructing the view. And the eardrum appears… slightly dull. Not bulging, thankfully, but definitely not perfectly clear. I see no signs of acute infection, which is good. It appears you have a significant impaction of earwax. That’s likely the cause of your fullness and muffled hearing.
PATIENT: Earwax, you say? Is that… bad? I never really paid much attention to it before. My wife… she used to take care of things like that. Can you just… remove it? Is it painful? I'd rather not have a lot of fuss, if possible.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad”, Mr. Guerrerolopez, but excessive buildup can cause these symptoms. And yes, we can remove it. It's a fairly simple procedure. We can try irrigation – flushing it out with warm water. It can be a little uncomfortable – a brief sensation of pressure – but generally not painful. If that doesn’t work, we may need to use manual removal with specialized instruments. Do you have any history of ear problems, perforations, or surgeries?
PATIENT: Perforations… surgeries… Honestly, Doctor, I’m really not sure. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. I’ve had… various things over the years, I suppose. Nothing major, as far as I recall. No, I don’t think so. I never had any tubes put in my ears, if that’s what you mean. My wife would have remembered if I did, and she… she always kept excellent records.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see no record of any ear surgeries or perforations in your EHR. Given your history – or lack thereof – we'll proceed cautiously with irrigation. I’m going to warm some water, and then we’ll flush your ear. Let me know if you feel any sharp pain at any point, and we'll stop immediately.
PATIENT: Okay. Quickly, if you please, Doctor. I really must get back to the fields. The tomatoes are ripening, you know, and they don't wait for anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright, leaning your head slightly to the left… good. Here we go… just a warm sensation, hopefully. Let me know if you feel any pain. Any discomfort?
PATIENT: A little… pressure. Like something’s… moving. It’s not painful, exactly. More… strange. Like bubbles, maybe? Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, the bubbles are the water breaking up the wax. And some wax is coming out, which is good. Let's try a little more. Still no sharp pain?
PATIENT: No, no sharp pain. Just… a weird sensation. Like… something’s blocked, but it's… loosening, maybe? It’s… difficult to describe. Honestly, Doctor, I’d rather just get it done. Is it nearly finished? My fields…
DOCTOR: Okay, that should be enough for now. Much better. The ear canal is significantly clearer, and I can see the eardrum much more clearly now. It still looks slightly dull, but that could be normal variation. Your hearing should improve over the next few hours as the remaining wax drains. We've removed the bulk of the impaction.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s… good. Really good. So I can go now? To my fields, I mean. I appreciate you getting it over with quickly, Doctor. My tomatoes… they really need attention.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go. However, I’m writing you a prescription for some ear drops—mineral oil—to help soften any remaining wax and prevent future buildup. Use as directed. And if your hearing doesn’t improve significantly within a few days, or if you experience any pain, drainage, or dizziness, you need to see an ENT specialist immediately. Here’s a referral. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Ear drops… right. And a specialist, if it doesn’t get better. Yes, I think so. I’ll… try to remember. Honestly, keeping track of things is… difficult. Mineral oil… I’ll ask my neighbor to remind me. Thank you, Doctor. I really must be going now. Fields are waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Try to rest and follow the instructions carefully. And please, don't hesitate to seek further medical attention if needed. .
