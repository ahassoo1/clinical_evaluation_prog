DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s these little spells, you see. Confusion, they call it. My wife, she’s the one who insisted I come. Says I ask the same questions twice, forget where I put things… it’s not that bad, really. But she worries.
DOCTOR: Confusion, you say. And your wife is the one who noticed it primarily?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. She has a very good memory, my wife. Better than mine, certainly. Though I wouldn’t say I'm completely lost. Just… moments. Like trying to remember a name on the tip of your tongue, but it won’t come. Or walking into a room and… forgetting why you went in there. Small things. Though she makes a bigger deal of it than I do. It’s probably just old age, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good she’s observant. These things can be normal with age, you're right. But it's always best to rule out anything else that might be going on. Just to be sure. So, these “moments”… how long has this been happening, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s not sudden, you see. It’s been… creeping up, I suppose. Maybe six months? Six or eight months, at least. At first, it was just misplacing things. My tools, mostly. A tile nipper here, a trowel there. But then it started with the questions… asking my wife what day it is, or what we had for dinner. Things like that. It's not like I don't know these things, it just… slips my mind. For a moment.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight months. And it seems to be gradually worsening. Do these moments happen at specific times of day, or does it seem random?
PATIENT: Random, mostly. Though… now that you mention it, they seem to be worse in the afternoons. When it’s hot, like it has been lately. I work outside, you see, setting tile. It’s hard work, under the sun. Perhaps the heat… gets to me. I always drink plenty of water, though. My wife makes sure of that. She's very diligent.
DOCTOR: That’s good you’re staying hydrated. Heat exhaustion can certainly cause confusion. But we want to explore other possibilities as well. Aside from the confusion and memory lapses, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. My wife says I’ve become a bit more… irritable. Snappish, she calls it. Not a nice way to put it, if you ask me, but she's right, I suppose. Small things bother me more easily. And I… I haven’t been sleeping as well lately. Wake up in the middle of the night, and can’t get back to sleep. Thinking about… things. Mostly work, to be honest. Making sure everything’s done right. I take pride in my work, you see. But it keeps me up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased irritability and trouble sleeping as well. Do you have any difficulty with balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance? Not really. I’m still steady on my feet. Been setting tile for forty years, you need a good balance for that! Though… sometimes, when I stand up quickly, I feel a little… dizzy. Just for a moment. Like the room is spinning. It doesn’t happen often. But it has happened a few times lately. More than it used to, I think. It’s probably just getting old, though. Everything gets a bit shaky as you get older, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It can be part of aging, yes. But we’ll want to rule out other causes. Now, have you had any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: My vision? Well, it’s not what it used to be, naturally. I need glasses for reading, and for seeing things close up. But I’ve had the same prescription for… oh, maybe five years now? No, nothing new. No blurriness, no double vision, nothing like that. Just… getting older. Everything fades a bit, doesn’t it? I go to the eye doctor regularly. He says it’s just age-related. Though my wife thinks I should get a stronger prescription. She’s always worried about me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that's about it. High blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control with medication for years now. I see Dr. Chen down the street for that. He's a good doctor. No other serious illnesses. Nothing like diabetes or heart problems. I eat pretty healthy, mostly rice and fish. My wife makes sure of that too. She's very particular about what we eat. Never smoked, never drank much alcohol. She worries about my health, you see. Always has. Is that enough? I’m not one for remembering dates and details, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful. Appendectomy, controlled hypertension… No other significant medical problems. Let's talk about medications. You mentioned something for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for… oh, I don’t know, maybe ten years now? Dr. Chen adjusts it when needed. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take Ibuprofen. But not every day. Just when I need it. That’s about it. I don’t like taking too many pills, honestly. My wife keeps track of everything. She has a chart on the refrigerator. Very organized, she is. Is that enough detail? I don’t want to bore you with all this.
DOCTOR: No, this is very good. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of pollen in the spring, but that’s it. Nothing serious. A little sneezing, a little itchy eyes. Nothing that requires medication. My wife checks the pollen count every day and makes sure I stay indoors when it’s high. She’s very cautious, she is. Always looking out for me. Is there anything else you need to know? I feel like I’m rambling now.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all. This is all very helpful information, thank you. Now, to finish up, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Well, my parents both lived to be old, into their eighties. My father was a farmer, strong as an ox. My mother… she had arthritis, like me. And she… I think she had some memory problems when she got older, but no one ever talked about it much. It’s not something we Cambodians talk about openly, you see. And my siblings… they’re all healthy, as far as I know. No one with… with any serious brain problems. Just the usual aches and pains. My wife… her mother had heart problems. That’s about it. Is that enough? I’m not very good at remembering things like that, honestly. It’s all a bit hazy. Is there anything else?
DOCTOR: No, that’s fine. Thank you, Mr. Lason. Now, I think it’s time for a quick physical exam. Just to get a better overall picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It’s not the confusion itself, really. It’s… worrying my wife. And when she worries, I worry. So, yes. Do whatever you need to do. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just hop up on the table here. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Then I’ll check your reflexes, balance, and do a brief neurological assessment. It won’t take long. Just breathe normally for me.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just tell me what you want me to do. I'll try my best. It's just… I don't like being poked and prodded, if you don't mind. My wife says I'm a bit of a baby. But she's probably right. Now, go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mr. Lason. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, a slight murmur, but that's not uncommon with age. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could I have you cross your legs?
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm trying to be still. It's just… my knees feel a bit stiff today. It's probably the weather. My wife says I'm getting old. She's probably right. But go ahead. Do what you need to do. I'm ready. Just… be careful, okay? I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but that's not unexpected at your age. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Could you stand up slowly for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright. Here I go. Slowly… slowly… Just… be careful, Doctor. I don’t want to fall. I feel a little dizzy already. It's probably just getting old. Is that enough? I don't like being on my feet for too long. It makes me feel… wobbly.
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy there. Yes, that’s good. You are a little unsteady. And I do see some slight swaying. Let’s just sit back down for a moment. Okay. Now, I'm going to do a very quick memory test. I’m going to say three words, and then I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me. Can you do that?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. A memory test. Alright. Three words, you say? Yes. I can do that. I used to have a very good memory, you know. I could remember everything. But lately… it’s not what it used to be. Go ahead. Say the words. I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Alright. The three words are… apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Um… Apple… table… and… um… …Something shiny… a coin… I can’t… I can’t remember! Oh dear. This is not good, is it? My mind is a complete blank. I knew it. I'm losing it.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's alright, Mr. Lason. Don't worry. It's just a quick test. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: Hmm… The year… Let me see… Is it… 2023? No… 2024? Oh dear. I can’t… I can’t remember the year! It’s right on the tip of my tongue, but I just can’t grasp it. My wife is going to be so worried.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's alright. We'll figure this out. Now, what city are we in?
PATIENT: City…? Is it… Phnom Penh? No… That's Cambodia… Is it… Long Beach? No… I… I don’t know! My mind is a complete blank. I’m so confused. I’m so sorry. I feel like I’m losing my mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Based on what I’m seeing, and the results of the quick assessment… I think it's important to run some further tests. Your recent memory lapses, combined with the difficulty recalling the year and city, are concerning. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but we need to investigate the possibility of some cognitive impairment. I want to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. And I’d also like to schedule an MRI of your brain. This will help us rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI…? What does that mean? Is it serious? Is something wrong with my brain? I… I don't know. My wife is going to be so worried. She already worries so much about me. What if… what if it’s something bad? What if I… I forget who she is? Just… tell me the truth, Doctor. Is it serious? And what will happen to me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, it's understandable that you’re worried, and I want to reassure you that we’re going to do everything we can to figure this out. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging test that will give us a detailed picture of your brain. It doesn’t hurt, and it will help us rule out things like stroke, tumors, or other structural problems. Right now, it's too early to say definitively what's going on. The symptoms you're experiencing could be caused by a number of things, including normal age-related changes, medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, or a more serious condition. I want to be upfront with you – the possibility of some cognitive impairment needs to be investigated. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something serious. Many conditions can cause memory problems, and some are treatable. The next step is to get these tests done so we can have a better understanding of what’s going on and develop a plan. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available, and I’ll answer all of your questions. I’m also going to refer you to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. They can perform a more thorough cognitive assessment and provide additional guidance. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A neurologist… more tests… Alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. If it will help figure out what’s going on, I’ll do it. I just… I just want to know what’s happening to me. And I want to be able to… to remember my wife. That’s all. Can you at least tell me… is it something I did? Is it my fault? I’ve always taken care of myself. I’ve never smoked, never drank much… Is it something I should have done differently?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, it’s absolutely not your fault. There’s nothing you did to cause this, and there’s nothing you should have done differently. These things can happen for a number of reasons, and often, it’s simply a matter of age or genetics. It’s not a reflection of your lifestyle or choices. We'll run these tests to get a better understanding, and then we can discuss all of your options. It’s important to remember that even if it is something more serious, there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. I’m going to have my nurse, Sarah, come in and schedule the blood work and MRI for you. She’ll also give you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, the neurologist. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I just… I’m scared, Doctor. That’s all. Scared of forgetting… scared of what’s going to happen. Just… please, do everything you can to help me. And please, tell me the truth. I want to know what’s happening to me, even if it’s bad. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lason. I promise to do everything I can to help you, and I will always be honest with you, every step of the way. It’s okay to be scared, and I want you to know that you’re not alone in this. We'll face this together. I'll have Sarah come in now to get the ball rolling. Is there anyone you’d like me to contact for you?
PATIENT: Yes… my wife. Her name is… Mei. Mei Lason. She’s… she’s the one who brought me here. She’s very worried about me. Please, tell her everything. And… ask her to come with me to the neurologist appointment. I… I don’t think I can do it alone. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for everything. I just… I just want to be able to remember my wife. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I will absolutely contact Mei and let her know what’s going on, and I’ll be sure to encourage her to come with you to the neurologist appointment. You shouldn’t have to go through this alone. I’ll have Sarah come in now to get everything set up. In the meantime, just try to relax, okay?
