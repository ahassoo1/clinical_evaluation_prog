DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. I am Dr. Blim. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this cough. It just won’t go away. It’s been… oh, goodness, feels like months now. And with my heart, you know, I get worried. It just feels different this time.
DOCTOR: "Months," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, months. Maybe three, maybe four? Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? It started small, just a little tickle. Now it’s… well, it’s enough to keep me up at night sometimes. And I get so breathless with it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And you mentioned your heart. Are you currently under the care of a cardiologist?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Doctor Ramirez, over at City Hospital. He's a good man. I see him every six months, regular as clockwork. He’s the one who told me about the… the heart failure, a few years back now. He’s got all the details, of course.
DOCTOR: Very good. And are you taking all the medications Dr. Ramirez prescribed?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Every single one. I have a chart on my fridge, and my daughter, Elena, she helps me make sure I don’t miss any. She's very good about that, Elena is. Let me see… there's Lasix, and… Lisinopril, and something for the… the rhythm, Digoxin, I think it is. All at the same time, every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: And besides these medications, are you taking any other pills, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Just a little bit of Vitamin D, Doctor. The Ramirez said my levels were low. And sometimes, when my knees are acting up, I take some glucosamine. Just when they’re really bad, though. Not every day, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Sadhu, let's focus on this cough. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a… a dry cough. It brings up some phlegm, a little bit. Sometimes it's clear, sometimes… yellowish. And it feels deep, down in my chest. Like something’s rattling around in there. It’s worse when I lie down, definitely. And it makes me feel… tired. Just completely worn out.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats accompanying this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever that I've noticed. Elena checks me with the thermometer sometimes, when she comes over. And no chills, or sweats. I sleep pretty soundly, actually, when the cough isn’t bothering me. It's just… this cough. It’s draining, you know? Makes everything harder. Especially with my heart.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a listen to your lungs, then. Please take a deep breath for me, and exhale slowly. I do hear some congestion in both lower lobes. And a slight wheeze. We'll need a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what's going on. And I'd like to check your oxygen saturation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Congestion… Is that bad? I always worry when you start talking about things like that. An X-ray… alright, if you think it’s necessary. And the oxygen… what will that tell us? I just want to get this cough sorted, Doctor. It's really wearing me down.
DOCTOR: The X-ray will help us rule out pneumonia, or other more serious causes of your cough. And the oxygen saturation will tell us how well your lungs are transferring oxygen to your blood. It’s a simple test, Ms. Sadhu, quite non-invasive. The nurse will be in shortly to take your vital signs and get those tests ordered. We’ll take it one step at a time. Now, before the nurse arrives, can you tell me if you’ve been around anyone else who’s been sick recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Elena's grandson, little Mateo, had a bad cold last week. But I didn’t get close to him, she wouldn’t let me. She’s very careful, Elena is. And Mrs. Rodriguez from next door, she was coughing a bit a few days ago, but that’s… normal for her, you know? She has that… the COPD. No one else that I can think of, no. Just Mateo and Mrs. Rodriguez. But I didn’t spend much time with either of them. .
DOCTOR: Alright. That will be all for now. The nurse will be in shortly to proceed with the tests. I’ll review the results and we’ll discuss a plan of action. .
