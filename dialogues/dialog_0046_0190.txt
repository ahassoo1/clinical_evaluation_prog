DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I wish the circumstances were more cheerful. I’ve been… unsteady, lately. Imbalanced, you might say. It’s rather troubling, and I haven’t been able to quite put my finger on why. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly concerning when you experience something like that without a clear cause. “Unsteady” and “imbalanced” are helpful descriptions. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That’s… difficult. Everything feels a bit… hazy, truthfully. I believe it was sometime after… after my husband passed. It wasn't immediate, not right away. But gradually, over… months, perhaps? It’s hard to say precisely. It's not a clear memory, more of a… feeling of increasing instability. I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilyanna. Grief can absolutely affect our memory and perception of time, so it’s not unusual to feel that way. It sounds like this began some time after your husband’s passing, and has been developing gradually over months. To clarify, when you say “unsteady,” can you describe how you’re unsteady?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… a good way to put it. It’s not a constant thing, you understand. It comes and goes. But when it does happen… well, it’s like the ground isn’t quite there. Or perhaps I’m not quite there. It’s a… wavering sensation. A loss of balance, naturally, but it’s more than that. A feeling of being… disconnected. Sometimes it’s when I stand up quickly, other times it seems to happen at random. I haven’t fallen, thankfully, but I’m… cautious. Very cautious. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A wavering sensation, feeling disconnected, and occurring both with quick movements and seemingly at random – that’s helpful information. And it’s good you haven’t fallen, but being cautious is wise. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if anything specifically triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: That's a… good question. I've been trying to identify a pattern, you see. But it’s… elusive. I haven’t noticed any particular activities or environments that consistently bring it on. I work… well, I operate a rotary drill for an oil and gas company. It's quite physical, naturally. And I haven't noticed it being worse at work than anywhere else. It happens… inside, outside, standing, sometimes even when I’m sitting. I suppose if I had to offer something… perhaps when I’m tired? But even then, it’s not a guarantee. It’s all rather frustrating, to be honest. I’d very much like to know why this is happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lilyanna. It sounds incredibly unsettling to experience this without a clear cause, and it’s good you’re actively trying to identify any patterns. To help me get a more complete picture, let’s briefly go through some other symptoms. Have you experienced any dizziness, ringing in your ears, changes in your vision, or headaches alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Oh my… let me think. Dizziness… yes, sometimes. Not a spinning sensation, exactly. More of a… lightheadedness. Ringing in the ears… no, not that I've noticed. My vision… no changes there, as far as I can tell. And headaches… occasionally, a mild one, but I attribute that to… well, the work, mostly. Long hours, you know. Nothing significant. Though… now that you mention it, I’ve felt a bit more fatigued lately. Beyond the usual work tiredness, I mean. It’s… a deeper weariness, if that makes sense. I do apologize for being so… imprecise.
DOCTOR: You're not being imprecise at all, Lilyanna. You're describing your experience very thoughtfully. Lightheadedness, occasional mild headaches, and a deeper level of fatigue beyond your usual work tiredness - that's all very helpful information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a bit difficult. My husband always handled the medical appointments, you see. I… I don’t recall being diagnosed with anything significant. I've had the usual things, I suppose. Colds, flu, a broken wrist once when I was a child. Nothing ongoing. I did have high blood pressure, but it was… well managed, with medication. I believe I stopped taking it a few years ago, after… after he passed, when I moved. Perhaps that’s relevant? I really can’t say for certain. I apologize again for my… lack of clarity. I should have kept better records.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It's understandable that things may be unclear, and it's good you're sharing what you remember. So, to clarify, you had high blood pressure that was previously managed with medication, but you stopped taking it a few years ago after your husband's passing and moving. Do you recall what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a particularly hazy memory. He always handled the prescriptions, you see. I believe it was a small, white pill. Perhaps with a… ‘H’ on it? Or was it a ‘V’? It's terribly difficult to recall. I really can’t say with any certainty. I know he was very particular about making sure I took it regularly, but the specifics… they’ve unfortunately slipped my mind. I apologize profusely. I wish I could be of more help.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lilyanna. It's not uncommon to forget medication details, especially when it was managed by someone else. We can try to look up your medication history through the clinic's records system. Before we do that, let's briefly discuss any allergies you may have. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. I don’t believe I have any significant allergies. No reactions to any medications that I recall. I’ve eaten… most things, without issue. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to shellfish, a mild stomach upset, but nothing severe. Nothing that would require an EpiPen, certainly. I am generally quite robust, health-wise. Though, again, my husband always kept track of those things, and my memory… it’s not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. No significant allergies, and a mild sensitivity to shellfish. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh my… family history. That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she had some heart trouble, I believe. Nothing specific, just… a general weakness. She passed when I was quite young, so I don’t have a lot of details. My father… he was a very stoic man. He didn’t talk much about his health. I believe he had high blood pressure as well, but that's about all I can recall. There wasn’t a lot of discussion of medical matters in my family, truthfully. We… preferred to focus on other things. I apologize for my… lack of information. It's not very helpful, is it?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lilyanna. It's understandable that family medical history may be limited, especially if it wasn't openly discussed. It sounds like your mother had some heart trouble and your father had high blood pressure. To finish up with your background, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh… lifestyle. Well, I work, as I mentioned. Long hours, quite physical. I live alone now, in a small house just outside of town. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, but it's sometimes difficult with the long shifts. I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven't had much time for hobbies lately. Mostly, I focus on my work and… trying to keep things together. It's a rather solitary existence, if I'm honest. I don't have much of a social life. It's… just me, mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lilyanna. That gives me a good overview of your lifestyle. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just… please excuse my… slight apprehension. I’ve never been particularly fond of medical examinations, if I’m honest. But I understand it’s necessary. What will you be doing?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Lilyanna. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. I'll keep things as comfortable as possible. I'm going to start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat, and briefly assess your neurological function—checking your reflexes and balance. Finally, I'll listen to your abdomen and assess your skin. It shouldn't take long. First, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Relax… I'll try. Just… let me know if anything feels… unpleasant. I do apologize in advance if I'm a difficult patient. My nerves tend to… get the better of me sometimes.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Lilyanna. I'll explain everything as I go, and please, don't hesitate to let me know if you're uncomfortable at any point. Your blood pressure is 160/95. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, which isn't entirely surprising given your reported history and current stress levels. I'll want to monitor that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Deep breath… yes. I do… feel a little anxious, if I'm honest. This is all rather overwhelming. Is that… normal? I apologize for being so… troublesome. Is my blood pressure very high? Perhaps I should have mentioned it sooner. My husband… he always said I worry too much.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious during a medical examination, Lilyanna, and your feelings are completely valid. Your heart sounds regular, but I am hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. Nothing alarming at this point, but something to be aware of. Your blood pressure is elevated, yes, and it’s something we need to address. It's good you're letting me know what you're feeling. We can discuss some options for managing it after the examination. Now, I'm going to check your ears, eyes, and throat. Your ears look clear, and your eyes appear normal. Your throat is also clear, but slightly dry. Do you experience frequent heartburn or indigestion?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… the heartburn. It's… quite frequent, actually. Especially after meals. I usually just… take something over the counter. It helps… sometimes. It's not a major problem, I suppose. Just… uncomfortable. I hadn't thought to mention it, as it seems… insignificant compared to everything else. But, yes, frequent heartburn. And sometimes, a little bit of acid reflux as well. Is that… relevant, Doctor? Perhaps my diet is to blame? I do… occasionally indulge in rich foods. It's a small comfort, you see.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Lilyanna. Frequent heartburn and acid reflux can be related to several underlying issues, and it's good you mentioned it. It's also good to acknowledge those small comforts, we all deserve them. Now, I'm going to briefly assess your neurological function. This just involves checking your reflexes and balance. Could you please sit on the edge of the bed and I'll check your reflexes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Reflexes… I haven’t thought about my reflexes in years. I used to be quite nimble, but I fear those days are long gone. Please… be gentle. I do have… a slight fear of falling. It's probably irrational, but… well, here we are. Please let me know if anything feels… concerning.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I'd like to check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly, and try to stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… not very graceful. I do feel a little unsteady. It's… worse when I try to stand still like this. I don't like this very much. Please… if I start to fall… just… catch me, alright? I apologize for being so… troublesome. My husband… he used to say I was all elbows and knees.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It’s good you're letting me know how you feel, and I’m here to support you. It's not a surprise that you feel unsteady, given your reported symptoms. The wobble is concerning, but we'll explore the possible causes. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Could you please lie back down on the examination bed?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Abdomen… yes. I haven’t had any major abdominal problems, thankfully. Just… occasional indigestion, as we discussed. I do… worry a lot. Perhaps that’s part of the problem. Worrying about everything, all the time. It’s… exhausting. Please let me know if anything feels… unpleasant. I do apologize for being such a nervous patient. It's not rational, I know. But here we are.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a slight tenderness in the upper quadrants. Again, nothing overly concerning at this point, but something to be aware of. Okay, Lilyanna, that completes the physical examination. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, I'd like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and vitamin B12 and D levels. I’d also like to order a urinalysis. Finally, given your symptoms of imbalance, I think a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation would be prudent. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and a neurologist… yes. Whatever it takes to find out what’s happening. I'm… tired of feeling this way, to be honest. Tired of worrying, tired of feeling unsteady, tired of not knowing. So, yes. Please, do whatever you think is necessary. What do I need to do? Where do I go for the blood tests? And… what should I expect from the neurologist? I apologize for being so… inquisitive. It’s just… I like to be prepared. It helps calm my nerves, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It's good you're being proactive, and it's completely understandable that you want to be prepared. I'll have the nurse draw a requisition for the blood tests. You can go to the lab at St. Jude’s Hospital, just a few blocks down the street. They don’t require an appointment, but it’s best to go in the morning for faster results. As for the neurologist, I'm referring you to Dr. Evelyn Hayes. She's excellent. She'll likely want to perform a more detailed neurological examination, and may order some imaging scans, such as an MRI of your brain, to rule out any underlying neurological causes for your imbalance. She will discuss the results with you and recommend a treatment plan if necessary. The nurse will give you a referral slip and Dr. Hayes’ contact information. In the meantime, I'd like to address your elevated blood pressure and frequent heartburn. I'm going to prescribe a low dose of lisinopril to help lower your blood pressure, and a proton pump inhibitor, like omeprazole, to help reduce your stomach acid. I’ll also recommend some lifestyle modifications, such as reducing your salt intake, eating smaller meals more frequently, and avoiding rich and spicy foods. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Oh my… that’s… a lot of information. Blood tests, a neurologist, medication… lifestyle modifications. It’s… overwhelming, to be honest. Lisinopril and Omeprazole… are there any side effects I should be aware of? And what about interactions with… anything else I might be taking? I don’t take anything regularly, but I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for headaches. And what about driving? Will the medication make me drowsy? And the diet… reducing salt, smaller meals… it sounds… difficult. I do enjoy cooking, but I’m not very good at following recipes. And the neurologist… will they be able to tell me what’s wrong? Will they be able to fix it? I apologize for being so… anxious. It’s just… I like to know what’s happening. I like to be prepared. It helps me cope, you see. And… will the nurse explain all of this to me as well? I’m afraid I’m not remembering everything.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It is a lot of information, and it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. It’s good you're asking these questions. Let's address your concerns one by one. Medication Side Effects & Interactions: Lisinopril can sometimes cause a dry cough, dizziness, and fatigue. Omeprazole can cause nausea, headache, and diarrhea. Both medications are generally safe, but it's important to be aware of potential side effects. As for interactions, both medications have minimal interactions with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, but it’s always best to check with the pharmacist before taking anything new. Driving: Lisinopril can sometimes cause dizziness, so it's best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how it affects you. Diet: Reducing salt and eating smaller meals can be challenging, but it's something we can work on gradually. There are many resources available online and through dieticians who can help you create a meal plan that's both healthy and enjoyable. Neurologist: Dr. Hayes will perform a thorough examination and order any necessary tests to determine the cause of your imbalance. She will then discuss the results with you and recommend a treatment plan if needed. While I can’t guarantee she’ll be able to “fix” everything, she's highly skilled and will do everything she can to help you. The nurse will explain all of this to you in detail before you leave, and will provide you with written instructions on how to take your medication, potential side effects, and contact information for both Dr. Hayes and myself. She will also be happy to answer any further questions you may have. Do you have any other immediate concerns I can address before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. Knowing that the nurse will explain everything again is… a great comfort. I suppose… one last question. What if… what if it’s something serious? What if it’s something I can’t… fix? I know it’s a morbid thought, but… it’s been on my mind. My husband… he always said I worry too much. But it's hard not to, you see. Especially when I don't know what's happening. And… will I be able to continue working? That's… important to me. It's not just about the money, it's… it's about feeling useful. It's about having a purpose. I apologize for being so… emotional. It's just… it's a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel emotional, Lilyanna. It's completely natural to worry, especially in the face of uncertainty. And it's brave of you to share those concerns with me. Regarding your fears, it’s important to remember that we don’t know what’s causing your symptoms yet. While it's possible that it could be something serious, it's equally likely that it's something more manageable. The tests and the neurologist’s evaluation are designed to help us determine the cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan. As for your ability to continue working, that's something we’ll need to assess after we have a better understanding of your condition. If your symptoms are interfering with your ability to perform your job safely, we may need to consider some temporary modifications or adjustments. However, I don’t want you to worry about that right now. Let's focus on getting a diagnosis first, and then we can discuss your work options. I understand this is a lot to take in, Lilyanna, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns, now or in the future. The nurse will be in shortly to review everything with you. Take a deep breath, and remember that we'll face this together. Is there anything else at all I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that’s everything. Thank you. Thank you for listening, and for being so… patient. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. That means… a lot. I suppose… I'll just wait for the nurse. And… try to breathe. .
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help, and remember, I’m here if you need anything at all. Please take care, and don't hesitate to reach out. .
