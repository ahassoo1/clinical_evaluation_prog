DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but my daughter – bless her heart – she kept after me about this PrEP thing. Said I should look into it. She’s very… informed. I’m Helaina, by the way. Just Helaina is fine. I’m here to, uh, talk about it, I guess. See if it’s right for me. I'm 55, single, and trying to be sensible.
DOCTOR: It's good to meet you too, Helaina. And it’s certainly not embarrassing to ask questions about your health – in fact, it's very responsible of you. It sounds like your daughter has good instincts, and it’s wonderful you’re being proactive. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a very effective way to prevent HIV, and we can definitely discuss whether it might be a good option for you. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about why your daughter suggested it?
PATIENT: Well… she said with everything going on, and me being… active, even at my age, it’s something to consider. She reads a lot of articles online, you know? I don’t really… keep up with all that. I work as a parking attendant downtown, so I see a lot of people, different walks of life. She just worries, I think. She's a good girl, always looking out for me. It’s not like I’m… recklessly doing anything, but I’d rather be safe than sorry, I suppose. Especially now. Medicare covers it, right? She mentioned that too.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, Medicare does cover PrEP with most plans, which is excellent. It's very smart of you to consider all of this, and it’s good that your daughter is looking out for you. It sounds like you’re being thoughtful and responsible. To help me determine if PrEP is a good fit, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your health history and current situation. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Ask away. I don't have any big secrets. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I walk a lot at work, that’s for sure. Just a little arthritis in my knees, but nothing serious. And I had the flu last winter, but who hasn’t? I don’t really go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to, if I’m honest. What kind of questions are we talking about?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're generally healthy and active! Walking a lot is excellent. And no worries about the flu – it was a bad season for everyone. I’ll just ask some routine questions, mostly about your medical history, any medications you take, allergies, and some lifestyle questions. Nothing to be alarmed about. First, have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Actually, I had a test… let me think… maybe five years ago? It was at a community clinic, just a routine thing. Everything came back negative, thankfully. I remember being a little nervous, but the nurse was very kind. I don’t think I’ve been tested since then, though. It’s not something I think about often, to be honest. Does that make sense? I keep forgetting what year it was, exactly. It was definitely before the pandemic, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It’s completely normal to not remember exact dates. Knowing you had a negative test about five years ago is good information. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I don't like penicillin, it always upsets my stomach, but I’m not actually allergic to it, if that makes sense. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I’ve never had a problem with them. Other than that, no. I can eat pretty much anything. I used to be able to, anyway. Getting old, you know? Suddenly you find out you can't eat certain things! But no serious allergies, no.
DOCTOR: That's good to know! It sounds like you don’t have any major allergies we need to be concerned about. And you're right, things do change as we get older! Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I check my blood pressure at the pharmacy sometimes, and it's usually a little high, but the pharmacist said it's nothing to worry about, just stress. And my knees, like I said, a little arthritis. But no doctor has ever told me I have anything serious, if that makes sense. I’ve been lucky, I think. I eat pretty healthy, mostly, and I try to stay active. My mother, she had a weak heart, but I don’t think I inherited that. Honestly, I'm not a fan of doctors, so I tend to avoid them when I can. Hopefully that doesn't come across as… foolish.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It's perfectly reasonable to not enjoy doctor visits, and it sounds like you've been taking good care of yourself. Avoiding unnecessary medical interventions is a sensible approach. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen for my knees, when they really bother me. And a multivitamin, just a basic one, you know? Old lady stuff. My daughter keeps telling me I should take glucosamine and chondroitin for my knees too, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. Honestly, I forget half the time to take the multivitamin. Nothing regular, though. Definitely nothing a doctor prescribed me. Just stuff I pick up at the drugstore. Is that okay? I hope I'm not making this too complicated.
DOCTOR: No, not at all! That’s perfectly fine. Ibuprofen occasionally and a multivitamin aren’t anything to worry about. It's good you're being upfront about everything. Now, I'm going to ask a few more personal questions, and you're welcome to decline to answer anything you're not comfortable with. These questions are important to help assess your risk and determine if PrEP is appropriate. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Well… yes. I am. It's… complicated. I’ve been single for a long time, and… I have a few… casual acquaintances. I don’t really… date, if that makes sense. It’s not like I’m running around, but… yes. I am sexually active. I try to be careful, always use protection, but… you know. It's just… hard to talk about. I don't want to offend you or anything. It's just… a part of life.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Helaina. It takes courage to talk about these things, and I appreciate your honesty. It’s absolutely not offensive, and it’s a very important part of understanding your health needs. And it’s good you’re already taking precautions. Can you tell me a little more about the types of sexual activity you engage in?
PATIENT: Well… mostly it's just… oral sex. And sometimes… intercourse. But it's not… frequent. And I always, always use condoms. I'm very careful about that. I’m not looking for anything long-term, you know? It’s just… companionship. It's hard being alone. My daughter worries, she thinks I’m being reckless, but I'm not. I promise. I just… I like to feel wanted. Is that bad? I don't know. I don't want to give you too many details. It's just… private.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. You’ve shared enough, and I appreciate your honesty. It’s important to understand the context, and it sounds like you’re being thoughtful about protecting yourself. Given what you've told me, PrEP could be a good option for you. To be certain, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and some blood work to check your kidney function and screen for any sexually transmitted infections. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… fine. Whatever you think is best. I want to make sure I’m doing the right thing. I just… I want to be safe. And I want my daughter to stop worrying so much. So if this PrEP thing can help, then… yes. Blood work and an exam are fine. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? I’m not a fan of doctors, remember? And how long will it take? I have a parking shift this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take it as slowly as you need to, and I’ll explain everything as we go. The physical exam will be fairly basic – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick examination. The blood work will just require a few vials of blood. The whole process should take about 30-45 minutes, including the blood draw. We can definitely get you in and out in time for your shift. Let's start with the physical exam. If you don’t mind, please sit back on the exam table, and we’ll begin. Would you like me to provide a gown?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A gown would be… good. Thank you. I feel a little silly, but… yes. A gown. I just… I'm not used to this. And please, don't rush me. I need a minute to… adjust. This is all a bit much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Take all the time you need. There’s no rush at all. I’ll just step out for a moment while you get changed, and I’ll be right back when you’re ready. Please let me know if you need anything at all.
