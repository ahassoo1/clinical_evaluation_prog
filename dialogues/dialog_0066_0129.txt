DOCTOR: Hi Dawnetta, good morning! I'm Dr. Condray. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let's just get on with it. It's my stool. It's black. Like…tar. And I take those pain pills, you know, for my arthritis. Been taking 'em for years. That's it. Is that enough information, or do you need a whole life story?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, no life story needed! Black, tarry stool… and you're taking pain pills for arthritis, long-term. That is good information to start with. Just to clarify, when did you first notice the change in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it was… probably a week ago, maybe a little longer. Honestly, I don’t spend a lot of time looking at it, if you catch my drift. It just…was different. Darker. I figured it was the pills, to be honest. Is that what it is? It has to be the pills. I read things online, you know. It's probably just bleeding somewhere, right? From the pills. Don't tell me I need a… a camera up there. I’ve heard stories.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you brought this to my attention. It could be related to the pain pills, as some medications can cause changes in stool color. However, black, tarry stool is often a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract, and we need to rule that out. I want to be thorough, so we need to investigate a little further. Now, you mentioned it's been about a week. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the change in stool?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, I’m 73, Doctor. I have lots of symptoms. My knees ache, my back hurts, I get tired easily… are you asking about stomach problems? Because no, not really. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but I take those little pink tablets for that. And I’ve been a bit more… tired than usual, but that could be anything. Honestly, I just want to know if I'm going to be alright and can go back to my garden. Is it serious? Don’t beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration and wanting a straight answer. And it's good you tell me about the tiredness. The black stool can be serious, and we need to figure out where the bleeding is coming from. It's not always something major, but it's important to rule out anything concerning. To help me determine the cause, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check your overall health. Then, I'll need to order a blood test to check your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, which will tell us if you've lost blood. We may also need to check a stool sample. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. A stool sample? Really? Look, I haven't got time for a lot of tests. Can't you just…give me something for the heartburn and see if that fixes it? I’ve managed just fine for years without poking and prodding. And honestly, Doctor, I don’t see the point. I'm old. Things wear out. I’m not asking for a miracle, just… reassurance. Is it something to worry about right now? Because if it isn't, I'd rather just go home. I have tomatoes that need staking.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns and respect your wishes, Dawnetta. I want to provide you with reassurance, and that’s why I’m recommending these tests. It's not about performing unnecessary procedures, but about gathering enough information to ensure your safety and make an informed decision about your care. While it’s true things can wear out with age, black stool is a symptom we take seriously because it could indicate a problem that needs attention. Dismissing it without investigation could potentially be harmful. Let's do this: I'll listen to your abdomen now, which is quick and non-invasive. I'll also order the blood test. We can discuss the results before deciding on any further steps, including a stool sample, if needed. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. My abdomen. Honestly, you doctors and your poking and prodding. Alright, do what you have to do. And make it quick, please. I've got a garden waiting. And don't tell me anything terrible. I don’t want to hear about… ulcers or anything like that. Just tell me if it’s the pills. That’s all. And what will the blood test show exactly? I don't understand all that medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just listening to your abdomen now. It doesn’t seem to be particularly tender to the touch, which is good. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. Now, about the blood test, it will show us your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Hemoglobin is the protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen. If you're losing blood, your hemoglobin level will be lower than normal. Hematocrit is the percentage of your blood volume made up of red blood cells. That will also be lower if you're bleeding. It basically tells us if you’re anemic, meaning you don't have enough healthy red blood cells. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Anemic. So, if I'm anemic, it means I’m… weak? Like, I’ll collapse in the tomato patch? Look, Doctor, I’m not a scientist. Just tell me if it’s serious and if I need to worry. You’re making me anxious with all these… levels and cells. And honestly, I’m starting to think these pills are more trouble than they’re worth. Could I just… stop taking them? Would that fix it? Don’t tell me I’ll be crippled, though. I need to be able to garden. That’s the most important thing. Can I just stop the pills?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your anxiety, and I apologize if I'm using too much medical jargon. Let me be very clear. Being anemic means your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen efficiently, which can lead to weakness and fatigue. But we don’t know if you are anemic yet, that’s what the blood test will tell us. Regarding stopping the pills, that's a good question. We absolutely shouldn't stop any medication abruptly without a plan. Suddenly stopping pain pills can cause withdrawal symptoms, and it could also worsen your arthritis pain. We need to figure out why you're seeing black stool first. If it’s related to the pills, we can discuss alternatives or ways to manage the side effects. But stopping them on your own could create more problems. Let's wait for the blood test results before making any decisions, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood test. Honestly, it's always something with doctors. Alright, alright. Just tell me when I can leave. And make it quick. I’ve got tomatoes to stake, you know. And I’m starting to feel a bit… faint. Probably from all the poking and prodding. Just…hurry up, please. And don't tell me I need a camera up there. I'm serious. I've heard stories. Terrible stories. Just…blood test. That's all I want to hear about right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta. I've ordered the blood test, and the lab technician will come up shortly to draw the sample. It shouldn’t take long. Once the results are back, usually within a couple of hours, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. And I promise, we’ll consider all options before recommending anything invasive. I'll have the nurse check your blood pressure, just to be safe, since you're feeling a bit faint. Please just relax while we wait. I understand your eagerness to get back to your garden, and we'll get you the answers you need as quickly as possible.
