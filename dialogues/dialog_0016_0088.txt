DOCTOR: Hi Jaylyne, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, it’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been… well, it’s been bothering me for a bit now. I just wanted to get it checked out, if that’s okay. I’d like to get this over with quickly if possible, I have a pretty busy day.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears – we call that tinnitus. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. And I understand you’re busy, so I'll do my best to be efficient. First, can you tell me a little more about the ringing?
PATIENT: Right, tinnitus. Okay. Um… it’s not a loud ringing, exactly. More like a high-pitched whine, sometimes. It comes and goes. Mostly when it’s quiet, I think. Like, at night when I’m trying to sleep, or if I’m just relaxing. It’s hard to describe. It doesn’t hurt, though. Just… annoying. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. It's good to know it's not painful, and that it comes and goes. Knowing it’s worse in quiet is also useful information. And just to clarify, has anything specific happened recently that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of. Nothing major. I was at a concert a couple of weeks ago, but it wasn’t that loud, you know? I always try to stay away from the speakers. Work’s been pretty normal, same as always… waiting tables. No accidents or anything. I’m really not sure what could have caused it. I don’t think I’ve been stressed either, more bored than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a concert a couple of weeks ago is good to know, even if it wasn't particularly loud – sound exposure can sometimes cause tinnitus. And waiting tables… that’s good information as well. Now, let's talk a little bit more generally. Have you noticed any hearing loss at all?
PATIENT: Hearing loss? Um… not really. I mean, I’m not deaf or anything! I can hear perfectly fine, as far as I know. Maybe I don’t pick up on high-pitched sounds as well as I used to, but I just figured that was getting older. I'm 27, but still... I don't know. I haven't really paid attention, to be honest. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad at all that you haven't specifically noticed – a lot of hearing loss happens gradually. It's good you mentioned you might not pick up on high-pitched sounds as well as you used to. We'll definitely check that out. Okay, next question. Have you experienced any dizziness, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: No dizziness, no. And… fullness? No, I don’t think so. My ears just feel… normal, most of the time. Apart from the ringing, obviously. They don't feel blocked or anything like that. Just… the whine. I really hope this isn’t something serious, Doctor. I need my hearing for work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you mentioned needing your hearing for work. We’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on. Now, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy. I don't take any medication regularly. I’m not allergic to anything that I know of. And… I got divorced last year, but that's not a medical thing, right? Just thought I should mention it in case… I don’t know.
DOCTOR: No, the divorce isn't a medical thing, thank you for sharing. It's always good to have a complete picture. And no, no current medical conditions, no medications, no known allergies – that’s good. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope, and then we’ll do a quick hearing test. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, please? I really do have to get back to work later. I don’t want to cause any problems for my manager.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. Okay, your ear canals look clear. No signs of infection or wax buildup. Your eardrums look normal as well. Now, let's do a quick hearing test. I'm going to have you wear these headphones, and you'll raise your hand whenever you hear a sound. It won’t take long. Okay… and how about this one?
PATIENT: Um… yes, I can hear that one. And… yes, that one too. I think… maybe I couldn’t hear the really high-pitched ones as well? It was a bit faint. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. The test does indicate some mild high-frequency hearing loss. It's not severe, but it’s consistent with potential noise exposure. And it could explain the tinnitus. So, based on the exam and the hearing test, the most likely cause of your tinnitus is mild noise-induced hearing loss. It's common, and often manageable.
PATIENT: Noise-induced? From waiting tables? Or… the concert? Is there anything I can do about it? I need to be able to hear customers, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It could be a combination of both. Waiting tables can have surprisingly consistent, low-level noise, and even a single concert can contribute. The good news is, there are things we can do. The first step is to protect your hearing from further damage. I recommend wearing earplugs in noisy environments – even during your shifts if possible. There are special earplugs designed for musicians and hospitality workers that filter sound rather than block it completely, so you can still hear conversations. We can also explore some tinnitus management techniques. There are sound therapies and apps that can help mask the ringing, and there are counseling options to help you cope with the annoyance. I'd also like to schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to re-evaluate your hearing and see how you're doing. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay… earplugs. That’s… doable. I guess. I hadn’t really thought about it. And the apps… I can look into those. I'm not sure about counseling, but I’ll think about it. Three months… yeah, that's fine. So, basically, I just need to be more careful and try not to make it worse? And I’ll try the earplugs? Is there a specific kind you recommend, or just… any earplugs?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Being careful and preventing further noise exposure is the key. For earplugs, I recommend high-fidelity earplugs. They’re designed to reduce the volume of all sounds equally, so they don’t distort the sound quality. Brands like Loop or Etymotic Research make good ones. You can find them online or at most music stores. They're a little more expensive than foam earplugs, but they’ll be much more comfortable and effective for long-term use. I'm going to write you a prescription for a basic hearing protection kit with a few different sizes of earplugs, and I'll also email you some links to resources on tinnitus management and apps. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, high-fidelity… I'll look those up. A prescription for earplugs… that's good, thanks. And the links, that's really helpful. No, I think that’s everything for now. I just… I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. And trying to be quick. I guess I’ll just try to be more careful and see if it gets any better. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. I’m glad I could help. It's important to remember that tinnitus is often manageable, and with a little bit of care, you should be able to minimize its impact on your life. Here's your prescription, and I’ll get the email sent to you right away with those links. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. You too. .
