DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Batara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it simply, I’ve gained quite a bit of weight recently, and I haven’t…changed anything in my routine to explain it. It's rather worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Quite a bit of weight recently.” Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me think… from, oh, about March, I’ve put on… approximately 7 kilograms. Perhaps a little more, actually. I weigh 83 kilograms now, and I was at 76 before that, give or take. I have been weighing myself regularly, you see. It's been quite consistent, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: 7 kilograms in five months. And you say there haven’t been any changes to your diet or exercise?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. My husband and I eat the same meals we always have – mostly traditional Lithuanian fare, I suppose. Nothing extravagant. And I walk to the market most days, which is… well, it’s a good distance. I haven’t increased my activity, nor have I decreased it. It’s just… appeared. It’s a little unsettling.
DOCTOR: Traditional Lithuanian fare… right. And is this weight gain… all over, or is it concentrated in certain areas?
PATIENT: Mostly around my middle, I think. And my hips, a little. It’s not as though I’ve suddenly grown noticeably larger everywhere, it’s…distributed. Though, I suppose, it is difficult for me to be completely objective. My husband says it's mostly around my waist, but he’s always been kind.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you noticed any other changes along with this weight gain?
PATIENT: Let me consider… not really, Doctor. No changes to my sleep, my appetite is the same, no excessive thirst or…well, no frequent urination. I haven't been feeling particularly tired, either. Perhaps a little more…short of breath when I’m walking uphill, but I attributed that to the summer heat. Honestly, that’s about it. It’s just the weight. It's rather… perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing significant, thankfully. I had a rather bad bout of the flu several years ago, but that was it. No high blood pressure, no diabetes… nothing. I’ve always been rather…robust, I suppose you could say. This is quite a departure from my usual state of health.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My husband jokes that I’m too stubborn to let anyone near me with a scalpel. It’s true, though. I've always preferred to avoid them if at all possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, God rest her soul, was… a large woman. And my father was quite healthy, but he had a bad heart later in life. I have a sister, she’s slim as a rail, always has been. No history of…unexplained weight gain, as far as I know. Mostly heart problems and…the usual aging ailments, really.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Certainly not. My husband and I enjoy a glass of kvass with our meals sometimes, but that's the extent of it. We've never been ones for those sorts of…habits. Very sensible people, we are.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I pride myself on maintaining my health naturally. A bit of chamomile tea for a good night's sleep, perhaps, but no regular prescriptions or anything of that nature. This is what’s so confusing about all of this, you see. There’s no reason for this to be happening.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I will need to examine your thyroid. Then we’ll talk about some possible blood tests. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Nothing I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my entire life without incident. That sounds rather boastful, doesn’t it? But truthfully, no allergies. I'm quite eager to discover the source of this…problem, so please, do whatever you deem necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Please, sit back and relax. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your thyroid. Please, tilt your head back. Thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but no nodules that I can detect at this time. Alright. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a lipid panel. We’ll also check your blood sugar and kidney function. It’s likely nothing serious, but we need to rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: That sounds…thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. An enlarged thyroid… that is something new. I had no idea. And the tests… well, I trust your judgment. When can I expect the results? I hope it's not too long. I am a little anxious, naturally.
DOCTOR: The lab usually gets the results back within three to five business days. I will have the nurse call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce your salt intake. It won’t solve the problem, but it’s a good place to start. And frankly, Ms. Selbitschka, you are carrying some extra weight. While I understand you haven’t changed your diet, it’s important to be realistic. A modest reduction in caloric intake and regular exercise could make a significant difference. It's not always about finding a hidden cause; sometimes it's about making sensible lifestyle changes.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. I appreciate your candor. While I haven't intentionally changed my routine, I suppose it's possible my portion sizes have crept up over time. And I'll certainly try to be more mindful of my salt intake. I am, after all, a practical woman. I just… hoped there was a more straightforward explanation. Thank you for your time. I suppose I will await the nurse's call.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome. Please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before then. .
