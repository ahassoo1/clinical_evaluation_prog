DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, yes. Right. It’s my ear, you see. Feels…full. Like something’s blocking it. Been that way a bit, honestly. Not sure how long, exactly. A while, I guess? It’s just…annoying.
DOCTOR: “A while,” huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Sorry, I’m not very good with dates. Everything’s a bit…fuzzy these days. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just…there. A pressure, mostly. Makes it hard to hear properly. Especially…well, quiet sounds.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no pain, just a feeling of fullness and difficulty hearing. And quiet sounds are the problem. Any discharge?
PATIENT: Discharge? Uh…no, I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. I mean, I clean my ears regularly, as you do. But no, nothing…coming out. I hope not, anyway.
DOCTOR: "As you do." Right. And how do you clean your ears, Mr. Guerrerolopez?
PATIENT: Oh, you know…with…things. Cotton swabs, mostly. And sometimes…a little…roll of paper? I'm not sure what it's called. My wife used to get them. It’s just what I've always done. Is that…bad? I mean, I don’t shove them in deep, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guerrerolopez, using cotton swabs to clean your ears is generally not recommended. You can actually push wax further in, impact it, and cause more problems than you solve. And these "rolls of paper"...that sounds like ear candles. Those are also ineffective, and can be dangerous. But let's focus on what's going on now. When did you first notice this fullness?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I…I didn’t know. My wife always got them for me. She said it was to keep things clean. The fullness…hmm. August, I think? Or maybe July? It started gradually. I just…didn’t pay much attention at first. It was slight. Now it’s just…more noticeable, because I’m trying to listen to the radio, and I can’t quite hear the news. It’s…frustrating. Honestly, everything's frustrating these days. .
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a gradual onset in July or August. Let's have a look. Open wide, please. I need to get a better look at that ear of yours. And please try to remain still.
