DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Humph. Morning to you too. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get on with it. It's this... this situation here. It's not what it used to be, you understand? Used to be solid. Now...well, it's just not. I want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I understand you'd like to get to the bottom of this quickly. When you say "not what it used to be," could you describe that a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specific? Specific?! Look, doc, I been workin' hard all my life. Pile drivin', you hear? That takes a man's build. This… …this is sagging. It's soft. And it’s… noticeable. Used to wear nice shirts, you know? Now I gotta wear these… these things. Loose ones. It’s embarrassing, plain and simple. Don’t need a lecture on healthy eating, either. I eat fine. Always have.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you're concerned about a change in your abdominal area and how it's affecting your comfort and confidence. It’s good you’re addressing this. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me if you've noticed any other changes along with the softening and sagging?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… Not really. Just… weaker, I suppose. Can’t lift as much as I used to, but that’s to be expected at my age, innit? Ain't a spring chicken no more. But this… this is different. It's not just muscle. It's… there. And it bothers me. A lot. Is that what you want to know? Or you gonna ask me what I had for breakfast? Honestly.
DOCTOR: No, I won't ask about breakfast, Mr. Trendler. Just trying to get a clearer picture. You mentioned feeling weaker – has that weakness been gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual. Very gradual. Took years, really. Pile drivin' takes a toll on a man, you know? Always thought it was just the years catchin' up. But then… then this started. It's not like I'm worried 'bout bein' pretty or nothin'. Just want to be… solid. Like I used to be. It's dignity, doc. That’s what it is. You understand that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I absolutely understand. Dignity is important. It sounds like you’re experiencing a change in your abdominal strength and appearance, and it's causing you distress. Now, have you noticed any pain or discomfort in your abdomen at all?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not really. Sometimes… a little ache, maybe. But nothin' worth mentionin'. Old age aches, you hear? I’ve had worse from fallin’ off a ladder. It’s just… unsettling. Always been a strong man. Always. And now… well, look at it. It's… flabby. And it jiggles, if I move just right. Disgustin’. I just want it fixed. Can you fix it? Is that what you do here, or am I wastin’ my time?
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just some occasional aches. That's good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? You askin' me about… that now? Look, I came here 'cause my stomach is saggin', not to discuss… personal matters! What kind of doctor asks a man his bowel habits on the first visit? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Are you even listenin' to me? I want somethin’ done about this. Not a questionnaire 'bout… well, you know. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, please allow me to explain. I apologize if my questions seem personal, but it's important to get a complete picture of your health. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes be related to abdominal issues, and it’s a standard part of a medical assessment. However, if you are uncomfortable discussing that right now, we can certainly focus on your concerns about your abdomen. Perhaps we can start with a physical exam?
