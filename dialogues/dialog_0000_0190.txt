DOCTOR: Right. Lilyanna Snerling, 23 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um... good afternoon. It's... it's difficult to explain, precisely. I've been feeling... unsteady. Like I might fall over. It's been happening for a little while now, and it's getting… concerning. I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest. Just… gradually.
DOCTOR: Gradually, you say. Hmm. And when you say “unsteady,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… not a spinning feeling, not dizziness exactly. More like my feet aren’t quite… there. Like they don’t belong to me, perhaps? And then… whoosh. Not a big fall, usually, just a wobble. It happens more when I’m walking, and sometimes when I stand for a long time. It’s… unsettling. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Not quite there,” interesting. And how often would you say this “whoosh” happens?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… hard to say. It isn’t every day, certainly. Perhaps… a few times a week? Sometimes more if I've been working long hours. It’s been… worse recently, I think. Work is… demanding. I operate a rotary drill, you see. A lot of standing, a lot of… vibration. Though, I don't know if that’s connected. I really don’t remember things very well.
DOCTOR: A rotary drill, yes. That could be a factor, though as you say, recollection is… problematic. Let’s try to get a bit more detail here. When you stand for a long time, does it happen immediately, or after a while?
PATIENT: Oh, um… usually after a while. Not right away. I can stand for a bit, maybe ten or fifteen minutes, and then… it starts. A little bit of swaying, and then… the unsteady feeling. It’s difficult to describe the timing, precisely. It just… builds up. And it feels… worse if I haven’t eaten. Though, again, I'm not entirely sure. I often forget to eat when I’m busy.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it worsens with prolonged standing, potentially exacerbated by lack of food. We’ll need to explore that further. Now, let's talk about other things. Any problems with your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… Oh. I haven’t really noticed any problems, no. Though, I suppose I haven’t had it checked in… a long time. Years, probably. Everything seems… normal. Perhaps a little blurry sometimes, but I assumed that was just… tiredness. I work very long shifts, you see. And the dust… it can get in your eyes. I just blink it away.
DOCTOR: Dust and long shifts. Alright. Any headaches associated with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Headaches… No, not usually. Occasionally, a mild one, but nothing… severe. More of a pressure, really, behind my eyes. But it doesn’t always happen with the unsteadiness, no. It’s… unrelated, I think. Or, at least, I haven't noticed a connection. It’s difficult to say for certain. I apologize for being… vague.
DOCTOR: Vague is… unhelpful, Miss Snerling. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… that’s… a good question. I work around very loud machinery all day, you see. The drill, and the compressors… Everything is quite noisy. I suppose… my hearing is probably a bit muffled? But I've gotten used to it, so I don’t really notice a change. I haven't been able to hear things clearly for a while, to be honest. I assumed it was the noise. I apologize. It’s hard to… isolate things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on from the senses for a moment. Any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Sometimes, yes. In my feet, mostly. A little bit of… pins and needles, I think you call it? It doesn't happen all the time, and it goes away on its own. It’s usually at the end of a long shift. I thought it was just… my boots being too tight. Or maybe… standing for too long. I'm sorry. I feel like I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: “Not very helpful” is… an understatement. Let’s try to establish some baseline information. Have you had any significant illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… difficult. I… I don't really remember much about my medical history. My husband… he always took care of those things. He passed away a few years ago, you see. It’s all very… hazy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I think. Nothing… serious. I had a surgery once, on my… appendix, I believe? But that was years ago. I truly apologize for being so… unorganized. I wish I could recall more details. It’s just… gone.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh. No, not regularly. Sometimes I take something for… headaches, but it's just over-the-counter. Ibuprofen, I think. And occasionally, something for… sleep. But it doesn’t always work. It's just when I can't… rest. That’s all. I don’t have a regular doctor, you see. My husband… he handled everything. It's all very… confusing. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to stand up, if you’re able. We’ll check your balance, coordination, and reflexes. Do you have any difficulty with standing?
PATIENT: Oh… um. No, not… immediately. But… I feel a little unsteady even thinking about it. Perhaps if I hold onto something? It's just… the feeling is already there, you see. Building up. It might be safer if I had something to… steady myself with. I apologize for being… anxious. It’s just… I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll need you to hold onto the chair. Now, let’s try standing with your feet together, and close your eyes. Don’t worry, I'm right here.
PATIENT: Oh… um… okay. Oh… dear. I… I don’t feel very stable. It's… worse when my eyes are closed. I feel like I’m going to… wobble. Please… be careful.
DOCTOR: Right. That’s what I suspected. Marked instability with Romberg testing. Now, let's try a quick neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Oh… um… yes, I believe so. It's… a little difficult. My eyes feel… heavy. And I'm trying very hard not to… wobble. Please… be patient.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Weak reflexes, bilaterally. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply. Heart rate slightly elevated, lung sounds clear. Now, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, vitamin B12 levels, and a thyroid panel. And I want you to schedule an MRI of your brain.
PATIENT: Oh… um. That sounds… like a lot. An MRI? Is that… serious? And blood work… I don’t like needles. Is there something… wrong? I apologize for… panicking. I just… I don’t understand. What do you think is happening? I feel so… unsteady. And now I’m… frightened.
DOCTOR: Miss Snerling, please. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious when you don’t know what’s going on. The MRI and blood work are simply to gather information. We need to rule out several possibilities. Vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other neurological conditions can cause these symptoms. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to investigate. Given your symptoms – the unsteadiness, the weakness, the difficulty with balance – and the preliminary findings from my exam, I want to refer you to a neurologist. I’m also concerned about possible B12 deficiency. I’ll write you a prescription for a B12 supplement in the meantime. We'll get these tests done as quickly as possible. And I want you to avoid driving until we have a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Avoid driving… yes. I… I understand. A neurologist… that sounds… very serious. And the B12… I… I apologize for being so… difficult. I just… I feel so lost. And frightened. Will… will I be okay? Will I… fall? Is there anything… anything I can do now? Other than… avoiding driving? I just want to… feel stable again.
DOCTOR: Miss Snerling, I understand your fear. It's good you're asking questions. For now, take it one step at a time. Until we have the results of the tests, focus on your safety. Make sure you have someone with you when you're walking, especially on uneven surfaces. Use a cane or walker if you feel unsteady. And please, don't hesitate to call my office if your symptoms worsen. I know this is overwhelming, but we’ll get to the bottom of this. The neurologist will perform a more comprehensive evaluation and determine the best course of treatment. To reiterate: No driving. Avoid heights. Be cautious with movement. And please, try to rest and reduce your stress as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… um… No… I don’t think so. I… I’m just… overwhelmed. Thank you… for trying. And… for being patient. I… I think I should go now. I… I need to sit down. And… rest. .
