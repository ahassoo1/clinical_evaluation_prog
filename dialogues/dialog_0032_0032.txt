DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re eighty-three years young. Welcome to the clinic. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Eighty-three, yes… a rather long time, wouldn’t you say? Well, it’s… a delicate matter, really. Something a man doesn’t typically discuss so openly. I’ve noticed… a discharge. An unpleasantness, if you will. It’s been going on for… some time now, I suppose. Though, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it once was. I just know it’s bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. These things can be difficult to discuss. “An unpleasantness,” as you put it, is perfectly acceptable phrasing. And don’t worry about the timeline; we’ll work through it. To help me understand, could you describe this discharge a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically… hmm. Well, it’s not… copious, thankfully. More of a… a dampness, really. And a bit… yellowish, I believe. Though the lighting in my bathroom isn't the best, you understand. It's certainly not blood, thankfully. And there’s no… odor, not that I’ve noticed, at least. My wife, bless her heart, hasn’t complained. She's usually very vocal when something's amiss.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Krok. No blood and no odor are good signs. A yellowish dampness… and it’s been ongoing, you said?
PATIENT: Ongoing… yes. How long, precisely? That’s… difficult. Weeks, certainly. Perhaps months. It began gradually, a little bit at a time. I initially dismissed it as… well, age, you understand. Things don't function as they once did. One tends to develop… leaks, as one gets older. My wife suggested I come see someone, but I resisted for some time. I don’t like bothering doctors with… trifles.
DOCTOR: I see. While it’s admirable that you’ve been monitoring it, Mr. Krok, dismissing a change in your body as simply “age” is rarely advisable. Now, have you noticed any pain, burning, or itching associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A slight discomfort, perhaps, but nothing I would describe as painful. A bit of sensitivity, occasionally, but it’s fleeting. Itching… now that you mention it, yes. A little bit, especially after… well, after using the facilities. But nothing debilitating, certainly not enough to keep me up at night. My skin is rather dry these days, you see. Perhaps it’s just that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or any changes in your urinary habits – such as increased frequency, urgency, or difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Fever or chills? No, thankfully. I’ve felt perfectly… robust, all things considered. As for the… urinary habits, you ask? Well, I suppose I do get up a bit more frequently at night than I used to. But that’s to be expected, isn’t it? A full bladder is a common affliction of old age. Difficulty urinating… no, not particularly. It takes a moment to get going sometimes, but that’s been true for years. Nothing new in that regard. I assure you, Doctor, I’m not a complete invalid.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krok. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination. This will involve a brief examination of your abdomen and a genital exam. I will, of course, explain everything as I go and ensure your privacy is maintained. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: A physical exam… hmm. Well, I suppose it’s necessary, if you insist. I’m not overly fond of such things, but I trust your professional judgment. Privacy is certainly paramount, naturally. I’m a modest man, Doctor. And please, be gentle. Things aren’t as… resilient as they once were.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll start with listening to your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, although somewhat diminished, which can be normal with age. Now, I will need to perform a genital exam. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. I observed some mild erythema of the glans. No obvious lesions or discharge visible at this moment, though it could be intermittent. I didn’t detect any significant swelling or tenderness.
PATIENT: Erythema… is that good or bad, Doctor? You’re using rather… technical terms. And intermittent… so it wasn’t there now? This is all rather disconcerting, you know. I came to you with a simple… unpleasantness, and now you’re talking about redness and… things appearing and disappearing. Is it serious? Please, Doctor, be frank with me. I’m an old man, I don’t need to be coddled.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, “erythema” simply means redness, and in this case, it's mild. It's not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it does warrant investigation. The fact that the discharge wasn't present during the exam doesn't rule anything out; these things can be intermittent, as you pointed out. Based on what you've described, and my initial examination, the most likely possibility is balanitis – inflammation of the glans, often due to infection or irritation. However, to be certain, I’d like to order a urine analysis to rule out a urinary tract infection, and a swab of the glans for a microscopic examination and culture to identify any specific pathogens. Do you agree to those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… of course, tests. It seems everything requires tests these days. Balanitis… is that contagious? My wife and I… well, we’re rather close, you understand. And a culture… does that involve taking something from me? I’m growing increasingly uncomfortable with this whole process, Doctor. But if it’s necessary to determine what’s ailing me, then I suppose I have no choice. Yes, proceed with your… investigations. But please, be as quick and discreet as possible. My dignity is a fragile thing, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Krok, and I assure you, we will proceed with the utmost discretion and sensitivity. Balanitis is not typically contagious, so your wife is not at risk. The swab will involve a gentle collection of a small sample from the glans – it’s a quick and relatively painless procedure. I’ll write the orders for the lab work now. You can visit the lab downstairs; they’re expecting you. It should only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend keeping the area clean and dry. Do you have any questions before I proceed?
PATIENT: Questions… yes, actually. How long will these results take? I’m not one for waiting, you see. And what sort of… treatment are we talking about? Pills? Creams? Injections? I’ve never been one for needles. And finally… is it possible this is something… more serious? Something I should be worried about? Please, Doctor, I need a straight answer. I’m an old man, but I still have my fears.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, the lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. Treatment for balanitis usually involves a topical antifungal or antibiotic cream, applied directly to the area. In rare cases, oral medication may be necessary, but that’s unlikely in your case. Injections are not typically required. Now, regarding your question about something more serious… While balanitis is often a straightforward condition, it's important to rule out other possibilities. Rarely, symptoms like this can be associated with conditions such as lichen sclerosus, or even, in very rare instances, penile cancer. That’s why the tests are important – to get a definitive diagnosis and ensure appropriate treatment. However, based on my initial examination, I don’t believe this is cause for immediate alarm. We are being thorough, which is the best course of action. I will call you as soon as the results are available. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Cancer… you said cancer? Good heavens. I… I hadn’t even considered such a thing. That’s… unsettling, to say the least. Lichen… whatever that is… it sounds dreadful. So, you’re saying this… unpleasantness could be a sign of something far more serious? I must confess, Doctor, I’m beginning to regret coming here. I should have just ignored it, perhaps. Left it well enough alone. I suppose… I suppose I have no choice but to wait for these results. But please, Doctor, be as prompt as possible. The uncertainty is… agonizing. And if it is something… serious, I want to know immediately. I may be an old man, but I still have… arrangements to make.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, please allow me to clarify. I mentioned those possibilities only to be completely thorough and transparent. The vast majority of cases like yours are due to a simple infection or irritation. We are running these tests to rule out anything more serious, not because I suspect it. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, I will call you the moment the results are available. We will discuss them in detail, and I will answer all your questions. In the meantime, try to remain calm. Worrying will not change the outcome, but focusing on your well-being will. I've written a note for the lab emphasizing the need for a quick turnaround. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… please, Doctor, call me as soon as you have the results. Don’t delay. I need to know. And if it is something… serious, I’d like to discuss my options immediately. I have a wife, you see. And… arrangements. Yes, arrangements. Thank you, Doctor Pipkorn. I appreciate your… thoroughness. Although, I confess, I wish I hadn’t come. But perhaps… perhaps it’s better to know.
