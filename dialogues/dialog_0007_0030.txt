DOCTOR: Hi Kerriann, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor Hernandez, good to meet you too. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor recently, and it’s…different. It's not worse, just…not me, you know? I haven’t changed anything in my routine – same soap, same deodorant, same clothes. It just started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It's good you brought it up – changes like that can be worth investigating, even if they seem small. And don't worry about embarrassment, I deal with all sorts of things. So, a few weeks ago you noticed a change in your body odor, despite keeping everything else consistent. Can you describe the difference?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's hard to put into words. It’s…sweeter, maybe? Not like perfume sweet, but…faintly fruity, almost. And it seems to come on quicker, like after just a little bit of activity. Usually I can go most of the day without noticing anything, but now it's…there sooner. It’s not awful, but it's enough to make me wonder what's going on. I haven't been feeling sick or anything, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, sweeter and fruity, coming on quicker with activity… and no other symptoms. That’s helpful. And you said "most of the day" usually – so this is a noticeable shift from your typical experience. Just to clarify, is this all over, or is it localized to a specific area, like your armpits or groin?
PATIENT: It's... mostly under my arms, I think. I haven't really noticed it anywhere else. Sometimes, maybe a little bit, but it's definitely most obvious when I move my arms. And it’s not like a strong smell, more like… a hint. It's subtle, but I notice it, and that's why I came in. I don't want something small turning into something big, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely – it's always best to get these things checked out. Okay, so primarily under the arms, subtle, and a recent change. Have you noticed any changes in your skin in those areas?
PATIENT: No, not really. No rashes, bumps, or anything like that. The skin feels normal, looks normal. Same as usual. I check sometimes, because I do a lot of work with my hands and on my knees, so I'm used to looking for cuts or scrapes. But everything looks fine. It's just… the smell.
DOCTOR: Alright, no skin changes, just the odor. And you mentioned working with your hands and on your knees – what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I’m a floor layer. Mostly vinyl and linoleum, things like that. Not carpet or wood. It’s physical work, lots of bending and kneeling, and I get pretty warm doing it. It’s good work, but it can be hard on the body. I've been doing it for…oh, goodness, almost 20 years now.
DOCTOR: Okay, 20 years as a floor layer, physical work, bending and kneeling, getting warm… that’s good context. Have you noticed any changes in your sweating overall?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Not really. I sweat like normal, I guess. More when it's hot or I'm working hard, less when it's cold. Nothing out of the ordinary. It’s not like I’m sweating more, it’s just…the smell of the sweat is different. It's hard to explain. Like, it used to be a normal sweat smell, and now it's… this sweet thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, normal amount of sweat, but a change in the odor. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don't mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s managed with medication. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, as far as I know. I see my primary care doctor for check-ups every year, and everything’s always been good. I'm on Medicare, so they keep a pretty close eye on things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good – managed high blood pressure, annual check-ups, and on Medicare. Do you take any other medications besides what's for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains after work, but that’s it. Just as needed, not every day. I try to avoid taking anything if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, and ibuprofen as needed. And no allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, been stung by bees, no problems. My mother had some pretty bad hay fever, but I never got it. Nothing like that on my side of the family, really. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, good - no known allergies. Let’s move on to family history. Do you have any family members with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father had heart problems. He died when I was pretty young, actually. And my brother has arthritis, but that’s about it, as far as I know. Nothing really major on either side of the family. I don’t know much about my grandparents, to be honest. They passed away a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father, and arthritis in your brother. And now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I work a lot, like I said. It's pretty physical, so I get a good workout during the day. I don't really have a lot of extra time for hobbies, but I try to eat healthy when I can. Mostly just regular food, nothing fancy. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner every now and then. I live alone, so it's usually just me. It’s a pretty simple life. I try to stay active and take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, active work life, healthy diet, no smoking, occasional alcohol. That's all helpful. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your armpits. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. That sounds good. Go ahead. I'm ready when you are. I hope you don’t mind, I haven’t worn deodorant today, so you can get a good smell. I figured it would be best.
DOCTOR: That was thoughtful of you. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. And visually, your armpits look normal – no rashes, bumps, or anything unusual. I do detect a slightly sweet odor in both armpits. It's subtle, as you described. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Your pulse is 72 and regular. I don't feel any swollen lymph nodes. Given your history and the physical exam, it sounds like we're dealing with something called bromhidrosis. It's a relatively common condition where body odor changes due to a combination of sweat and bacteria. Sometimes it's caused by changes in diet, medication, or stress, but often there’s no clear cause. In your case, the slightly sweet odor could be a result of changes in the bacteria on your skin, or possibly a mild reaction to the Lisinopril. It's not usually a serious concern, but it can be bothersome. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Brom…hidro…sis? Oh goodness, that's a mouthful. Well, it does sound like what’s happening, I guess. It’s good to know it’s not anything serious. I was worried it was something worse. So, changes in bacteria or… the medicine? Is there anything I can do about it? I don’t want to stop taking my blood pressure medicine if I don't have to. It keeps me healthy.
DOCTOR: You're right to be cautious about stopping your medication! We definitely don't want to do that without exploring other options first. Okay, so bromhidrosis. It’s a change in body odor, usually caused by bacteria breaking down sweat. The Lisinopril can sometimes cause changes in body odor as a side effect, though it’s not common. Here’s what we can try. First, let’s rule out anything simple. I recommend trying an antibacterial soap in the shower, focusing on your armpits. And make sure you’re drying thoroughly after washing. Sometimes, that's enough to help. If that doesn't work, we can try a topical antibacterial cream. I can prescribe you something mild to start with. If that doesn't work, we can consider talking to your primary care doctor about switching blood pressure medications. But let's start with the simplest things first. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds like a good plan. Simple things first, that makes sense. I can definitely try the antibacterial soap and drying thoroughly. I usually just use regular soap, so that's an easy change. And a cream wouldn't bother me, if it comes to it. I appreciate you not just saying I have to stop taking my medicine right away. That puts my mind at ease. So, just try the soap for now, and see what happens? Do I need a prescription for the antibacterial soap, or is the regular kind okay?
DOCTOR: Exactly – let's try the soap for a week or two and see if it makes a difference. You don't need a prescription for the antibacterial soap. Any over-the-the-counter antibacterial body wash will do. Look for something with ingredients like benzalkonium chloride or triclosan. If you don't see any improvement after two weeks, give my office a call, and we can discuss the prescription cream. And if you do notice a rash or any irritation after using the soap, stop using it immediately and call us. In the meantime, if you notice any other changes, like fever, weight loss, or night sweats, please let me know right away. Those could indicate something more serious. But based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I don't think that’s likely. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all makes sense. Soap for two weeks, watch for irritation, and call if anything changes. You've been very thorough, Doctor Hernandez. I really appreciate it. It's a relief to know it's probably not something serious. Thank you for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Here's a little handout about bromhidrosis with some additional tips. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, you too. I will. Bye bye!
