DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, well, it's… unpleasant. Been throwin' up blood, mostly. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to worry a fella. Started a couple days ago. Honestly, I've had worse aches and pains, but my daughter insisted I come. She gets… worked up. Says it’s “serious”. I think she watches too much TV.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Vomiting blood is definitely something we need to investigate, even if it’s not a large amount. It's good of your daughter to encourage you to get it checked out – it’s always better to be safe. When you say a couple of days ago, can you recall specifically when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it was after I had that kebab from Old Man Hemlock’s truck. Tuesday, I reckon. Yeah, Tuesday evening. Ate it around… sixish? Felt alright at the time, but woke up Wednesday feelin' queasy. Then, well, you know. Not my finest moment, I can tell ya. Hemlock’s truck hasn't been lookin' too clean lately, if you ask me. Used to be a real stickler for hygiene, that fella.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tuesday evening after the kebab from Old Man Hemlock's truck. And you started feeling queasy Wednesday morning, followed by the vomiting blood. Can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Describe it? What am I, a painter? It's blood, Doc. Red. Mostly. Though, it wasn’t like… bright red, you know? More… dark. Like coffee grounds, maybe? Mixed in with the… other stuff. And it smells… well, like you'd expect it to smell. I ain’t exactly a medical man. Honestly, I tried not to look too close. It’s just… unnerving, alright? Is Hemlock finally lettin’ things slip? That truck is a local landmark, you know. Been there forever.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't want to get into too much detail. "Coffee grounds" is a very helpful description, actually. That can tell us a lot. And you’re right to be concerned about the source. We'll certainly consider that. Aside from the vomiting, have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… My stomach’s been rumblin’ somethin’ fierce. And I’ve been… tired. Real tired. More than usual, even. I work the night shift, you know? Crematory work ain't exactly a picnic. But this is… different. Just feelin’ drained. And a little lightheaded, I suppose. Especially when I stand up too fast. My daughter keeps tellin’ me I’m pale. She’s got a good eye, I’ll give her that. But I reckon she sees problems where there ain't any. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so stomach rumbling, fatigue, and lightheadedness, especially when standing. Your daughter noticing you’re pale is also good to know. Now, have you had any fever, chills, nausea without vomiting, diarrhea, or any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: No fever. Definitely no chills. Nausea… well, I feel sick to my stomach, but it usually ends with the… unfortunate incident, if you catch my drift. No diarrhea. Bowel movements have been… normal, I suppose. As normal as they ever are. Look, Doc, I ain't one for talkin' about… personal things. Is this gettin’ anywhere? I got a shift startin’ in a few hours. A late one. And… well, you know how it is. People gotta be… taken care of. Regardless of my own… discomfort.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. You're right, we've covered a good amount already. And I appreciate you sharing everything with me. Let's quickly go over your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history? Not much to tell ya, Doc. I've always been a strong fella. Work hard, eat… well, usually alright. Had a bit of trouble with my back a few years back, but that sorted itself out with some strong pain killers and a bit of rest. Lost my wife, bless her soul, five years ago. That was… hard. But no serious illnesses. No diabetes, no heart problems. Just… gettin' old, I suppose. And stressed. My daughter… she means well, but she's a handful. She keeps tryin' to get me to take vitamins. As if that's gonna solve anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of back pain that resolved, and your wife passing five years ago – I'm very sorry for your loss. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. No other significant medical conditions. Do you take any medications regularly – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just the occasional pain killer for the back, when it flares up. Usually ibuprofen. Nothing regular, though. And I take a multi-vitamin sometimes, just to keep my daughter happy. She buys 'em, so I take one now and then. Mostly just… water, Doc. Gotta stay hydrated, you know? It's a dirty job. And a long night ahead. Folks don't just… disappear. Even when they do. Someone's gotta look after 'em. Still. Is this gettin' anywhere? I'm startin' to feel a bit queasy again, just thinkin' about it all.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain and occasional multivitamins to appease your daughter. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, no allergies. Never had any trouble with that. Bees, maybe, but who hasn't been stung by a bee? I ain't exactly spendin' my days strollin' through a flower garden. Mostly I'm indoors, with… well, you know. It's a quiet job, usually. Though, lately… quiet ain't exactly the word I'd use. This whole blood thing… it's just… unsettlin', alright? And I gotta get back to work. Folks are countin' on me. Even the ones who… ain't countin' anymore. So. Allergies? No. Just… tired. And a bit queasy. And worried about Old Man Hemlock's truck. Honestly. It's probably just that kebab. It has to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. I understand your concerns about getting back to work, and your worry about the kebab. To finish up with your history, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hmm… let me think. Not that I recall. Had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I reckon. Back in Yemen, it was a pretty standard thing. But that was… a long time ago. Nothing else. No major operations. Just… the tonsils. And the occasional back tweak that I fixed myself with a bit of ibuprofen and a strong will. Honestly, Doc, I ain't one for hospitals. Too… sterile, if you catch my drift. Prefer to keep things simple. Now, are we done here? I really gotta get goin'. Folks are… waitin'. And the thought of that kebab… it's startin' to churn my stomach again. It has to be the kebab. It's the only thing that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child. No other surgeries. Alright, Mr. Gentz, that gives me a good picture of your medical background. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check for any signs of dehydration. It won’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… quick, alright? I got a shift to get to. And honestly, I'd rather not think about… anything, at the moment. Just get it done, Doc. And tell me it’s that kebab. Please. Just tell me it’s that kebab. Folks are dependin' on me, and this whole situation… it's just… unsettlin'. A quick exam. And a diagnosis. That's all I'm askin' for. Just tell me it’s that kebab.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I’ll do my best to be as quick and thorough as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 88 beats per minute. Not bad. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Your abdomen is soft, but there's some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Not alarming, but we’ll keep it in mind. You don’t appear to be significantly dehydrated, but I’ll order some blood work just to be sure. It will check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function, and kidney function. We'll also check an amylase and lipase to rule out pancreatitis.
PATIENT: Pancreatitis? What's that? Sounds… serious. Look, Doc, I appreciate you doin' all this, but… you're makin' me nervous. All this talk of blood work and… pancreas things… I just want to know if it's that kebab. Is that too much to ask? I gotta get back to work. Folks are… waitin'. And this whole situation… it’s just… unsettlin'. Can we just rule out the kebab first? Maybe I just ate somethin' bad. Old Man Hemlock's truck hasn't been lookin' too clean lately, you know. He used to be a real stickler for hygiene. Honestly. Is it the kebab? Please tell me it's the kebab.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Gentz. I'm not trying to scare you, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel that way. Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, and it can sometimes cause abdominal pain and vomiting. It’s not something we want to ignore, but it’s not necessarily common. We’re just being thorough, to make sure we cover all possibilities. You’re right to focus on the kebab. Food poisoning is definitely a possibility, and it's the most likely explanation given the timing. However, vomiting blood – even a small amount – is concerning enough that we need to rule out other potential causes. The blood work will help us do that. It will also tell us how hydrated you are, which is important. We'll run these tests, and I’ll call you with the results as soon as they come back, likely tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding solid foods and sticking to clear liquids. If the vomiting continues or gets worse, or if you experience any new symptoms – like fever, chills, severe abdominal pain, or black, tarry stools – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Blood work. No solid food. Clear liquids. Emergency room if things get worse. You're makin' me feel like an old man fallin' apart, Doc. Honestly. But… alright. If you say it's necessary. Just… call me as soon as you have the results. And… please. Tell me it's that kebab. It has to be the kebab. Folks are waitin'. And I really don't wanna spend my day explainin' to 'em why I'm outta commission. And… look, no offense, but can we hurry this up? I got a shift to get to. And thinkin' about Old Man Hemlock’s truck… it's churnin' my stomach again. Is there anything else? Any more tests? Any more… talk? Just… let me get back to work. And please. The kebab. Tell me it's the kebab.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Gentz, that's all for now. We'll start with the blood work and see what the results tell us. I've already given the order to the lab, and they're ready for you whenever you're ready. I understand your concerns and appreciate your patience. I will call you as soon as the results are back – most likely tomorrow morning. And I promise to do everything I can to get you back to work as soon as possible. Here's the lab slip. Just take it to the front desk, and they'll direct you. In the meantime, focus on staying hydrated and getting some rest. And while we can’t say for certain yet, the kebab is certainly a plausible explanation. We’ll have a better idea once we see the blood work. Get well soon, Mr. Gentz. .
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Blood work. Kebab. Rest. Thanks, Doc. I appreciate it. Kebab. It has to be the kebab… folks are waitin’…
