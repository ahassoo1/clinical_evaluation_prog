DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again… my flank, I think you’d call it. And it seems to come with…trouble going to the bathroom, if you understand me. It’s been happening on and off for a while now.
DOCTOR: On and off…right. And when you say “trouble,” can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Well, it burns when I go. And I feel like I have to go very often, even when there isn’t much there. It’s…uncomfortable, to say the least. It’s happened a few times now, and each time it feels…worse than the last, if that makes sense. I don't know if it's related to my kidneys, the doctor a while back mentioned something about them.
DOCTOR: Right. Burning, frequency…and you said something about your kidneys?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A doctor years ago – I can’t recall his name now, sadly – told me I had something with my kidneys. Polycystic…something? He said there were little pockets on them. I didn’t fully understand it then, and he didn’t explain it very well, to be honest. He just said to come back if I had trouble. And I suppose…this is trouble.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease…yes, that does explain some things. Alright. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on now. Besides the burning and frequency, are you having any pain in your back?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes. Not all the time, but a dull ache, low down on my back. It’s hard to describe. It doesn’t come and go like the flank pain, it's more…constant, but not sharp, you understand? And sometimes, I feel a bit tired, just generally run down. But I'm an old man, Doctor, so who knows if that's related.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, constant… fatigue. Yes, I understand. And is there any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that you mention it… yes. A couple of times, I’ve noticed a little bit of red when I… well, you know. Not a lot, mind you, just a tinge. I thought it might be something I ate, but perhaps it is something more serious. It’s scared me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. We definitely need to investigate this further. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and back, and then I'll gently press on those areas to check for tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m not a fan of doctors, but I know I need to find out what’s going on. Just…be gentle, if you would. My back isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. Now, just lie back for me, please. Okay. I’m listening now. I do detect some tenderness in your flank, on both sides, and a little bit lower down in your back. Nothing terribly alarming at this point, but it’s good we’re checking. Now, I'm just going to gently press here…and here…any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit when you press on my side, right there. It’s not sharp, more like a…deep ache, like a bruise. And a little bit in my lower back, too, but not as bad. It’s…uncomfortable, but I can tolerate it. I just hope it's not something too serious. I’m not a young man anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, we need to rule out a few things. Given your history of possible polycystic kidney disease and the blood in your urine, I suspect we're dealing with either a kidney infection or a blockage. We'll need some tests to confirm. I’m going to order a urinalysis – that will check for infection – and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The CT scan will give us a much clearer picture of your kidneys and surrounding structures. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds a bit…serious, doesn’t it? But if it's what you recommend, Doctor, then yes, that’s fine. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. A urinalysis I understand, just a sample, right? Is the CT scan…painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bit of a schedule, you see, and I need to make arrangements if it’s a long process.
DOCTOR: A CT scan is just a series of X-rays, Mr. Espinueva. It’s not painful, although you will need to lie still for a bit. And yes, it does require some arrangements. You’ll need to drink some contrast beforehand, which is why it takes a bit of time. As for the results…usually within 24 to 48 hours, but it depends on the radiologist. I’ll have my nurse schedule you for both tests. She’ll give you specific instructions about the contrast for the CT scan, it's very important to follow those. In the meantime, I want you to drink plenty of fluids - at least eight glasses of water a day. And if you develop a fever, or the pain gets significantly worse, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Plenty of fluids, eight glasses a day, and emergency room if fever or worse pain. I will write that down. And the nurse will schedule the tests… that’s good. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, even if it sounds a bit…worrying. I’m a bit anxious, but I suppose that’s to be expected. Thank you, Doctor. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or anything I should avoid doing while I wait for the results?
DOCTOR: Avoid strenuous activity, Mr. Espinueva. And refrain from any heavy lifting. Honestly, you shouldn't be doing those things anyway at your age. I'll also send a referral to a urologist, just to get a second opinion once we have the test results. They specialize in kidney and bladder problems, and will be best equipped to determine the best course of treatment. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… hmm. I don’t think so. I've had tests before, years ago, but I don't recall any problems. I’ve always been a fairly healthy man, all things considered. I don't have any known allergies to medication, and I haven't had any bad reactions to anything in the past. But I suppose it’s best to be sure. My nurse will ask me about that when she schedules the tests, right? She’ll be very thorough, I’m sure. Thank you again, Doctor. I think that’s everything for now. I’ll wait to hear from the nurse. .
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will go over everything with you. Just drink plenty of fluids, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Alright, you’re all set. Have a good day, Mr. Espinueva.
