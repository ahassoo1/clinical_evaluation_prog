DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... what brings me in... It's my joints, I think. They get… stiff. Especially in the morning. It's just… bothersome, you know? I don't really remember when it started, exactly. Just… always kinda there, lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Stiffness in your joints, particularly in the mornings. And you say it's been gradually worsening, or just consistently present for a while now?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Or maybe not. It's hard to say. Things… blur, you know? I just know getting out of bed is not as easy as it used to be. My hands, mostly. And my knees. It's not a sharp pain, just… tight. Like they need a good oiling or something.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, stiffness in your hands and knees, worse in the morning, and not so much a sharp pain as a feeling of tightness. Can you tell me, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the stiffness at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale… Zero to ten… Hmm. Well, it's not that bad. I can still do things, you know? I work with children… well, I did. Maybe… a four? On a bad morning, a four. Most days it's more like a two or three. It just… makes everything slower. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Lilliana. A four on a bad morning, two to three on average, and it’s impacting your ability to do things easily. Besides your hands and knees, are you noticing any stiffness or discomfort in any other joints – your elbows, wrists, shoulders, hips, ankles, or feet?
PATIENT: My… elbows sometimes. Not always. And my shoulders, a little bit. But mostly it's the hands and knees. My feet… I don't really pay much attention to my feet, to be honest. They just… are there. Is that a silly answer?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright! It's good you're telling me what you do notice. So, stiffness in your hands, knees, sometimes your elbows and shoulders. Now, have you noticed any swelling in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… I don't think so. Not really. They might look a little… bigger sometimes, but I just figured that was… well, I’ve gained a little weight, you know? Nothing obvious, anyway. No big puffiness or anything. Just… normal-sized hands. For someone my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant swelling. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the stiffness, like fatigue, fever, or any skin rashes?
PATIENT: Fatigue… Oh, always tired, aren’t we all? No, no fever. And no rashes. I just… get worn out easier, I think. Especially after a long day. But who doesn’t, right? I just figured it was getting older. Or maybe the weather. This humidity is terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no rashes, just increased fatigue. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like arthritis, lupus, or any other autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. I… I had a doctor, a long time ago, after my husband passed. He checked me for… something. But I don't remember what. It was years ago. I don't think he said anything serious. Nothing they named, anyway. Just… regular check-ups. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is just… not what it used to be. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilliana. Don't worry about it at all. We can work through this. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That's all I can remember, really. And… I was in the hospital for a few days after I had my son. Complications, they said. But that was… a long time ago. Nothing recent. Just the usual things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a hospital stay after your son’s birth. Now, thinking about your family – are there any relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had arthritis, lupus, or any other autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s tricky. My mother… she had aches and pains, always complaining about her joints. But she was old, you know? She just… got old. And my grandmother… I don't really remember much about her. She lived in Greece. I don't think anyone was ever told they had anything special. Not that I recall, anyway. It's all a bit hazy, Doctor. So sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of specific autoimmune conditions. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. Just a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes. When it gets high. But not every day. And… I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because the doctor told me to. That's about it. Nothing fancy. Just the basics, you know? And I try to take ibuprofen for the aches if they get really bad, but it doesn't always help.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you take medication for your blood pressure occasionally, a vitamin D supplement, and ibuprofen as needed. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just check your joints for tenderness, swelling, and range of motion. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I just want to feel a little bit better, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just checking for any areas of swelling or pain when I move these joints. Okay, I’m noticing some mild tenderness in the knuckles of both hands and a slight limitation in the range of motion of both knees. There is no significant swelling in any of the joints I’m examining. Your reflexes are normal and your grip strength appears adequate. I'm also noting some mild crepitus – that’s a sort of grinding sensation – when you bend your knees.
PATIENT: Crepitus? That doesn’t sound good. Is that… serious? It just feels like… old bones, you know? But you’re the doctor. What do you think? Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It's good you asked. Crepitus isn’t necessarily serious on its own, Lilliana. It often just indicates some wear and tear in the joint – what you described as “old bones” isn’t far off! However, combined with the tenderness and limited range of motion, it does suggest some underlying joint inflammation. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it's most likely you are experiencing early osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease. It's a common condition, especially as we get older, and it happens when the cartilage in your joints starts to break down. To confirm this, I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out other potential causes of joint pain, like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. I’d also like to get X-rays of your hands and knees to see the extent of the cartilage loss. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Osteo… what-arthritis? That sounds… complicated. And blood tests and X-rays? Oh dear… I don’t like needles, Doctor. And X-rays… are they safe? Is it something really bad? Will I need… surgery? I just wanted something for the aches, not… all this. Is there anything else I can try first? Maybe some creams or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilliana. It can be overwhelming to hear all of this at once. Let’s break it down. Osteoarthritis simply means the cartilage – the cushioning in your joints – is wearing down. It’s very common, and thankfully, it doesn’t usually require surgery right away. The blood tests are to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, like rheumatoid arthritis, which is a different type of joint inflammation that requires different treatment. And X-rays help us see how much cartilage loss there is, so we can determine the best course of action. The X-rays use a very low dose of radiation, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. Before we consider more invasive options, we can absolutely try some less aggressive treatments. I recommend starting with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as you've already been doing. We can also explore topical creams with capsaicin or menthol, which can help relieve pain. Physical therapy can also be very beneficial to strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion. We can also discuss some lifestyle modifications, like losing weight if you are overweight, which can reduce stress on your joints. I want to assure you that we will take a step-by-step approach and explore all available options before considering anything more invasive. Would you be comfortable with starting with the blood tests and X-rays to get a better understanding of what’s going on, and then we can discuss these other treatments afterwards?
PATIENT: Okay… step-by-step. That sounds… better. Less scary. Blood tests and X-rays… alright. But no needles if you can help it, okay? And I really don't want surgery. Promise me. And those creams… do they smell bad? I can't stand strong smells. I guess we can try anything once, right? As long as it doesn't involve too many needles. Yes… let’s do the tests. And then talk about the creams and… other things. Just slowly, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilliana. No needles if we can avoid it – we'll work around your comfort level. And I promise you, surgery is a last resort – we will explore all other options first. The creams come in different scents, and we can definitely find one you like – or a scent-free option if you prefer. Okay, let’s get the paperwork started for the blood tests and X-rays. I'll write you a referral to the lab and the imaging center. They'll schedule appointments at your convenience. Then, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me in about a week or so to discuss the results and create a personalized treatment plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. A week… that’s enough time to brace myself. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very patient with me. Will the paperwork be difficult? My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you know. And I always lose my glasses. But yes… let’s do the paperwork. And then I can go home and… try to relax. Thank you again.
