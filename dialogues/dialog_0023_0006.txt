DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… I have been coughing up… some blood. It scared me a lot, so I thought I should come in. It’s not… a lot of blood, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I see. Coughing up blood, or hemoptysis as we call it, is certainly something we need to investigate. When did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, “hemoptysis”… yes. That’s a big word. It started… maybe three days ago? At first it was just a tiny bit, I thought it was maybe from brushing my teeth too hard. But then it happened again yesterday, and again this morning. That’s when I knew I needed to see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Three days ago, initially small, increasing over time. And you’ve noticed it with multiple coughs?
PATIENT: Yes, with a few different coughs. Not every cough, just… some of them. And it’s always with the… the mucus. Not just blood on its own, if that makes sense. It's mixed in. Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Weichers. You're doing fine. Mixed in with the mucus, good. Can you describe the color of the mucus and blood?
PATIENT: Oh… the color. Um… the mucus is usually clear, or maybe a little bit white. The blood… it's bright red. Not dark, not old-looking, bright red. Like… when you cut yourself a little bit, that kind of red. Does that make sense? I’m sorry if it’s… a gross description. It feels strange to talk about.
DOCTOR: Bright red, mixed with clear or white mucus. No dark or old blood. Alright. And aside from the blood, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever. No chills. I’ve been a little bit tired, but I also haven’t been sleeping very well since… well, since my husband passed. So I’m not sure if that’s related. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. Just… the coughing and the blood. And the tiredness, but maybe that's not the cough.
DOCTOR: I see. Fatigue, potentially related to grief, understandable. No fever, chills, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Hmm. That's a good question. I… I don't think so. Maybe a little bit, but I haven’t been eating much lately either, so it’s hard to say if it's from the cough or just… not having an appetite. It's been difficult to keep track of things, honestly. Is weight loss something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It can be a concerning sign, Ms. Weichers, but in your case, given your recent loss, it’s less clear-cut. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: Um… No, not really. I had asthma when I was a child, but I grew out of it a long time ago. I don’t take any medications regularly. I had the flu shot last year, and I’m generally healthy. My husband… he had some heart problems, but I don’t. Is that helpful? I’m so sorry, I just feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Asthma in childhood, resolved. No current medications. That is… adequate. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. And… no hospitalizations. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but it didn’t require a hospital stay. Just a cast. That's it, I think. Nothing major. Oh! I did have my appendix out when I was in college, but that was a long time ago. It went smoothly, no complications. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Appendectomy in college, no complications noted. Good. Now, family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a hard one. My mother had high blood pressure. And her sister… she had diabetes. My father’s side… they mostly had heart problems, I think. My husband’s father had… something with his lungs, I remember him coughing a lot when I first met him. But I don’t know what it was, specifically. Is that… enough information? I’m not very good at remembering family medical details.
DOCTOR: Adequate. And do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don't smoke, and I've never smoked. My husband used to, but he quit many years ago. He coughed a lot after he quit, but… well, that was different. He had other problems. I've always been very careful about avoiding smoke. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, good. Now, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, I haven't had a reaction to any foods. And no allergies to medications either. The doctors have given me some different things over the years, for colds and flu, and I've never had a problem. I think I'm pretty lucky, actually. Is that all the questions?
DOCTOR: Alright Ms. Weichers. I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam now. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Please take a deep breath when I ask you to. I want to rule out other causes for the bleeding.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I’m a little nervous, but I understand you need to check things. Please, just tell me what to do. Deep breaths, right? I can do that.
DOCTOR: Yes, deep breaths. Please sit up straight and relax your shoulders. I’m going to listen to your lungs first. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the lower right lobe. That’s not necessarily alarming, but we’ll need to investigate further. Now, let’s check your heart rate and blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, regular. Throat is clear, no obvious signs of infection. I’m going to palpate your lymph nodes as well. No significant swelling in the lymph nodes. Everything appears normal, however the diminished breath sounds are concerning.
PATIENT: Okay. Diminished breath sounds… that sounds… not good? What does that mean, Doctor? And what does investigating further involve? I'm a little scared now, if I'm being honest. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It could indicate several things, Ms. Weichers. It doesn't automatically mean anything serious, but it requires further evaluation. We need to rule out pneumonia, bronchitis, or, less likely, something more concerning. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count to start. The X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and check for any abnormalities. The blood count will help us identify any signs of infection or inflammation. I’m also going to order a sputum culture to test for any bacteria or other organisms that might be causing the bleeding. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think so. X-ray, blood count, and… sputum culture. To see if there's something in my lungs? That sounds… thorough. Okay. That’s good, I guess. Is the sputum culture… difficult? Do I have to… cough into something? I hope it’s not too unpleasant. I just want to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to provide a sputum sample, Ms. Weichers. It involves coughing deeply into a sterile container. The nurse will provide you with instructions and assist you. It can be a bit uncomfortable, but it’s not usually painful. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be available in a few days. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a mild cough suppressant to help manage your symptoms while we await the results. I want you to contact me immediately if your symptoms worsen, if you develop a fever, or if you experience any chest pain. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay. Cough suppressant… that sounds helpful. And I will contact you if things get worse, definitely. So, X-ray, sputum sample, wait for results… and call if I have a fever or chest pain. Is that everything? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It still makes me a little nervous, but I feel… a bit better knowing what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. The nurse will come in shortly to assist you with the sputum sample and provide you with the prescription and instructions for the X-ray. I'll review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them. I would like to see you again in one week, regardless of the results, for a follow-up. I understand you are grieving, Ms. Weichers, but it’s important to address your medical concerns promptly. It's vital we rule out any underlying causes for the bleeding. Do you have any further questions before I leave you to the nurse?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you for your time, and for being so patient with me. I will schedule a follow-up appointment. And I will contact you if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. I expect you to be proactive about your health, Ms. Weichers. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
