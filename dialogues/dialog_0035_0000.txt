DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Firestone. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my legs. They just… gave out, practically. A few days ago, I had a terrible cold, you know, the sniffles, achy all over. That cleared up, but now my legs are so weak. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I haven’t been able to do much of anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness in your legs after a cold. That is definitely concerning, and we'll figure out what's going on. When you say “gave out,” can you describe what that felt like exactly?
PATIENT: It wasn’t a sudden collapse, if that’s what you mean. It was more… gradual. I was walking to the grocery store, and I just noticed I was… slower. Then it felt like trying to walk through molasses, and then my knees just wouldn’t hold me up anymore. I didn’t fall, I just had to sit down on a bench. It’s been like that ever since, varying degrees of… not working. Honestly, it’s a bit frightening. I don’t usually have problems like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it was a gradual onset of weakness while walking, not a sudden collapse. And it's been persistent since then, varying in severity. That helps. Let me just pull up your record here… you mentioned the cold – do you recall when exactly that started, and did you have a fever at any point?
PATIENT: Let me think… the cold started last Monday, I believe. Yes, I did have a fever. Not a terribly high one, maybe 101 or 102, but definitely enough to feel awful. It lasted about three days, with the usual aches and congestion. And I made sure to drink plenty of fluids, naturally. I don’t like being sick, and I try to take care of myself. I don’t go around spreading germs either, unlike some people I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the cold started last Monday, with a fever peaking around 101-102 for about three days. And the leg weakness started after the fever broke?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It was a couple of days after the fever broke, really. I felt like I was getting better, thinking I was over the worst of it, and then… this. It’s just so frustrating! I have things to do, places to be. I can't be stuck sitting around. It's a terrible inconvenience, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not really. My hands feel fine, I can grip things normally. No numbness or tingling. It’s just my legs. Though, now that you mention it, I have been feeling… more tired than usual, but I figured that was just because I was recovering from the cold. I haven't been sleeping particularly well, either. But I chalked that up to the stress of this whole situation, truthfully. It’s just… unsettling, not knowing what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or tingling, hands are fine. More tired than usual, some difficulty sleeping, but you attribute that to the stress and the recent illness. Alright. Have you had any changes in your bowel or bladder habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Is that really necessary? I mean, really? I haven't had any… problems down there, if that’s what you’re asking. Everything is… normal, as far as I can tell. I find this line of questioning rather intrusive, to be frank. I came here because my legs aren't working, not to discuss… that. I just want to know what’s wrong with my legs. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt intrusive, Ms. Firestone. I assure you, I'm asking these questions to get a complete picture of your health and to rule out potential causes for your leg weakness. Sometimes seemingly unrelated symptoms can offer important clues. It's important to be thorough. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any pain in your legs, and if so, where exactly and what’s it like?
PATIENT: Fine. But I still think it’s rather unnecessary. As for pain… yes, actually. It’s mostly in my thighs, a sort of dull ache. It’s not sharp pain, more of a constant discomfort. It gets worse when I try to walk, naturally. And it's in both legs, equally. It’s not like one is significantly worse than the other. It just… hurts to move them. I’d describe it as… an old ache. Like I’ve been overdoing it at the gym, but I haven’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache in both thighs, worsens with walking. And have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no swelling at all. I've been keeping an eye on them. Honestly, I’m quite meticulous about my health, you know. I'd notice if my legs were swelling. It’s just the weakness and the ache, and frankly, the inconvenience of it all. This is really throwing a wrench in my plans. I was supposed to be visiting my sister next week, but I don't see how I can possibly go now. It's very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. No swelling, just weakness and thigh ache. Ms. Firestone, I think it’s time we do a quick physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs. It will help me narrow down the possible causes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. But please be gentle. I don’t like being poked and prodded. And do explain what you’re doing as you go. I don’t like surprises. Honestly, I’m rather concerned about this. It's just… unsettling, not knowing what’s going on. Is it something serious, Doctor? You haven't really said anything about what it might be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Firestone. I will explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with your reflexes. I’m just going to tap on your knee and ankle with this little hammer; it’s perfectly harmless. It helps me assess your nervous system. Okay, reflexes are… two plus bilaterally, normal. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Can you please try to push against my hand when I ask?
PATIENT: Fine. But do be careful. Honestly, I don’t understand why you need to do all of this. I told you my legs are weak. What more do you need to know? I just want a diagnosis, and perhaps a solution. This is taking far too long. But, go ahead. Push against your hand, you say? Very well. But don’t push too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, strength is… four plus on both sides for hip flexion and knee extension. Some mild weakness with dorsiflexion, about a three plus. And ankle plantar flexion is… five plus. I don’t notice any significant muscle wasting. Now, I’m going to check sensation. Close your eyes, and tell me when you feel me touch your legs.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is rather silly. I know I can feel you touch my legs. But, very well. You're touching… here. And here. And… there. Are you finding something? You haven't said anything! Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite anxious. This is taking far too long, and you're not telling me anything. Is it something serious? Is it my nerves? Am I going to be able to walk again? You need to be more forthcoming, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensation is intact bilaterally. Ms. Firestone, based on what you've told me and the initial exam, I suspect this could be related to a post-viral weakness. Sometimes, after a cold or flu, there can be temporary inflammation affecting the nerves and muscles. It doesn’t necessarily indicate something serious, but it's important to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, electrolyte balance, and inflammatory markers. I also recommend an MRI of your lumbar spine to rule out any nerve compression. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, I really don’t like being confined in those machines. Claustrophobic, you know. And blood work? More poking and prodding. It all seems… excessive. I just want to know what’s wrong and how to fix it, not be subjected to a battery of tests. Is there really no other way? Post-viral weakness… is that what you think it is? But how long will it last? Will I be able to visit my sister? Honestly, I’m very skeptical. And what about the cost of all of this? Medicare doesn’t cover everything, you know. This is all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone, and I want to address them all. The MRI will give us a clearer picture of your spinal nerves and rule out anything more serious. We can discuss options to make you more comfortable during the procedure – medication for anxiety, a wider machine if available, and a shorter scan time. As for the blood work, it’s a simple procedure, and it can help us identify any underlying deficiencies or inflammation that might be contributing to your weakness. Regarding your trip to see your sister, it's difficult to say definitively at this point how long the weakness will last. It could be a matter of weeks, but it's important to get a diagnosis and start appropriate treatment. I will check with Medicare to see what is covered, and my staff will help with any necessary pre-authorizations. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but it’s best to be thorough. We will discuss the test results thoroughly and create a treatment plan together. Would you like me to schedule the blood work and MRI for you?
PATIENT: Very well. But I still think it’s excessive. And please, make sure it’s a wide MRI machine, and I want something to calm my nerves. Honestly, I do not like being confined in those things. And do hurry it along. I have things to do, you know. And check with Medicare first before scheduling anything. I don’t want to be surprised by a huge bill. Alright, schedule the tests, but with all of those caveats. I suppose I have no choice. But I’m still skeptical. And Doctor? If it turns out to be nothing, I expect a full explanation and an apology for the inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Firestone. I’ll make sure to note all of your requests – wide MRI machine, anti-anxiety medication, and Medicare pre-authorization. I’ll have my staff contact you to schedule the blood work and MRI appointment. They’ll also confirm your insurance coverage and any potential out-of-pocket costs. I will personally review the results with you as soon as they are available. And if the tests are negative, I will absolutely provide a full explanation and apologize for any inconvenience. In the meantime, please try to rest and avoid strenuous activity. If your weakness worsens or you develop any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or difficulty breathing, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Honestly, I’m quite overwhelmed. Just… please make sure everything is handled smoothly. And do keep me informed. I don’t like being kept in the dark. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll be going now. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Firestone. My staff will be in touch. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day. .
