DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think? Something to do with… checking things. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. It was the paperwork, mostly. They said I needed to come in. Something about work… and making sure I’m okay to keep doing it?
DOCTOR: Right. The paperwork. Yes. It appears you had some blood work done recently, ordered by your employer, as part of a routine occupational health screening. And you’re concerned about what those results might indicate, correct?
PATIENT: Occupational… oh, yes, that’s right! I operate the paving equipment, you know? The big rollers and… tampers. It’s a good job, keeps me busy. But honestly, Doctor, I don’t really remember why they needed the blood work. Just that I needed it. And now I’m here. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Well, let’s not jump to conclusions. The blood work can indicate a number of things. It’s a broad screening tool. It shows your general health status. We’ll go through it. First, let's clarify a few things. Do you experience any fatigue, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Fatigue… hmm. You know, now that you mention it… I do get tired quicker than I used to. But honestly, I figured that was just getting older! I’m not as young as I once was, and that job… it’s physical. Long days in the sun, you know? Is that what you’re asking about? Just feeling… worn out?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. And what about shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. Not unless I’m really pushing myself on a hot day, running up and down the equipment. Then, yeah, I might get a little winded. But not just… sitting around. No. I haven’t noticed anything unusual, honestly. I walk a bit, too, when I can. Keeps me moving, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your skin color?
PATIENT: Skin color… oh dear. I haven’t really been looking at my skin color, Doctor! I put sunscreen on, when I remember, but… no, I don’t think so. I mean, I get a tan, of course, from being outside. But not… pale or anything? I’m French, you know, we’re supposed to have good color!
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Moving on. Do you have any history of bleeding easily?
PATIENT: Bleeding easily… no, not really. I mean, I get cuts and scrapes like anyone else, working with machinery and all. But they stop bleeding pretty normal. Nothing unusual. I don't bruise more than usual, I don't think. Oh, goodness, Doctor, this is a lot of questions! Is this about something serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, I assure you, these questions are necessary to build a complete picture. It’s a routine process. Now, have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Unexplained weight loss… hmm. That’s a good question. You know, I think I have lost a little weight… but I’ve also been eating less, to be honest. Trying to watch what I eat, you know? It’s hard when you’re tired all the time. I haven’t been trying to lose weight, but I wouldn't say it's completely unexpected. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: So, unintentional weight loss, concurrent with decreased appetite. Alright. Let's discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Chronic illnesses… oh dear. Let me think. My husband, bless his soul, he had… something with his heart, I think. But me? I haven't really been sick. Just the usual aches and pains, you know? A bit of arthritis in my knees, nothing serious enough for a doctor to bother with, really. I take some over-the-counter stuff now and then. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder out years ago. Must have been… twenty years ago, at least? And I had a hysterectomy, too. A long time ago. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. It was a long time ago, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be! I really don't remember much about either one, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my husband’s side had a bit of trouble with high blood pressure, I think. And his mother had diabetes. My mother… she lived a long life, very healthy, mostly. I don't really know much about her side of the family, to be honest. We didn't keep in touch much. It's sad, really. But it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, other than the over-the-counter pain relievers you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… just the ibuprofen for my knees, when they bother me. And… sometimes I take something for heartburn. It’s a little pink pill. I can't remember the name of it. Nothing else, Doctor. Really. I try to avoid taking too much medication. It can't be good for you, can it?
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to perform a brief physical exam. Just to assess your overall condition. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a quick look at your extremities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I understand. I just… hope it’s nothing serious. I really need to get back to work, you know? That equipment doesn’t run itself!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s begin. Please have a seat. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, rate is 78. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles noted. Blood pressure is 130/80. Peripheral pulses are 2+ in all extremities. Skin is warm and dry. No edema noted. Overall, your vitals are within acceptable ranges.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s… reassuring. Is that a good thing? You said “acceptable.” That doesn’t sound… fantastic. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, “acceptable” simply means within the normal parameters. It doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. However, given your reported fatigue and the recent blood work, I’d like to review the results more closely. Your hemoglobin is slightly low, at 11.5. Your iron levels are also on the lower end of the spectrum. This could explain the fatigue you’re experiencing. It suggests you may be slightly anemic.
PATIENT: Anemic…? Oh dear. What does that mean? Is it serious? Will I have to… stop working? I really can’t afford to stop working, Doctor. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Anemia simply means your body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your tissues. In your case, it appears to be iron-deficiency anemia. It’s not usually serious, but it can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. It's manageable. Stopping work isn't necessarily required, but we need to address the underlying cause. I recommend a course of iron supplementation. I’ll write you a prescription for ferrous sulfate, 325 milligrams twice daily.
PATIENT: Oh, iron pills… alright. Twice a day, you said? Will they… upset my stomach? I've heard those can be… difficult. And will I have to change anything else? My diet, or… anything? I mostly just eat whatever’s quick and easy, to be honest. I don't have much time for cooking.
DOCTOR: Yes, iron pills can sometimes cause stomach upset. Taking them with food can help minimize that. And it's preferable to take them with a source of Vitamin C, as that enhances absorption. As for your diet, you should try to incorporate more iron-rich foods. Lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and leafy green vegetables. But frankly, given your lifestyle, the supplementation is the more practical approach. I also recommend a follow-up appointment in six weeks to recheck your iron levels and assess your response to the treatment. We'll monitor your progress. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Vitamin C… and more iron-rich foods. I’ll try my best. It’s just… everything is so busy. Six weeks… that’s good. I’ll mark it on my calendar. Will this… make me feel better quickly? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: It's unlikely you'll feel an immediate difference. It typically takes several weeks for the iron levels to build up sufficiently to alleviate the symptoms. Be patient. And consistent with the medication. If you experience any severe side effects, such as persistent stomach pain or black, tarry stools, discontinue the medication and contact my office immediately. I’m providing you with a handout outlining the common side effects and dietary recommendations. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Side effects… and dietary recommendations. Black stools… that doesn't sound good. I’ll try my best, Doctor. Thank you. I really appreciate you looking into this. I just… I need to keep working. It’s important. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston. That is all. I’ll see you in six weeks. Please schedule the follow-up appointment with the receptionist on your way out. If anything arises before then, don't hesitate to contact the office. And try to prioritize a balanced diet, if possible. It will only benefit your overall health.
