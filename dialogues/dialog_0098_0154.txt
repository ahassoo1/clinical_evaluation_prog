DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, I suppose. They bother me. A lot. I keep getting… troubles down there. It's happened a few times now. I don't really… remember exactly when it started, but it’s not nice.
DOCTOR: Alright, “troubles down there,” you said. And it’s been happening a few times now. I understand remembering the exact timing can be difficult. Could you tell me a little more about what you mean by “troubles”?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… a burning feeling. When I go to the bathroom. And… and I have to go often. Even when I don't feel like I really need to. It’s quite… disruptive. I mostly just try to ignore it, but it keeps coming back. Is that… helpful? I don’t know what else to say, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. A burning sensation when you urinate, and frequent urination even when you don’t feel the urge. Okay. Has there been any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I… I don’t think so. Maybe once? A long time ago? It’s hard to say. I don’t… pay very close attention, if I'm honest. It was just… a little pinkish, I think. But I really can’t be sure. It could have been something else. I forget easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible pinkish discoloration in the past. And you said it’s been happening on and off. Is it constant right now, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's... mostly gone right now. But it will come back. Usually when I'm… busy. Or stressed. It's hard to explain. It’s been like that for… well, I don’t know how long. A long time. It’s just… annoying. I just want it to stop, really. I haven't been sleeping well either, getting up to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, triggered by stress or being busy, and it’s been causing you to wake up at night to urinate. We’ll definitely want to investigate this further. Now, have you noticed any pain in your lower abdomen, or in your back?
PATIENT: Pain? Not… really. A little ache sometimes, but nothing… terrible. It’s just a general… discomfort. Like I’m a bit… sore. Hard to say where, exactly. It could just be my age, you know? I do a lot of… puttering around in the yard. I don’t think it’s anything serious. But it's good you asked. I just want to be done with this visit now. Is there a test or something?
DOCTOR: Alright, a general ache, possibly related to activity. We'll do some tests, yes. I’d like to start with a urine sample to check for an infection. And I’ll also do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a test? Yes, alright. A urine sample. Fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… a physical exam? I suppose. Just… be gentle, please. I’m… not as sturdy as I used to be. I hope this isn't going to be a long process.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s get that urine sample. I’ll have you go into the bathroom, and I’ll give you a cup and some instructions. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a bit in the cup, and finish. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Mid-stream…? Oh dear. I… I think I understand. Start, then… collect. Is there a lid on the cup? And… where is the bathroom? I seem to be a bit… turned around. Perhaps you could show me? I don’t want to make a mess. I really don’t.
DOCTOR: Of course. Yes, there’s a lid on the cup. And I’m happy to show you. It’s just down the hall here, first door on the right. I’ll wait just outside, and you can call me when you’re finished. Don’t worry about making a mess, we have everything you need. Just take your time.
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I appreciate it. I’ll… I’ll try not to be too long. I hope this isn’t too much trouble. I never did like doctors, if I’m honest. But this… this is bothering me enough to come. .
