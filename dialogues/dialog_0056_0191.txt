DOCTOR: Hi Tierney, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I requested to be tested for HIV. It’s… a personal matter, and I’d like to know my status.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tierney. That’s perfectly alright, and a very responsible thing to do. We can absolutely get that done for you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you're wanting to get tested now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my husband and I… we haven’t been as careful as we should be, recently. And I just want to have peace of mind, you understand? It’s been some time, and I’d rather know one way or the other. It’s for both of our sakes, really. It’s just a precaution, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That’s a very good reason, and it’s always best to be proactive about your health. Before we proceed with the test, I’m going to ask a few questions, just to get a clearer picture and ensure we’re doing everything correctly. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, ask away. I will answer as honestly as I can.
DOCTOR: Great. Let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other sexually transmitted infections – STIs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I’ve always been quite careful, truthfully. This is… a bit different, as I said. I haven't had any issues like that in the past. My husband either, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you ever had a blood transfusion, or shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never. I’ve never needed a transfusion, and I certainly wouldn’t share needles with anyone! I find that a rather… unsettling question, Doctor. But I understand you must ask.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that felt unsettling, Tierney. It's just standard procedure, covering all bases. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, or over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, Doctor. Nothing else. And occasionally, I take paracetamol for a headache, if needed. But nothing regularly. My husband takes medication for his blood pressure, but that is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I am aware of. I eat quite a varied diet, and I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I've been quite fortunate in that regard. Though, I dislike shellfish intensely, but that's a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, just to clarify a bit about your recent change in practice with your husband… roughly how long has it been since you started being less consistent with protection?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it’s been approximately six months, Doctor. Perhaps a little longer. We… we simply became comfortable, you see? A foolish mistake, perhaps. It’s been a rather stressful time with my sister being ill, and… well, things just slipped. I realise it wasn’t sensible.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months. That gives us a good timeframe. And just to be clear, when you say "less consistent," does that mean you haven't used any protection at all during that time, or just sometimes?
PATIENT: Sometimes, Doctor. We haven’t always gone without, but… more often than not, we haven’t used anything. It was… spontaneous, mostly. We didn't plan things, if you understand. I feel terribly silly admitting this now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to feel silly, Tierney, it’s important to be honest so we can get you the best care. Now, I’m going to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a quick look at your general health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement completely. I just want to get this sorted out, one way or another.
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart and lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so, and could be related to stress. I’m going to take a quick blood sample now for the HIV test. It’s a standard blood draw, nothing to worry about. Do you have any history of fainting or feeling lightheaded during blood draws?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I’ve always been quite alright with needles, thankfully. I've given blood several times in my youth, and never had an issue. Please, don’t worry about me. I am rather stoic, you see.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s reassuring. Okay, this might sting for a moment. Alright, all done. I’ll send this sample to the lab, and the results should be back in about a week. It's standard turnaround time. In the meantime, it’s important to practice safe sex. Is that something you and your husband can commit to?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. We will. We’ve already spoken about it, and we are both committed to using protection until we have the results. It was… foolish of us to be so careless, and we are taking full responsibility. Thank you for reminding us, and for your professionalism. It's a relief to have it addressed, even though we await the results.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s excellent to hear. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d also like to discuss your slightly elevated blood pressure. We can monitor it over the next few weeks and see if it comes down with stress management or lifestyle changes. We can also consider medication if necessary, but let's see how it goes first. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Tierney?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at the moment. You’ve been very thorough and have answered all of my concerns. I suppose… just a question about the test itself. Is it a completely accurate test, or is there a chance of a false negative? I understand these things aren’t always foolproof.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. No test is completely foolproof, you're right to ask. The test we’re using is highly accurate, but there is a small window period after infection where the test may not detect the virus yet. That’s why it’s important to practice safe sex even after a negative result, especially if you've had recent exposure. We typically recommend a repeat test in three months to confirm the results, just to be certain. If you have any symptoms of HIV infection – fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat – during that time, please contact us immediately. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, it does. A three-month repeat test is sensible, and I understand about the window period. I will be sure to contact you if I experience any of those symptoms. It is reassuring to know you are taking all the necessary precautions. Thank you again for your time, and your patience. I feel much calmer knowing we have a plan in place.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tierney. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have the lab results sent to my office, and my staff will contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. I think that’s everything for today. Take care of yourself, and remember to practice safe sex.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Amussen. You too. Goodbye.
