DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. My name is Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s nice to meet you as well. I’ve been feeling rather… off, lately. Mostly just excessively thirsty and hungry, all the time. It’s quite bothersome, to be frank. I’d like to get it checked out, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, I don’t mind at all. Excessive thirst and hunger can be caused by a number of things, so it’s good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It began… oh, around late June, I’d say. Perhaps the beginning of July. It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual increase. I just kept feeling… like I hadn’t had enough to drink, even after a good amount, and then needing to eat shortly after a meal. It’s… difficult to explain precisely.
DOCTOR: I understand. Gradual onset is helpful to know. And is this thirst and hunger constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… fairly constant, yes. Though, I suppose it’s slightly worse in the evenings. After work, I find myself drinking a great deal more water and… well, snacking. It’s not a craving, exactly. Just… a need. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Constant symptoms with some evening worsening gives me a bit more to work with. Have you noticed any changes in your bathroom habits – more frequent urination, perhaps, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it… I have been going to the toilet rather more often. Especially at night, which is… disruptive. And… yes. My vision has been a bit blurry around the edges, I think. I put it down to needing new glasses, to be honest. It’s not terribly noticeable, but… it’s there. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information, Christen. Increased urination and blurry vision alongside the thirst and hunger are definitely things we need to investigate further. Let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, if a bit prone to catching a cold now and then. I had a bout of the flu last winter, but nothing serious. My doctor back home – in Scotland – always said my blood pressure was good. And I don’t believe anyone has ever mentioned diabetes to me. Divorced, you see, and my ex-wife usually handled all the… appointments and such. I apologize, I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Christen. We can figure it out together. No need to apologize. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single one. I broke my arm when I was a lad – fell out of a tree, attempting to retrieve a football – but that was just a cast and a sling. Nothing… major. I’ve always been quite lucky, health-wise. Until now, it seems.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had some issues with her joints, arthritis I believe. And my father… he had a heart condition, later in life. Nothing… communicable, as far as I know. He passed away a few years ago. I wouldn't say there's a strong history of… anything particularly relevant, honestly. Just the usual aches and pains that come with age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t had a reaction to any medication in the past. I took some painkillers after the football incident, of course, but nothing untoward happened. I am, however, rather averse to shellfish. Not an allergy, just… a strong dislike. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That doesn’t count as an allergy, no. Just a preference. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I generally try to avoid taking anything if I can. A bit of paracetamol if I have a headache, perhaps, but that’s it. I believe in letting the body heal itself, if possible. My ex-wife was the one who always kept a well-stocked medicine cabinet, but… well, I don't.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never been a smoker. My father was a heavy smoker, unfortunately, and I saw the effects it had on him. Put me off it for life, it did. I do enjoy a pint or two of beer on occasion, but nothing excessive. Perhaps a couple on a Friday or Saturday evening. Socially, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Not as much as I should, I suppose. My work involves a fair amount of lifting and carrying, which keeps me moving, but I don’t… exercise, per se. I used to play football when I was younger, but that was… some time ago. I enjoy a long walk on occasion, but it’s hardly a regular occurrence. The weather here doesn’t always cooperate, either.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, Christen, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a basic neurological exam, and check your feet. Just to get a better picture of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to do a thorough examination. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement. I just want to get to the bottom of this, if you don't mind. I'm rather eager to be finished with this, to be honest, but I understand it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Christen. 148 over 92. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear, but your pulse is a bit fast. 96 beats per minute. And now I’m going to check your reflexes and do a quick foot exam. Your reflexes are normal and sensation is intact. I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles, and your skin feels a little dry. Based on your symptoms and the preliminary exam findings – the elevated blood pressure, rapid pulse, increased thirst and urination, blurry vision, ankle swelling, and dry skin – I’m concerned about the possibility of diabetes, but other conditions could be causing these symptoms as well. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a fasting blood glucose level, a complete metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests seem a logical next step. I'm happy to proceed with those. Fasting blood glucose, you said? I presume that means I shouldn't have anything to eat or drink beforehand? And a complete metabolic panel and lipid panel as well. The more information, the better, I suppose. When can I expect to have these done? And… how long will it take to get the results? I rather dislike being kept in suspense, if you don't mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: I understand your dislike of being kept in suspense, Christen. We’ll get these results back as quickly as possible. Yes, a fasting blood glucose means no food or drink – except water – for at least eight hours before the test. The lab technician will explain the details when you go in. The complete metabolic panel will give us information about your kidney and liver function, as well as electrolytes, and the lipid panel will check your cholesterol levels. I'll send the order to the lab now. They’re just down the hall. You can go anytime today. It usually takes 24-48 hours for the results to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as excessive fatigue, unexplained weight loss, or changes in your vision – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before you go to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. Eight hours fasting, complete metabolic panel, lipid panel… I think I have it all. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness. I’ll head down to the lab now, then. I’ll look forward to hearing from you within the next couple of days. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. Thank you again, Doctor Bacy.
