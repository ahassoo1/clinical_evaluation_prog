DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Yeah, well, I'm trying out for a team. Need to get a check-up, you know? Make sure I'm not falling apart before I start, ha. Don't want to waste anyone's time.
DOCTOR: That’s very responsible of you, Lamark. It’s always best to be proactive. And congratulations on trying out for the team! To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little more about the team you're trying out for and what kind of physical activity is involved?
PATIENT: Thanks. It's… a sort of semi-pro wrestling thing. Local mostly. Lots of… throwing around, you know? Lifting, falling… the usual. Not like the big leagues, thankfully. My joints wouldn't survive that. It's mostly for fun, keeps me moving. I haven’t done anything serious in a while though, so figured I should get checked out first.
DOCTOR: That sounds… quite active! Good on you for wanting to get a check-up beforehand – that’s very smart. Okay, so lifting, throwing, and falling… that gives me a good starting point. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort anywhere in your body recently – perhaps in your joints, muscles, or back – that might be related to preparing for this, or even just in general?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. My back gets a little stiff sometimes, you know, getting old. But nothing I can't work out with a bit of stretching. Knees are okay, shoulders… sometimes a little achey, but again, old age. Honestly, I'm probably more worried about pulling a muscle than anything serious. I haven't been this active in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, stiffness in the back, occasional shoulder aches… that’s good to know. And it’s understandable to be concerned about pulling a muscle after being less active. Let's get a little more detail on those aches. When you say "sometimes achey" in your shoulders, can you describe where exactly the ache is located?
PATIENT: It's… hard to say exactly. More like… around the top of the shoulder, kinda where your neck meets your shoulder. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Happens more when I try to lift something heavy, or reach for something high. It usually goes away after a bit of movement. Honestly, it's probably just me being out of shape. I don't want to take up your time with old man complaints.
DOCTOR: No, please, don't worry about "taking up my time." It's my job to listen and understand what's going on. And pinpointing the location of discomfort is important, even if it seems minor. So, the ache is primarily at the top of your shoulder, where your neck meets your shoulder, and it's aggravated by lifting or reaching. Does it radiate anywhere – meaning does the pain spread to other areas like your arm or neck?
PATIENT: Hm… sometimes a little bit down my arm, yeah. Not all the way to my fingers, just… the upper part of my arm. It's not bad, really. Like a mild tingling, more than a pain. I usually just ignore it. I probably just slept on it wrong. Look, I’m not trying to be difficult, but is this really necessary for a wrestling tryout? I just need a quick check, make sure I'm not about to collapse.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about keeping this efficient, Lamark. And you're right, we want to be practical. The tingling down your arm does give me a little more information, and it's good you mentioned it. It could be related to a few different things, and it's important to rule out anything serious before you start a physically demanding activity. To get a better picture, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll check your range of motion, strength, and reflexes in your shoulders and arms, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just… try to be quick, okay? I have things to do. And don't make me do anything too strenuous. I'm trying to avoid pulling something, remember?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll keep it as quick and gentle as possible. If you could just sit here, and I’ll start with your shoulder. I’ll ask you to move your arm in a few different directions – just tell me if anything feels particularly painful or uncomfortable. First, can you lift your arm straight out to the side?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's… okay. A little stiff, but nothing major. Feels a bit… tight, I guess. It's not a sharp pain, just… resistance. Like something's a little stuck. Is that what you want to hear? I'm really not good at describing this stuff.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Lamark. “Tight” and “resistance” are good descriptions. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, that's a little sore. Not terrible, but… yeah, right there. Feels kinda… bruised, almost, but I don't remember hitting it or anything. It's probably just old age again. Seriously, I'm starting to feel like a broken down machine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And it’s perfectly normal to have some discomfort with age, but we want to make sure it's not something more serious. How about rotation?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's a little stiff too. Not painful, just… limited. I can't get it to go as far as it used to, I guess. It feels… tight in the back of my shoulder when I do that. Honestly, it's probably just lack of use. I haven’t done anything like this in years. You're making me feel really old, you know?
DOCTOR: I'm not trying to make you feel old, Lamark, I assure you! I’m just gathering information. Your heart and lungs sound clear, which is good. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you bend your elbow?
PATIENT: Yeah, no problem. I can do that. Everything's working, last I checked. Though, I might need oiling soon. Just kidding. Sort of. Is this all you need to know? Can I go now? I really should be getting back to… well, doing old man things.
DOCTOR: Almost finished. Just a quick check of your reflexes. And that's good. And one more. Good on both sides. Okay, Lamark, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you have some mild rotator cuff impingement and possible tendinitis in your shoulder. The limited range of motion, tightness, and discomfort with lifting and rotation are consistent with that. It's not severe, but it's something we should address before you start this wrestling training. The fact that your reflexes are normal and your heart and lungs sound clear is reassuring.
PATIENT: Rotator cuff… tendinitis… sounds fancy. So, what does that mean? Am I broken? And what do I need to do about it? I don’t want to get seriously injured, but I also don’t want to sit around doing nothing. Is this going to stop me from trying out? I really just want a straight answer, Doctor. No medical jargon, please.
DOCTOR: No, you're not broken, Lamark! It simply means the tendons around your shoulder joint are a bit irritated and inflamed. Think of them like ropes that get a little frayed with use, especially if they haven't been used much recently. That's why you're feeling the tightness and discomfort. It's very common, especially as we get older. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to stop trying out, but we need to be careful. I recommend a course of physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your shoulder and improve your range of motion. Also, some anti-inflammatory medication, like ibuprofen, can help reduce the pain and swelling. I'm going to write you a prescription for the ibuprofen. And I'll give you a referral to a physical therapist I trust. They can develop a personalized exercise program for you. It's important to listen to your body, and don't push yourself too hard, especially in the beginning. Starting slowly and gradually increasing your activity level is key. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that makes a little more sense. Frayed ropes… I can picture that. So, pills and exercises. Not the end of the world, I guess. I can handle that. What kind of exercises are we talking about? Am I going to be doing push-ups and stuff? I haven't done a push-up since… well, a long time. And how long do I need to take the pills for? I don’t really like taking medication if I can avoid it. And finally… is this going to affect my wrestling? Will I be able to actually wrestle if I do all this? I need a straight answer, Doctor. Don’t sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: Good questions, Lamark. I appreciate you being so direct. The physical therapist will assess your specific needs and develop a program tailored to you. It will likely start with gentle range-of-motion exercises and gradually progress to strengthening exercises. It might include some modified push-ups, but they can be adjusted to your level. They'll focus on exercises that strengthen the muscles around your shoulder without putting too much stress on the joint. As for the pills, I’ll prescribe ibuprofen for two weeks to start. You can take it as needed for pain and inflammation, but don't exceed the recommended dosage. After two weeks, we can reassess whether you still need it. The goal is to get you off the medication as soon as possible. Now, about the wrestling… this could affect your ability to wrestle initially. You’ll need to take it slow and listen to your body. Pushing yourself too hard too soon could worsen the inflammation and delay your recovery. The physical therapist can advise you on when it's safe to gradually return to more strenuous activity. It’s possible you’ll need to modify your technique or avoid certain moves, at least initially, to protect your shoulder. But with proper treatment and rehabilitation, I’m optimistic that you’ll be able to wrestle again. I want to be realistic - there’s always a risk of re-injury, especially with a physically demanding activity like wrestling. But with a careful approach, you can minimize that risk. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… okay. Realistic is good. I don’t want false promises. So, pills for two weeks, physical therapy… and listen to my body. Got it. Can I get those prescriptions now? I need to get going. I have things to do, you know? Old man things. And can you write down the name of that physical therapist? I’m terrible with names. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate your honesty. And your patience. I'm not the easiest patient, I guess.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lamark. And you're right, you're not the easiest patient, but I appreciate your directness. It helps me to understand your concerns better. Here's the prescription for the ibuprofen. It's good for 30 tablets, take as needed. And here’s a referral to Sarah Chen, she's an excellent physical therapist. I’ve written her contact information and address here. Please, don't hesitate to contact me or Sarah if you have any questions or concerns. I want to see you get back to doing what you enjoy. Take care, Lamark. And be careful out there! .
