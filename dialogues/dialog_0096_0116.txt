DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Bilstein, welcome. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, my legs. They bother me at night. Cramp up, they do. It’s been going on for… a little while now. I can’t rightly say how long, exactly. Just… nights. It wakes me up.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Leg cramps, you say. And it’s been happening for a "little while," alright. That doesn't give me much to work with, does it?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. My memory… it isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. My husband, bless his soul, he always remembered things. Dates and such. I just know it's been troublesome enough to finally come in. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a tightening. A really strong squeeze. And it's both legs, usually. Though sometimes just one.
DOCTOR: Right. Both legs, sometimes one. A tightening, a squeeze… not sharp. Okay. Do you find anything helps when they happen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I try to stretch them out. Wiggle my toes. And… sometimes I just have to wait it out. It eventually goes away, but it’s… unsettling. My daughter, she suggested I mention it to a doctor. Said I shouldn’t just suffer through it. She’s a good girl, that one.
DOCTOR: Stretching, wiggling toes… waiting it out. Alright. Now, have you noticed if anything triggers these cramps?
PATIENT: Triggers? Oh dear. That’s a good question. I… I honestly can't say. I walk a little each day, down to the store and back. I try to, anyway. And I drink plenty of water, I think. Nothing particular stands out. Maybe… if I’m on my feet a lot during the day, it’s worse that night? But I’m not certain. It all feels… jumbled up.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Walking, plenty of water… more noticeable after a day on your feet. Okay. Now, let’s talk about other things. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Just a little something for my arthritis now and again when it flares up. Nothing every day. Just when it's bothering me. It’s… a white pill, I think? My daughter fills it for me, so I don't always pay attention to the name. She knows what I need. I don't like taking too many things if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional something for arthritis. We'll need to get the name of that medication eventually. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, allergies. I don't think so. Nothing I’ve ever been aware of. I used to help my mother with her garden, and I never had a reaction to anything. She grew all sorts of flowers. Though… I always got a bit of a rash from poison ivy, if I brushed against it. But that wasn’t an allergy, really, was it? Just… a rash. I can’t recall ever being sick from a medicine.
DOCTOR: Right. No known medication allergies, just a rash from poison ivy. Good to know. Now, have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. A long, long time ago. And… I had a bit of a problem with my heart, they said, a while back. But it’s been alright for years now. Doctor kept me on a little pill for a bit, but I don't take it anymore. He said it was under control. Everything felt alright after that. I don’t remember many details, honestly. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removed… a heart problem previously… Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family. My mother lived to be ninety-two, a strong woman she was. My father… he passed when I was quite young. I had a brother, but he’s gone now too. He had… trouble with his legs, I believe. Something with swelling. And my daughter, bless her, she's healthy as a horse. She worries about me though, always has. I don’t recall any specific illnesses in the family besides that. It was a long time ago, you see. Things get… muddled.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Bilstein. We've covered a fair bit. Now, before we do a quick examination of your legs, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother didn't approve. And alcohol… well, I might have had a sip of sherry at Christmas with my husband. But nothing regular, goodness no. I always preferred a nice cup of tea. A calming cup of tea. That’s always been my preference.
DOCTOR: Right. No smoking, very little alcohol. Good. Now, let’s take a look at your legs. Can you just lift this sheet for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. There they are. Not much to look at, I'm afraid. Just old legs. Be gentle now, they ache a bit even when I'm resting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Bilstein. I’m just feeling around. Your pulses feel… a little weak, but not alarmingly so. Calves don’t seem particularly tender. Any areas feel worse than others when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh… that spot. Yes, that one feels a little… tighter. Not painful, exactly, just… a little uncomfortable. The rest feels alright, I suppose. It's hard to say, they ache all over sometimes. Like a dull throb, you see. It’s not sharp or anything, just… there.
DOCTOR: Right. Slight tenderness in the lower right calf. And you say a dull throb overall. Alright. Now, just one final thing before I formulate a plan. Do you notice any redness or swelling in your legs, particularly at night?
PATIENT: Oh… sometimes. I do get a little swelling in my ankles, especially if I've been on my feet all day. It goes down when I put my feet up. And… I think my legs are a little red sometimes, but it's hard to tell. I have… thin skin, you see. Everything looks a bit red. It’s hard to say for sure. It's hard to notice things these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Bilstein. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief examination, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of peripheral artery disease, coupled with some venous insufficiency. The weak pulses, the tenderness in your calf, the swelling, the redness… it all points in that direction. It’s not a definitive diagnosis at this stage, mind you. We need to do some further testing to confirm. I’m going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your legs to assess the blood flow. And I’d also like to check your ankle-brachial index—that just involves comparing the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Ultrasound and… index? I don't know… Will it hurt? I don't like needles, Doctor. And I don’t understand all those terms. What does it mean if it’s… disease? Is it serious? It's just… a lot to take in. I just wanted something for my legs to stop cramping at night.
DOCTOR: Now, Mrs. Bilstein, it’s alright to be concerned. It sounds complicated, but the tests themselves aren’t painful. The ultrasound just uses sound waves—it’s like getting a picture of your legs. And the ankle-brachial index does involve a blood pressure cuff, but it’s no different than what we use in the office, just on your ankles. As for what it means… peripheral artery disease is basically a narrowing of the arteries in your legs, which can reduce blood flow. It's common as we get older. If left untreated, it can lead to more serious problems, but we're catching it early, and there are things we can do to manage it. Medication, lifestyle changes, those sorts of things. And it doesn’t necessarily mean you'll need anything drastic done. Right now, we're just gathering information. Let's get these tests done, and then we can talk about the results and a plan. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Oh… that does sound a little better, Doctor. If it's not too painful, and it's just getting information… alright. I suppose I can have the tests. When can I schedule them? And… will my daughter need to come with me? She worries so. I don’t want to fuss her. But I might need someone to explain everything to me. It all sounds so… technical.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Bilstein. We can get you scheduled for the Doppler ultrasound and ankle-brachial index at the imaging center across the street tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. It shouldn't take more than an hour or so. As for your daughter, it's perfectly fine if she comes with you. In fact, I encourage it, if it makes you feel more comfortable. She can certainly help with any questions you might have. I'll also make sure to have the results sent to my office, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment next week to discuss them in detail. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Tomorrow at nine… and my daughter can come with me. That will be a comfort. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel… a little less anxious now. Is there anything I should do before the tests tomorrow? Anything I need to wear? I don’t want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Bilstein. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. As for preparation, just wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing. Ideally, something you can easily roll up above your knees and ankles. And please, don’t worry about messing anything up! Just come as you are, and we'll take it from there. I’m going to write up a referral for the imaging center, and a little summary of your medical history for them. And I’ll also give you a list of some things to avoid before the tests – like caffeine, and anything that could constrict your blood vessels. Nothing major, just a few simple precautions. Here you go. This has all the details. Do you have any questions about any of this before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. This is very helpful. Hmm… "avoid caffeine…" alright, I can manage that. I mostly drink tea anyway. And… "loose-fitting clothing…" yes, I have plenty of that. No, I don't think I have any other questions at the moment. You've explained everything so thoroughly. I'm still a little worried, of course, but I feel much better knowing what to expect. Thank you again, Doctor Burlingham. You've been very kind. I think… I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Bilstein. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions at all before your appointment tomorrow. And remember, we're just gathering information right now. Let's see what the tests tell us, and then we'll take it from there. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and I'll see you tomorrow.
