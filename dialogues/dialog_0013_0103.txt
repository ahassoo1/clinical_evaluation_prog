DOCTOR: Hi Albino, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Well, my back... it hurts. Lower back, mostly. It's been bothering me for a while now, and my daughter, she said I should come see someone. She worries a lot, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain. I understand. And it’s good of your daughter to encourage you to get it checked out. “A while now” is pretty vague though – could you tell me roughly how long it’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? No, more like eight, I think. It comes and goes, you know? Some days it’s just a little ache, other days… well, other days it’s hard to even stand up straight. I can't be sure, my memory isn't always the best for dates, but it's been a good while. Longer than half a year, for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, eight months or so, coming and going. And when it is bad, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It’s not… a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache. Like… like someone is squeezing my back, tight, tight. And sometimes it goes down my legs a little, not all the way to my feet, just the upper part. Makes it hard to bend over, that's for sure. And sitting for too long… oh, that makes it worse. Really worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, dull ache with squeezing sensation, radiating to the upper legs, worsened by sitting. Okay. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Well, laying down helps. Especially on my side, with a pillow between my knees. That feels good. And walking a little bit, not too much, but a little walk around the house... that seems to loosen it up some. Not a cure, mind you, just… a little better. And hot water. A hot shower, or a hot pad on my back… that helps for a little while.
DOCTOR: Okay, laying on your side with a pillow, gentle walking, and heat provide some relief. Good to know. Now, has anything specific happened that you can think of that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Hmm... That’s a good question. I don't recall anything specific. I’ve always been careful, you know? I used to work with heavy things, building things, years ago, but that was a long time ago. Maybe it’s just old age catching up with me? My daughter, she says I shouldn't say things like that! But I'm 77, Doctor. Things break down, right? No falls, no accidents, just… started hurting.
DOCTOR: That’s fair, and it's good you haven’t had any recent injuries. It could be related to previous work, or just age-related changes, and it's good you're being proactive about it. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Do you have any other medical problems that you know of?
PATIENT: Well… my blood pressure is a little high, the doctor told me years ago. I don't take any pills for it, though. He said to watch my salt intake, and I try to. Mostly. And I have a little trouble with my bones, the doctor said they aren’t as strong as they should be. He said something about… osteoporosis? That’s the word, I think. But I don't do anything special for that either, just try not to fall, you know? I don’t have any other problems that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with diet, and a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Thanks for letting me know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see... yes, actually. Years ago, when I was younger, I had my appendix taken out. And… oh, and I had a hernia operation, I think it was maybe 20 years ago? That’s about it, I think. Nothing else. They didn't have fancy things back then like they do now! It was all… quicker, I think. Not as much fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and hernia repair. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have similar problems with their back or bones?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother, she always complained about her back, especially when she got older. She had a lot of trouble bending over. And my sister, she had a bad fall a few years ago and broke her hip. The doctor said something about her bones being weak too, like me. My son is fine, I think. He’s very active, always running around. My daughter… she worries a lot, but she seems healthy enough. But yes, my mother and sister, they both had trouble with their bones and backs.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of back problems and osteoporosis. And are you currently taking any medications, besides what you mentioned not taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t take anything regularly. Just sometimes, if I have a headache, I'll take an aspirin. But that’s it. I try to stay away from pills if I can. They never seem to do much good, and they always have side effects, you know? I prefer a good cup of tea when I'm feeling under the weather.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I've been lucky that way, I suppose. Sometimes a little sniffle in the spring, but that's just the pollen, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well... I live alone, in a small apartment. I mostly keep to myself, you know? I like to watch the news, and read the paper. I try to walk a little bit every day, around the block. I used to go to church more, but it’s been hard lately. I don't smoke, never have. And I only drink a little bit of wine with dinner, maybe a glass or two. I like to cook for myself, mostly Lebanese food, that’s what I grew up with. It's a pretty quiet life, Doctor. Not much excitement!
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, quiet lifestyle, some walking, no smoking, light alcohol use, Lebanese diet. Thanks for sharing that. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on with your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead. I’ll try to be still. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Great. Alright, if you could just lie down on your back on the examination table for me, that would be perfect. I'm going to start by just feeling along your spine to see if there’s any tenderness. Then I'll check your range of motion, see how well you can bend and twist. And finally, I’ll do a few simple neurological tests to make sure there's no nerve compression. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Sounds good. Be gentle, please. My back is a little sensitive today.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just feeling along your spine now. Let me know if anything is particularly painful. Okay, I'm noticing some tenderness right here, in your lower back. On both sides, actually. Now, if you could just gently bend forward at the waist, as far as comfortable. Don’t push yourself. Alright, thank you. Now, could you try to bend backwards, gently?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little sore. It's hard to get very far. And that's even harder! It feels like something is… stuck. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, like I told you. It's just… limited. I can't bend very far in either direction. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It sounds like you have limited range of motion, and some tenderness. That’s consistent with what we've discussed. Now, I’m going to do a couple of simple neurological tests. I’m just going to check your reflexes, and see if you can feel light touch on your legs. This will help me rule out any nerve compression. I’m going to gently tap on your knees with this little hammer, and then use this cotton ball to check your sensation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m checking your reflexes now. Your reflexes are a little bit slower than I would expect, but they are still present. Now, can you tell me if you can feel this light touch?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can feel that. And that… yes, I can feel that too. It's a little… faint, maybe? But I can feel it. Both legs feel the same, I think. No numbness or tingling, just… a little bit less feeling than usual. Not bad, but not as strong as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Sensation is intact, though slightly diminished. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you have lower back pain likely related to age-related degenerative changes, possibly with some muscle strain. The diminished reflexes and sensation could be contributing factors, but it doesn't sound like there's any acute nerve compression. It's good that you haven't had any recent injuries, and that you have full sensation in both legs. Now, I’d like to order some X-rays of your lower back, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on with your bones. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: X-rays, eh? I don't like radiation, Doctor. Is it safe? I’ve heard things about those machines. But… if you think it's necessary, then yes. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what's wrong with my back, and what I can do about it. So, yes, order the X-rays. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about radiation exposure. The amount of radiation from an X-ray is very low, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks in this case. We’ll take all necessary precautions to minimize your exposure. The technician will explain everything before they start. Okay, I’m ordering the X-rays now. You’ll need to go to the radiology department, which is just down the hall. They'll likely ask you to change into a gown, and then they'll take a few images of your lower back. It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes. Once the radiologist reviews the images, we’ll get the results back, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take things easy, avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity, and continue with the things that provide you relief – laying on your side with a pillow, gentle walking, and heat. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Easy, walking, heat… I can do that. And I'll go down to radiology after this. Is there anything I need to bring with me? My insurance card? Or anything else? I don't want to forget something. And… will you call me when the results are back? My number is 555-1212.
DOCTOR: Yes, please bring your insurance card, and your photo ID if you have it. And don’t worry, I will definitely call you as soon as the results are back. I have your number here – 555-1212 – and I'll make a note in your chart to contact you as soon as possible. It usually takes a day or two for the results to come back, but I’ll call you as soon as I have them. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's everything. Thank you for your time, and for listening to me. I feel much better just knowing what might be wrong, and having a plan. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I’ll go find that radiology department. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Albino. I'm glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before I call you with the results. The radiology department is just down the hall to your left. Take your time, and be careful. It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: .
