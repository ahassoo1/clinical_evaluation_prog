DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um... my joints, mostly. They feel… stiff, you know? Especially in the mornings. It's been going on for a bit now, I think. Hard to say how long, exactly. Things just... blur sometimes.
DOCTOR: “A bit now…” Right. Well, we’ll try to be more specific. Stiffness in the mornings… Can you tell me which joints are affected?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… my hands, definitely. And my knees, I think. Maybe my… hips? It's hard to say for sure. They all kinda ache together, it feels like. Not a sharp pain, just… heavy and slow to move. Like an old, rusty gate, maybe? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, vaguely. “Heavy and slow.” And is this stiffness consistent, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it's mostly mornings, like I said. It gets a little better as the day goes on. I do a bit of… well, I used to do more gardening, but it’s hard now with the aching. So, it’s not all the time, just… the start of the day is the worst. Then it's just a dull ache, if I move around too much, maybe. I don’t really push myself, though.
DOCTOR: Gardening… Right. And how long does this morning stiffness typically last?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… an hour? Sometimes longer. It’s hard to say for certain, really. I usually just get up and try to move, slowly. It doesn't go away completely, it just… lessens. It’s just annoying, you know? Makes getting the day started a bit of a chore. I used to be much more… sprightly.
DOCTOR: "Sprightly." Right. Well, let's try to get a better picture. Have you noticed any swelling in these joints, along with the stiffness and aching?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Oh, goodness. I… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My hands sometimes look a little… puffy, maybe, but I just thought that was… age. Or maybe too much salt? I don't really pay attention, to be honest. I just know they hurt to move, especially in the mornings. I’m not very good at noticing things like swelling, I guess. Does that make sense? I’m sorry I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: It's… acceptable. And has this affected your ability to perform daily tasks?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. It's… harder to do things. Like, opening jars is a real struggle. And getting dressed, buttoning things… things like that. I used to help the kids with their coats, you know? But now… it’s just easier to let them do it themselves. I don’t want to drop things, either. Everything feels so… slippery. I try not to complain, though. It’s just… things aren't as easy as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s move on to some other questions, then. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Not that I know of. My husband… he was the one who took care of all the doctor’s things. He passed away a few years back, you see. And I… well, I haven’t really seen a doctor much since then. I used to have… high blood pressure, maybe? He told me once. But I don’t take anything for it. Honestly, I can’t even remember if I still have it. Everything is just a bit… hazy these days. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: “Hazy.” Okay. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That's… all I can really remember. And… maybe a cataract surgery in one eye, a few years back? My husband arranged it. Honestly, everything feels like a long, blurry dream these days. I just can’t keep track of things, you know? It's not that I'm trying to be difficult, I just… forget things easily. I apologize. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. My mother… she had arthritis, I think. In her hands. Terrible pain, she always said. And my father… he had heart trouble. He passed away when I was quite young. I don't really know much beyond that, to be honest. We weren't a very… close family. I mostly just remember my mother complaining about her hands. Does that help? I'm so sorry, I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: It’s… noted. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. I don’t think so. I haven't really taken many medications, you see. Just… over-the-counter things, like pain relievers. But I don’t recall ever having a bad reaction to anything. I might have been allergic to penicillin as a child? My mother said something about that once, but I can’t be sure. It was a long time ago. I apologize again, I’m really not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh, um… just ibuprofen, sometimes. When my hands are really bothering me. And… sometimes a little something for my stomach. It's just… an antacid. When I eat something rich, you see. Nothing regularly, though. Just when I need it. I really try not to take much, if I can help it. Is that alright? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your joints, range of motion, and look for any swelling or tenderness. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels particularly painful.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… fine. Just let me know if I need to do anything special? I'm not very good at these things, you see. And… please be gentle? I don't want to fall. I apologize for being such a worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your hands. Please keep your arms still. Okay… I’m noticing some mild tenderness upon palpation of the MCP and PIP joints bilaterally. No visible swelling at this time, but there is a slight crepitus with range of motion. And how would you rate the pain on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, when I apply this pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, um… One to ten, you say? Hmm… it’s not terrible. Maybe a… four? On a good day. Sometimes it goes up to a six, if I've been using my hands a lot. It’s not a sharp pain, you see. Just a dull ache. Like a… a wearing-down feeling. It's hard to explain. And… is crepitus bad? I don’t know what any of these words mean, I apologize. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Crepitus is a grinding sensation… not necessarily “wrong”, but something we need to investigate. Alright, let's move on to your knees. Please lie down on your back for me. I'm going to check their range of motion now. Okay… there is some limitation in full extension and flexion bilaterally. Mild tenderness with palpation of the joint line. No effusion noted. And how does that feel, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Lying down is fine. Um… it’s… stiff. Very stiff. It doesn't feel like it locks or anything, but it’s hard to bend them all the way. And… it aches a little when you push on them, you see. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like… an old, rusty hinge. I’m so sorry I’m not being very helpful. Is something seriously wrong? I apologize for being such a worry. I just… get anxious with doctors, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to take a listen to your heart and lungs now, just to get a complete picture. Please breathe deeply. Okay… Heart sounds are regular, normal S1 and S2. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Alright. Ms. Voner, based on your symptoms and my examination, it seems you are experiencing signs of osteoarthritis. Given your age and presentation, it's the most likely diagnosis. However, to confirm this, I’d like to order some blood work and X-rays of your hands and knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis? That sounds… serious. Like my mother. The hands… and the knees… Is there… something you can do about it? The blood work and X-rays… yes, yes, that's fine. If that's what you think is best. I… I just want to feel better, you see. I'm not sure what any of this means, though. Will it hurt? Will I need… surgery? I apologize for being so anxious. I just… get worried.
DOCTOR: It's alright to be anxious, Ms. Voner. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, especially as we age. It involves the breakdown of cartilage in your joints, leading to pain and stiffness. The blood work is just to rule out other conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis. And the X-rays will help us assess the extent of the cartilage damage. As for treatment, we can start with conservative measures—physical therapy, weight management if applicable, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, which you're already using. We can also discuss other options, like corticosteroid injections, if needed. Surgery is rarely the first step, and would only be considered if other treatments aren't effective. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. So, it’s not… immediately terrible? The blood work and the X-rays… and then the therapy and the pills… That sounds… manageable, I think. The physical therapy… what does that involve? Will I have to… lift heavy weights? I don’t want to fall, you see. And… if the pills don’t work, then what? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… I’m worried, and I don't understand all the medical terms.
DOCTOR: It's alright to ask questions, Ms. Voner. That's what I'm here for. Physical therapy typically involves exercises to strengthen the muscles around your joints, improve your range of motion, and reduce pain. It does not necessarily involve lifting heavy weights. We’ll tailor the program to your specific needs and abilities. We will start with gentle exercises, and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. If the pills and therapy aren't enough to manage your pain, we can consider other options—like corticosteroid injections, which can provide temporary relief by reducing inflammation in your joints. I’ll provide you with a referral to a physical therapist, and we can discuss these options in more detail at your follow-up appointment. I’ll also send the lab orders and X-ray requisition to the front desk. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That sounds… less scary than I thought. Gentle exercises… that’s good. And… the injection… just temporary? That’s alright. I’m not sure I want… long-term things, if I can help it. Yes… I think that covers it, for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I apologize for being such a worry. Now, about the blood work… will I need to fast beforehand? I apologize again. I just… forget these things easily.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Voner. Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood work. No food or drink, except water. The lab will give you specific instructions when you go in. I'm going to write a note for the front desk to remind you of this when they schedule your appointment. I believe that covers everything for today. We’ll see you at your follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a long-term plan. Do you have any difficulty with transportation to and from appointments?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you to remind me about the fasting. I'm getting a little worried I'll forget. Transportation… no, I have a friend who can take me. But thank you for asking. It's… nice to know. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Yackey. You've put my mind a little at ease. I apologize for all my questions.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Voner. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before your appointment. And please, try not to worry. We will take things one step at a time. Have a good day.
