DOCTOR: Hi Sharifa, it’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's...fine, I suppose. Honestly, it’s my legs. They just feel…weak. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a really nasty cold. Not the flu, a cold. A proper one, with the sniffles and everything. Now, I can walk, but it feels like I'm wading through mud, you know? It’s quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness in your legs that started after a cold… okay. And you said a few days ago?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Let me think… it was Tuesday, I believe. Tuesday the 29th of July. I had finished a tour group, dropped them off at the airport, and then… that evening, I noticed it. It wasn’t terrible at first, just a little bit of drag when I was walking. But it’s gotten worse each day, honestly. It's rather disruptive to my schedule, you understand. I have bookings!
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Disruptive to your schedule is definitely concerning. So, it’s been gradually worsening since Tuesday the 29th. Can you describe the weakness a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I can't move them, Doctor. That would be awful. It's just...effortful. Like I said, wading through mud. It’s in both legs, equally, which is odd. And it's more noticeable when I try to stand up from a chair, or after I’ve been sitting for a little while. It doesn't hurt, though. No pain at all. Just…heavy. And slow. It's very frustrating. Do you…understand what I mean? Some doctors just don’t listen.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Sharifa. Heavy and slow, more noticeable after sitting, and no pain – that’s helpful. It's good you can still move them, but the effort is the concerning part. Now, besides the legs, have you noticed any other symptoms since your cold?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. Well, I was terribly fatigued for a couple of days while I had the cold, naturally. But that’s gone now. No fever, no cough lingering…nothing like that. My appetite was a little off while I was sick, but that's back to normal too. I haven’t noticed anything else, honestly. Though, now that you mention it, my hands felt a bit tingly yesterday morning. Just for a few minutes. It could have been anything. I was rushing to get ready for a tour. You doctors always ask about everything! Is tingling related to this leg business? It sounds so silly now that I say it out loud.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all to mention anything you’ve noticed, Sharifa. Fatigue with the cold is expected, and the tingling is worth noting. When you say tingling, can you describe what that felt like?
PATIENT: Oh, it wasn't a proper pins and needles, you understand. More like… a slight buzzing sensation. In my fingertips, mostly. And it wasn't constant, just a fleeting little…vibration, really. It went away quickly. Perhaps it was from holding my coffee mug too tightly? I do have a rather strong grip, you know. I'm a strong woman. It's just... I don't usually pay much attention to those little things. It wasn't painful, or alarming, just...there. And then gone. Honestly, Doctor, I just want my legs to feel normal again. This is very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fleeting buzzing sensation in your fingertips that resolved quickly. So, to recap, you had a cold that resolved, followed by gradually worsening weakness in both legs that feels heavy and effortful, and a brief tingling sensation in your fingertips. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I don't really have health conditions. I’m quite robust, you see. I do have a touch of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. But I keep it under control with…well, with trying to eat sensibly. And not getting too stressed. Though it’s difficult with tourists, honestly. They are demanding! I take…something for it, but I can’t remember the name. It's a little white pill. And…I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. That was unpleasant, but it’s all sorted now. Other than that, I'm perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I've always been a strong woman. Do you need to know anything else? I find all this questioning rather…intrusive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the questions, Sharifa, and I apologize if they feel intrusive. I just need to gather all the information to understand what's going on. High blood pressure managed with medication—do you recall roughly when you were diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was… after my divorce, I believe. About fifteen years ago, perhaps? Yes, around 2010. I went to a doctor for a check-up, and he said my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on medication, and I've been taking it ever since. It's… a little white pill, as I said before. I don't really pay much attention to the details. I just take it every morning with my coffee. Do you need to know the dosage? I honestly haven't the faintest idea. It’s all a bit of a blur, frankly. My ex-husband handled all the medical things. He was always so… organized. Unlike me.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure diagnosed around 2010, managed with a white pill – we'll try to get more information about that pill later. Now, can you tell me about any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Hmm. Well, my mother had… arthritis, I believe. In her hands. She couldn’t knit anymore, which was a shame. And my father… he had heart trouble, towards the end of his life. He smoked, you see. A dreadful habit. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had diabetes. But other than that… not much, really. My family wasn't particularly prone to illness, thankfully. We were a robust bunch, mostly. I suppose I’ve inherited that trait. Do you need to know anything more specific? Honestly, I don’t remember much about my family’s medical history. They didn’t talk about these things, you see. It was considered… indelicate.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and diabetes in an aunt. And now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. I drink a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally - a lovely Chilean Merlot, usually. But that's it. And smoking? Heavens, no. My father smoked, and it killed him, as I mentioned. A dreadful habit. And recreational drugs? I am a respectable woman, Doctor. I wouldn't dream of it. I get enough excitement dealing with tourists, thank you very much! Honestly, the things they try to get me to do… Now, is that enough about my lifestyle? I find all this rather… personal.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly sufficient, Sharifa. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, if it's a bad one. But that's it. And… oh, yes! I take a multivitamin. Every morning with my coffee and my blood pressure pill. I read somewhere that it’s good for you. And… I occasionally use a topical cream for my hands, especially after a tour. They get so dry, you see. All the hand sanitizer and the guiding… But that's just a lotion, nothing serious. Do you think all these questions are going to help me get my legs better? Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed, multivitamin daily, and topical cream for your hands. Thank you for being so thorough, Sharifa. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. But please be gentle. I have a tour tomorrow, you understand. And I don't want to be in any more discomfort than I already am. I do hope you can find something to help me. This is very inconvenient, Doctor. Very inconvenient indeed. Proceed, then. But quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sharifa. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not terribly so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound good. Now, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that's…not easy. As you can see, it's rather difficult. It feels wobbly, Doctor, quite wobbly. And my legs are already feeling…more tired. Is this normal? I really do hope you find something to help me. This is just dreadful.
DOCTOR: I see. It does appear a bit unsteady. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Now, can you walk for me, please?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s like wading through mud. See? Just like I said. It’s… frustrating, and quite undignified. I’m a tour guide, you understand. I need to be able to walk confidently. This is very inconvenient, and frankly, a bit alarming. Are you sure you can help me?
DOCTOR: I see what you mean. Your strength feels a little reduced, but not significantly. Now, one last thing – can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that…strong enough? It feels… less firm than usual. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to get quite worried. I've never felt this weak before. This is very inconvenient. I have a tour tomorrow, and I need to be able to lift things, to help my clients. What do you think is wrong? Is it something serious? You must tell me, Doctor. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sharifa. Based on the exam, your strength is slightly reduced, your gait is slow and effortful, and you’re feeling weak in your legs. The tingling you mentioned, coupled with the recent cold, makes me think it could be a post-viral neuropathy. This means the virus may have affected some of the nerves in your legs. It’s often temporary, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, to be certain, I'd like to order some blood tests. We’ll check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and electrolytes. We should also consider an MRI of your spinal cord to rule out any structural issues, though that's not an emergency. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Blood tests? An MRI? Oh, goodness. This is getting more complicated by the minute. I suppose if it’s necessary… but I really do hope it doesn't take too long. I have bookings, you see. And an MRI… is that painful? Will it interfere with my tour tomorrow? Honestly, this is very inconvenient. But… if you think it’s necessary, then do what you must. But please, be quick about it. And tell me what the blood tests are for, exactly. I don't want to be poked and prodded without knowing what you're looking for.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sharifa. Let me explain. The blood tests will help us rule out vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and electrolyte imbalances – all of which can cause weakness. The MRI will give us a detailed look at your spinal cord to make sure there’s nothing pressing on the nerves. It’s usually painless – you’ll just lie on a table inside a large machine, and it will take about 30-40 minutes. We can schedule it for later this week, so it shouldn’t interfere with your immediate tour schedule. As for right now, I'm going to recommend you take it easy, avoid strenuous activity, and stay well-hydrated. We can also try some physical therapy to help strengthen your legs. And I'll give you a prescription for a multivitamin with B vitamins, just to boost your levels. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… a multivitamin… that sounds…less frightening than an MRI, I suppose. But I really do hope it works. I can't afford to be laid up. I have bills to pay, you see. And clients to entertain. And… well, I don't want to disappoint anyone. Yes, alright. Physical therapy and the vitamins. And schedule the MRI for as soon as possible, but please, not during peak tour season. What about something for the weakness itself? Is there a pill I can take to make my legs feel stronger, immediately? I need to be able to function, Doctor. This is very inconvenient, and frankly, quite stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand your need for immediate relief, Sharifa. Unfortunately, there isn’t a pill to instantly fix muscle weakness. We need to address the underlying cause, which is why the tests are important. I can prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant to help with any discomfort, but it won't make your legs significantly stronger. It's more for easing any tension. As for the MRI, I’ll have the scheduler contact you to find a time that works with your schedule. We can also discuss the possibility of a referral to a neurologist, a nerve specialist, if your symptoms don’t improve with the physical therapy and vitamins. Here's a printout of the prescription, and a referral for physical therapy. I’ll also give you some information about post-viral neuropathy, so you can understand what might be going on. Now, do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh, goodness. This is getting more complicated by the minute. Well, I suppose if it's necessary... I don't want to be one of those people who goes to doctor after doctor without getting any answers. Let me see… Is there anything I can do, besides rest and vitamins? Any special exercises I should avoid? Any foods I should eat or avoid? And… how long will it take for the vitamins to start working? I have bookings next week, and I can't afford to be weak then. Honestly, this is very inconvenient. And… will this show up on my medical records? My insurance company? I don't want my premiums to go up because of this. This is very stressful, Doctor. Very stressful indeed.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Sharifa. Let's address them one by one. For exercises, avoid anything that significantly increases your weakness or causes pain. Gentle stretching and walking are good, but don't push yourself. As for diet, there's no specific food to avoid or eat for this condition. Just maintain a healthy, balanced diet. The vitamins usually take a few weeks to start showing noticeable effects, but everyone is different. In the meantime, the physical therapy should help strengthen your legs and improve your mobility. Regarding your medical records, yes, this will be documented in your electronic health record. Your insurance company will likely be informed if you file a claim for the tests or therapy, but that doesn’t necessarily mean your premiums will increase. It depends on your insurance policy. I can have our billing department contact you to explain the potential costs and coverage. Do you want me to write down the contact information for the billing department?
PATIENT: Well, at least you’re being honest. The billing department, then, yes. Please write down the contact information. And… if the symptoms get worse before my appointment next week, who should I contact? Is there an emergency number I can call? I don’t want to wait until my next appointment if something serious happens. Honestly, this is very inconvenient. Very stressful. And frankly, a bit alarming.
DOCTOR: Here you are. And you’re right to ask about emergency situations. If your symptoms worsen significantly – meaning you experience new weakness, loss of bladder or bowel control, severe pain, or difficulty breathing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not wait for your next appointment. Otherwise, if your symptoms are gradually worsening, but you’re not experiencing any of those red flags, you can call our office, and we'll try to get you in as soon as possible. Here's our office number. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Sharifa?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Although… one last question. Will this… affect my ability to travel? I have bookings scheduled for next month, and I can’t afford to cancel them. Honestly, this is very inconvenient. Very stressful. And frankly, a bit alarming. I need to know if I should start making alternative arrangements. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern. It’s difficult to say for certain whether this will affect your ability to travel. It depends on how your symptoms progress with the treatment. If your weakness improves and remains stable, you should be able to travel without any issues. However, if your symptoms worsen, you may need to reconsider your plans. I recommend discussing your travel plans with a neurologist if you decide to see one. They can assess your condition and provide personalized recommendations. In the meantime, I advise you to stay well-hydrated, avoid strenuous activity, and listen to your body. Here's a summary of our discussion, along with the prescriptions and referrals. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns. And I hope you feel better soon, Sharifa. .
