DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s… it’s about the sun, really. I’ve been getting really bothered by it lately. More than usual, anyway. It feels like my eyes are extra sensitive, and my skin gets red so quickly. It's been happening for a couple of months now, I think.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Sensitive to the sun, you say. And redness... for a couple of months. Alright. Just to clarify, is this redness a full-body thing, or is it more localized?
PATIENT: Mostly on my face and my arms, Doctor. Anywhere that's actually in the sun, I guess. It doesn’t really bother me if I’m inside, or covered up. It's not itchy or painful, just… really red. And makes my eyes feel like they're burning a little. It’s just getting annoying, you know? Especially with the weather being nice and all. I like being outside.
DOCTOR: Alright, so face and arms, with sun exposure being the main trigger, and some eye irritation. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question… hmm. Not really, I don’t think. I mean, nothing major. I started a new vitamin, a multivitamin, maybe a month ago? But I’ve tried vitamins before and never had any problems. Oh! And my wife… she passed away last year, and I’ve been… well, I’ve been trying to get out more, spend time in the garden like she always loved. Maybe that’s it? More sun than usual, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A new vitamin and increased time outdoors… right. We’ll come back to that. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I guess. I had the flu a couple of times, but nothing serious. No major illnesses or anything. And I'm on Medicare, if that helps. I don’t really see doctors often, if I can avoid it, to be honest. My wife always took care of all that.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major health issues, thankfully. And Medicare is noted. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: No, never been hospitalized, and no surgeries either. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise. Just the occasional cold, that's all. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football, but it healed up just fine. Nothing since then, though. Honestly, I'm just a bit worried about this sun thing. It's just… different than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. We're getting a good picture here. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history, if you don't mind. Does anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any history of skin problems, like skin cancer, or unusual sensitivities to the sun?
PATIENT: That’s a tricky one, Doctor. I didn’t really know my father very well, he passed away when I was young. And my mother… she lived in Ghana her whole life, and we didn't talk much about health issues. I have a sister, but we haven’t seen each other in years. I don't think anyone had skin cancer, but honestly, I can’t really say for sure. We just didn’t talk about things like that. I’m sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly understandable. We’ll proceed without specific family history for now. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. Always thought it was a bad habit. My wife didn’t like it either, so that helped me stay away from it. I do enjoy a beer now and then, maybe one or two on the weekend. But that’s about it. I don’t do any drugs, never have. Mostly, I just like to garden and read. And try to enjoy life, you know? Especially lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. No smoking, minimal alcohol, enjoys gardening and reading. Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides that multivitamin you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just the multivitamin, Doctor. I take one tablet with breakfast. Nothing else. I used to take something for my blood pressure a few years ago, but the doctor took me off it when it came down on its own. So, yeah. Just the vitamin. I make sure to drink plenty of water, too. My wife always said hydration was important.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the multivitamin. And you're doing well to stay hydrated. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better look at your skin. Could you please take a seat on the examination table, and we’ll get started?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good, Doctor. No problem at all. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. If you could just loosen your shirt a bit, that would be helpful. I’m going to start by looking at your face and arms. I see some redness, as you mentioned, particularly on your cheeks and forehead. It doesn’t appear to be raised or scaly, which is good. And similar redness on your forearms. No obvious blisters or weeping. Your skin feels warm to the touch, but no significant swelling. I’m just going to check your lymph nodes… okay, no significant swelling there either. And your eyes… a little bit of irritation, but no obvious lesions or clouding. Alright. Everything appears relatively normal, aside from the redness and mild eye irritation. It's possible this is a form of sun sensitivity, or photosensitivity. However, we should rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel just to make sure everything is functioning as it should. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A blood test sounds fine with me. Just let me know where to go and what I need to do. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure this out. And thank you for taking the time to listen, it really means a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work. The lab is just down the hall, third door on the right. You don't need an appointment. Just present your Medicare card and the form, and they’ll take care of it. Results usually come back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding direct sun exposure as much as possible. Wear protective clothing – long sleeves, a hat, sunglasses – and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. And continue to stay hydrated. We'll review the results when they come back, and discuss the next steps. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a very good plan, Doctor. Avoiding the sun, sunscreen, stay hydrated… I can definitely do all of that. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Third door on the right, Medicare card… got it. I’ll head over there now and get it done. Thank you again for your help. I feel a bit better just knowing we’re looking into it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Komarov. That's what I'm here for. We'll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms or develop a fever. Have a good day. And try to enjoy what’s left of it, in the shade. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will. And I will try to stay in the shade! Thank you again for everything. Have a good day too. .
