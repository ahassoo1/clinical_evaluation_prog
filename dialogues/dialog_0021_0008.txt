DOCTOR: Right. So, Mr. Guerrerolopez, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, right. The… the ear. It feels full. Like something’s… blocked, you know? It’s been… a while now. Honestly, I can’t really say how long. A few weeks, maybe? It's just… annoying. I’d like to get it sorted if possible. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: "A few weeks," you say. Right. It's always "a few weeks" with these things. And annoying, yes, I understand. It’s usually something minor. Let’s have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Quickly if you can. I… I don’t like having this pressure. It makes it hard to hear sometimes. Not terribly, but… enough to be bothersome. I suppose it’s not painful, exactly. Just… full.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s some cerumen buildup, certainly. Nothing dramatic. Your tympanic membrane looks…normal. Have you been trying to clean it yourself?
PATIENT: Clean it? Oh… I think so. Maybe. My wife… she always used those little cotton swabs. I think I… I still have some. But honestly, I don't really remember. It's been… a long time since she passed. Everything gets a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the cerumen isn’t causing a complete blockage, but it could be contributing to the fullness you’re experiencing. It’s a common enough issue. Honestly, poking around in your ears with cotton swabs rarely helps, and often makes things worse. You just push the wax further in. We could try a simple wax removal. Do you have any allergies to ear drops?
PATIENT: Ear drops… I… I don't think so. Not that I'm aware of. My wife handled all that sort of thing. I don’t really pay attention to… details like that. Is it… a strong medicine? I just… prefer to get things done quickly, if possible. And if it's too uncomfortable, I’d rather just… leave it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It’s not a “strong” medicine, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It's just mineral oil-based, to soften the wax. You lie on your side, I put a few drops in, and it does its work. Usually takes about ten minutes. If it doesn't resolve the issue, we can explore other options, but honestly, I suspect this will do the trick. It’s far less invasive than poking around with instruments. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Ten minutes… Yes, that sounds… manageable. Mineral oil, you say? Alright. Yes, I understand. Lie on my side, drops go in. Ten minutes. As long as it’s not… painful. And it won’t make me… dizzy?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t make you dizzy. It's very rare. And I assure you, I will be careful. It's a standard procedure, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Just relax. Lie on your left side, please. I’ll need to gently pull your ear back and up to straighten the ear canal. It may feel a little strange.
PATIENT: Left side… Right. Just… get it over with quickly, please. I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just lie still for ten minutes. I’ll be back shortly. Don't move your head. I'll need you to remain perfectly still to ensure the drops work effectively.
PATIENT: Right. Ten minutes. Still. .
