DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is lovely to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… Yes, well, it’s this pain. Down low, in my belly. It comes and goes, you see, but when it does come… it’s quite severe. I believe my previous doctor mentioned something about… well, about my system acting up? It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out. I do apologize for being a bit… vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It's perfectly alright to be vague – we'll work through it together. “Down low in your belly” is a good starting point. Could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. Let me see… It's not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… cramping, I suppose? And a deep ache. It feels… like everything is tightening, if that makes any sense? It comes in waves, really. Sometimes it’s just uncomfortable, but other times… well, other times I can hardly move. It’s been quite distressing, truthfully. And I do seem to recall my previous doctor mentioning something about… inflammation? Perhaps? I’m terribly sorry, I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Ms. Glymph. Cramping and a deep ache that comes in waves is helpful. The mention of inflammation is also a good detail. To get a better understanding, could you tell me where exactly in your lower abdomen you feel the pain most intensely?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. It seems to be… centered, really. Right in the middle, a bit below my navel. But sometimes it radiates… spreads out to both sides, almost like… a band around my lower belly? It's not always in the exact same spot, which is rather confusing. And honestly, Doctor, sometimes it’s difficult to pinpoint precisely. It just… hurts all over down there. Is that terribly unhelpful? I feel so foolish trying to explain it.
DOCTOR: Not at all unhelpful, Ms. Glymph. It’s very common for pain to be diffuse, especially abdominal pain. Centered below the navel, radiating to both sides – that gives me a clearer picture. And it’s good you mentioned it isn’t always in the same spot. Now, has anything specific seemed to trigger this pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's another good question. Let me think… I don’t know that anything specifically triggers it, not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It just… comes and goes. I suppose… when I’m stressed, it does seem a bit worse. And perhaps after I’ve eaten a large meal? But I wouldn't say those things cause it, exactly. It could happen any time, really. And, you see, I’ve been having… well, some digestive troubles as well. A bit of bloating, you know. But I assumed that was just part of getting older. Perhaps I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Glymph. You're providing valuable information. Stress and larger meals are certainly things that can contribute to abdominal discomfort. And digestive troubles like bloating are important to mention. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well, Doctor, it’s not a particularly pleasant topic, is it? I suppose… they’ve been a bit irregular, lately. Sometimes I’m… constipated, if you will. And other times… well, other times it’s rather the opposite. It seems to fluctuate quite a bit. I haven’t noticed any blood, thankfully, but it’s been… unpredictable. And uncomfortable, naturally. I apologize for being so… detailed. It’s just… it’s hard to know what’s important and what isn’t.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. It is important, and you’re doing a wonderful job describing everything. Irregularity, constipation, and diarrhea are all relevant. No blood is good to know. Now, let’s move on to some other areas. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… the appetite has been a bit off, I suppose. Not a complete loss, mind you, but not as robust as it once was. I find myself not finishing meals sometimes. And, yes, I have experienced some nausea, a few times. Not severe, thankfully. Just a bit queasy. And… I think I had one instance of vomiting, perhaps a month ago? It was after a particularly stressful day, if I recall correctly. It wasn’t a great deal, but it was… unpleasant. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like so many little things, all happening at once. It's difficult to pinpoint a specific cause.
DOCTOR: It’s very common for things to feel scattered when you’re experiencing multiple symptoms, Ms. Glymph. It helps us to put the pieces together. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… my previous doctor, Dr. Abernathy, mentioned something about… systemic lupus erythematosus, I believe. SLE, for short. It was diagnosed… oh, quite some time ago now, perhaps twenty years? And I've been on various medications for it over the years. I can’t recall the specific names at the moment, I’m afraid. Other than that… I had my appendix removed when I was quite young. And a rather nasty bout of pneumonia a few years back. But other than that… I don’t believe so. My memory… it’s just so frustrating.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. That's very important information. Systemic lupus erythematosus is significant, and we'll need to consider that as we evaluate your current symptoms. I’ll make a note to review your records from Dr. Abernathy. And the appendix removal and pneumonia are helpful to know as well. Are you currently taking any medications for the lupus, or for any other condition?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I do take something for the lupus. It’s a small, white pill… I believe it starts with an ‘H’? Hydroxy… something. Hydroxychloroquine, perhaps? And I take a vitamin D supplement, my doctor suggested it for my bones. And… occasionally, I take a pain reliever for my joints, when they’re particularly troublesome. Just ibuprofen, over the counter. I don't take anything regularly, just as needed. And… I think that’s all. Honestly, Doctor, I wish I were better organized. It’s so easy to forget things these days.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Glymph. Many people have difficulty keeping track of their medications. Hydroxychloroquine, vitamin D, and ibuprofen as needed—that's very helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I don't believe so. I've never had a severe reaction to anything, thankfully. I think I might be slightly sensitive to shellfish, but it’s not a true allergy, more of a mild upset stomach. And… I recall a slight rash once, after using a particular brand of lotion. But other than that… no, I don’t have any known allergies. I’m rather fortunate, in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… Well, it's rather quiet, I suppose. I live alone, in a small cottage in the countryside. I enjoy gardening, when the weather permits. And I do quite a bit of reading. I used to travel extensively, but that became… difficult, a few years ago. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. I wouldn't say I get a great deal of exercise, but I do enjoy a leisurely walk now and then. It's a simple life, but it suits me.
DOCTOR: That sounds very peaceful, Ms. Glymph. And finally, do you have any family history of medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… my mother had arthritis, quite severely, in her later years. And my father had high blood pressure, I believe. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, had rheumatoid arthritis, I think it was. I don’t recall anyone else with any significant medical conditions. Honestly, Doctor, my family wasn’t particularly forthcoming about their health. It wasn’t a topic we discussed much. It’s difficult to recall specific details. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. You’ve provided a great deal of helpful information. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment implicitly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'll palpate your abdomen to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the examination. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Can you tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort in a specific area?
PATIENT: It’s… yes, it’s becoming more noticeable now. Right… here. When you press there, it’s quite tender. And… yes, it radiates a bit outwards, to both sides. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… deep ache. And… it feels a bit swollen, perhaps? I’m not sure, it’s difficult to tell. Oh, that’s… uncomfortable. But I suppose I should expect that, given the pain I’ve been experiencing.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do feel some tenderness there as well, and there is some mild guarding. It’s not significantly distended, but I note mild tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, with some radiating discomfort. I don’t feel any masses, and your organs don’t appear to be enlarged. I’m also going to check your reflexes and assess your range of motion. Your reflexes are normal, and your range of motion is good. Based on the information you've provided and the findings from the physical examination, I suspect we need to investigate this further. Given your history of SLE, the abdominal pain could be related to a flare-up, or it could be something else entirely. I recommend we order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and some inflammatory markers, such as an ESR and CRP. We should also do a urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection. I would also like to order an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your organs and rule out any structural abnormalities. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Very sensible. I trust your judgment implicitly. Blood work, a urinalysis, and an ultrasound… yes, that seems a thorough approach. I’m happy to undergo whatever tests you deem necessary. Honestly, I just want to get to the bottom of this pain. It’s been… quite disruptive. If you think those tests will help, then please proceed. I just hope they don't reveal anything too… concerning.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Glymph. We're going to take a systematic approach and gather as much information as possible. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. I'll order the tests now, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. The ultrasound will also be scheduled through the radiology department. In the meantime, if your pain becomes significantly worse, or if you develop a fever, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve explained everything clearly. I appreciate your patience and your kindness. It’s… reassuring to know that you’re taking this seriously. I suppose I’ll just wait for the lab to contact me, then. And try to remain calm. Thank you again, Doctor Glowka. You’ve been most helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. And remember, we're going to work through this together. I’ll have the nurse give you a copy of the test orders, and she'll also provide you with instructions for scheduling the ultrasound. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results. Have a good day, Ms. Glymph.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I shall.
