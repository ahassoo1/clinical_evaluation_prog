DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MayHugh, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Donate. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And my head. It’s hard to explain…things go quiet sometimes, and then I get really dizzy. It doesn’t last long, but it’s scary. My husband…he used to have something similar, that’s why I came. I don’t remember much about what he had, though. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, ears and dizziness…and some quietness. It’s good you came in, especially with your husband having similar issues. Let’s try to get a better picture of what's going on. When you say “acting up,” can you describe how your ears are acting up?
PATIENT: Um…well, it’s not pain, exactly. It’s more like…everything gets muffled, like someone turned the volume down low. And sometimes it’s just in one ear, and other times both. It comes and goes, you see? It’s not constant. And the dizziness…that feels like the room is spinning, or I’m spinning, I can’t always tell. It usually happens with the quietness, but not always. I wish I could explain it better. It all just feels…off.
DOCTOR: It sounds unsettling, Ms. MayHugh, and you're doing fine explaining it. It's helpful to know it's not constant pain, and that the muffled hearing and dizziness seem to come and go together sometimes. Now, has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm…that’s a good question. I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Maybe…stress? I get a bit anxious sometimes, thinking about things. But it doesn’t always happen when I’m stressed. And other times I’m perfectly calm and it still happens. Honestly, Doctor, it just seems to…come out of nowhere. I wish I knew what was causing it! It’s just… worrying.
DOCTOR: Right, no clear triggers. Okay. And about how long have you been experiencing these episodes – the muffled hearing and dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… hard to say. It’s been on and off for…well, a while now. Maybe a year? Longer? It’s difficult to remember exactly when it started. They weren’t frequent at first, just every now and then. But lately, they’ve been happening more often, which is why I decided to come in. It’s starting to interfere with things, you see? I don't like relying on people to repeat themselves all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, so roughly a year, increasing in frequency. That’s good to know. Now, Ms. MayHugh, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me think. Sometimes I feel a little bit…off balance, even when I’m not dizzy. Just unsteady, like I might fall. And…oh, sometimes I feel a little bit of pressure in my ears, like when you’re going up in an airplane. But not always. And…no, I don’t think that’s it. My head…sometimes I feel a bit…full? Like it’s stuffed up, but my nose isn’t blocked. Is that…helpful? I’m rambling, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Ms. MayHugh. It’s good you’re telling me everything. Pressure in the ears, feeling off balance, and a “full” feeling in your head…these are all helpful pieces. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, I have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take a little pill for it every day. And my joints…they get a bit achy sometimes, especially when it’s cold. But nothing major, really. Oh, and I wear glasses, as you can see! That’s about it, I think. I had the flu a couple of years ago, but that was a one-time thing. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure managed with medication, and some joint aches. Good to know. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… No, just the one for my blood pressure. Sometimes I take a pain reliever for my joints when they’re really bothering me, but that’s just over-the-counter, you know? Like… ibuprofen. But I don’t take it very often. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. It's not good for you, they say.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the blood pressure medication and occasional ibuprofen. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental allergens?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t noticed any trouble with pollen or dust or anything like that. My husband…he was allergic to bees, but I don’t have that problem. I'm lucky, I guess. I try not to worry about things like that. It’s stressful enough as it is!
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any family members—parents, siblings, or other close relatives—who have experienced similar problems with hearing, dizziness, or balance?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… that’s actually why I came. My husband, like I said, he had…something similar. He went to doctors for it, years ago. They said it was something with his inner ear, I think. And his mother…she had trouble with her balance when she got older. She fell a few times. But other than that… I don’t know. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen my family. My sister… she has high blood pressure, but that's it. Everything else… I couldn’t really tell you. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, husband with inner ear issues and mother with balance problems. That’s helpful to know. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this. It’s…worrying me, you see? Especially with my family history. Just let me know what I need to do. I'm a bit unsteady on my feet, so if you could help me, that would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. MayHugh. We’ll take our time. I’ll have you sit here, and I’ll start by checking your ears with an otoscope. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few simple balance tests. Just follow my instructions, and let me know if you feel dizzy or unsteady at any point. First, let's take a look in your ears…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. I'll try my best. It's just… the dizziness scares me a bit. But I'm ready. Go ahead. I'll close my eyes, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Closing your eyes is a good idea, Ms. MayHugh. It might help you relax. Alright… Hmm… your ear canal looks clear. The eardrum appears intact, but it’s a little bit… dull. Not as reflective as it should be. Now, let’s check the other ear. Okay… this ear looks similar. Eardrum is intact, but also slightly dull. No signs of infection, but the appearance is a bit concerning. Alright, now let's listen to your heart and lungs…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Dull, you say? That doesn't sound good. I hope it's not too serious. Go ahead with the listening… I'll just try to breathe normally, won’t I? It’s been a bit… stressful, all this worrying.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little bit elevated, but that’s understandable given your anxiety. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs or extra noises. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Alright, now let's check your balance. I’m going to have you stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Just try to maintain your balance for as long as you can. Let me know if you feel unsteady.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Elevated heart rate…that's not surprising, I suppose. Alright, feet together and close my eyes… Oh… I don’t think I’m very good at this. I feel a bit… wobbly.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. MayHugh. It's good you let me know. It is a difficult test. You did well to attempt it. Okay, now I’m going to do a quick test of your eye movements. Just follow my finger with your eyes, keeping your head still. Follow my finger to the left… now to the right… up… down…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’m a bit worried I’m going to fall. Following your finger…left, right, up, down… Oh… that makes me a little bit dizzy. Just a little bit, but it's there. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s enough of that. It’s alright, Ms. MayHugh. The dizziness with the eye movement test is significant. Based on what I’ve seen and heard, and the results of the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a condition called Vestibular Neuritis. It's an inflammation of the inner ear, which can cause dizziness, balance problems, and muffled hearing. The dull appearance of your eardrums, combined with the dizziness with eye movements, supports this possibility. However, to confirm this diagnosis, I recommend an audiometry test to assess your hearing and a VNG test to evaluate your inner ear function. Would you be willing to schedule those tests?
PATIENT: Vestibular Neuritis…that sounds…serious. And tests… more tests. Oh dear. I…I suppose so. If it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yes, I’ll do the tests. I just… I want to get this sorted out. It’s unsettling, not knowing what’s happening. When can I schedule them, Doctor? And…will they be painful?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. MayHugh, I understand your concern. The tests are not painful, thankfully. The audiometry test is just a hearing test where you’ll wear headphones and listen for sounds. The VNG test involves placing small sensors on your face and head to measure your eye movements while you look in different directions. It might be a little bit uncomfortable, but it’s not painful. Let me have my assistant schedule you for an audiometry test next week, and then a VNG test the week after. That should give us a good idea of what’s going on. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you some anti-nausea medication to help manage the dizziness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Anti-nausea medication… that sounds good. Anything to help with the dizziness. Next week and the week after… alright. That sounds…manageable. Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you explaining everything. I just… I hope it’s not too serious. And I hope these tests will give us some answers. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Anything to avoid?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. MayHugh. While we wait for the test results, I recommend avoiding sudden movements and situations that might worsen your dizziness, such as driving or operating heavy machinery. Try to stay hydrated, and get plenty of rest. Over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen can help with any discomfort, but avoid taking them if they worsen your dizziness. I’m also going to give you a handout with some exercises you can do to help improve your balance. They’re gentle exercises, and you should only do them if you feel comfortable. If your dizziness gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, severe headache, or vision changes, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Handout with exercises… okay. I'll try to remember to do them. Sudden movements… and no heavy machinery. I don’t really do much of that anyway. No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little bit better knowing what’s going on, even if it’s just a possibility right now. I'll schedule those tests with your assistant, and I’ll be careful in the meantime. And I’ll come back if anything gets worse. Thank you again.
