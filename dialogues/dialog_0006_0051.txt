DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini, good to see you. Or, uh… good to meet you. I'm Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit silly, really. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. My daughter… she said I should come in to have them check… what do you call it… my blood type? Yes, that’s it. Just to know. She worries, you see. A good girl, my daughter.
DOCTOR: Right, your blood type. Yes, perfectly reasonable. It’s good your daughter encourages you to stay on top of these things. A little preventative care is always a good idea. Though, usually we don’t just check blood type without a specific reason... but if that’s what you’d like, we can certainly do that. Before we get to that, though, just to get a bit of a broader picture… have you been feeling alright generally?
PATIENT: Oh, generally? Hmm… well, I ache a bit, like an old house settling, you know? Nothing terrible. And I get tired easier than I used to. But who doesn’t, at my age? I mostly just… am. I don’t really… go to the doctor much. Unless something really bothers me. Is checking the blood type… a long process? I wasn’t planning on being here all day.
DOCTOR: No, no, it's quite quick, Ms. Nini. A simple blood draw. Just a few vials. But you mentioned aches and fatigue… those could be related to a lot of things. Just routine things. Before we do the blood type, maybe just quickly go over a few things?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A few things? Like… questions? I'm not very good at remembering details, you see. I worked as a rigger, for many years. Up high, mostly. Dangerous work, but good money. I don’t think that has anything to do with it now, though. It was a long time ago. But… yes, questions are alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Right, a rigger. Good to know. Okay, let's keep it brief. Do you have any problems with your heart?
PATIENT: My heart? Oh, goodness. Let me think… I get a bit breathless sometimes, when I climb the stairs. But I live on the fourth floor, you see. It’s probably just that. My husband… he had a bit of trouble with his heart, towards the end. But I don’t… I don’t think I do. Not really. I mean, it beats, doesn’t it? Is that a good enough answer?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Breathlessness is good to know. And your husband’s history is helpful. Any chest pain with that breathlessness?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, no, not really. Just… tired. A heavy feeling sometimes, but not pain. It’s hard to explain. Like… a weight. And it comes and goes. Mostly when I’ve been… doing something. Though, truthfully, I don't do much these days. Mostly just sit and watch the television, you see. It’s a good show. About detectives.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any swelling in your ankles or feet, Ms. Nini?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… Now that you mention it… perhaps a little. Not terribly, but they do feel a bit… plump, sometimes. Especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just… old age. You know, things drooping a bit. Is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Okay. Plump ankles, good to know. Just to finish up this quick check… any trouble breathing when you lie down?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that… that’s a good question. Sometimes, yes. I have to… prop myself up with an extra pillow. It’s not terrible, but I do sleep better when I’m a bit… elevated. I thought it was just the bed, you see. It’s a bit old, and perhaps not firm enough. Is that… bad? I really don’t want to replace the bed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Nini. We've covered a good bit now. It sounds like you've been having some breathlessness, particularly when lying down, and some swelling in your ankles. It's good you mentioned that. And your daughter was right to suggest a check-up. Before we do the blood type, I think it would be wise to listen to your heart and lungs, and maybe get a quick EKG just to see what’s going on. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. An EKG? Is that… one of those machines with the stickers? I don’t like stickers. And I really just wanted to know my blood type. My daughter is very particular about knowing these things. Is the EKG… necessary? It sounds… complicated.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nini, it's a very simple test. Just a few stickers that read your heart's electrical activity. It doesn't hurt, and it will help me understand why you're feeling breathless and have swelling in your ankles. It's a common precaution. And while knowing your blood type is useful, it won’t tell us why you’re feeling the way you are. I understand your reluctance, but it’s important to rule out anything serious. I won’t keep you any longer than necessary. Would you prefer I explain it to your daughter?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You’re right, I suppose. It's just… machines. I never was very good with machines. My husband… he used to fix everything. But if it won’t take long… and if it really will help… alright. Do it. But gently, please. And could you tell me what you find out? I don't understand much of the medical talk, you see. Just… simple explanations. For an old lady.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Nini. Gently, I promise. And I'll explain everything in plain language. No medical jargon. If you’ll just sit here and relax, I’ll get everything set up. It will only take a few minutes. Afterwards, I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Then we can talk about what we find.
PATIENT: Alright. I do hope it doesn't involve too much poking and prodding. And… is it cold? Those stickers, I mean. My skin is rather sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: No poking or prodding, I promise. And the stickers are room temperature. They might feel a little cool at first, but not unpleasant. Just relax and breathe normally. I'll tell you when I'm done. Okay, just a few more seconds… excellent. Alright, Ms. Nini. That didn’t take long, did it?
PATIENT: No, not too bad. So… what did it show? Is everything alright? Don't tell me anything complicated, please. Just… is my heart beating properly? That's all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Nini, the EKG shows some irregularities in your heart rhythm. It’s not an emergency, but it does explain the breathlessness and swelling you’ve been experiencing. It looks like you have what we call atrial fibrillation. Essentially, your heart is beating irregularly, which can sometimes cause those symptoms. We need to investigate this further, but the good news is that it’s often manageable with medication. It’s important to get it checked out, but please don’t panic. It’s very common, especially as we get older. Do you understand so far?
PATIENT: Atrial… what now? My heart is… broken? Is that what you're saying? Oh, dear. My husband… he had heart trouble too. Is it… serious? Will I need… surgery? I don’t do well with surgery. I just wanted to know my blood type! This is too much. Perhaps I should just go home.
DOCTOR: No, no, please sit down, Ms. Nini. Your heart is not broken. That's not what I meant at all. Atrial fibrillation simply means the upper chambers of your heart are beating a little chaotically. It’s not a mechanical problem, it’s more of an electrical one. And no, you won't necessarily need surgery. Most people manage it very well with medication to slow down the heart rate and prevent blood clots. We need to do some further testing – a blood test and possibly an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart – to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I understand this is a lot to take in, and you’re feeling overwhelmed. We’ll take it one step at a time. Let’s start with the blood test. It will give us some important information. And I’ll explain everything in detail, I promise. Would you like me to call your daughter?
PATIENT: Oh… Blood test… alright. If you think it's necessary. And… yes, please. Call my daughter. She's very good at… at understanding these things. She always knows what to ask. I just… I feel so confused. And tired. Is it alright if I just… sit here for a moment? Before we do anything else?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Nini. Take all the time you need. I’m going to call your daughter now, and she can come in and help us. I’ll also get a nurse to bring you a glass of water. You just sit here and try to relax. I understand this is a lot to process. Hello?
PATIENT: .
