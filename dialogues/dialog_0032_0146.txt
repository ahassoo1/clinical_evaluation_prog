DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 38 years old. Please, tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right. Thirty-eight. I’m here… well, my muscles just feel weak. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to worry me. It’s hard to explain, just… tired, and not strong.
DOCTOR: “Weakness” is rather broad, Mr. McKinnon. Could you elaborate on that for me?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Broad is… a good word for it, I guess. It's not like a sudden thing, you know? It’s just… everything feels harder. Lifting things, even getting up from a chair sometimes. My legs feel it most, I think. And my arms… after a bit of work, they just feel… done. It’s not painful, not usually, just… not working right. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: So, a gradual onset of weakness, primarily in your legs and arms. And it’s exacerbated by exertion. When did you first begin to notice this, Mr. McKinnon?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… it started, I guess, maybe… three or four months ago? It was just little things at first, like feeling a bit more tired after yard work. I didn't think much of it, figured I was just getting older, to be honest. But it's been getting worse steadily since then. It's not a sudden thing, like I said.
DOCTOR: And has this weakness been consistently progressing, or are there times when it’s better or worse?
PATIENT: It's… it's definitely worse some days. Hard to say why, exactly. Some days I wake up and feel… okay, not great, but I can manage. Other days, just getting out of bed is a struggle. I haven't noticed anything specific that makes it better or worse, not really. It just… fluctuates. Stress maybe? I don’t know. I've been a bit stressed lately with work, but I always am.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really, not that I've noticed. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but again, work. No fever, no… numbness, no tingling. No problems with my balance, I don’t think. Oh, wait… sometimes my hands feel a bit shaky, but that’s only after I’ve been doing something for a long time, like filling out paperwork. It goes away pretty quick though. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Intermittent tremor with exertion. Okay. Now, let’s move onto some more general questions. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. Had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox and all that, but nothing serious. No hospital stays, no major surgeries. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. I haven’t really been to the doctor much in the last ten years, honestly. Just for check-ups, nothing major.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my mom, she had some problems with her joints when she got older, arthritis I think it was. Nothing… really serious, though. No one that I know of had anything like… muscle weakness or anything like that. We're Yemeni, you know, and my family… we don’t really talk about health stuff much. It’s just not our way.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you currently take any medications, Mr. McKinnon?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Never really needed to. Maybe some ibuprofen for headaches every now and then, but that’s it. I try to stay away from medication if I can, to be honest. Don’t like taking pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, regarding your lifestyle… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. Don’t really care for alcohol, either. And definitely no drugs. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Work, family, that’s about it. I drink a lot of tea, though, if that counts. Yemeni tea, very strong. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, and never had a reaction. I've never had any issues with bee stings or anything like that, either. Honestly, I think I'm pretty lucky. Just this weakness now, which is… annoying, to say the least. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Thank you for that comprehensive history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your strength, reflexes, and overall neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Let’s get it done. I just want to know what’s wrong. The sooner, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit up on the examination table, we’ll begin with an assessment of your upper body strength. I’m going to ask you to push against my hands with both arms, and try to resist my force. Do not worry if you cannot push as hard as you used to, just do your best. We'll start with your right arm… please extend it straight out, palm up.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem. I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Just tell me when to push.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please push upwards, resisting my force. Try to keep your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle. Okay, good. Now, your left arm. Same thing. Extend it out, palm up… Strength is 4/5 bilaterally. Mild weakness noted, but within acceptable limits for age. Now, let's move on to your legs. Could you please extend your legs straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Okay, done. They feel a bit stiff, to be honest. But I've got them out, ready when you are, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Push your heels into the table, resisting my force. Try to bend your knees. Strength is 3+/5 bilaterally in lower extremities. Decreased strength noted compared to upper extremities. Let's check your reflexes now. We'll start with your knees… Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally, normal. Now, I'm going to quickly run a cotton swab along the soles of your feet to test your sensation. Please tell me if you feel anything.
PATIENT: Okay, I felt that. Yes, definitely felt a tickle there… and now on this foot too. Both feet feel the same, to be honest. A little strange, but yeah, I can feel it. It’s not numb, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Sensation intact bilaterally in lower extremities. Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Thank you. That concludes the physical examination. Based on your history and the physical examination, there are several possibilities. Your symptoms suggest a possible neuromuscular weakness, but further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause. Given your age, and the gradual onset of symptoms, we need to consider a few things. It could be something relatively benign, like a vitamin deficiency, or it could be something more serious.
PATIENT: Okay… that doesn't sound good. What kind of things are we talking about? And what do we need to do to find out? I’m starting to get a little worried now, to be honest. Vitamin deficiency sounds okay, but… “more serious” is a bit frightening.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Mr. McKinnon. It's best to be thorough. "More serious" could encompass a range of conditions, from nerve compression issues to rarer muscular disorders. It’s crucial not to jump to conclusions before we have more information. To start, I’d like to order some blood tests. We’ll check your vitamin levels – specifically B12, D, and magnesium – as well as your thyroid function and a complete metabolic panel. We'll also do a Creatine Kinase level to look for muscle damage. These tests will help rule out some of the more common causes. I’ll also order a complete blood count to evaluate your overall health. Additionally, given the location of the weakness, I would like to order an Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Study . This test measures the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves and can help identify any underlying nerve damage or muscle dysfunction. It is more involved, but very helpful. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Wow… that’s a lot. EMG and… NCS? What exactly does that involve? Is it painful? And how long will all of this take? I'm just trying to get a handle on what we're doing here. And… is it expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. McKinnon. The EMG/NCS test involves inserting small needles into your muscles to record their electrical activity while you contract them. It can be slightly uncomfortable, a bit like a mild muscle cramp, but it’s generally well-tolerated. The nerve conduction study involves placing electrodes on your skin to measure the speed of nerve impulses. It doesn’t involve needles and is painless. The entire process usually takes about an hour to two hours. As for the cost… unfortunately, without insurance, it can be quite expensive. I can provide you with an estimate of the costs, and we can explore options like payment plans or financial assistance programs. We also have a social worker here at the clinic who can assist you with navigating these financial concerns. It’s important to gather this information to make an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Would you like me to go ahead and order these tests for you?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Fine. Yes, go ahead and order them. I don’t see any other way. But please, let me know the costs beforehand. And can you get me in touch with the social worker? I’m going to need all the help I can get. This is… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. McKinnon. I will order the blood tests and the EMG/NCS right away. The lab will contact you directly to schedule the blood draw. I’ll also have the receptionist forward you the social worker’s contact information after this consultation. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. Just… please send me the information as soon as you can. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I’m just… anxious to get this figured out.
