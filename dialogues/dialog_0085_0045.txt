DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I been getting… a lot of flushing. My face gets very red, and sometimes my chest too. It’s been happening for… oh, maybe a month now? Not every day, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month of flushing, primarily on your face and sometimes your chest. That definitely warrants looking into. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. When it happens… that’s a good question. It doesn’t seem to be after eating anything special. I eat mostly… simple things. Rice, dal… sometimes chicken. It doesn’t feel connected to food, no. Maybe… when I’m a little stressed? I lost my wife last year, and… things get to me sometimes. Not always, but… yes. Maybe when I’m thinking about things.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Withycombe. That must be incredibly difficult. It’s understandable that things would get to you. So, it sounds like stress or thinking about difficult things might be a trigger for the flushing. Besides the flushing, are you experiencing any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is difficult. Yes… sometimes my heart beats a little fast when it happens. Not a lot, but I can feel it. And… sometimes I get a little sweaty. Mostly just my palms. And… I feel a little… warm, all over. Like a fever, but I don’t have a fever. I checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, so with the flushing, you're also experiencing a racing heart, sweaty palms, and a feeling of warmth. That’s helpful information. Do you notice any other symptoms at all, even if they seem unrelated?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! Sometimes… my head feels a little… funny. Not a headache, exactly. More like… light. And I get a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. Not every time, but it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness when standing and feeling lightheaded. Thank you. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I go for walks every day. Not much trouble, really. Just… old age, I guess. My wife, she… she had some trouble with her blood pressure, but I didn't.
DOCTOR: That's good to know you've generally been healthy. And I'm sorry to hear about your wife's health issues. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital. Just… a few colds, here and there. Nothing serious. I try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to… let my body heal itself. Maybe some turmeric in my tea sometimes, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or regular supplements. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife was allergic to some kinds of nuts, but I’m not. I can eat everything, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had some trouble with her heart when she was older. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. But that was a long time ago. My wife’s family… they were all pretty healthy, as far as I know. Not much trouble on her side.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your father. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to ask a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife didn’t either. We both thought it was a bad habit.
DOCTOR: Good. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have… a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just one. It helps me relax. Not every day, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine a few times a week. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your work and stress levels outside of the loss of your wife?
PATIENT: I work as a counselor, Doctor. Helping people with… well, with their problems. It’s… rewarding work, but it can be stressful. Hearing about people’s troubles all day… it takes a toll sometimes. I try to separate work from my personal life, but it’s hard. I have been thinking about retiring soon, if that makes sense. It’s just… a lot to carry.
DOCTOR: Okay, working as a counselor and considering retirement. That certainly sounds like it could contribute to stress. Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Mr. Withycombe. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe. Your heart sounds regular, although a little fast. Your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated – 140/90. Your ears and throat look normal. I'm also noting some mild flushing of your face and neck. I'm going to palpate your pulse and check your reflexes. Your pulse is also a bit rapid. Reflexes are normal. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of what could be a few different things. It could be related to stress and anxiety, which is common after a loss, or it could be something like rosacea, or even something that needs to be checked more carefully. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it helps figure out what’s wrong, then yes, please. Blood tests are fine. I just want to… feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Withycombe. I'll order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We’ll also check your Vitamin B12 levels, as deficiencies can sometimes cause similar symptoms. I'll also order a cortisol level to check your stress hormone. The lab is just down the hall. You can go anytime today. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, try to manage your stress as best you can. Perhaps some gentle exercise, meditation, or talking to a friend or family member could help. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… when will I get the results? And… how long does it usually take?
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Our office will call you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It’s always better to be safe. I’ll also print out a copy of the lab orders for you. Do you need a work note for any time off?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thank you. I don’t need a work note. I’m… flexible with my schedule. I appreciate you asking. And thank you for… taking the time. I feel a little better already, just talking about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I'm glad I could help, even just a little. Remember, I’m here for you. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
