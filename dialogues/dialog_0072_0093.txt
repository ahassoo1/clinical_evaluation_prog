DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I'm Dr. Hembrey. Welcome to the clinic. So, to begin, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Right, well… honestly, it's a bit of a blur, things have been… off. I think my wife mentioned something about not sleeping well before… well, before. And I guess I haven’t been feeling exactly peak condition, you know? Not that I do much strenuous activity these days. Mostly just fiddling with instruments. It’s… a long story.
DOCTOR: "Off" is rather vague, Mr. Redfern. Perhaps we can unpack that a bit. You mentioned not sleeping well and not feeling at your best. Can you describe what “not sleeping well” entails?
PATIENT: Ugh, details. See, that's the problem. It's not like I wake up feeling awful, exactly. Just… not refreshed. I toss and turn a bit, I suppose. Might get up once or twice. It's just… quantity is low, I think. And the quality… feels thin, somehow. Like I haven't actually been asleep, if that makes any sense. It's frustrating, really. Used to be able to sleep through anything.
DOCTOR: "Thin," you say. That’s… an interesting descriptor. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Honestly? A while. Months, definitely. Possibly longer. After… everything. It’s all a bit muddled, you understand. I really can't put a precise date on it. It just… crept up on me. I wouldn't say it's drastically impacted my life – I spend most days in the workshop anyway – but it's… nagging. And my wife… she'd have noticed. She always did.
DOCTOR: I see here you have Medicare, and the clinic is… rural. That may be relevant. And I note no significant past medical history listed. You mentioned "everything," Mr. Redfern. Would you be willing to elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? It’s… my wife passed. A few months back now. Sudden illness. Terrible thing. She… well, she kept me going, you see? Organized everything. Made sure I ate right, exercised… I mostly just kept the instruments in tune. After she went… things just… slipped. I haven’t been taking care of myself, I suppose. It’s not something I'm good at, if I’m honest. It's a bit pathetic, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss is… significant. And it’s quite common for routines – and self-care – to be disrupted following a bereavement. Let's focus on your current symptoms. Beyond the sleep disturbance, are you experiencing any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… I’ve probably put on a bit of weight, I imagine. Clothes feel… snugger. And… I don't know. A general lack of… motivation, I suppose. Even fiddling with instruments feels like an effort sometimes. Not that I've stopped, mind you. Can't just stop, can I? People rely on me. But… it’s not the same. It’s… harder. And I’m always a bit tired. Just… generally sluggish.
DOCTOR: Sluggishness, weight gain, and lack of motivation… Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, Mr. Redfern?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat. Mostly whatever's easiest, to be honest. Biscuits with tea, usually. Sometimes a bit of leftover something from the deli. Nothing… elaborate. My wife did most of the cooking, so I never really paid much attention. It's not like I'm hungry all the time, but I don't actively avoid food either. Just… neutral, I suppose. It all tastes… the same, if I'm being honest. Bland.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Really? Is that… necessary? Look, I’m a simple man, Doctor. I fix instruments. I don't spend much time… thinking about that sort of thing. If you must know, it's… regular enough, I suppose. Nothing… dramatic. Just… normal. Why do you ask?
DOCTOR: We ask about all aspects of your health, Mr. Redfern. It helps to paint a complete picture. Now, let's move on. Have you noticed any feelings of sadness or hopelessness?
PATIENT: Hopelessness? Well, isn’t that just… stating the obvious? My wife is gone, Doctor. What do you expect? Of course, I'm sad. Doesn’t everyone grieve? It's just… I'm not one for… displays. I keep busy. Fix instruments. That's what she would have wanted. But yes, alright, I'm not exactly overflowing with joy. Is that what you wanted to hear?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Let's do a brief physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look at your thyroid. And, if you'll permit, I'll palpate your abdomen. Just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Palpate my… abdomen? Really? Must we go through all of this? I’m a simple man, Doctor. Not some… specimen. Look, I suppose if you insist. But I warn you, I haven't exactly been diligent about… self-maintenance lately. Just get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Please lie down on your back, Mr. Redfern. Blood pressure is 148/92. Pulse is 78, regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs noted. Thyroid is slightly enlarged, non-tender. Abdomen is soft, mild tenderness in the epigastric region, no masses palpated. No hepatosplenomegaly. Your thyroid is a bit enlarged, and there's some tenderness in your upper abdomen. It's not particularly concerning at this stage, but we'll need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate further? What does that mean, exactly? More poking and prodding? I told you I haven’t been taking care of myself. It’s probably just biscuits and tea, honestly. What sort of investigation are we talking about? Blood tests? X-rays? I haven’t got all day, you know. I have instruments to fix.
DOCTOR: I understand you have commitments, Mr. Redfern. However, dismissing potential issues simply isn’t prudent. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a basic metabolic panel. That will give us a better understanding of what's going on. And yes, a chest X-ray would be beneficial, just to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues given your age and… recent history. We'll also want to check your Vitamin D levels. It's surprisingly common to be deficient, and it can contribute to fatigue and mood changes. These are standard tests, Mr. Redfern. It's a process of elimination. And, frankly, it's better to be thorough. In the meantime, I recommend you start incorporating a bit more… varied nutrition into your diet, and attempt to get at least 30 minutes of light exercise each day. A walk, perhaps. It sounds… simplistic, but it can make a difference.
PATIENT: Simplistic is an understatement. Look, I appreciate you going through this, Doctor, I truly do. But you’re talking about… a lifestyle overhaul. I’m not a fitness enthusiast, and frankly, I’m not much of a cook. Fine. Do your tests. Blood tests, X-rays, whatever. Just… don't expect miracles. And please, no lectures on the benefits of kale. When can I expect the results? And will this require multiple visits? Because frankly, I'm not sure I have the energy for a prolonged medical saga.
DOCTOR: The lab work should be back within three to five business days. The X-ray results usually take a day or two longer. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. It’s likely we will need at least one additional visit. Here are the requisitions for your lab work and X-ray. The X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street. Their number is on the order. As for a “saga,” Mr. Redfern, we are simply gathering information to ensure your well-being. I understand your reluctance, but it's a necessary step. And no, I won't lecture you about kale. However, I will recommend a balanced diet. It's not about perfection, simply improvement. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No. No, I don’t think so. Balanced diet. Right. Well, thank you, Doctor. I suppose I'll get these tests done. If you'll excuse me. I have instruments waiting.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Redfern. Take care. .
