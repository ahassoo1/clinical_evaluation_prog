DOCTOR: Good morning, Antoine. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for this. It’s…a bit embarrassing to be discussing this, really. It’s something in my mouth. A white coating. It’s rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can definitely be unsettling to deal with something like that, and it's perfectly alright to feel embarrassed. We'll get to the bottom of it. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a bit more about this white coating?
PATIENT: Well, it's…on my tongue, mostly. And the insides of my cheeks. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. More…irritating. It makes it difficult to taste things properly, you know? And my wife keeps giving me…looks. It's been going on for about a week, I suppose. I haven’t been terribly concerned, frankly, but she insisted I come. Women.
DOCTOR: I see. So it's been present for about a week, primarily on your tongue and the inside of your cheeks, causing some irritation and affecting your taste. And your wife encouraged you to get it checked out. That's good of her, actually. It’s always wise to have things looked at. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this white coating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? I don’t know…I feel fine. Perfectly normal. Perhaps a little tired, but that’s likely due to work. I’m a faller, you know. It’s physically demanding. I don’t sit around cataloging symptoms all day. I suppose…no fever. No swelling. No…pain, as I said. Just this…unsightly coating. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Antoine. No fever, no swelling, no pain, just the coating and some tiredness related to your work as a faller. To clarify, have you noticed any changes in your mouth before this week – any sores, blisters, or redness?
PATIENT: Before this week? Goodness. No, not really. I mean, I’ve had the occasional…cut, perhaps, from chewing on something too hard, but nothing significant. My mouth feels…normal, aside from this unfortunate situation. Honestly, I don't spend a great deal of time examining my oral cavity. Is this a common ailment?
DOCTOR: It can be, Antoine. Many things can cause a white coating in the mouth. To help narrow it down, could you tell me a little about your diet?
PATIENT: My diet? Really, Doctor? What does my diet have to do with this? I eat. I eat what is available. It’s mostly beans, rice, some meat when I can get it… fairly standard fare. Nothing fancy. I assure you, I don't spend my evenings indulging in sugary delicacies. Is this going somewhere? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your time, Antoine. I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what might be causing this. Diet can play a role, and so can certain habits. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Smoke? Doctor, are you suggesting…no. Absolutely not. I am a healthy man. I work hard, I provide for my family. Smoking is…detrimental. Look, is there a quick solution to this? A cream, perhaps? Because I really don’t have time for a lengthy investigation.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I assure you I’m not making any assumptions. It’s just a standard question. Alright. Since you don't smoke, and your diet seems typical, let’s take a look at your mouth. I just want to do a quick examination to get a better visual understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But please, be quick. I have trees to fell. I truly don't see what good this will do, but…go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Antoine. I’m just going to take a look. I see the coating you mentioned. It appears a bit patchy, and when I gently wipe it away, the tissue underneath looks a little red and inflamed. No open sores, thankfully. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your saliva – is it thicker or drier than usual?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No. I eat my meals just fine. And my saliva…I don’t know. It feels normal enough. I suppose I haven't been paying particular attention to the consistency of my saliva. Is this taking long?
DOCTOR: No, we’re almost done. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it looks like you likely have oral thrush – also known as candidiasis. It's a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of yeast in your mouth. The redness and inflammation I observed support that. It can sometimes happen after antibiotics, but it can also occur with a weakened immune system or simply a disruption in the natural balance of bacteria in your mouth. Have you recently taken any antibiotics, or been feeling particularly stressed or run down?
PATIENT: A fungal infection? In my mouth? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy. I’ve never been one for…ailments. Antibiotics…no, not recently. Perhaps…a year ago, for a bad tooth. But that was a long time ago. Stressed? Well, I run a business. There’s always some stress. But I manage. So, what now? A pill? A cream? Just tell me what I need to do to get rid of this…fungus.
DOCTOR: Alright. Since you haven't taken any antibiotics recently, and given your description, it’s possible that it's a mild case related to stress, or a slight imbalance in your oral microbiome. I’m going to recommend an oral antifungal medication – Nystatin suspension. It's a liquid that you swish around in your mouth for a few minutes, then swallow. It will help to kill the overgrowth of yeast. You’ll need to use it four times a day for 7-14 days. I'm also going to recommend practicing good oral hygiene - brush twice a day and floss daily. Avoid sugary foods and drinks, as these can feed the yeast. And try to manage your stress levels as much as possible. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A liquid…four times a day? For two weeks? This is…inconvenient. And expensive, I presume? I suppose…I can try it. But I’m a busy man, Doctor. If this doesn’t work quickly, I’ll need to reconsider my options. And what if it is related to stress? What am I supposed to do, take a vacation? Just…tell me where to get the medication, and let’s be done with this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Antoine. It is an inconvenience, and I’ll write you a prescription that includes information on potential generic options to help with the cost. The medication is typically available at most pharmacies. Regarding the stress, I don't expect you to take a vacation! Simply being mindful of stressors and incorporating stress-reducing techniques like deep breathing or short breaks throughout the day can be helpful. I'll write the prescription now. I also want to emphasize the importance of good oral hygiene. I’ll give you a printed instruction sheet with details on how to use the medication, potential side effects, and when to follow up if your symptoms don’t improve after a week. If you find your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any difficulty swallowing or fever, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s everything. Just…the prescription. And I hope this works quickly. I have a schedule to maintain. Thank you. I suppose. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the prescription and the instruction sheet. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. I hope you feel better soon, Antoine. Have a good day. And please, try to take care of yourself. .
