DOCTOR: Good morning, Josie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s… nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have all day. It’s my stomach. Food just… comes back up, alright? Reflux, the young lady on the phone called it. It's a nuisance, mostly. Been happening for a few weeks now. Don't need a whole song and dance about it.
DOCTOR: Reflux, alright. A few weeks... yes. Okay. Just to clarify, when you say 'comes back up,' is that… heartburn sensation, or are you actually vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting, Doctor. Actual food. Do you need me to draw you a picture? It’s not just a little burn, it's… unpleasant. Really unpleasant. And it happens mostly after I eat, which, frankly, is a problem. I like to eat.
DOCTOR: No need for pictures, Josie, I understand. Actual vomiting… alright. And is it immediately after eating, or does it happen a few hours later?
PATIENT: Oh, usually within an hour or so. Sometimes sooner. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Soup, steak, doesn't make a difference. Though, maybe… maybe it’s worse with richer foods. But I shouldn’t have to catalog every single bite I take, should I? It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, you shouldn’t have to. Rich foods… alright. Hmm. And do you experience any other symptoms alongside the vomiting?
PATIENT: What do you mean, ‘other symptoms’? I throw up! What more do you need? I suppose… sometimes my chest feels a bit… tight afterwards. And a little sour taste in my mouth. But honestly, Doctor, I'm a busy man. Emergency Management doesn’t run itself. Are we getting anywhere with this or should I just go home and suffer in silence?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Chest tightness and sour taste… good to know. Those can be related. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? What are you implying? I'm still a perfectly good six-foot-five, thank you very much. Though… now that you mention it, my wife has been saying my trousers are a little… looser. But that's probably just the heat. She always complains about something. It's not like I've been trying to lose weight. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. A little looser fitting… okay. And are you experiencing any difficulty swallowing, or any pain in your chest when you swallow?
PATIENT: No! I told you, the chest tightness comes after. Swallowing is fine. Perfectly fine. Look, I don’t need a detailed anatomy lesson here. I know when something’s wrong. It’s my stomach. Food goes in, food comes back up. It’s a simple equation, Doctor. Are we going to figure out a solution or not? I have a meeting at one.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Now, have you ever had any tests done for this before?
PATIENT: Tests? No. I've never bothered with tests. I don't go around poking and prodding at things when they're obviously malfunctioning. I'm a practical man, Doctor. Fix the problem, don't analyze it to death. I’ve always just… dealt with it. A little antacid here and there. But this is getting worse. That’s why I'm here, reluctantly, I might add.
DOCTOR: Alright, no previous testing. Just antacids occasionally. And this is… worsening over the past few weeks. Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listen to your abdomen, feel around a bit. See if we can get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful. Just what I needed. More poking and prodding. Fine, get it over with. Just be quick about it, alright? I haven't got all day, and I really don't appreciate people touching me. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, of course. I'll be as quick as possible. If you could just lie back on the exam table, please. And I'll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Hmm… Okay. I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds, but there’s a little tenderness when I press here, on the upper left side. Not sharply painful, but definitely sensitive. And your abdomen is… soft, but slightly distended. Is it uncomfortable when I press here?
PATIENT: Ow! Yes, that’s a bit sore, actually. Not unbearable, but… definitely noticeable. Distended? I don’t know what that means. I just eat a normal amount of food. Maybe I had a big lunch. Look, I'm not a medical professional, alright? Just tell me what this means. Are you going to give me a pill or what? This is incredibly inefficient. .
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Some tenderness and slight distension… and the recent weight loss… Hmm. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing, but it could be a number of things. Given your symptoms and the timeline, it's possible we're dealing with something like gastritis, or perhaps a hiatal hernia. It’s also important to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to recommend a few tests. A blood test to check for inflammation and rule out any underlying issues, and an endoscopy, which is where we use a small camera to look inside your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
