DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 35 years old. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, 35, that's right. Hmm... well, I keep coughing. A lot. And I feel... tired, always tired. And my nose, it gets stuffy... a lot too. Feels like sinus, you know? Like blocked. Been happening... a while now. I forget exactly how long. Sorry.
DOCTOR: A while now… right. Can you be a little more specific, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: Specific... uh... maybe... six months? Or more? It comes and goes, but it always comes back. Especially when it’s hot, or when it rains. Makes it worse, definitely. I work outside... changing tires, so maybe that? I don't know. It’s just... annoying. And I can’t sleep good with the coughing.
DOCTOR: Changing tires… so exposure to dust and potentially other irritants. And it's worse with changes in weather. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats associated with this cough and congestion?
PATIENT: Fever... not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but not like, shivering cold or anything. No chills, no... night sweats? What's that even mean? I just sweat normal, I think. I work hard, you know? Gets hot. I don't usually check for special sweat... sorry. Is that a bad sign?
DOCTOR: No, it’s alright. Night sweats are excessive sweating that occurs during sleep, often associated with infection. Since you don't experience those, that's good. Do you have any pain anywhere – chest pain, sinus pain, headache?
PATIENT: Uh... sometimes my head hurts, yeah. Like, a pressure headache, behind my eyes. And... my chest feels a little tight when I cough really hard. Not always, just when I'm coughing a lot. Sinus... yeah, around my nose and forehead. Feels blocked, you know? Like someone stuffed cotton in there. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Chest tightness with forceful coughing, pressure headache, sinus congestion. Have you noticed any colored mucus when you cough – green, yellow, or even blood?
PATIENT: Colored... uh... sometimes. Usually it's clear, just watery. But when it's bad... yeah, sometimes it’s... yellowish. Not always, but it happens. Never seen blood, thankfully. Makes me nervous just thinking about it! I just wipe it away. Sorry, it's… gross to talk about.
DOCTOR: It is what it is, Mr. Tati. We need information. Have you tried anything to alleviate these symptoms – over-the-counter medications, home remedies?
PATIENT: Uh... yeah, I tried those cough syrups. The red one, and the green one. Didn’t really help much. My wife, she gives me hot tea with lemon sometimes. That feels okay for a little bit, makes my throat feel better, but it comes back. I don't like taking too much medicine, you know? Makes me sleepy. Not good when I’m changing tires.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies – to pollen, dust, animals, medications?
PATIENT: Allergies... hmm. Not that I know of. I get itchy sometimes when I’m outside, maybe from the grass? But everyone gets itchy, right? I don’t think it’s a bad allergy. And no, not to medicines, I don't think. I haven’t tried many. Mostly just… pain killers when I hurt my back. Does that count? Sorry, I’m not very good at remembering things like this.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright. Let's move on. Now, do you smoke, or are you frequently exposed to secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And my wife doesn’t either. We try to stay away from people who do. Makes it hard to breathe, you know? Especially when I'm already coughing. We eat outside a lot because of that. It's... bad for you. Definitely.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or any other lung condition?
PATIENT: Uh... no, not that I remember. I get sick sometimes, like, a normal cold, but never anything… serious. Doctor never said anything about my lungs. I had a fever when I was little, and chickenpox. And I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that’s about it. Sorry, I’m not very good with doctor stuff. I usually just tell them what hurts, and they give me something.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family... hmm. My mother... she had a bad cough sometimes, when she got old. But I don't know what it was. She just... coughed a lot. And my father, he was healthy, I think. Never sick much. My wife’s mother... she had high blood pressure. That’s all I really know. Sorry. They live far away, we don’t see them much. It's hard to ask about doctor things from so far away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs, check your sinuses, and take your temperature. Just sit back and relax. Please take a deep breath in... and out...
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Deep breath... like this? takes a deep, slightly wheezing breath Is that okay? I’m a little nervous, sorry. It always feels weird when someone listens to my chest. Feels like they can hear everything wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tati. Breathe normally. pauses, moves stethoscope around I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, particularly on exhale. continues examination, palpates sinuses Your sinuses are tender to the touch, and there's some mild swelling. Temperature is 99.1 Fahrenheit – slightly elevated. steps back Your heart rate and blood pressure are within normal limits. Given your symptoms and the findings from the exam, it sounds like you likely have acute bronchitis, possibly with a secondary sinus infection. It's likely viral in origin, but the sinus involvement could be bacterial.
PATIENT: Bronchitis... and sinus? Is that bad? Will I need… shots? I don’t like shots. And what does ‘viral’ mean? Is that like… a cold? I just want to stop coughing, and not feel so tired. It's hard to work when I feel like this, you know? My wife worries.
DOCTOR: “Viral” means it’s caused by a virus, similar to a common cold, yes. Shots aren’t necessary for this. We won’t be giving you any injections. Given that it seems to be a relatively mild case, and you've had symptoms for some time, I’m going to prescribe you an expectorant to help loosen the mucus in your lungs and a decongestant for your sinuses. I’m also recommending a course of saline nasal rinses – you can get a kit at any pharmacy. They help clear out the congestion. Now, given your lack of insurance, I’ll prescribe you the most affordable options available. It's important to stay hydrated, rest as much as possible, and avoid irritants like dust and smoke. If your symptoms worsen – you develop a high fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain – you need to seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Uh... yeah, I think so. Expectorant… for the cough. Decongestant for the nose. And… salty water in my nose? That sounds… weird. No shots, that's good. No insurance, that's okay, cheaper is good. I'll try to rest... but I need to work, you know? Bills to pay. pauses And if I get really bad, go to the doctor? Okay. What happens if I can't afford the medicine? Is there somewhere I can go? Sorry, I'm just... worried about the money.
DOCTOR: There are some patient assistance programs available, and I can provide you with a list of local pharmacies that offer discounted medications. We can also explore some over-the-counter options that are less expensive, though they may be less effective. I'm writing down the names of the medicines now. This list includes the dosages, and also the pharmacy information. If you find that you're unable to afford any of these options, please contact the clinic's social worker; they can assist you in finding resources. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. That's very helpful. A list… and the social worker… good. I think that's all. I just want to feel better. I don't want to keep coughing. My wife gets worried, you know? Thank you for helping me. takes the slip of paper and folds it carefully, putting it in pocket I'll try the medicines, and the salty water. And if I get really bad, I’ll come back. Thank you again. stands up slowly I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Tati. Get some rest, and follow the instructions carefully. Should your condition deteriorate, do not hesitate to seek further medical attention. Here’s a work note excusing you from heavy lifting for three days. hands over another slip of paper. Have a good day.
