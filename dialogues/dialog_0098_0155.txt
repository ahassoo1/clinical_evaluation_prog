DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome. I’m Dr. Bombara. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this shaking. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. Gets worse when I try to… do things. Not a big thing, really. Just thought I should get it checked. Don't remember exactly when it started, to be honest. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, shaking in your hands… and it seems to worsen with activity. You’re right to get it checked, Mr. Jezik. It’s good you came in. You mentioned you don’t recall precisely when it began. Roughly, can you give me a sense?
PATIENT: Roughly… hmm. Maybe… six months? A year? Time all blurs together, you know? It wasn’t sudden, like a switch flipped. More like it just… gradually got noticeable. I used to be able to hold a wrench steady, working on things… now it's… not so easy. Water treatment’s a precise job. Was, anyway.
DOCTOR: Water treatment… yes, I see that in your records. And it's affecting your ability to do your work. Okay. So, gradual onset, over perhaps six to twelve months. Besides the shaking, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. Not really. Maybe a little… stiff? Sometimes my hands feel a bit cramped up, but it passes. I sleep alright, I suppose. Everything just feels… slower, overall. Like I'm wading through mud, sometimes. But that could be the age, too. I forget things, a lot… though I suppose everyone does when they get to be my age. Don’t remember much about my… wife, to be honest. It’s awful, really. But that's another story.
DOCTOR: Okay… stiffness, a feeling of slowness. And some memory issues. You mentioned forgetting things… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I forget everything. More like… names. Dates. What I had for breakfast yesterday. Little things. Important things, I think, I can still… mostly remember. Like how to fix a pump. But it’s frustrating. My daughter keeps telling me I’m repeating myself. Drives her mad, she says. It's… I just want to get this shaking sorted, really. Is it serious, Doctor? Is it something I should worry about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re bringing these concerns to me, Mr. Jezik. It is important to investigate both the shaking and the memory issues. It's too early to say definitively what's going on, but we'll work through it. To get a better picture, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Conditions… hmm. Not that I recall, really. I had the usual childhood stuff, measles, mumps… nothing serious. Broke my arm once, falling off a tractor, years ago. Had a bad bout of the flu a few winters back, but that's about it. I used to go to the doctor regularly, getting check-ups, but then… well, things happened. Lost track, I suppose. Mostly just kept myself busy, fixing things. Never much bothered with doctors unless I absolutely had to. Everything just… slowed down. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history as far as you recall. And no regular medications currently?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Never been much of a pill-taker. Always preferred to tough things out. My father was the same. "A little hard work never hurt anyone," he used to say. Though, maybe that's why he wasn't around for very long. He… well, never mind. Point is, no pills, no regular prescriptions. Just… me, trying to keep things running. And now this shaking is making it harder. Really harder. Is there anything you can do about it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Let's take a look. I’m just going to have you do a few simple movements for me, so I can get a better sense of the shaking. Could you extend your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There. See? It's worse when I hold them out like this. Like… a little earthquake. Not constant, mind you. Comes and goes. It's… embarrassing, really. I used to be so steady. Now I feel like an old, broken machine. It’s frustrating. Truly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the tremor. And it seems to be resting tremor, which is… noteworthy. Now, if you would, please touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger with yours. Just alternate back and forth as quickly and accurately as you can.
PATIENT: Ugh. That's… harder than it looks. My hand just won’t listen to me anymore. Like it has a mind of its own. It’s… it’s getting worse. I can feel it. Is it… is it something bad, Doctor? Please tell me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. You're doing fine. What we’ve observed suggests there could be a few possibilities. Given your age, the resting tremor, and the difficulty with coordination, it’s important to consider Parkinson's Disease. However, there are other potential causes for these symptoms, and we need to rule those out. I'm going to order some blood work to check for any underlying medical conditions and I also want to schedule an appointment with a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Parkinson's… My… my wife… she had something like that. Towards the end. It wasn't a good time. So… that’s what this is? Is it… incurable? I don't want to end up like her. I just want to… fix something. Anything. Just to get my hands steady again. Blood work… a neurologist… Alright. Alright, do what you need to do. Just… please tell me what’s happening. And if there’s anything… anything at all I can do. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. I understand your concerns, and I'll explain everything as clearly as I can. Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive neurological disorder, but there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. We’re not jumping to any conclusions yet; the blood work will help rule out other possible causes, and the neurologist will perform a more thorough examination to determine the best course of action. I'll get the orders sent to the lab, and my nurse will schedule the appointment with the neurologist for you. In the meantime, try to stay active and focused on tasks you enjoy. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
