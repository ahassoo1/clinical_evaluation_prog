DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I am Dr. EADDY. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit… complicated. A friend suggested I come. She said… something about getting ready… before… well, before trying for a baby. I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. It was a lot of information. I just know I want to be… prepared. Is that right?
DOCTOR: “Prepared,” alright. Well, that is… sensible, I suppose. Though quite vague. So, you are considering starting a family, and your friend recommended a check-up?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A check-up… to make sure everything is okay. I’m… not the youngest anymore, you see. And I want to do this right, if… if it happens. I don't even know what kind of check-up this is, really. She just said “preconception” something or other. Does that make sense? Is that what you do here?
DOCTOR: “Preconception,” yes, that's correct. It’s a general health assessment for individuals planning to conceive. It's… fairly standard. We assess your overall health, review your medical history, and identify any potential risks that could impact a pregnancy. Though, frankly, at your age, Mr. Verrall, there are bound to be some risks. Now, let’s begin with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… right. Medical history. Hmm. Let me think… it’s been a long time. I had… a bad knee years ago, playing football. Does that count? And… I think I had a bit of the flu a couple of times. Nothing serious, though. I don’t… I don’t think I’ve ever been told I had anything… chronic. No, not that I remember. I’ve always been… pretty healthy, I guess. Except for the knee. It aches sometimes. But that’s just old age, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: The knee is noted. It's not typically a concern in preconception counseling, but we'll address it if it causes you significant discomfort. Let's move on. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Now that’s a good question. Let me see… Oh! Yes. Years and years ago. When I was a young man, I had my… my tonsils out. And… I think I had something done on my knee, a long time after the football injury. Just a small thing, I think. They… cleaned something up, maybe? I really don't recall the details. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t paying much attention. Does that help? Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and a knee procedure… alright. And, Mr. Verrall, I'm going to ask a rather sensitive question. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That’s… a bit personal, isn’t it? I… I haven’t really… been with anyone for a very long time. Not recently. Years. Decades, even. So… no. Not that I know of. I mean, when I was younger… well, that was a long time ago. Things were different then. I didn’t really… worry about things like that. I’m sorry, that’s probably not a very helpful answer. It’s just… hard to remember. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Verrall. Regardless of how long ago, a history of STIs can impact fertility and pregnancy. But if you haven’t been sexually active recently, that mitigates the risk. We can always perform a screening if you prefer, just to be certain. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… right. My father… he had a bad heart. He died young, actually. Heart attack, I think. And… my mother, she had… arthritis, I believe. Badly in her hands. And… my sister, she had… something with her blood pressure, I think. High blood pressure. Nothing else comes to mind, really. We weren’t a very close family, you see. Didn’t talk much about… health things. Mostly just… got on with it. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. It's all a bit… hazy. Is that enough? Do you need names? I don’t… I don’t really remember much about their doctors.
DOCTOR: Alright. Father with heart disease, mother with arthritis, sister with hypertension. That's… something. Now, Mr. Verrall, I need to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no. Never smoked in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit. And I’ve always tried to keep healthy, you see. As much as I can, anyway. Even though my knee aches. And I get a bit forgetful. But no, definitely no smoking. Never touched it. I do enjoy a… a glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. But just one. Not a heavy drinker, at all. Is that okay? Does that matter?
DOCTOR: One glass of wine occasionally is… acceptable. Let’s move on. What about your occupation?
PATIENT: Oh, right. My job. I'm a… Sales Engineer. I travel around, helping companies with… well, with technical things. I explain how things work, make sure they're using the right equipment. It’s… mostly talking, really. And a lot of driving. I’ve been doing it for… a long time now. Nearly forty years. I’m thinking about retiring soon, actually. It’s getting a bit… tiring. All the traveling. But I haven’t made up my mind yet. Is that what you needed to know? Is that important for… this?
DOCTOR: It's… relevant, Mr. Verrall. The travel, the potential stress… We’ll note it. Now, just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think… Just for my knee, sometimes. When it really aches. I take… Ibuprofen, I think? The regular kind. Nothing special. And… occasionally, I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor recommended it, a few years ago. Said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. That’s it, really. Nothing else. Just the Ibuprofen and the vitamin D. Is that all? Are we nearly done? I’m getting a bit… tired now. And my memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. Ibuprofen as needed for your knee pain and a vitamin D supplement. Now, before we proceed, I must inform you that given your age and vague recollection of medical history, a thorough physical examination is necessary. We need to assess your overall health, including your cardiovascular function, blood pressure, and musculoskeletal system. Are you amenable to a physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam… oh. Well… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I haven’t had one in… years, probably. Decades. I’m not… thrilled about it, to be honest. But if it’s important for… this, then I’ll do it. Just… please be gentle with my knee. It aches, you see. And… try not to surprise me. My memory isn’t good, and I get a bit… flustered easily. Is that alright? What will it involve?
DOCTOR: Very well. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, examining your abdomen, and assessing your reflexes. I will be careful with your knee, as you requested. Please lie back on the examination table, and we will begin with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, Mr. Verrall, but not critically high. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please breathe deeply. Your heart sounds are… unremarkable, but there is a slight wheezing in your lungs. This could be due to a number of factors, including age or a previous respiratory infection. Now, I need to examine your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back, and let me know if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay… alright. I’m lying flat now. My knee’s a bit uncomfortable. And… it’s cold in here. I always get cold easily. What are you listening for? Is something wrong? I get a bit… anxious when I don’t know what’s happening. Is my heart okay? It hasn’t bothered me recently, but my father… well, he had a bad heart, you see. Just tell me if everything is alright. Please. And… please be gentle. My stomach… it’s a bit sensitive sometimes. I had a bit of trouble with it a few years ago. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. Is everything alright so far?
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is… soft, but there is slight tenderness in the lower quadrants. Nothing overtly concerning at this time. It could be due to gas or a previous digestive issue, as you mentioned. Now, I need to check your reflexes. Please extend your legs. Your reflexes are… slightly diminished, which is common at your age. However, they are symmetrical, which is reassuring. Now, just a few more observations… I notice some slight swelling in your ankles. Do you experience this frequently?
PATIENT: Swelling in my ankles… hmm. Now that you mention it… yes, a little bit. Especially at the end of the day. I just thought it was… old age. I spend a lot of time on my feet, you see, with my job. Traveling and… showing people things. It’s probably just my feet getting tired. Is… is everything alright, Doctor? You seem… concerned. Is there something wrong with my heart? Or my lungs? Or my stomach? I’m getting a bit anxious now. Please just tell me straight. Don’t beat around the bush. I’d rather know, even if it’s bad news. I’m not… I’m not a young man anymore, you see. I’ve lived a long life. Just… tell me the truth. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, your examination reveals several areas of concern that require further investigation. Your blood pressure is elevated, there is slight wheezing in your lungs, diminished reflexes, and swelling in your ankles. Coupled with your age and the vague nature of your medical history, these findings necessitate a series of tests to rule out any underlying cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurological issues. I am ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an electrocardiogram to assess your heart function, and a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. We will also need a urine analysis to check your kidney function. I understand this is concerning, but it is crucial to have a clear understanding of your health status before proceeding. I am not prepared to offer a definitive diagnosis at this time, as we need the results of these tests. I will schedule you for a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend that you limit your salt intake, engage in moderate exercise as tolerated, and avoid strenuous activity. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Tests… lots of tests. And… a treatment plan? That sounds… serious. So, you do think something is wrong? I… I don't understand all those words. Complete blood count… metabolic panel… ECG… What do they do? And what if… what if the results are bad? I just wanted to be prepared for… for trying for a baby. I didn’t want to… I didn’t want anything to be wrong. Now… now it sounds like everything is wrong. What are the chances… what are the chances that I… that I can’t do this? Can I even have a baby, with all this wrong with me? Please… just tell me straight. I need to know. I need to know if this is… possible. Is it even worth doing all these tests?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, I understand your anxiety. It is natural to feel overwhelmed in this situation. Let me explain the tests in simpler terms. A complete blood count checks for any abnormalities in your blood cells. A comprehensive metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte balance. An electrocardiogram records the electrical activity of your heart to detect any irregularities. And a chest X-ray provides an image of your lungs to identify any underlying respiratory issues. Regarding your question about having a baby… It is too early to say definitively. These tests will provide valuable information about your overall health and help me determine if you are medically fit to proceed with conception. The results will guide our decision-making process and allow me to assess the potential risks and benefits involved. It is important to emphasize that these tests do not necessarily mean you cannot have a baby. They are simply a precautionary measure to ensure your safety and the health of the potential child. I understand your concerns about the worth of doing these tests. However, I believe it is essential to have a clear understanding of your health status before making any decisions. If the results reveal any underlying medical conditions, we can explore appropriate treatment options to mitigate the risks and improve your chances of a successful pregnancy. I will schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend that you limit your stress, maintain a healthy lifestyle, and avoid making any major decisions until we have a clearer understanding of your health status. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Stress… how can I not be stressed? This is… a lot. I just wanted… a family. Treatment options… what kind of treatment? Will it be… painful? Will it be expensive? I don’t… I don’t have insurance, you see. It’s… complicated. And… if the tests are bad… what then? Will I… will I be able to have any treatment at all? Or… is it too late? I'm sixty-six years old, you see. I'm not getting any younger. Just… be honest with me, Doctor. Please. Tell me the truth, even if it’s bad news. I need to know. I need to know if there’s any hope at all. Is there any hope?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, I understand your concerns. It is natural to feel overwhelmed and anxious in this situation. Let me address your questions as honestly as possible. Regarding treatment options, the nature of treatment will depend entirely on the results of the tests. If we identify any underlying medical conditions, the treatment options may range from lifestyle modifications and medication to more invasive procedures. The cost of treatment will also vary depending on the nature of the condition and the chosen treatment plan. Given your lack of insurance, we can explore options for financial assistance or discuss lower-cost alternatives. I can connect you with a social worker who can assist you with navigating these resources. Regarding your question about hope… It is too early to say definitively. The tests will provide valuable information about your overall health and help me determine if you are medically fit to proceed with conception. Even if the tests reveal underlying medical conditions, it does not necessarily mean that you will be unable to have a baby. There are many treatment options available, and we can explore them together to determine the best course of action. However, I must be honest with you. Your age is a significant factor, and there are inherent risks associated with conceiving at your age. The risks include an increased risk of miscarriage, genetic abnormalities, and other complications. We will discuss these risks in detail once we have the results of the tests. For now, I recommend that you focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoid making any major decisions until we have a clearer understanding of your health status. I will schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I will connect you with a social worker who can assist you with navigating financial assistance options. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: A social worker… financial assistance… It’s… humiliating. I just wanted a family. I didn't want… this. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that's enough for now. I need… time to process everything. I'll… I'll see you next week. Hope… I hope.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist on your way out.
