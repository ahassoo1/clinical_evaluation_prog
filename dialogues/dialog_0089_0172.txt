DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s just… a formality, I suppose. My husband insisted. We just moved here, you see, and he wants me to establish care. I’m perfectly fine, thank you very much. I’ve not been sick a day in my life, not really. Though… my memory isn’t what it used to be. But that’s just age, isn’t it? I don’t expect you to do much.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear you've been so healthy! Establishing care with a new move is always a good idea, even when feeling well. And you're right, memory changes can be a normal part of aging. Still, it's good we're talking about it. Just to be thorough, and since you're new to the clinic, let's go through a little bit of your medical history. I see here you’re 79 years old, and your height and weight are noted as 196 and 145, correct?
PATIENT: Goodness. Are you quite sure about those numbers? I seem to recall them being… rather different. But if that’s what’s written down, I suppose it’s written down. I haven’t measured myself in decades. And really, does it matter? I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. I’ve always been… robust. Now, is there anything else? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to question it! Those numbers do seem a bit off. My apologies - sometimes information gets entered incorrectly during transfer. We can definitely update those. It absolutely matters to have accurate records, but let’s not dwell on it right now. Let's start with this: have you been seeing any other doctors regularly, or been hospitalized for anything in the past few years?
PATIENT: Other doctors? Heavens, no. I manage perfectly well on my own, thank you. Hospitalized? Certainly not. I’ve always avoided doctors, if I’m being honest. They poke and prod and… well, it’s simply unnecessary. My husband, bless his heart, is always fretting, and he took me to the specialist for my… my knees, a few years back. But that was just a preventative measure, and I didn’t even need anything done. Honestly, it was a waste of time. Is that sufficient? I truly don’t recall much else.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Just to clarify, you saw a specialist for your knees a few years ago, but nothing was ultimately done?
PATIENT: That’s correct. He wanted to… scope them, I believe he said. Something about cartilage. But I told him no. Absolutely not. I’ve always been able to manage the discomfort myself. A little liniment, a bit of rest… it works wonders. I simply don’t see the point in subjecting myself to unnecessary procedures. Honestly, the thought of it gives me the shivers. Now, are we quite finished? I have a luncheon engagement, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. So, no surgery or ongoing treatment for your knees. Now, thinking more broadly, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, herbal supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, my husband gives me something for my… my water retention, I believe. A small white pill. And I take a multivitamin, of course. Everyone takes a multivitamin, don’t they? And sometimes, if I’m feeling particularly… unsettled, I’ll take a bit of chamomile tea. Does that count? Honestly, I can’t recall the name of the water pill. He handles all of that. It’s much easier that way. I really don’t bother with such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for water retention, a multivitamin, and chamomile tea as needed. That’s good to know. Now, I like to ask a few questions about how you’ve been feeling generally. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, weight, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’m rather particular about my appetite. I eat very well, thank you. Always have. As for weight… well, I’ve always been… substantial. And energy levels? I tire easily, naturally. One does, at my age. It’s not as if I’m running marathons, you know. I enjoy a quiet life, mostly reading and… social engagements. I haven’t noticed anything drastically different, if that’s what you’re asking. Is this truly necessary? I feel perfectly fine, despite what my husband may tell you. He always exaggerates.
DOCTOR: I understand. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, sometimes memory problems can be caused by things other than just age. Have you been experiencing any difficulty with your memory specifically – forgetting recent events, repeating questions, getting lost, or having trouble finding the right words?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you implying something? I’ve already told you my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s simply age, as I said before. I occasionally misplace my spectacles, and sometimes I… struggle to recall names. But who doesn’t? It’s perfectly normal. I’m not senile, if that’s what you’re suggesting. My husband worries excessively, and he probably filled your head with all sorts of nonsense. I assure you, I’m perfectly capable of managing my affairs. Now, is there anything else, or may I be on my way? I have a reputation to uphold, you know.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all! I assure you, I’m not implying anything. You’re perfectly right; some memory lapses are perfectly normal with age. I’m just asking questions to get a complete picture, as I mentioned. And I apologize if my questions are causing any distress. Alright. Let’s move on then. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve never had an allergy in my life. I eat everything in moderation, of course. I’m not one for… fads or restrictions. I occasionally get a bit of indigestion, but that’s simply from enjoying a good meal. And as for medications, I barely take anything, as we’ve already established. Honestly, I’m rather robust, as I said before. Is that sufficient? I truly must be going now. I have a luncheon with the ladies, and I wouldn’t want to be late. They’re rather… particular about punctuality. Now, may I have a pass?
DOCTOR: Certainly. It sounds like you're generally in good health, and that's wonderful. Just to be on the safe side, and since you're new to the clinic, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a quick neurological assessment to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? After all this questioning? Honestly, Doctor, I find that rather… intrusive. I’ve already told you I’m perfectly fine. I do not appreciate being poked and prodded. I came here simply to fulfill my husband’s demands, and I’ve answered your questions to the best of my ability. I fail to see the necessity of a physical exam. I think I’ve wasted quite enough of my time already. No, thank you. I shall take my leave now. And please, don’t bother contacting my husband. I’ll handle everything myself.
DOCTOR: Very well, Candice. I respect your decision. I will document our conversation and your preference against a physical exam. If you experience any changes in your health, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a pleasant day, and enjoy your luncheon.
