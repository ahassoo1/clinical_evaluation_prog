DOCTOR: Hi Jamill, welcome to the clinic. It's good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Georgiou. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a rather… unusual sensation in my back. It’s a popping, or clicking, sound and feeling. It doesn’t hurt, not exactly, but it’s definitely noticeable and a little concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sensation in your back for the past few weeks. Not painful, just noticeable and concerning. That's good information to start with. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about where exactly in your back you're feeling this?
PATIENT: Certainly. It seems to be centered in my lower back, just above my tailbone, really. Sometimes I feel it a little higher up, maybe around where my kidneys are, but the main sensation is definitely in that lower region. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly where, but it’s not in my upper back at all, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Lower back, centered above your tailbone, sometimes radiating slightly higher, but definitely not upper back. Okay. And when does this popping or clicking happen?
PATIENT: It’s… well, it seems to occur most often when I’m moving, really. Bending over, twisting, even just getting out of a chair. It also happens sometimes if I've been sitting for a long period and then stand up. I do a fair bit of lifting at work, installing and repairing electrical systems in various vehicles, so I initially thought it might be related to that, but it happens even on days when the lifting isn't particularly heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's associated with movement – bending, twisting, standing up after sitting. You mentioned some lifting at work, but it happens even on lighter days. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, or anything that seems to relieve it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… stretching seems to help a little, momentarily, at least. Just a gentle stretch, nothing too strenuous. But it always comes back. What makes it worse… prolonged sitting, definitely. And if I try to ignore it and push through the discomfort, it seems to become more frequent and… pronounced, I suppose. It doesn’t cause pain, but the sensation itself is more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, stretching provides some temporary relief, prolonged sitting makes it worse, and trying to push through it increases the frequency and noticeability. Good to know. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with this clicking?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, as I’ve said. No numbness or tingling in my legs or feet. No weakness. No fever, no weight loss… nothing else that I’ve been able to identify. It’s truly just this popping sensation. It’s more… bothersome than anything, honestly. It just feels… off. I’m usually quite active and I like to stay on top of things, and this is making me a little anxious, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no numbness, no weakness, no systemic symptoms. Just the bothersome popping sensation causing some anxiety. I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any previous back problems, injuries, or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No previous back problems at all, thankfully. No injuries to my back that I recall - I’ve been quite careful over the years. And no surgeries of any kind, actually. I’ve always been relatively healthy, to be honest. Just the usual childhood illnesses when I was younger, but nothing serious. My wife sometimes jokes that I’m too stubborn to get sick, but… that’s another story. I do see a cardiologist regularly, just as a preventative measure, due to a family history of heart disease, but that's been stable for years.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous back problems, injuries, or surgeries. You see a cardiologist preventatively due to family history, which is good. That's helpful information. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose statin for cholesterol, prescribed by the cardiologist. And occasionally an over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache, if needed, but that’s infrequent. Otherwise, I don’t take any other medications regularly. I try to maintain a healthy diet and get plenty of exercise, so I generally avoid needing anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, statin for cholesterol and occasional over-the-counter pain relievers. That’s good to know. Alright, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of, Doctor. Never had any reactions to any medications or foods. My wife is the one with the allergies, so we’re very careful about checking labels, but I haven’t had any issues myself. No environmental allergies either, like pollen or dust.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My father was a smoker and I saw the effect it had on him, so I made a conscious decision to stay away from it. I do enjoy the occasional glass of wine with dinner, but I wouldn’t consider myself a heavy drinker.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And what about your typical work day?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned, I’m an electrical and electronics installer and repairer, primarily working on transportation equipment – cars, trucks, buses… I spend a lot of time bending, reaching, twisting, lifting… climbing in and out of vehicles. It can be physically demanding, and I'm often in awkward positions. I try to take breaks when I can, and I’m careful about lifting techniques, but it’s not always easy. I usually work about 40-45 hours a week, and I’m on my feet for most of the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, physically demanding work, bending, reaching, lifting, climbing, on your feet for most of the day. That gives me a better picture. Alright, Jamill. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like this clicking sensation is likely related to some mechanical issue in your lower back. It could be a muscle strain, a ligament sprain, or even a minor joint issue. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, go ahead. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, if you could lie down on your stomach on the examination table for me, that would be great. I’m going to start by palpating your lower back, feeling for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort as I do this. Okay... a little tenderness here on the right side, near the spine. Not significant, but noticeable. Muscles feel a little tight, but no obvious spasms. Now, I’m going to ask you to gently bend forward, backward, and twist to each side. Just go as far as you comfortably can. Again, let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Alright, I'm ready. Okay, bending forward feels a little stiff, not painful. Backward is okay. Twisting to the right feels a bit more restricted than the left, but still no sharp pain. I do feel a slight… popping sensation when I twist to the right, the same one I’ve been describing. It’s not bad, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight stiffness bending forward, restricted range of motion twisting to the right with the same popping sensation. Noted. Your posture looks fairly normal, no obvious scoliosis or other abnormalities. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs and feet. This is just to rule out any nerve involvement. Okay, reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Now, can you tell me if you feel any sensation here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. And yes, I feel that as well. Everything feels normal there, no numbness or tingling.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensation is intact. Alright, Jamill. Based on the physical exam, it appears that you have some muscle tightness and restricted range of motion in your lower back, particularly on the right side. The popping sensation is likely related to some minor joint irritation or muscle imbalances. There is no evidence of nerve involvement. This sounds like a fairly common musculoskeletal issue, often seen in people who do a lot of physical work. It’s unlikely to be anything serious. However, we should rule out other possibilities, just to be safe. I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back to check for any underlying structural problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. An X-ray seems like a good idea, just to rule things out. I appreciate your thoroughness. I'd be happy to go ahead with that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’ve sent the order to the radiology department. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend some conservative measures to help alleviate your symptoms. These include: Rest: Avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms. Ice: Apply ice to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Heat: After the initial inflammation has subsided, you can try applying heat to your lower back. Over-the-counter pain relievers: You can take ibuprofen or naproxen to help reduce pain and inflammation. Gentle stretching: Start with some gentle stretches to help improve your range of motion. I can show you some examples before you leave. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds very sensible. Rest, ice, heat, over-the-counter medication, and gentle stretching. I can certainly manage that. Yes, actually, I do have one question. You mentioned stretching. Should I avoid any particular types of stretches, or movements, while I'm waiting for the X-ray results? I don’t want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. While we’re waiting for the X-ray results, I recommend avoiding any stretches or movements that cause sharp pain. Gentle stretching is fine, but stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. Specifically, avoid any twisting motions or bending backward excessively. Focus on gentle forward flexion and side bends. These types of stretches are generally safe, but listen to your body and don’t push yourself too hard. If you’re unsure, it’s always best to err on the side of caution. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough and have put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I'll schedule the X-ray and follow your recommendations. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jamill. I’m glad I could help. Just remember to listen to your body and don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen or if you have any concerns. Get well soon. And please feel free to reach out if you have any questions after the X-ray results come in.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you, Doctor Georgiou. Thank you again for your kindness and expertise. I will certainly do that. Have a good day.
