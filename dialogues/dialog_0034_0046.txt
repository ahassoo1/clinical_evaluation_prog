DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. I understand. And when you say “a little while now,” could you tell me roughly how long that is?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I believe, around the middle of June, so about six weeks, perhaps a little more. It comes and goes, but it’s definitely been consistent enough that I wanted to have it looked at. I can recall the exact date because it was shortly after my cousin’s birthday party.
DOCTOR: Alright, six weeks, starting around mid-June. That’s helpful. And could you describe the pressure for me?
PATIENT: It's not painful, exactly. More… a fullness, like I constantly need to use the restroom, even when I don’t. It’s uncomfortable, and it distracts me. Sometimes it feels like a heaviness, too, low in my abdomen. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A fullness, a constant urge, and a heaviness low in your abdomen. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, or how often you're going?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I have noticed I’m going more frequently, especially at night. I usually don't wake up, but lately I’ve had to get up once or twice. The color seems normal, I think, but… perhaps the odor is a little stronger than usual? It’s hard to say, honestly. I don’t pay close attention to that unless something seems obviously wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency, particularly at night, and a potentially stronger odor. Thank you for that information. Now, have you experienced any pain with urination, any blood in your urine, or fever, chills, or nausea?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No pain when I urinate, no blood, no fever, no chills, and I haven’t been nauseous at all. Just the pressure and the increased frequency. I am glad it hasn’t been anything more than that.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Let's move on to some other questions, then. Do you have any history of urinary tract infections, kidney stones, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I've never had a urinary tract infection, and no kidney stones either. My doctor has always said my checkups look good. I do have slightly high blood pressure, which is managed with medication, but that’s it. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily. Oh, and I'm married, if that’s relevant. My husband is very supportive.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information. Lisinopril for blood pressure – good to know. And yes, sometimes marital status can be relevant to overall health and support systems. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. I had a normal childhood, a pretty straightforward pregnancy and delivery with my son ten years ago, and haven’t had any major medical issues since. I’ve been very fortunate, truly.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother had diabetes, type 2, and my father had heart disease. My younger brother is currently being monitored for high cholesterol. Beyond that, nothing too significant that I’m aware of. Both of my parents are deceased now, unfortunately. But I do remember them mentioning some arthritis in the family on my mother’s side.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'm a graphic designer, so I spend a lot of time sitting at a computer. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. I do enjoy walking when the weather is nice, but admittedly, I don’t get as much exercise as I should. I live with my husband, and our son is in school most of the day. We are both very active in our church community.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marialena. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. No known allergies at all. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can take most medications without issue, and I'm not sensitive to any particular foods. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'll also do a quick neurological exam. Then, I'd like to check a urine sample. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A physical exam and a urine sample – whatever you think is best. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just lie back comfortably, and try to relax. Deep breaths are helpful. Okay. Your bowel sounds are normal. I'm not feeling any tenderness or masses in your abdomen. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes briefly. Your reflexes are normal as well. Everything seems normal so far. Now, let's collect that urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and instructions. Please try to collect a midstream sample – that means start urinating, and then collect the sample a few seconds into it. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I do not. A midstream sample, I understand. Start and then collect a few seconds in. That sounds straightforward enough. Where would you like me to leave the sample when I’m finished?
DOCTOR: Perfect. There's a small disposable container on the counter next to the sink. Once you've collected the sample, please place it in there, and I'll come back to retrieve it when you're finished. I’ll give you a few moments of privacy. Please let me know if you need anything.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, I'll send this sample to the lab for a urinalysis. That will help us check for infection, blood, and other abnormalities. It usually takes about 20-30 minutes to get the results back. In the meantime, based on what you've told me and my preliminary exam, a few things could be going on. It could be a simple urinary tract infection, even though you don’t have a fever or severe pain. It could also be overactive bladder, or interstitial cystitis – a chronic bladder inflammation. Less likely, but we need to rule it out, is a kidney issue. So, we’ll wait for the lab results, and then we'll discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
