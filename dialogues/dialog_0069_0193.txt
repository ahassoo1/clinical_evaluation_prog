DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Well, um… it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. But I have… a lot of gas. More than usual. It’s been happening for, oh, I would say maybe two weeks now. It’s… uncomfortable, to put it mildly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Goodstein, no need to be embarrassed at all. These things happen. It's good you came in to get it checked out. So, it’s been about two weeks of increased gas. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks, give or take a day. Um… it’s not constant, not exactly. It comes and goes. After I eat, mostly. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Soup, sandwich, even just a piece of fruit… it seems to trigger it. And it’s… loud, Doctor. Very loud. I live alone, thankfully. It’s also… the smell is not pleasant, I must admit.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loud and unpleasant odor – that definitely adds to the discomfort. And it sounds like it’s pretty consistently happening after meals, regardless of what you’re eating. That’s helpful to know. Has anything changed in your diet recently, even something small?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. No, not really. I eat pretty much the same things I always have. I do buy… a new brand of bread, maybe a month ago? It’s a whole wheat, from the bakery down the street. But I’ve been eating bread for years, of course. Nothing else… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t started any new… supplements, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, the new bread is something to keep in mind. Sometimes even a slight change in ingredients can cause digestive upset. Now, aside from the gas and odor, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, no… stomach ache. Not feeling sick to my stomach, or anything like that. Just… the gas. And, um… a little bit of bloating, maybe. But it’s not severe. It just feels… full, after I eat. But that’s not new, honestly. I've always felt a bit full after a meal, especially if it's a large one.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no pain, nausea, or other major digestive issues, just increased gas, odor, and some mild bloating after eating. That’s good information. Let's move on to a bit more of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have Medicare, so… I have some things, I suppose. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out, oh, about ten years ago. And I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it's controlled with… a small pill. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major. Oh, and I had a bad knee when I was younger, but it doesn't bother me much anymore. Mostly just aches a bit in cold weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, and controlled high blood pressure. And knee pain that's mostly weather-related. Thank you. What about any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. Never had a reaction to any food, or… medication, or anything like that. I don’t even get hay fever, and I spend a lot of time outside.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, aside from the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one pill for the blood pressure, Doctor. It's… amlodipine, I think it's called. A small white pill. I take it every morning. And sometimes, if my knee is really bothering me, I take some… ibuprofen. But not very often. Maybe once a month, or less.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine daily for blood pressure and occasional ibuprofen for knee pain. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. Never have. And I very rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a year, if that. I mostly drink water, or… tea. I prefer tea. It’s… chamomile, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very minimal alcohol, and you prefer tea, often chamomile. That's helpful. And just one last quick question for now: How would you describe your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Well, um… regular, I suppose. Usually one time a day. Not… difficult. Not too hard, not too soft. Normal. I haven’t noticed any… changes, recently. Everything is… passing as it should, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Regular, one bowel movement a day, and no changes recently. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Goodstein. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen, and then I'll gently press on it to see if anything feels tender. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I… I hope you don't hear anything strange.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm listening now… sounds are present in all quadrants, which is good. I'm gently pressing here... any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little bit… uncomfortable, but not painful. It feels… normal, I suppose. Maybe a little bit gassy, if you press hard enough. But that’s probably just… me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No significant tenderness noted, and I'm not feeling any masses. Your abdomen is soft, but I can feel some… bloating, as you mentioned. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, it's likely this is related to something you're eating, or perhaps a mild functional digestive issue. The new bread could be a contributing factor. However, to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a simple blood test to check your basic inflammation levels, and a stool test to check for any infections or malabsorption issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. I am happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. Blood test and stool test, yes. I… I would like to know if there is something wrong, if there is something wrong.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Goodstein. It’s best to be thorough. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab right away. They’ll contact you to schedule the tests. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a food diary for the next week, noting everything you eat and drink, and when your symptoms occur. Also, you might try temporarily eliminating the new bread from your diet to see if that makes a difference. And try to avoid any known gas-producing foods, like beans, broccoli, and carbonated drinks. We’ll discuss the results once they are back, and then we can decide on a course of action. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a very good plan, Doctor. I will keep a food diary, and I will stop eating the bread. No more new bread. Thank you for your time, and for… not laughing at me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. And absolutely no need to be embarrassed. These things happen, and I'm here to help. I’ll also send a note to the lab requesting they prioritize the results, just in case. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and… kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. I will follow your instructions, and I will… await the results. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. We’re here for you. Have a good day, and I’ll see you again when your results are back.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. .
