DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… good to meet you as well, Doctor. It's… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been feeling… unsteady. Like I might fall over. It's been happening for a little while now, I think. Honestly, the dates are a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: “A bit fuzzy,” alright. Well, we'll try to pin that down. When you say unsteady, can you describe that more?
PATIENT: It’s not… dizziness, exactly. More like… my feet don’t quite feel connected, if that makes sense? Like they’re not… firmly on the ground. And sometimes, just walking… I wobble. It's rather embarrassing, actually. I work… well, I did work with machinery, so it’s concerning. It hasn't happened at work recently, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Machinery, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Rotary drills… for oil and gas. It… it was good work. Physical, but good. I was a… a fairly skilled operator, I believe. My husband… he always said so. Though, it's been a while since I’ve been able to… actually do it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has it been since you were actively working with the machinery?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a difficult question. I… it was after… after Thomas passed. A little while after, certainly. Perhaps… six months? Maybe eight? It all feels rather… blended together, if I’m honest. It wasn’t immediately after, because I… I needed time. But it wasn't long, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: And when you say “passed”, are we talking about a recent loss?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. It… it was last year. In… November, I believe. It was… unexpected. A heart condition. He was a strong man, my Thomas. A builder. It still feels very raw, truthfully. I… I haven't really gotten used to it. Excuse me a moment.
DOCTOR: Right. So, unsteady gait started around… six to eight months ago, following your husband’s passing. Let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. Though, I do feel… tired a lot. But that could just be… everything, I suppose. Vision… no, I don't think so. No changes that I've noticed, at least. And ringing… hmm. Sometimes, I think I hear a faint ringing, but I always assumed it was just the… city noise. It’s quite loud where I live. I wouldn't say it's constant.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and intermittent tinnitus. Alright. Any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. Sometimes. Mostly in my feet, I think. It’s not… severe. More like… a pins and needles feeling. It comes and goes. More noticeable when I’ve been sitting for a long time. It doesn’t happen often enough for me to really think much about it, until now. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Everything is important, Lilyanna. It helps build a complete picture. Tell me, have you noticed any weakness in your legs or arms?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Not… outright weakness, no. But sometimes, my legs feel… heavy. Like they take more effort to move. Especially at the end of the day. I used to be able to walk for miles, but now… not so much. And climbing stairs… that’s become quite a challenge. It’s probably just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Getting old” at 23 is unlikely, Lilyanna. Let’s not dismiss things so quickly. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, infections, or injuries?
PATIENT: Illnesses… not really. A cold, perhaps, earlier this year. A minor one. Nothing serious. No infections that I’m aware of. And no injuries… except for a few scrapes and bruises from… well, from around the house. Nothing significant. Though, I did fall a couple of weeks ago. Just tripped over a rug. Didn’t think much of it at the time. Just a bit shaken up. Is that… related, do you think?
DOCTOR: Tripped over a rug, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. In the kitchen. It was… rather silly, actually. Just a small rug. I lost my balance and… fell. Didn’t hit my head, thankfully. Just bruised my arm and… my pride, mostly. I didn’t think it was important enough to mention. It happens, doesn't it? Should I have?
DOCTOR: Lilyanna, everything is relevant. A fall, especially with your recent symptoms of unsteadiness and now pins and needles, is absolutely relevant. Have you had any imaging done – MRI, CT scan – related to this fall, or any prior falls?
PATIENT: No. No imaging. I didn’t go to the hospital. I… I didn’t want to bother them. It seemed… silly. Just a small fall. I’m insured, of course, but… I don't like going to doctors unless it's absolutely necessary. My husband… he always said I worried too much. So, no, no scans. Just… a bruised arm. And a lot of embarrassment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk past medical history. Any known conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid issues, anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My husband, Thomas… he had high blood pressure. But I… I don’t think I do. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything. I have private insurance, so I've had regular check-ups, but everything was always… fine. The doctors always said I was perfectly healthy. No thyroid issues, no diabetes… nothing. Though, my mother… she had something with her nerves, I think. But I don't really remember the details. It was a long time ago. And I was quite young.
DOCTOR: And family history beyond your mother?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father was… a builder, like my husband. Healthy, as far as I know. No major illnesses. He passed away when I was young, unfortunately. My mother… she had a sister, I believe. But I didn’t know her very well. We didn’t… keep in touch. As for illnesses… I don’t recall anyone having anything serious. Heart problems, maybe? But it was a long time ago. I'm afraid my memory isn't very good. Is it important for me to remember specific details? I feel terrible about not being able to recall more.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful. Now, tell me about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, goodness, no! Never. My husband… he didn’t approve of smoking. He said it was terrible for your health. I… I never had the inclination, myself. No, absolutely not. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: Occasionally. Alright. What about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Well, as I said, a glass of wine with dinner. Maybe two, if it's a special occasion. I don't drink every day, certainly. Perhaps… three or four times a week? It helps me relax. Though, not lately. I haven’t been feeling very sociable since… well, you know. It's difficult to enjoy things when… when you're feeling unwell. And… lonely.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s get to current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, not really. Just some vitamins, occasionally. A multivitamin, mostly. And sometimes, I take something for… for sleep. Just a herbal remedy, though. Melatonin, I think it's called. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. And no allergies that I’m aware of. I can eat anything. No reactions to anything. Is that… unusual?
DOCTOR: No, that's not unusual. Alright Lilyanna, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Though… be warned. I’m a little… wobbly. It's why I came, you know. I hope I don't fall.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just stand still for me. Let's start with your gait. Walk for me, please, a few steps forward, and then a few steps back. I’m just observing your balance and coordination. Noticeable wide-based gait, slight swaying. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please sit back down.
PATIENT: There… that was… rather difficult, actually. I felt like I was going to fall. And my legs… they feel very heavy now. Is it… bad? I hope it's not something serious.
DOCTOR: Reflexes 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen soft, non-tender, no masses. Now, let's do a quick neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I… I think so. It's a little… hard to focus, actually. Everything feels a bit… blurry. But I’m trying to follow it. Is it… okay? I hope I’m not doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: I’m seeing some slight nystagmus. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes… like this? It’s… a little hard. My hands feel… weak, I think. I hope that’s not… a bad sign. I used to be able to grip much stronger. I worked with machinery, you know. I needed a strong grip.
DOCTOR: Grip strength significantly reduced bilaterally. Okay Lilyanna, I’m going to need to order some labs and imaging. I want to get a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a Vitamin B12 level, and a thyroid panel. I also want an MRI of the brain and a CT scan of the cervical spine. I want to rule out any underlying neurological issues. Given your symptoms – unsteadiness, weakness, pins and needles, the fall – I am also referring you to a neurologist. It's important to get a professional evaluation.
PATIENT: Labs… and imaging… and a neurologist? Is it… serious? Is something… terribly wrong? I just… I thought it was just… getting older. Or… the grief. What do you think is wrong? What could it be?
DOCTOR: Lilyanna, it’s too early to say definitively what's going on. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. We need to rule out several things, including vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis or a stroke. Your symptoms could be explained by a number of things. The fall is concerning, and we need to make sure there's no underlying structural damage. I know this is a lot to take in, but we’re going to get to the bottom of this. I'm going to schedule these tests for you as soon as possible. And I'll refer you to a neurologist who specializes in these types of conditions. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity and be very careful with your balance. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Multiple sclerosis… and a stroke? Oh, dear. I… I don’t understand. I just feel so… weak and unsteady. And scared. What… what will happen if it is something serious? Will I… will I be able to walk again? Will I… need someone to take care of me? I live alone. I don’t have anyone… since Thomas.
DOCTOR: Lilyanna, please try not to panic. We haven’t even diagnosed anything yet. It's important to remember that these are just possibilities. And even if it is something serious, there are treatments available for many neurological conditions. Many people live full and productive lives even with these diagnoses. We'll take things one step at a time. First, we'll get the test results. Then, we'll meet with the neurologist, and they'll be able to give you a more accurate assessment and discuss treatment options. And regarding your living situation… we can explore resources available to help you. There are support groups, home healthcare services, and other organizations that can provide assistance if you need it. I can connect you with a social worker who can help you navigate these options. Right now, let’s focus on getting these tests scheduled. Do you have any immediate concerns or questions about the testing process?
PATIENT: The testing… I don't know. What kind of tests are they? Will they be… painful? Will I have to stay overnight? And… what if something shows up? What if it’s… really bad? I’m just… so scared of finding out. And I don’t have anyone to… to help me through this. I just want to feel normal again. I want to be able to walk without falling. I want to… live my life.
DOCTOR: Lilyanna, it's perfectly normal to feel scared and overwhelmed. Let's talk about the tests. The MRI of the brain is a painless procedure. You'll lie down on a table, and a strong magnet will create images of your brain. It’s loud, but we can provide you with earplugs. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes. The CT scan of the cervical spine is also painless, and it uses X-rays to create images of your neck. It takes just a few minutes. You won’t need to stay overnight for either test. As for what if something shows up… that's why we're doing the tests. If we find anything, we'll discuss it with you thoroughly and develop a treatment plan. There are many options available, and we'll work together to find the best one for you. And you're not alone. I’m here to help you through this, and I can connect you with resources for support, like a social worker and support groups. Right now, let’s focus on scheduling these tests. I'll have my nurse give you the paperwork and instructions. Do you have any questions about the paperwork or the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No… I think… I think I understand. But… I’m still very scared. If it turns out to be… something serious… will I still be able to… work? I know it sounds silly, but… I need to work. I need to… to feel useful. And… to pay my bills. I don't have any family to help me.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Lilyanna. It's perfectly understandable that you're worried about your job and your finances. Whether you'll be able to continue working will depend on the diagnosis and the severity of your symptoms. Some conditions may allow you to continue working with accommodations, while others may require you to take time off or explore other options. If it turns out to be something serious, we'll explore all available resources to help you, including disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation, and financial assistance programs. I can connect you with a social worker who specializes in these areas. They can help you navigate the paperwork and understand your options. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests scheduled and meeting with the neurologist. We'll take things one step at a time. I'm going to have my nurse come in and give you the paperwork for the tests and schedule your appointments. Do you have any immediate concerns or questions about the appointments themselves?
PATIENT: No… I think… I just want to get it over with. Please just… hurry. I can’t… I can’t keep feeling like this. Just… please just help me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna. I understand. My nurse will be right in. She’ll go over everything with you and get the appointments scheduled. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. You are not alone in this, and we will do everything we can to help you. I’ll leave you with her now. Take a deep breath, and remember that we’re here for you. .
PATIENT: .
