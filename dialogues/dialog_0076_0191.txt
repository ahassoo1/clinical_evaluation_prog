DOCTOR: Right. Tierney Shaub, 64 years old. Look, I have a very full schedule today, so let's get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Ruocco. Thank you for seeing me. I… well, I requested an HIV test. I wanted to get checked, just to be sure, you understand. It’s better to know, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: An HIV test. Right. Well, that’s… sensible, I suppose. Though at your age, frankly, it's a bit unusual to be concerned about this. Still. Let's not dwell. Have you… engaged in any risky behaviors?
PATIENT: Risky behaviors? Doctor, with all due respect, what exactly does that mean? I’ve been married for forty years. My husband and I… well, we’ve been together a long time. Is that what you’re asking? I just… I read something, and it worried me, and I thought it was best to be cautious. It doesn’t mean anything is happening, you understand.
DOCTOR: Forty years. Hmm. Alright. Still, it's… prudent to rule things out. Though, frankly, the chances… But fine. Have you ever had a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: A blood transfusion? No, never. Not once. I've been quite healthy, all my life, really. Just the usual things, a cold here and there. Nothing serious. I certainly haven't needed a transfusion. Is that… is that something that would give me this… this concern? I apologize, I’m not very knowledgeable about these things.
DOCTOR: Look, let's not get bogged down in details. It's just a standard question. Any… recreational drug use?
PATIENT: Recreational drug use? Doctor, I assure you, absolutely not. I haven't touched a recreational drug in my life. I find that quite offensive, actually. I am a respectable woman, and a churchgoer. I don't appreciate being asked such things. Are these questions… standard for everyone?
DOCTOR: Standard procedure. Look, it's just to cover all bases. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take something for my blood pressure – amlodipine, I believe it's called. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it last winter. That’s all, really. Just those two things. Nothing else at all. Is that… important? Is it something that might affect the… test?
DOCTOR: Amlodipine… vitamin D. Fine. Allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not to anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, food or otherwise. No hay fever, no skin sensitivities, nothing at all. My husband always jokes that I could eat anything and be fine. He says I have a cast-iron stomach. Though that doesn’t really matter, does it? For this test, I mean.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't really matter. Alright. Let's just get this over with. I'll need to draw some blood. Follow me.
PATIENT: Right. Blood work, then. Will it be painful? I don’t particularly like needles, you see. And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: It's a pinprick, really. Hardly noticeable. And results… usually a week, give or take. We'll call if anything's… concerning. Now, sit here.
PATIENT: A week… That seems a long time to wait. Is there anything I should be doing, or avoiding, while I wait? Or… is there anything you should know? Anything at all? I'm trying to think if there’s anything I’ve forgotten to mention. It’s just… I want to be sure we have everything right.
DOCTOR: Look, you've told me you're married, healthy, no allergies, on amlodipine and vitamin D. You haven’t had transfusions, don’t use recreational drugs. What else could there possibly be?
PATIENT: Well… My husband… he travels. For work. Quite a bit, actually. To… to Nigeria, sometimes. He has business there. And… well, sometimes he returns with… gifts. Small things. And I suppose, it’s been a few years now, but… once, he brought back a… a traditional carving. It was beautiful, but… it was quite old. A bit rough, you understand. We’ve since given it away, but… I read somewhere that… some things can carry… things. I don’t know. It probably sounds foolish. But it’s been on my mind. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Nigeria, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. He has a partner there, a Nigerian businessman. He goes to Lagos frequently. It was a gift from this… this associate. A beautiful ebony carving, but… afterwards, I did read something about… risks. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but it's been nagging at me lately. I apologize for bothering you with such trivial details. It’s probably nothing, really. But I wanted to be thorough. Perhaps I am being overly cautious. It just… I want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Look, your husband's… business dealings are of limited medical relevance. But... given the travel history, and the… carving… We'll need to run a full panel. Not just HIV. This will take longer. And it will be more expensive. Are you prepared for that?
PATIENT: More expensive? How much more? I… I hadn’t budgeted for this. I’m retired, you see. And… my husband and I, we live on a fixed income. Is it absolutely necessary? Could we… perhaps just do the HIV test for now? If you think it’s unlikely… I just… I don’t want to cause a financial burden. What kind of panel are you talking about? What would it test for, exactly? I need to understand.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm a doctor, not a financial advisor. But given the circumstances—travel to a high-risk region, potential exposure to…unsterile items—a comprehensive screening is prudent. We’ll test for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and a few other tropical diseases common in Nigeria. It's about being thorough. It will be… several hundred dollars. Take it or leave it. Honestly, I have other patients.
PATIENT: Several hundred dollars… That… that is a considerable amount of money. I… I hadn’t anticipated this at all. Is there any way to… to negotiate? Or perhaps a payment plan? I understand you have other patients, Doctor, but… this is a significant financial strain. My husband wouldn’t be pleased. Is it absolutely essential to test for everything? Could we perhaps start with the Hepatitis tests and… and revisit the others later, if necessary? I truly appreciate your expertise, but… this is a difficult situation. Please, could we explore some options?
DOCTOR: Look, I’m not running a charity. The full panel is the safest course of action. If you want to gamble with your health to save a few dollars, that's your prerogative. But I won’t compromise my standard of care. Either you agree to the full screening, or we stick to the HIV test. I have other patients waiting. Make a decision.
PATIENT: … Alright. The full panel, then. If that’s what you recommend… and if it’s the safest thing to do… then yes. The full panel. But… could you perhaps explain the cost breakdown? Just so I understand… and can explain it to my husband. And… is there anything I should be doing while we wait for the results? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Fine. The blood work will be $350, covers all the necessary tests. No, there's nothing you need to do. Just… try not to worry. The lab will contact you with the results in about two weeks. Next patient.
PATIENT: Two weeks… Thank you, Doctor Ruocco. .
