DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Seil. Is good to meet you as well. Well, I been feelin’ a little… off lately. I drinkin’ a lot more water than usual, and I always hungry. No matter how much I eat, I still feel empty, you know? It worryin’ me a bit.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling unusually thirsty and hungry, even after eating, is certainly something we should look into. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It start maybe… two, three months ago? Slowly, you know? At first, I just thought I was gettin’ older, needin’ more water in the heat. But it gettin’ worse. And the hunger… always there now. Even after a big plate of food, I feel like I need more. Is strange, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three months ago, gradually worsening thirst and hunger. That's helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your weight during this time – either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: Well now… that’s a good question. I don’t weigh myself regular, you know? But my clothes feel a little looser, maybe? Not much, but… a little. I not sure if is just the heat making me sweat more, or what. I really haven’t been payin’ close attention, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. Okay, so potentially some unintentional weight loss. Have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? You mean… peeing? Yes, I been goin’ to the bathroom a lot more often. Especially at night! Wakin’ up two, three times to pee. Is botherin’ my husband, poor man. He sayin’ I keep him up all night. Is not comfortable, you know? Always feelin’ like I have to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency of urination, especially at night. That's important information. And just to clarify, is there any pain or burning when you urinate, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burnin’ at all. And no, no blood. Just… more of it. Is clear, you know? Just a lot more frequent than usual. Is not uncomfortable, just… inconvenient. And I have to get up so many times at night! Is really tire me out.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, no blood, just increased frequency and volume. Have you experienced any other symptoms – perhaps increased fatigue, blurred vision, or any skin changes like increased thirst or dryness?
PATIENT: Fatigue… yes, I been feelin’ more tired lately, yes. Always feelin’ sluggish, even after a good night sleep. And my vision… hmm… maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I have always needed glasses. Is not much worse, I don’t think. Skin… no, I don’t think so. Maybe a little dry, with the heat, but nothin’ major. Is just the tiredness and the thirst and hunger really botherin’ me, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and some blurry vision in addition to the increased thirst, hunger, and frequent urination. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been diagnosed with nothin’. I been healthy all my life, mostly. I get a little achy sometimes, like any old woman, but nothin’ serious. My husband, he had high blood pressure for a while, but I never had it. I go to the doctor for check-ups when I have to, but they always tell me I'm fine. Just the usual aches and pains, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Not one. I been lucky like that, I suppose. Always try to stay healthy, avoid riskin’ too much. My mother always say prevention is better than cure, you know? So I try to take care of myself. I never needed a surgery before, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. Well, my mother, she had… something with her sugar. Not sure exactly what, but she had to watch what she eat. She always drinkin’ a lot of water, like me now. And my father, he had problems with his heart, but that was later in life. My brother, he healthy as a horse, and my sister, she have arthritis, but that’s about it. Not much serious illness in the family, really. Is hard to remember everything now, you know? Old age… it makes you forget things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of sugar problems in your mother and heart problems in your father. That's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take nothin’ regular. Just sometimes I take a little paracetamol for my aches and pains, but that’s it. Nothin’ every day. I try to avoid medication as much as possible. I believe in natural remedies, you know? A little ginger tea, a little rest… that usually do the trick. No pills or nothin’ like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any allergies. Never been allergic to nothin’ in my life. I eat everything, I touch everything… never had a reaction. I lucky like that, I suppose. My husband, he allergic to dust, but I not. I can handle anything, really. No allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Not a drop. And definitely no… recreational drugs. I’m a church woman, you know? I live a clean life. Always have. I believe in takin’ care of my body and my soul. So no, no bad habits at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Excellent. Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Zicarelli. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just tell me what you want me to do. I want to get to the bottom of this, you know? Been worryin’ me for a while now.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I’ll do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 145/90. Pulse is 88 and regular.
PATIENT: 145 over 90? Is that bad, Doctor? My husband’s blood pressure always high, I always tell him he need to watch it. Is mine high too? What does that mean?
DOCTOR: It's a little elevated, Ms. Zicarelli, yes. Ideally, we like to see blood pressure below 140/90. It doesn't necessarily mean there's something drastically wrong, but it's something we need to monitor and potentially address. We'll get a better picture as we continue the exam and, if necessary, run some tests. Ears are clear bilaterally. Nasal passages are clear. Throat is normal in appearance. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, you know? Is just… tiring, feelin’ this way all the time. And worryin’ about what it could be. Go ahead, Doctor. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetrical. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation is intact. Alright, Ms. Zicarelli, everything appears neurologically intact. Based on your symptoms – increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and unexplained weight loss – coupled with your slightly elevated blood pressure, I’m concerned about the possibility of diabetes. It's important to rule that out. We'll also want to investigate your blood pressure further. I'd like to order some blood work, including a fasting blood glucose test, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. A urine analysis would be helpful as well. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Diabetes? My mother… she had somethin’ with her sugar, you said? Is that what you think I have? Blood work… yes, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just… I don’t want to have diabetes. Is that serious? What does it mean if I have it? And… how much will all this cost? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Zicarelli. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet. The blood work will give us a clearer picture. Many things can cause similar symptoms, and we need to rule out other possibilities before making any diagnosis. Diabetes is a serious condition, but it’s also very manageable with proper treatment, which can include lifestyle changes and medication. It's important to catch it early, and that’s what we’re doing now. Regarding the cost, I understand you don’t have insurance. Let me check with the lab to see if they offer any assistance programs or a discounted rate for patients without coverage. I’ll also see if there are any local resources that can help cover the cost of testing. I’ll have my staff look into that for you. I want to ensure you get the care you need without any undue financial burden. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a home blood glucose monitor. This will allow you to check your blood sugar levels a few times a day, and we can review the results at our next appointment. Would you like me to explain how to use it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. Explain how to use it. I’ve never used one before. And thank you… thank you for checkin’ about the cost. It worryin’ me a lot. I just… I want to feel normal again. Is tiring feelin’ this way all the time. And worryin’ about what it could be. So, check my sugar at home… and then come back to see you? How long will it take to get the results from the lab?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. This monitor is quite simple to use. You'll need a small lancet to prick your finger, and a test strip that you insert into the monitor. The monitor will then display your blood sugar level. I’ll have my nurse demonstrate the proper technique before you leave, and we’ll make sure you feel comfortable using it. You’ll want to check your blood sugar first thing in the morning, before you eat or drink anything. And then again two hours after each meal. Keep a record of your readings, and bring it with you to our next appointment. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and create a plan of action. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, eat a balanced diet, and get some regular exercise. It’s important to take care of yourself during this time. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. My staff is available to help. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all for now. You explain everything very clearly. Thank you… thank you for bein’ so kind. I just hope… I just hope it’s nothin’ too serious. I’ll try to stay hydrated and eat right. And I’ll practice using the sugar machine. Thank you again, Doctor Seil. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Zicarelli. It was my pleasure to meet you. Remember, we’ll get to the bottom of this together. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will come in shortly to demonstrate the use of the blood glucose monitor and schedule your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you next week.
