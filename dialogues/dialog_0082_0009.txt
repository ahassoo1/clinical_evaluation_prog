DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. A pleasure, I suppose. It’s about my vision. It's... deteriorating. Frankly, it’s quite inconvenient, and I’d like to get it sorted. I’ve noticed things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, and it’s been steadily worsening for… well, a while now. I don’t particularly enjoy having to ask people to repeat themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, deteriorating vision... and it's been gradual, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. Not a sudden thing, thankfully. I’m not one for dramatic incidents, if you understand. It's just... a slow blurring. And honestly, it’s likely stress. I handle a great deal at work. People are… inefficient, you see. It requires a lot of oversight. Though, I suppose you’re the doctor. Perhaps it isn't stress.
DOCTOR: Well, stress can certainly play a role in many things, Mr. Alcorta. But it’s best we rule out anything else first. You mentioned a blurring… is that in both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I believe. Though, it's... harder to pinpoint exactly. I don’t make a habit of staring at my eyes, naturally. It’s rather undignified, don’t you think? It's more of a general... haziness. Like looking through a slightly dirty window. And the colors don't seem as... vibrant. It's subtle, but I notice it. I have a good eye for detail, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyes, a general haziness, and colors appearing less vibrant. Right. And has this affected your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Affected them? Heavily, Doctor, heavily. Driving at night is... less enjoyable. I’ve been avoiding it, if I’m honest. And reading the fine print on reports? Utterly impossible without straining. It’s rather frustrating. I pride myself on being thorough, and having to ask a colleague to read things for me is... demeaning. Frankly, it's a waste of everyone's time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Night driving difficulties and trouble with small print. Do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: I do, Doctor. I have had them for... oh, must be twenty years now. The current prescription… I believe it’s from LensCrafters. Though, I confess, I don't recall the specifics. I go every year or so for an update, but frankly, they all seem the same to me. They correct my distance vision, perfectly well. It’s this… other thing, this haziness, that's the issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, you have a current prescription for distance vision, and this is a new development. Alright. To get a better understanding, I'd like to do a quick eye exam. Just a standard check of your visual acuity, peripheral vision, and a look at the back of your eyes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An exam? Yes, I suppose. As long as it doesn't involve anything… unpleasant. I’m not particularly fond of having things poked and prodded, if you understand. And please, no flashing lights. Those give me a headache. A quick exam is fine, Doctor. But I do have a rather important meeting this afternoon, so I would appreciate it if you could be efficient.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. Nothing unpleasant, I assure you. No poking or prodding, and we'll avoid any flashing lights. We’ll keep it quick and efficient. Let's start with reading the eye chart, if you don't mind. Just tell me what you see on each line.
PATIENT: Very well. An eye chart. Honestly, this seems rather… rudimentary, doesn’t it? Still. Let’s get this over with. I believe that first line is… E. F. P. And… is that a Z? It's rather blurry, you see. I’m not at all confident in this assessment.
DOCTOR: Alright, E, F, P, and Z. Good. Now the next line, please. Don't strain if it's difficult. Just tell me what you think you see.
PATIENT: This is... exceptionally difficult. I believe… L? And… V. Perhaps a T? No, it's… it’s all rather indistinct, Doctor. I'm really not enjoying this. Honestly, I suspect my glasses simply need adjusting. This is a waste of valuable time. I have reports to review, you know. Important reports.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. It does seem like your current prescription isn't quite sufficient. Let's move on to checking your peripheral vision. I'm going to ask you to focus on this point here and tell me when you see something in your side vision.
PATIENT: Peripheral vision. Very well. Tell me when I should see something. This feels… imprecise. I prefer concrete tasks, you see. Numbers, reports, clear directives. Not… shadowy shapes in my periphery. Proceed, if you must. But do try to be quick about it. I have a meeting at three. A very important meeting.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm going to hold up fingers in your peripheral vision, one at a time, and you tell me when you see them. Just tell me the number of fingers. We’ll start on your right side.
PATIENT: One… no, wait. Perhaps two? It’s… indistinct. Are you certain those fingers are visible? This feels rather subjective, Doctor. Honestly, I suspect the lighting in here is suboptimal. Is it possible the room is simply too dim? Two, I believe. But I cannot guarantee the accuracy of my assessment. This is… unsettling. I have a very important meeting, you realize. And I require my full faculties to attend it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Thank you for your patience. Based on this brief exam, it seems there's some loss of peripheral vision and difficulty with your visual acuity. This warrants a more thorough investigation. I'd like to schedule you for a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist. They have specialized equipment to determine the underlying cause of these issues. It could be a number of things, and it’s best to get a proper diagnosis. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An ophthalmologist? Is that absolutely necessary, Doctor? I assure you, I’m a busy man. And frankly, the thought of additional appointments… it’s rather inconvenient. Couldn't we simply adjust my glasses? Or perhaps recommend a different optometrist? I fail to see the need for such drastic measures. And what is this "underlying cause" you speak of? It sounds… ominous. I have a very important meeting, you realize. It involves… sensitive matters. I require clear vision for that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your concerns and your busy schedule. However, based on what I’ve seen today, simply adjusting your glasses isn't likely to resolve the issue. The loss of peripheral vision is concerning, and it could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition. It could be something as simple as glaucoma, but it’s crucial to rule out other possibilities. Delaying a proper diagnosis could potentially lead to permanent vision loss. I don't want to alarm you, but it's best to be proactive. This pamphlet explains some of the common causes of vision loss. I strongly recommend scheduling an appointment with an ophthalmologist as soon as possible. I can provide you with a referral to a highly respected specialist in the area. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Glaucoma… Honestly, Doctor, this is most unsettling. I’m not one for dwelling on… morbid possibilities. And frankly, the thought of specialists… Very well. A referral, I suppose. Though I hold you personally responsible if this specialist proves to be a waste of my valuable time. I have a meeting, you realize. A very important meeting. And my reputation is at stake. Ensure this specialist has a prompt appointment schedule. And preferably, a comfortable waiting room. I will not tolerate excessive delays or… unsavory reading material. Proceed with the referral, Doctor. But I must reiterate: I expect efficiency and discretion. And, naturally, a full explanation of any… associated costs. I do not appreciate surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I will provide you with a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance. She's highly regarded and has a reputation for being very efficient. I will also ensure that his assistant provides you with information on scheduling and associated costs. I also recommend avoiding any strenuous activities until you’ve been evaluated by Dr. Vance. And if you experience any sudden changes in your vision, such as double vision or severe eye pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers it. Although, I must confess, I remain skeptical. This entire experience has been… disruptive. And frankly, I have reports to review. Important reports. Very well. I suppose I shall contact this Dr. Vance. But I reiterate: efficiency and discretion are paramount. And do ensure his assistant is thoroughly briefed on my schedule. I have a meeting, you realize. A very important meeting. Good day, Doctor. .
