DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarrotta. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about getting a card… for driving, you know? A commercial one. I need it for the ride-share work I do. It’s a bit of a hassle, all the paperwork, but it has to be done. I want to make sure I’m legal.
DOCTOR: A commercial driver's license… for ride-sharing. Right. So, this isn't a medical problem exactly, but a medical requirement for the license. I see. Well, Medicare does cover certain aspects of these examinations. Let's start with a thorough history. Have you experienced any changes in your vision, hearing, or neurological function recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… vision… no, not really. I wear glasses, have for years, and the prescription hasn’t changed. Hearing… maybe a little bit slower to hear quiet sounds, but nothing major. My daughter always tells me I don’t listen, but that's just her! Neurological… what does that even mean? Do you mean like… thinking? I feel pretty sharp for my age, if I do say so myself. I remember everything! Everything.
DOCTOR: “Feels sharp” is…subjective, Ms. Sciarrotta. We need to be a bit more precise. Let’s clarify. Have you experienced any dizziness, headaches, numbness or tingling in your extremities, weakness on one side of your body, or any difficulty with balance or coordination?
PATIENT: No dizziness, no. And no headaches, thankfully. I had terrible migraines when I was younger, but those haven’t bothered me in decades. Numbness… no, not really. Sometimes my hands get cold, especially in the winter, but that’s just the weather. Weakness… no. I still do a lot of work, you know? Logging equipment isn’t easy. Balance… well, I’m not a gymnast, but I haven’t fallen down lately! Coordination… I can still make a good cup of tea, does that count?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarrotta, while I appreciate your…colorful descriptions, we need to focus on potential neurological issues that could impact your ability to drive safely. Have you had any changes in your memory, concentration, or ability to make quick decisions?
PATIENT: Oh! Now I understand. You're worried about driving. Yes, yes, of course. I do remember everything, Doctor, as I said. Concentration… well, sometimes I get distracted by birds, but who doesn’t? Quick decisions… I’ve had to make a lot of those operating the machinery, believe me. It’s not a job for the faint of heart. I haven’t forgotten how to operate a vehicle, and I haven't gotten lost yet!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sciarrotta. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Let me see… high blood pressure, yes, a few years back. But it’s been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. The doctor checks it regularly. Diabetes? No, never. Heart disease… my father had some trouble with that, but I seem to have dodged that bullet. Stroke? No, thankfully. I had a bad flu once, a really bad one, but that was years ago. I’m generally quite healthy, for my age. I work hard, and I eat my vegetables. Mostly.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, Ms. Sciarrotta?
PATIENT: Just one, for the blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. But not every day, just when I need it. I don't like taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, Doctor, and survived! I haven't had any bad reactions to any medication either. My daughter always worries about that, but I'm very careful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I'll need to check your vision, hearing, reflexes, and neurological function. It's standard procedure for a commercial driver's license. Please follow my instructions carefully. We'll start with your vision. Could you please read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, yes, the chart. E… F… P… T… Oh, goodness, these are small! Is this a trick? I told you I wear glasses!
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarrotta, you are wearing your glasses, are you not?
PATIENT: Yes, of course I am! Do you think I'm a fool? Let me see… F… P… T… V… Oh, this is difficult. It’s a bit blurry, even with my glasses. Perhaps we could move a little closer?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please read the letters on this line. And please, try to focus.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. B… V… F… P… T… Oh, I think that’s a… R? No, maybe a P… It's hard to tell! They all look a bit smudged.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarrotta, with your current visual acuity, you do not meet the minimum requirements for a commercial driver’s license. It appears your prescription may need to be updated. I recommend you schedule an appointment with an optometrist as soon as possible. We can proceed with the rest of the examination, but I suspect the outcome will be similar.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… not good, is it? I haven’t updated my prescription in years. I just assumed my glasses were still good enough. So, you’re saying I can’t get the card? Without new glasses?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Ms. Sciarrotta, that is correct. The Department of Transportation has specific vision requirements for commercial drivers. Without meeting those standards, you will not be eligible for the license. It’s a matter of public safety. I can provide you with a list of reputable optometrists in the area. We can reschedule this examination once you have an updated prescription. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. This is a real inconvenience. Well, I suppose I have no choice. Yes, please, a list of optometrists would be helpful. And… thank you, Doctor. Even though it’s not the news I wanted to hear. I guess I’ll have to call my daughter and ask her to help me with this. She’s always telling me I need to get things checked.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have my assistant provide you with that list before you leave. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Sciarrotta?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just the list, please. I appreciate your time, Doctor. And… thank you again. It seems getting older is more trouble than it’s worth.
DOCTOR: That will be all for today, Ms. Sciarrotta. Please do schedule that appointment with the optometrist as soon as possible. And drive safely, with your current glasses, until you are able to get an updated prescription. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I will. Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. Ride-sharing… honestly. It's more trouble than it's worth.
