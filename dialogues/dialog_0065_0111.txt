DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the slightest idea why my wife insisted I come. Something about my…complexion, she said. I feel perfectly fine, all things considered. Just a bit tired, perhaps. Old age, you know. It comes for us all. Let’s just get this over with, shall we? I have important matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: "Right. Well, while you feel fine, your wife clearly has some concern. It’s good she’s attentive. We should always investigate concerns, even if they seem minor to the patient. Now, this 'complexion' issue...can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: It’s…darker, I suppose. My skin. Always had a good tan, of course. Spent my life in the sun, building things. But it’s…deeper now. Not unhealthy, just…different. And I fatigue more easily. Though that could be the weather. It's been dreadfully humid, hasn't it? Really, Doctor, I doubt it’s anything serious. My wife worries over nothing.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a change in skin pigmentation and increased fatigue. Has this change in skin color been gradual, or did it appear suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I presume. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to such trivial details. It wasn't yesterday that I noticed it, if that's what you’re asking. It’s been…some time. Weeks, perhaps? Months? Really, Doctor, I have a business to run. I don't have time for these long interrogations.
DOCTOR: "It's important to establish a timeline, Mr. Drahota. Even vague details can be helpful. Has there been any itching, pain, or bleeding associated with the changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Itching? Absolutely not. Pain? Don’t be absurd. Bleeding? Good heavens, no! This isn’t some…some dreadful disease, Doctor. It’s just a bit of color. A tan that’s… deepened. I work with iron and rebar, I get dirty. It’s hardly a medical emergency. Are we quite finished here? I have men waiting.
DOCTOR: "I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, but we need to rule out potential causes, even if it turns out to be nothing serious. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite…well, my wife cooks, so I eat what she puts in front of me. Can’t say I’ve noticed any significant changes. Weight? I wouldn't know. I haven't stepped on a scale in years. I’m a solid man, always have been. This is all rather pointless, isn’t it? I feel fine, I am fine, and I'm wasting my valuable time here.
DOCTOR: "Alright, Mr. Drahota. Let's proceed with a brief physical exam, just to get a better overview. I'd like to check your skin, your lymph nodes, and listen to your heart and lungs. It’s a standard procedure. And then, perhaps, we can discuss some basic blood work to rule out anything concerning. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? Doctor, really. This is… excessive. I told you, I feel perfectly well. But…very well. Get it over with quickly. I have important matters to attend to. But make it brief. And no poking and prodding unnecessarily. Honestly, I haven't got all day. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll start with your skin. “I’m noting diffuse hyperpigmentation on your arms and face. There are no obvious lesions, ulcerations, or masses. The skin feels warm and dry to the touch. No edema detected. Now, I’ll check your lymph nodes.” “Cervical lymph nodes are palpable, slightly enlarged bilaterally, but non-tender. Axillary and inguinal lymph nodes are normal in size and consistency.”
