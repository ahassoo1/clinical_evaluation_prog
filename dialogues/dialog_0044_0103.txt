DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back… it’s been botherin’ me. Lower back, mostly. Hurts to stand for long, and bendin’ over… oof, forget about it. It’s just… achy, you know? Been goin’ on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Achy” is a good way to describe it. And how long exactly is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… six months? Started slow, just a little stiff after gardenin’. I like to keep busy, you see. But it’s gotten worse steady since then. Not suddenly, just… little by little. I didn’t think much of it at first, figured I just pulled somethin’. But it ain’t goin’ away.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of a gradual onset… that’s helpful. And you mentioned gardening – is that the main thing that makes it worse, or do you notice it with other activities too?
PATIENT: Oh, gardenin’ definitely stirs it up. But even just walkin’ too far, or sittin’ for a long time… like watchin’ the news, you know? It’s there kinda constant, but some things make it sharper. And… well, I fell last winter. Just a little trip on the ice, but I landed hard. Didn’t break nothin’, doctor told me at the time, but maybe… maybe that had somethin’ to do with it?
DOCTOR: That's good information, Mr. Vankampen. The fall is definitely something we need to consider. Did you see records from that visit?
PATIENT: I did, yes. Let me see… Here it is. From City General. Doctor Ramirez saw me. Just said it was a bruise, told me to ice it and take it easy. No X-rays or nothin’. Just… bruise. He didn’t say much about my back botherin’ me later, though. Just the fall.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright. And aside from the back pain, are you experiencing any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingly feelings. And my legs feel strong enough. I still walk my dog every mornin’, you see. Old Buster needs his exercise! I can climb the stairs, but… sometimes they bother me a bit, you know? Not weak, just… a little achy, like the back. It’s hard to explain. It's just… general discomfort, really. Not like a sharp, sudden pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no radiating pain down your legs, no weakness, and the discomfort is more of a generalized ache. That's all very useful information. Now, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And I… well, I might have lost a little weight. But I ain’t been eatin’ much lately. Not because I'm sick, just… things haven't been appetizin', you know? Lost my wife a few years back, and… cookin’ for one ain’t the same. Just grab somethin’ easy, mostly. Nothing fancy. So maybe a little weight loss, but not intentional, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Vankampen. Losing your appetite after such a significant loss is completely understandable. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your range of motion, reflexes, and feeling along your spine. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s goin’ on with my back. It's startin’ to slow me down, and I don’t like that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's start with your range of motion. Can you try to touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Oof. Not very far, Doctor. It tightens up somethin’ awful. Like a… a rubber band pullin’ tight. I can get this far, but it’s not comfortable. I used to be a lot more flexible, you know. Old age… it catches up to ya.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. Okay, and does this feel tender anywhere specifically?
PATIENT: Ouch. Right there, Doctor. That’s… sensitive. Not like a sharp pain, but… a dull ache. And a little bit on this side too. It’s been achin’ there for a while now, even when I'm just sittin’ quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes appear normal on both sides. And I don’t detect any significant weakness in your legs. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have a muscle strain or a facet joint issue in your lower back. The fall could have contributed to it, even if it didn’t cause a fracture.
PATIENT: A muscle strain… that sounds about right, I guess. I do feel stiff and achy. But what’s a facet… a facet joint? Is that serious, Doctor? And… what does that mean for me? Can you fix it? I just want to be able to garden again without feelin’ like an old man.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Mr. Vankampen. Facet joints are small joints located on the back of your spine, and they help with movement and stability. They can become inflamed or irritated, leading to pain and stiffness. It's not typically serious, but it can be quite uncomfortable. As for fixing it, we'll start with conservative treatment. That means things like physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers, and possibly some muscle relaxants. We'll also discuss proper body mechanics to help prevent future injuries. I'd like to order some X-rays just to rule out any other underlying issues, like arthritis or a more significant fracture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-rays… yes, that sounds sensible. Better safe than sorry, right? I ain’t afraid of a little X-ray. And physical therapy… I suppose I can try that. Been a long time since I did any exercise, but… I’m willing to give it a shot. What about the muscle relaxants? Do those make you drowsy? I like to keep my wits about me, you see. I need to be able to remember things!
DOCTOR: That's a good point about needing to stay alert, Mr. Vankampen. Some muscle relaxants can cause drowsiness, but we can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. There are also different types, and we can choose one that’s less likely to cause those side effects. Let me write up the order for the X-rays, and I’ll give you a prescription for a mild muscle relaxant. I'll also give you a referral to a physical therapist. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the X-ray results and how you’re responding to the treatment. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good, Doctor. A plan is good. I like knowin’ what’s comin’ next. X-rays, therapy, a little somethin’ for the muscles… Alright. Thank you, Doctor Asami. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit. And one more thing… is it alright if I just ask… how much will all this cost? I'm… not insured, you see. It’s a bit of a worry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vankampen. That’s a very important question. Being uninsured can certainly add to the stress. Let me be upfront with you. The X-rays will likely be around \$150 - \$200. Physical therapy sessions typically cost between \$75 - \$125 per visit, and you’ll probably need several. The muscle relaxant is relatively inexpensive, around \$20 - \$30 for a month’s supply. We do have a financial assistance program, and I can connect you with our billing department to see if you qualify. They can also discuss a payment plan to make it more manageable. I don't want the cost to prevent you from getting the care you need. We’ll figure something out. Here are the prescriptions and the referral. The billing department is just down the hall, room 203. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with an old man’s worries. I appreciate it. Room 203, right. I’ll go talk to them now. And… thank you again. I hope you have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next week. .
