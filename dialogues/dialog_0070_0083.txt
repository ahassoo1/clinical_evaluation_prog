DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Abady, you say? A… Spanish name, yes? Well, I am here because… well, my daughter, she thinks I need a little… encouragement. A card, she said. From you. A “get well” card. I am not sick, mind you. Just… low spirits, perhaps. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your daughter is very concerned about your well-being, which is good. It’s always better to be cautious. While you may not feel physically sick, low spirits can certainly be a sign that something is going on. We want to rule out any underlying causes, just to be sure. Perhaps we can explore what’s been going on that’s led to these low spirits. Could you tell me a little more about how you've been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t see what this has to do with a card. I am a practical man. I operate boilers for a living. Big, complicated machines. Not feelings. But… alright. Things… haven’t been the same since the divorce. She, my wife, she… well, she moved on. Quickly. And now, everything just feels… gray. Like a cloudy day that never ends. I still go to work, I still do my job… but the joy is gone, you understand? It’s… tiring. And my daughter keeps fussing. She thinks a card will fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. A divorce is a significant life event, and it's perfectly normal to experience feelings of sadness, loss, and fatigue afterward. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot, and it takes courage to talk about it. It's not unusual for grief and emotional distress to affect your energy levels and overall sense of well-being. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a little more about when these feelings started?
PATIENT: When… well, right after she left, of course. Six months ago now, I suppose. It all happened so fast. One day we were… fine. The next, she was packing. Said she needed “space.” Space! After thirty years… space. It's been… a slow decline, I guess. At first, it was just sadness. Then the sadness turned to… nothing. Like a light switch turned off. I still eat, I still sleep… mostly. But the… spark? Gone. And my daughter… she keeps asking if I’m “okay.” It’s embarrassing, frankly. A grown man, needing a “get well” card…
DOCTOR: It sounds like the divorce was quite sudden and unexpected, and it's understandable that you're still processing the emotional impact of that. Six months is not a long time to adjust to such a major life change. It’s good that your daughter is concerned, even if it feels a little embarrassing. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns, other than what you’ve already mentioned?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I eat… less, perhaps. Not much, but the desire isn’t there. Food tastes… bland. And sleep… comes and goes. Some nights I toss and turn, thinking… about everything. Other nights, I sleep too much. Like I’m trying to escape. But it's not restful sleep, you understand? It’s… empty. And honestly, Doctor, this feels like a waste of time. I came for a card, not a… an interrogation.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. It doesn't feel like a waste of time to me. We’re simply gathering information to rule out any potential underlying causes for how you’re feeling. Sometimes, changes in appetite and sleep can be symptoms of other things, like a vitamin deficiency or thyroid issue, and we want to make sure we’re not missing anything. Besides the changes in appetite and sleep, have you experienced any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I’m not a hypochondriac, Doctor. I operate heavy machinery. I don’t have time for… aches and pains. But… alright. I have been… tired. A lot. Not just from lack of sleep, but… bone tired. Like I’ve been carrying a weight. And… sometimes, I get… irritable. Snap at people for no reason. My coworkers have been giving me strange looks. But that’s it. Really. Just tired and… grumpy. I still go to work, still do my job… I am a professional, you understand?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Kammer. Fatigue and irritability are common symptoms, and it’s good you’re noticing them. It's also helpful to know you’re still able to maintain your work responsibilities. To get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history? What for? I am a healthy man! I rarely go to the doctor. Boiler work keeps a man in shape, you know? But… alright. High blood pressure, maybe ten years ago. They put me on pills for a while. I stopped taking them. Felt better without them. And… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That’s it. Nothing serious. I’m not a sickly man, Doctor. Honestly, this is starting to feel ridiculous. A grown man, recounting his childhood illnesses for a… a card?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer, and I assure you, we’re not trying to waste your time. Knowing about your past medical history helps us understand your current condition and make the best possible recommendations. You mentioned high blood pressure that you stopped taking medication for. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings were at that time, or have you had it checked recently?
PATIENT: Recently? No. Not since… well, not since I stopped the pills. They were… high, I suppose. That’s why they gave me the medication. I don't remember the numbers, Doctor. I don’t concern myself with numbers. I operate boilers! I deal with gauges and pressures, yes, but… my own blood pressure? Not important. I felt fine without the pills, so I stopped taking them. It’s my body, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you were feeling well enough to discontinue the medication at that time. Now, are there any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t believe in pills. They just mask the problem, you understand? I prefer to deal with things myself. A good night’s sleep, a hearty meal… that’s all a man needs. No vitamins, no supplements… just good old-fashioned hard work. That's what keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Dust, maybe, from the boiler room. But that’s just… irritation. Not an allergy. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or close relatives – who have a history of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Mental health conditions? Well… my mother, she… she wasn't always the happiest woman. She worried a lot. Always fretting about something. My aunt, on my father's side, she spent some time in a… home, I believe. But we didn’t talk about it much. It wasn't something you discussed in those days. It’s a… sensitive topic, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you’re not comfortable sharing details. Knowing that there was some history of worry or mental health concerns in the family is helpful. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? What do you mean? I go to work. I come home. I eat dinner. I watch television. I sleep. It’s not a glamorous life, Doctor. But it’s honest work. I don't drink much anymore. Gave it up a few years ago. Didn't like how it made me feel. I don’t smoke. And I don't do… whatever it is young people are doing these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Kammer. That’s very helpful to know. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a baseline and rule out any physical causes for how you’re feeling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? For a… low spirit? Honestly, Doctor. But… alright. If you insist. I suppose it can't hurt. Just get it over with, please. I have things to do, you understand?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. It won’t take long. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please remove your shirt and sit back against the exam table?
PATIENT: This is… undignified. But… alright. Just get it over with, please. And try not to take too long. I don’t like being cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kammer. Deep breaths, please. In… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, although slightly diminished at the bases. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 150/90. That’s a little elevated. Now, let’s take a look at your throat and ears. Open wide, please. And let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: It’s… tight. Always has been. My throat, I mean. And… hurry, please. This is… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Throat appears slightly inflamed, but no obvious signs of infection. Ears look clear. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs?
PATIENT: What are you looking for? I am a perfectly healthy man! I told you this already.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Alright, Mr. Kammer, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on the information you've provided and the results of the exam, your symptoms—fatigue, low spirits, irritability, and elevated blood pressure—could be related to a number of factors. It's possible this is related to stress from the divorce, but we want to rule out other potential causes as well. I recommend we order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level, just to get a baseline. We should also consider an EKG to evaluate your heart health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? Honestly, Doctor. This is getting ridiculous. All this for… feeling a little down? But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… get it over with, please. And can we finally get to the card? That's why I came here in the first place, you understand?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I understand your frustration. We'll get to the card. The blood work and EKG will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to how you're feeling. I'll have the lab technician draw blood now, and then we'll schedule you for an EKG. In the meantime, I also think it might be helpful to discuss some strategies for managing stress and improving your mood. Would you be open to exploring some options, such as counseling or support groups?
PATIENT: Counseling? Support groups? Are you serious? I am a grown man, not a… a child. I don't need to talk about my feelings with strangers. I just want a card. A simple “get well” card. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kammer, that is not too much to ask at all. And I apologize if I've pushed you too far. It's simply that I want to ensure we address all aspects of your well-being. I understand that counseling or support groups may not be the right fit for you. However, I do think it’s important to acknowledge the emotional impact of the divorce. In the meantime, while we await the results of the blood work and EKG, I can prescribe a low-dose antidepressant to help stabilize your mood. It's a temporary measure, and we can always adjust or discontinue it if it's not helpful. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Pills? You want to give me more pills? I stopped taking the blood pressure medication, remember? I don't want to be dependent on anything. I just want a card, Doctor. A simple card. I’m starting to think you don't understand what I came here for. It’s a… a gesture. A sign of encouragement. Not a medical investigation.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mr. Kammer. I apologize. I’ve gotten caught up in the medical aspect of things and lost sight of why you came here. You're not here for a diagnosis; you're here for a gesture of support. And frankly, it’s good that you are assertive about your own preferences and boundaries. You don’t want medication, and you’re entitled to that. Let's forget about the blood work, the EKG, and the medication. I am happy to write you a note explaining your visit and offering encouragement. And, of course, I will gladly write you a “get well” card. Is there anything specific you’d like me to write?
PATIENT: Finally. That’s all I wanted. Just… something simple. Something positive. Tell my daughter… tell her I appreciate her concern. And maybe… maybe write something about… about staying strong. That’s all. Just… “stay strong.” It’s a little cliché, I know, but… it’s enough.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Kammer. It says: "Dear Early, Your father is a strong man who is navigating a difficult time. He appreciates your concern and is working on staying positive. Wishing him all the best. Sincerely, Dr. Abady.” I hope this brings you a little comfort. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: That’s… perfect. Thank you, Doctor. That’s all I needed. And… thank you for listening. Even when I was being… difficult. You’re a good doctor. No, that’s all. I think I’ll go home now. And maybe… maybe watch a baseball game. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, it's alright to ask for support when you need it. And don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, and enjoy the baseball game. .
