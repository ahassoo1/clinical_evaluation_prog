DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’m not sure why I even had to come in. It’s just… my stomach. It’s been awful. Everything I eat goes right through me. And I've tried things. You know, over-the-counter stuff. Didn’t do a thing. It's been going on for… well, too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds very frustrating when things aren’t settling down, and over-the-counter medications aren't helping. “Too long” is a bit vague though – could you give me a rough estimate of how long you've been experiencing these stomach issues?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. About three weeks, maybe? I don’t really keep track of these things. It started after… well, after my husband passed. Everything just feels off, to be honest. But the diarrhea is just…constant. It’s embarrassing even talking about it. And inconvenient. Do you really need me to go into detail?
DOCTOR: No, you don’t need to go into detail if you’re not comfortable. Three weeks is helpful. And I absolutely understand how disruptive and distressing this can be, especially given the circumstances. It's very common for grief to manifest physically, and digestive issues are a frequent symptom. So, aside from the diarrhea, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I’m tired. Really tired. But who isn’t these days? And my appetite is… nonexistent. Which, honestly, is probably a blessing given what happens when I do eat. No weight loss or anything, I don’t think. I haven’t bothered checking. It's not like I'm going anywhere to need to be a certain weight. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Fatigue and loss of appetite are both common with these kinds of issues, and especially in the context of recent loss. It’s good you haven’t noticed unintentional weight loss, that’s helpful to know. Okay. And have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Definitely no blood. That would be… alarming. Pain, sometimes. Just… general discomfort. Like, cramping, yeah. Not sharp, just… annoying. And honestly, I feel nauseous thinking about it. So, probably nausea too, if you want to call it that. Vomiting? No. I haven’t thrown up. I just… run to the bathroom a lot. Is that good enough? I really don’t want to spend all day talking about my… bowels.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Ms. Woodring. You don’t need to go into detail if it’s upsetting. "Running to the bathroom a lot" is perfectly descriptive enough. No blood, some cramping, and nausea – that helps me get a clearer picture. Now, just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who’s been sick?
PATIENT: Travel? No. Not since… well, not since everything happened. I haven’t wanted to travel. And sick people? I avoid them like the plague. I’ve got enough going on without catching something else. Honestly, it's probably just stress. That's what everyone keeps telling me. Can’t we just… get me something to stop it? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. Avoiding illness is always a good idea, and it’s very common for stress to cause digestive upset. It’s good to rule out other causes though. Now, regarding your medical history – do you have any known allergies, and are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat everything. And medications… just some vitamins, occasionally. Nothing regular. And I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off it after… everything. That’s it. Really. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. They just make me feel worse. Is this taking long?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, vitamins occasionally, and previously on blood pressure medication but no longer taking it. That’s good to know. And no, this isn’t taking too long. We're just gathering information to figure out the best approach. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just listening to your abdomen, checking for any tenderness, and feeling your stomach. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have better things to do than sit here getting poked and prodded. But I’m warning you, I bruise easily. Don't go digging around too much. And please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be very gentle. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds – that’s good. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I am noticing some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, on both sides. No guarding or rigidity. Everything else feels normal. Okay, Ms. Woodring. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing a case of irritable bowel syndrome, possibly triggered by the recent stress and grief. However, given the duration and severity of your symptoms, I want to rule out a few other possibilities. I'm going to order a stool sample analysis to check for any infections or parasites.
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? That’s… humiliating. And what if it’s something awful? I already feel awful. Look, can’t you just give me something to stop it? I don’t need a detailed diagnosis, I just need it to stop. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Woodring. It is a bit unpleasant, but the stool sample is a standard test to rule out any other potential causes, like a bacterial infection or parasite, and it will give us peace of mind. It's a quick and simple procedure, and we can provide you with detailed instructions and a collection kit to make it as easy as possible. While we wait for the results, which typically take a few days, I can prescribe you an anti-diarrheal medication to help manage your symptoms. It won't address the underlying cause, but it should provide some relief. I'm also going to recommend a bland diet – things like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast – to help soothe your digestive system. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get me the pills. And a kit. But I’m warning you, if this doesn't work, I’m not coming back. I have other doctors I can see. And honestly, I think you're making a big deal out of nothing. It's just stress. Everyone gets stomach problems when they’re stressed. Can we please just get this over with? I need to go home.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if this feels like a lot. I will write you a prescription for loperamide, an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication. It's generally very effective at controlling symptoms. I'll also print out instructions on how to use it and a list of foods to avoid while your system recovers. Here's the prescription and the instructions. The kit for the stool sample is just outside the door, on the counter. Please read through the instructions carefully before collecting the sample. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week, to discuss the results of the stool sample and see how you're feeling. If your symptoms worsen significantly before then – such as developing a fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I guess. I'll see what happens with the pills. And don’t expect me to be happy if they don’t work. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Woodring. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I sincerely hope the medication provides some relief. .
