DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me? Let me think… it’s my joints, mostly. They get…stuck, I guess, in the mornings. It’s hard to get going, you know? Not painful exactly, just… stiff. It’s been going on for… well, a while now, I suppose. I don’t really keep track of time these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Stuck” is a good way to describe it. And you say this has been going on for a while – would you estimate several weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. Months, I think? Maybe longer. Everything feels… fuzzy these days. My husband… he always remembered things like that. It's been a couple years since he passed, and things just aren’t as clear as they used to be. Sorry, I’m not much help with dates.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilliana. Please don’t apologize at all. It’s completely understandable, and we’ll work through it. So, months, perhaps longer... and would you say this stiffness is worse at any particular time of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: Definitely mornings. The worst! I wake up and… oof. Feels like I haven’t moved in days. It eases up a bit after I get going, you know, after I’ve been walking around for a bit, making breakfast, that sort of thing. But first thing… it’s rough. I don’t really do much anymore, to be honest. Just little things around the house. It doesn’t seem to get worse after doing anything specific.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily a morning stiffness that improves with activity. And it doesn’t seem to be aggravated by any specific movements or tasks. Are the joints affected on both sides of your body, or is it more localized to one side?
PATIENT: Hmm… both sides, I think. My hands are the worst, for sure. And my knees. Both of them. Sometimes my shoulders feel a bit…tight, but not as bad as the hands and knees. It’s hard to tell, honestly. They all feel a bit creaky, you know? Like an old house.
DOCTOR: An old house, yes, I can understand that description perfectly. So, hands, knees, and sometimes shoulders. And the stiffness is present in both sides. Now, aside from the stiffness, have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth in any of those joints?
PATIENT: No, not really. They don’t look different, if that makes sense. No red, no puffiness, nothing like that. Just… stiff. And sometimes a little… achy, I guess, but not really painful. It’s a dull ache, not a sharp pain. It’s just… annoying, mostly. Makes it hard to get things done, you know? Simple things, like opening jars.
DOCTOR: I see. No visible swelling, redness, or warmth, and the sensation is more of a stiffness and a dull ache rather than sharp pain. That’s helpful information. Now, Lilliana, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this joint stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… Not that I’ve noticed, really. I get tired, of course, but I’m always a bit tired. I don’t know if that’s related. No fever, no rashes, nothing else feels different. Just the stiff joints and the tiredness. I eat okay, I think. Nothing fancy, just simple meals. Oh! Sometimes my eyes feel a little dry. Is that something?
DOCTOR: Dry eyes – yes, that could potentially be relevant. Thank you for mentioning that. Now, Lilliana, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My medical history… That’s… a long time ago. I had the usual things, I suppose. Chickenpox when I was a kid. Nothing major. I had a bad flu a couple of years ago, but that's about it. My husband… he took care of all the doctor stuff, you see. I just… went along. I haven't really been to the doctor much in years. I don't have any allergies that I know of. And… I don’t take any medications. Not anymore. It's all a bit fuzzy. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilliana. It's understandable. We’ll take things slowly. So, no known allergies and no current medications. And you haven’t had any significant illnesses or surgeries that you recall?
PATIENT: No, not that I can remember. Nothing major. I think I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. My husband used to say I had a weak constitution, but that was just him teasing. He liked to worry. Honestly, I just… haven't spent much time thinking about my health. Does it matter? I mean, if I don't remember anything, is it important?
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, Lilliana, and you're right to ask. Even if details are fuzzy, understanding your overall background helps us to get a clearer picture of what's going on now. It's not about assigning blame or regret, it's simply about gathering information. It helps us rule out certain possibilities and guide our next steps. Now, thinking about your family – do you know of any relatives who have experienced similar joint problems or any other chronic illnesses, like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That was a long time ago. My mother had bad arthritis in her hands, I remember that. She used to complain about it all the time. She couldn’t knit anymore, which made her very sad. And my aunt… she had something with her bones, I think. But I don’t really remember what it was. It was… complicated. We didn’t talk about it much. My husband's side… I didn't know them very well. He didn't talk about his family either. Sorry, I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Lilliana. You've given me some very helpful information. Your mother having arthritis is particularly relevant. So, a family history of arthritis on your mother’s side. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I live alone now, in the same house I lived in with my husband. It's a bit big for one person, but I don't want to move. I mostly stay inside. I used to enjoy gardening, but it’s hard to get down on my knees now, with the joints. I watch a lot of television. I don't really have many visitors. I eat simple meals, like soup and sandwiches. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. It's a quiet life. A bit lonely, but… peaceful.
DOCTOR: I understand. A quiet life, and mostly staying indoors. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. I’ll need to gently check your joints for swelling, range of motion, and any tenderness. It won’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything causes you pain. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. As long as it doesn't hurt too much. I’m just worried about… well, I don’t want to make a fuss. Do I need to undress?
DOCTOR: No, no need to undress, Lilliana. We can examine your joints through your clothing. We’ll start with your hands. Could you simply extend your arms in front of you, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Is this okay? Are you seeing something? They just feel… stiff, you know? Not necessarily bad, just… tight.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just gently feeling around your knuckles and assessing their range of motion. I do notice some mild stiffness, as you described, and a slightly limited range of movement in several of your joints. There’s no visible swelling or redness, which is good. And I don’t detect any significant pain when I gently move your fingers. Now, let's check your knees. Could you sit on the examination table for me, please, and extend your legs in front of you?
PATIENT: Okay. Oh, that's a bit creaky. They always sound like old doors, you know? Is that bad? I hope I’m not making too much fuss. It’s just… they’re not as good as they used to be.
DOCTOR: That crepitus – the clicking sound – is quite common with joint wear and tear, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. I'm just assessing the joint line and feeling for any tenderness. I do notice some mild stiffness in both knees, as with your hands, and a slightly limited range of motion. There’s no visible swelling or warmth, and I don't detect any significant pain when I gently bend and straighten your legs. Now, let me listen to your knees for any fluid. No fluid detected. Okay.
PATIENT: Okay. That's… good, isn't it? No fluid. I always worry about things… My husband used to say I had an overactive imagination. He was probably right. What does it all mean, Doctor? Am I going to end up in a wheelchair?
DOCTOR: Lilliana, it’s understandable to be worried, and it’s good that you're asking these questions. Based on the examination, your symptoms – the stiffness in your hands and knees, the limited range of motion, and the crepitus – are most consistent with osteoarthritis. It’s a very common condition, often related to wear and tear on the joints over time, and can be aggravated by age and family history, as we've discussed. And to answer your question directly: No, it does not mean you're going to end up in a wheelchair. Osteoarthritis is often manageable with conservative treatments. We'll discuss those options in a moment. Before we do, I’d like to order some simple blood tests – a complete blood count and some inflammatory markers – just to rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… oh dear. I don’t really like needles. But… if it helps, I suppose. Is it a lot of blood? And will it hurt? You said… manageable? What does that mean? What kind of treatments?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be nervous about needles, Lilliana. It’s a very common fear. The blood draw is a small amount – just a few vials – and the phlebotomist is very skilled at minimizing discomfort. It's a quick procedure. And yes, "manageable" means we can work together to alleviate your symptoms and improve your quality of life. The treatments typically involve a combination of things. We can discuss physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your joints, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen if needed, and lifestyle modifications like regular gentle exercise and maintaining a healthy weight. In some cases, we might consider injections to lubricate the joints. We’ll start with the blood tests, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a personalized treatment plan that's right for you. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds better than a wheelchair, anyway. Physical therapy… I don’t know. I haven't really exercised in years. And injections… oh dear. But I suppose I should try, shouldn’t I? It’s just… everything feels so overwhelming. Okay. Blood tests. And then… we’ll talk more. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. I hope they don’t poke me too much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. And please don't worry. We'll take things one step at a time. And I assure you, the phlebotomist is very gentle. Let me write the lab order for you, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. After that, we’ll schedule your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now, before I leave the room?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you for being so patient with me. I know I ramble on and forget things. And thank you for not laughing at me when I asked about the wheelchair. It's just… getting old is scary. .
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Lilliana. You're not rambling at all, and I understand your concerns completely. Getting older is scary sometimes, but we'll face it together. And no, I certainly wasn’t laughing. It’s my job to listen and help you navigate these concerns. I’ll leave the nurse to come in and take care of the blood tests. Please don't hesitate to ask her any questions you might have. And I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Lilliana. .
