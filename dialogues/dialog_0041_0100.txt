DOCTOR: Hi Lytisha, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, I think it's about a test? A drug test, I believe. Someone said I needed one. Honestly, things are a bit fuzzy these days, you know? I don’t really remember all the details of why exactly.
DOCTOR: Right, a drug test. Okay. It’s alright if things are a bit fuzzy, we can definitely sort this out. Sometimes appointments get scheduled and the details… well, they don’t always stick. Just to be clear, do you recall who mentioned needing a drug test?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it was… someone from the insurance? Medicare, maybe? Or possibly… the folks at work? It’s all just a bit of a blur, really. I operate heavy machinery all day, you see, and sometimes my head just… isn't where it needs to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, it could be related to your work, or potentially a request from Medicare. Both are perfectly reasonable reasons for a drug test. Just to cover all bases, and again, don't worry if you don't remember specifics, have you recently started any new medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure, definitely. And… an arthritis thing. It’s yellow, I think. And sometimes I take something for… well, just general aches and pains. Nothing new, though, not recently. I've been on these for a while now. It's hard to keep track, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it is a lot to keep track of. It sounds like you’re managing a few different things. Just to be sure, could you tell me the names of the medications, if you remember them?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Names… that's where it gets tricky. The blood pressure one… I think it's a water pill? Starts with an 'H'? And the arthritis one… Oh, I really wish I wrote these down. It's little and yellow, and I take it with breakfast. And the other one… just a general pain reliever. Nothing fancy. I get them all from the same pharmacy, so they probably have a list.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me see if I can help with this. It looks like you’re currently taking Hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes, that is right! Hydro… whatever that is… and Ibuprofen… and Naproxen. You are a lifesaver, Doctor! I always get them mixed up. See? I knew I wasn't completely losing it.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to get medications mixed up, especially when you're taking a few different ones. That's what I'm here for! Now, back to the drug test. Knowing you’re on Hydrochlorothiazide, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen helps. Are you aware of why Medicare might be requesting a test?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medicare… I think… something about a new program? They sent a letter, a lot of official-looking paperwork, and my niece helped me fill it out. Something about making sure everything was okay, and that I was safe to… well, to keep living independently, I suppose. It’s all a bit fuzzy, but I think that’s what it was. They said it was routine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. It sounds like it’s part of the new Medicare Wellness and Safety Check program. That program is designed to ensure patients are safe and healthy, and the drug screen is a standard part of the assessment. So, to confirm, you're agreeing to proceed with the drug test as part of this Medicare program?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely! If that's what they need, then yes, let's get it done. The sooner it's over and done with, the better, really. I have a long day ahead of me, operating that big machine… it’s not easy work, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Alright, let's get this taken care of then. We'll just need a urine sample. Do you have any difficulty providing a urine sample?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. I can manage that just fine. Just tell me where to go, and I’ll get right on it. No problem at all. I’m used to… well, you have to go when you have to go, right? Especially when you’re on the job.
DOCTOR: That's very true. Alright, the restroom is just down the hall to your left. There's a collection cup in there, and a set of instructions. Please wash your hands thoroughly before and after. Once you’ve provided the sample, please bring it back to me, and I’ll send it to the lab. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Do you have any questions before you head off?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just down the hall, left, cup, instructions… got it! Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with an old lady like me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lytisha. It's my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions when you return. Take your time.
