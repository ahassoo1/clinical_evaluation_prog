DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's good to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s this ringing in my ears, it’s been bugging me for a while now. It’s… hard to explain, just a constant ring. It's pretty annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. A constant ringing can certainly be bothersome. Thank you for sharing that with me. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about this ringing?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like a phone ringing, more… a high-pitched whine, sometimes. Other times it’s just a buzzing. It's mostly in my right ear, but I think I can hear it in my left one too, faintly. It’s there all the time, but it gets worse when it's quiet. I just want it to stop, you know? It makes it hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. A persistent sound like that can be very disruptive. It sounds like you're describing what we call tinnitus. Now, to get a better picture of things, could you tell me approximately how long this ringing has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, maybe, six months ago? Around January, I think. It was very faint then, barely noticeable. I thought it would go away on its own, but it just… hasn't. It's definitely gotten worse over the last few months, especially with work being busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months. And you mentioned it started gradually and has worsened over time, coinciding with increased work stress. Has anything specific happened around the time it started – any loud noises, illness, or injuries?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, actually. There was a big party, a wedding, in December. The music was really loud, a live band and everything. I was right near the speakers for a bit, dancing with my cousin. I thought my ears were popping a bit that night, but I didn’t think much of it. And I did have a bad cold in January, right around when it started, but nothing serious. Just a regular cold, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's helpful information. So, potential exposure to loud noise at the wedding and a cold shortly after the onset of the ringing. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, sometimes my ears feel a bit full, like when you’re on a plane. But that doesn’t happen all the time. And maybe I've been a little more tired lately, but work’s been long hours, so I figured that was just from being exhausted. Nothing else, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional fullness in the ears, potentially related to fatigue. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was ages ago. And I've got mild high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a small pill for it every day. Apart from that, I'm pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat okay, though it’s hard with the work schedule.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of appendectomy and mild hypertension managed with medication. Thank you. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Um… let me see… it’s… Lisinopril, I think? Yeah, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I've been on it for about five years now.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Lisinopril ten milligrams daily. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My doctor’s asked before, and I always tell them the same thing. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Good. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I used to drink a little bit – a glass of wine with dinner sometimes – but I stopped a few months ago, actually. Around the same time the ringing got worse. I figured it couldn’t hurt to cut it out. And no, definitely no drugs.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears, nose, and throat, and also check your blood pressure, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s causing this ringing.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat, and I'll begin. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 135 over 85. Not alarmingly high, but worth keeping an eye on. Now, let's take a look at your ears. Okay. I'm looking in your ears now. Both ear canals appear clear. The tympanic membranes—that's the eardrum—look normal in color and shape. I don't see any signs of infection or fluid buildup. Your nose looks clear as well, and your throat is normal. No obvious signs of inflammation or infection. Now, I'm going to perform a quick tuning fork test to assess your hearing. This won't be uncomfortable. Okay, with the Weber test, the sound seems to be slightly diminished on your right side. And with the Rinne test, bone conduction is equal to air conduction in both ears. These results suggest a mild conductive hearing loss on your right side, which could be related to the ringing.
PATIENT: Okay… mild conductive hearing loss… what does that mean exactly? Is that bad? And is that what’s causing the ringing? I just… I just want it to stop, you know? I can barely hear people when it’s really loud, and it’s driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I'll explain everything as clearly as I can. A mild conductive hearing loss means that sound isn't traveling through your outer or middle ear as efficiently as it should. Think of it like sound being slightly muffled. In your case, it appears to be mild and localized to your right ear. The results of the tuning fork tests suggest this may be contributing to the ringing – the tinnitus. However, tinnitus is a complex issue, and it can have many causes. The recent wedding with the loud music, the cold you had, and potentially even the change in your lifestyle by stopping alcohol, could all be factors. It’s not always possible to pinpoint one single cause. Given your history and the examination findings, I believe the most likely cause of your tinnitus is a combination of these factors causing some temporary inflammation or irritation in the auditory pathway. While there’s no immediate cure for tinnitus, it's often manageable. We can explore some options to help alleviate your symptoms and improve your quality of life.
PATIENT: Okay… that makes a little bit of sense. So, it’s probably not something serious? And there are things we can do about it? What kind of things? I just want to be able to sleep without hearing this constant whine in my ears.
DOCTOR: No, based on your examination and history, I don't believe this is anything serious like a tumor or a major neurological issue. However, we need to rule out some other possibilities to be absolutely certain. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a simple audiometry test – a hearing test – to determine the extent of the hearing loss. This will give us a baseline and help us track any changes. I also recommend a complete blood count to rule out any underlying medical conditions. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to help manage your symptoms. Try to avoid loud noises as much as possible. If you're exposed to loud sounds, wear earplugs or earmuffs. Consider using a white noise machine or fan at night to help mask the ringing. Managing stress is also important, as stress can often worsen tinnitus. If the tinnitus persists despite these measures, I can refer you to an audiologist for further evaluation and treatment options, such as tinnitus retraining therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy. I can also discuss the possibility of a referral to an ENT specialist if necessary. How does that sound to you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… okay. A hearing test and blood work, I can do that. And I’ll try the white noise machine. Stress is definitely a problem, I guess. I just wish it would go away. It’s exhausting always hearing that whine. What’s the next step? Do I need to schedule another appointment? And how long will the tests take?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It is exhausting, and it's good that you're being proactive about it. The next step is to schedule those tests. I’ll write you a referral for the audiometry test and a lab requisition for the complete blood count. The audiometry test usually takes about 30-45 minutes, and you can schedule it at the clinic’s audiology department, or at any audiology clinic that’s convenient for you. The blood work will only take a few minutes. You’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. Once you have the results, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. We can then discuss those referral options if needed. Do you have any questions about scheduling the tests or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. I'll schedule the tests as soon as I can. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything. I guess I'll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re here to support you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
PATIENT: Thanks again, Doctor. You too.
