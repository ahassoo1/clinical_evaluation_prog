DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I am Dr. Eaddy. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tremor, that’s what they said I should mention. In my hand, mostly. It's... well, it’s been happening for a bit now. Honestly, I can't quite put my finger on when it started. Time just… slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, time does have a way of doing that. A tremor, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. It's not constant, mind you. Comes and goes. Worse when I try to… hold something steady. Like a cup of coffee, or a wrench. I used to be able to fix anything, but now… not so much. Used to work at the plant, water treatment. Lots of pipes and valves... that sort of thing. Don’t really do much of that anymore though.
DOCTOR: I see. And when you say “for a bit now,” could you perhaps give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate... hmm. Maybe... six months? A year? It's hard to say, really. Everything blurs together after a while, you know? I was divorced… oh, a long time ago now. That sort of thing messes with your memory, I think. Didn’t have insurance then, still don’t, to be honest. Just… hoping it's not anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's try to narrow it down a bit. Has the tremor been getting progressively worse over that six-to-twelve-month period, or has it remained relatively stable?
PATIENT: Worse, I think. Definitely worse. I used to be able to, like I said, fix things. Small things, mostly. But now... even holding a spoon steady is sometimes a challenge. It doesn’t hurt, you know? Just… shakes. A bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. And does anything seem to improve the tremor?
PATIENT: Improve it...? Hmm. Nothing I've noticed, really. Resting it sometimes helps, I guess. When I'm just sitting, doing nothing. But then I have to do something, and it starts up again. Not much gets easier with age, to be frank. I just want to get this sorted, if that’s possible. I don't need a lot of fuss, you understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you wouldn't mind. It will involve some simple neurological tests to assess the tremor and your overall motor function. Please extend your arms in front of you, palms up. And try to keep them still.
PATIENT: Alright. Though I'm warning you, "still" isn't exactly my strong suit these days. Just don't expect miracles, Doctor. It’s already starting up, you see. Hope it's not too bad. Honestly, I just… I'd like to know what’s going on, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I observe some resting tremor in both upper extremities, more pronounced on the right. There's also a slight rigidity present. Now, please close your eyes and tap your finger to your nose repeatedly with each hand. Keep a steady rhythm, if you can.
PATIENT: See? Not good. It’s… it’s not as easy as it used to be. Everything feels… off. Like my hand has a mind of its own. I’m just making a mess of it, I'm afraid. I apologize for the trouble. I don’t mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: It appears you have some bradykinesia, or slowness of movement, in addition to the tremor and rigidity. Now, I’m going to check your gait and balance. Please stand up and walk a few steps. Try to walk normally.
PATIENT: Whoa. Steady now. This is… not my finest hour. Always been a bit clumsy, I suppose, but this is different. Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart, you know? I just hope I don't fall and break something. It’s probably just age, isn't it?
DOCTOR: While some age-related changes are expected, your presentation is concerning for possible Parkinson’s disease. However, a definitive diagnosis requires further evaluation, including imaging and potential referral to a neurologist. Before we discuss that, can you tell me if you have had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s...? Oh dear. Never thought about that. Other symptoms...? Hmm. Let me think. Well, my wife… my ex-wife… she always said I smelled funny. Like a musky sort of smell. But I just thought… well, I didn't pay much attention. And… sometimes my voice feels a bit quiet, I suppose. Hard to say. I haven’t really noticed anything else, to be honest. It’s hard to keep track of everything these days. Is it serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The diminished sense of smell, or anosmia, and the change in your voice could be consistent with Parkinson’s disease. It is a progressive neurological disorder, but its severity and progression vary significantly from person to person. Before we jump to any conclusions, I would like to review your medical history in more detail. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other chronic conditions?
PATIENT: High blood pressure... maybe? I think the doctor mentioned something about it, years ago. Didn't really listen, to be honest. I wasn’t much for doctors. Diabetes… no, I don't think so. I like sweets, but my ex-wife kept me pretty healthy, all things considered. Mostly just… old age, I guess. Back pain, a bit of arthritis… the usual aches and pains. Never had anything serious, to my knowledge. No surgeries, no hospital stays… nothing like that. Honestly, I’m terrible with medical stuff. It all blurs together. Can we just… get this sorted? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your symptoms and limited medical history, I recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out other potential causes. Additionally, I will refer you to Dr. Anya Petrova, a neurologist, for a more comprehensive evaluation and possible initiation of treatment. She's excellent, and I will send all my findings to her. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with medications, as far as I can remember. Though, I haven’t taken many, to be honest. Just… pain relievers, now and then. Aspirin, ibuprofen… nothing fancy. But, I'm not 100% sure. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask? And… how long will this take? I don’t want to be stuck in and out of doctors’ offices for months on end. I just want a quick answer, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. Unfortunately, obtaining a definitive diagnosis requires time and investigation. The MRI will take approximately 30-45 minutes, and scheduling an appointment with Dr. Petrova may take a week or two. I will have my nurse prepare the necessary paperwork for the MRI and provide you with Dr. Petrova's contact information. Before you leave, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter supplements or vitamins?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see… Oh! I take a little vitamin D, sometimes. My daughter gave it to me. Says I don’t get enough sun. And… sometimes I take a little something for my back pain. Just… an over-the-counter thing. Ibuprofen, I think? It's… blue. In a little bottle. I can’t remember the name. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good with all this stuff. Is that important? I just want to get this tremor sorted, if that's possible. I don’t want to be a bother. .
DOCTOR: The vitamin D and ibuprofen are helpful to know, but not of immediate concern. My nurse will provide you with a list of potential side effects to monitor. I've documented everything we discussed today and will send the referral to Dr. Petrova as soon as possible. She's located at 14 Willow Creek Road. Please schedule an appointment with her at your earliest convenience. And please, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased tremor, difficulty walking, or any new neurological issues – contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
