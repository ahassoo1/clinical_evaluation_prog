DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Stoffregen. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit… tricky. I have trouble… going to the bathroom. It's hard to… push it out, you know? It just… doesn’t come easy. Been like this for a little while now, I think. Not sure how long, exactly. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with bowel movements – constipation, perhaps?
PATIENT: Consti… what now? Oh dear. Is that a bad thing? I just know it's harder than it used to be. And I have to… strain a lot. My husband, he helps sometimes, but I don't like bothering him. It's just… uncomfortable, mostly. Do you… know what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Stoffregen, I do. Constipation simply means having infrequent or difficult bowel movements. It’s quite common, and we can certainly look into what’s causing it for you. You mentioned straining… how often are you attempting to have a bowel movement, and how would you rate the pain on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A scale? Um… let me think. I try… every day, I suppose. Maybe more if I feel it. The pain… hmm. It's not sharp pain, you know? More like… a strong pushin' feeling. Like somethin’s stuck. Maybe a… four? On that scale. Sometimes a little higher, if I’ve been… sitting for too long. Does that make sense? My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. A four is helpful to know. And you’re right to mention sitting for long periods; that can certainly contribute. Now, besides the difficulty and straining, have you noticed any changes in your stool itself?
PATIENT: Oh… stool? You mean… what comes out? Well… it's usually… hard. Very hard. And… smaller than it used to be. Not much comes out, even when I try really hard. It’s… not like it was when I was younger, that’s for sure. I don't… I don't really look at it too closely, if that’s okay. It’s just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable, Ms. Stoffregen. You certainly don't need to go into detail if you're uncomfortable. Just knowing it's harder and smaller is helpful. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool or around your rectum?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. I… I don't think so. I haven't seen any, not that I remember. But… sometimes, after I go to the bathroom… there's a little… redness on the paper. But I thought that was just… from trying so hard. Is that bad? Oh, my goodness, I hope not. I really don't like talking about these things. It's just… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It’s quite alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Many people find these topics uncomfortable, and you’re doing very well. The redness you’re describing could be from straining, as you suspect. However, to be certain, and to rule out anything else, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a physical exam? Oh dear. What does that… involve? I don’t like doctors poking around. My husband always used to say I was a delicate flower. I… I don’t want anything… painful. Just tell me what you need to do, please. And if it gets… too much, can I stop? I get a little… flustered easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. Absolutely. I understand your concerns. A physical exam will simply involve me listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then a very gentle external examination of your rectal area. I will be explaining everything as I go, and you can absolutely stop me at any point if you feel uncomfortable. We're just trying to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would you like me to explain why we do this, or would you prefer I just begin, explaining as I go?
PATIENT: Oh… explaining as you go sounds… better. I don't really understand all the doctor talk, to be honest. I just want to feel better, you know? My stomach… it hasn't been right for a while. And I just want to get this sorted, if that's possible. Just… be gentle, please. And tell me what you’re doing, every step of the way.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. I will. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with this stethoscope. It doesn’t hurt at all; I’m simply listening for any unusual sounds. It will take just a moment. Okay, good. Sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or masses. Please tell me if you feel any discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… alright. A little pressure, but not… painful. Just feels a bit… full, maybe? Like I haven’t… emptied everything out. Not really sore, though. Ooh, there… that’s a bit… tender. Just a little. Is that… bad? It feels like… a hard spot, almost. Under the skin. But not… sharp pain, you understand. Just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, thank you for letting me know. It's good that there isn't sharp pain, but a hard spot could indicate a few things. Now, to complete the exam, I'm going to gently look at your rectal area. I will be asking you to briefly bend over or lie on your side. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… Bend over? Oh dear. I'm not very… flexible anymore, Doctor. My back… it creaks something awful. Is there… another way? I really don’t like bending over. My husband used to say I looked like an old question mark when I did. Could I… lie on my side? That might be easier. But… I do get flustered, you know. Please be quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. Lying on your side is perfectly acceptable. We will take things at your pace. I understand your concerns. I will be explaining each step as I go. It will just allow me to gently check for any abnormalities. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. Now, if you could just relax, and I will gently examine the area… Just a moment…
PATIENT: Oh… That's… a little uncomfortable. Not painful, but… strange. Is it almost over? I don’t really like having things… poked around. It feels… cold, too. Please be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle. Just tell me what you’re looking for, if you don't mind. That might… help. It feels… intrusive, you know?
DOCTOR: It is almost over, Ms. Stoffregen. I understand your discomfort and I apologize if it felt intrusive. I was checking for any masses, tenderness, or other abnormalities. I didn’t feel any masses, but there is some mild tenderness. And your anal sphincter tone seems a little relaxed. That's all, Ms. Stoffregen. You can get dressed now. I'll be right back with my thoughts.
PATIENT: Oh… good. Relaxed sphincter? What does that mean? Is that bad? Oh dear. My husband always said I worried too much. Well, hopefully it’s nothing too serious. I just want to feel better, you know? Is there anything I can do… right now? Some tea, perhaps? That always makes me feel a little calmer.
DOCTOR: A relaxed anal sphincter tone can contribute to your constipation, Ms. Stoffregen. It simply means the muscle that controls bowel movements isn’t as strong as it could be. It’s not necessarily serious, but it explains some of your symptoms. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it seems you're experiencing constipation likely related to a weakened muscle tone, potentially combined with a bit of hesitancy. I don’t believe anything serious is going on, but we should still do some routine bloodwork to rule out other possibilities, such as thyroid issues or anemia. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… bloodwork? Oh dear. I don't really like needles. Are you sure it's necessary? I mean, if you don't think it's anything serious… My husband always said I was a terrible patient. He used to bring me tea and biscuits when I had to get bloodwork. Do you have any… tea here? Just a little something to calm my nerves. And… what kind of bloodwork are we talking about? Will it take long? I have a luncheon with the ladies on Thursday, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Stoffregen. We only need a standard Complete Blood Count and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test. It's fairly quick, usually just a few vials of blood. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and we can make it as comfortable as possible. Unfortunately, we don’t have tea here, but I can offer you some water. As for your luncheon, it shouldn't interfere at all. The results usually come back within a couple of days. In the meantime, we can discuss some immediate steps to help alleviate your constipation. Would you like to hear about those?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A couple of days… that’s good. And… just a few vials? I suppose that’s manageable. Water would be lovely, thank you. And… yes, please. Tell me what I can do. I mean, what kind of… things can I do? I don't want to rely on… medicine, if possible. My husband always said natural remedies were best. Are there any… exercises? Or special foods I can eat? Anything to help… get things moving, you know?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your husband was right to value natural remedies, when appropriate. First, let's focus on lifestyle changes. Increasing your fiber intake is crucial. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are your friends. We’re aiming for about 20-30 grams of fiber per day. Drinking plenty of water – at least eight glasses – will also help. As for exercise, regular physical activity can stimulate bowel movements. Even a gentle walk for 30 minutes each day can make a difference. I can provide you with some pelvic floor exercises – often called Kegel exercises – which can strengthen those muscles. They're quite discreet and you can do them anywhere. Finally, try to establish a regular bowel routine. Go to the bathroom at the same time each day, even if you don't feel the urge, to train your body. We can also discuss a stool softener, a very mild medication, if these changes aren't enough. But let’s start with these natural remedies and see how you do. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… a lot. Fiber… vegetables… water… exercise… My husband used to make me smoothies with all sorts of things. I suppose I could try that again. And… Kegel exercises? Oh dear. I'm not sure I remember how to do those. And… eight glasses of water? I usually just have a cup of tea with my biscuits. It's a lot to… remember, Doctor. Perhaps you could… write it down for me? All of it. And… maybe just the simplest things to start with? I don't want to get… discouraged. It's easy for me to forget things these days, you know. And… maybe a gentle walk is a good start. That sounds… manageable.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. I understand. It can seem overwhelming at first, but we will take it one step at a time. Here, let me write down a simple plan for you. Constipation Management Plan – Zoie Stoffregen Fiber: Aim for 20-30 grams daily. Examples: Fruits , Vegetables , Whole Grains . Hydration: Drink at least 8 glasses of water per day. Exercise: Gentle walk for 30 minutes daily. Pelvic Floor Exercises : Squeeze the muscles you use to stop urination. Hold for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat 10-15 times, several times a day. . Establish a Routine: Try to go to the bathroom at the same time each day. Let's start with the walk and the water. Just focus on those two things for the next week. If you’re still struggling, we can discuss a stool softener at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions about this plan?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. A walk… and water… yes. I can do that. My husband always said a little fresh air did wonders. And… he always reminded me to drink my water. He was a good man. The stool softener… well, let’s try the walk and water first. I don’t want to rely on medicine if I can avoid it. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. Now… is it alright if I go now? I have a luncheon to prepare for, you know. And… I should probably start my walk before it gets too hot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. You’re very welcome. It was lovely meeting you. Remember, take things at your own pace. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Enjoy your luncheon, and have a pleasant walk. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in about two weeks to see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds perfect. Two weeks… I’ll remember to put it in my calendar. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. Goodbye now. And… thank you for the water. .
