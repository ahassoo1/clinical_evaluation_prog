DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, is just... I does be feeling very thirsty lately. All the time thirsty, you understand? And hungry too. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I feel like I need more. Is not a normal thing, this.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Thirsty and hungry, even after eating… How long has this been going on for, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Let me see… is start maybe… about a month now? A month or so. It not come on sudden, you know. Is just get worse little by little. First, is just a little extra thirsty after work. Then, I start feeling hungry quicker. Now… well, now is all the time. Is worrying me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset over a month… And besides the thirst and hunger, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I does feel a little tired, yes. More tired than usual. And sometimes… sometimes I have to go to the bathroom more often. Especially at night. Is that important, Doctor? I not sure if that have anything to do with the thirst and hunger.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst, increased hunger, fatigue, and frequent urination… These things can be related, Ms. Zicarelli. Frequent urination, particularly at night, is noteworthy. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Not that I notice, no. Everything look the same to me. I does wear glasses, you know, for reading, but they is the same ones I always have. Is everything still clear when I look far away? I not sure, Doctor. I not really pay attention to that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, no weight loss. If anything, I feel like I gain a little weight! Because I does be eating so much now, trying to feel full. Is strange, you know? I eating more, but I not losing weight. Is that… bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No weight loss despite increased appetite... Frequent urination... Ms. Zicarelli, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam and order some blood work. It's likely nothing serious, but we need to rule out a few possibilities. We'll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and a basic glucose check. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sound alright. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what is going on with me. All this thirst and hunger… is really bothering me. You check whatever you need to check. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you'll have a seat. I'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then we'll do a quick check of your blood glucose. Please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is cold in here, yes? But I does take off my shoes. You tell me what to do, and I does do it. Is just… I does be a little nervous with all these tests.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90… a bit elevated, but not alarming. We’ll keep an eye on it. Pulse is 88, regular. Now, this will just be a small prick. Hold this gauze on it for a moment. Hmm. 210 milligrams per deciliter… significantly elevated.
PATIENT: 210? Is that… bad, Doctor? What does that mean? I never had any numbers like that before. Is something serious wrong with me? You said it not alarming before, but this number sound… alarming. I does be scared now.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Zicarelli, a glucose level of 210 is elevated. It suggests that you may have hyperglycemia, which is a sign of diabetes. However, one reading isn't enough to make a diagnosis. We’ll need to do further testing to confirm this. I’m going to order a fasting blood glucose test and an A1C test. The A1C will give us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. Do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear Lord… My mother… she had sugar, yes. She was always getting sick and tired, and she had to take… pills, I think. She passed away a long time ago, though. Is that what this is? Is that why I does be so thirsty and hungry? Is this something bad, Doctor? Will I have to take pills too?
DOCTOR: It could be diabetes, Ms. Zicarelli, given your mother’s history and your symptoms. And yes, if it is diabetes, you may need medication to manage it. However, we need the test results first. I’m going to schedule you for a blood draw tomorrow morning, fasting. Nothing to eat or drink after midnight. In the meantime, try to limit your sugar intake and drink plenty of water. I’ll also give you a referral to a nutritionist. It’s important to get your diet under control. Here’s the lab order and the nutritionist referral. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No… no questions right now, Doctor. Is just… all this is a lot to take in. Diabetes… my mother… pills… Is a scary thing, this. Thank you, Doctor. I does try to do what you say. Limit the sugar… drink the water… Is just… hard. Is very hard. I does go home now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Zicarelli. You may go home. We'll call you with the test results as soon as they're available. Remember to follow the instructions carefully. And try not to worry too much. Next. .
