DOCTOR: Hi Brando, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Rosanova, you said? Yes, well… it’s about a… a checkup, I think. For… something to do with acting. A performance thing. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. They just said I needed to get cleared by a doctor. A physical, I believe. Can we just… get it over with? No offense, of course.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Brando. We all have days where things are a little… fuzzy. A performance physical, alright. We can absolutely get this done as efficiently as possible. Just to be clear, is this for a new role, or a continuation of something you’ve been doing?
PATIENT: New role, I think. Or… maybe it's an old one restarting? It’s all a bit… muddled. I've been doing this a long time, you see. Ushers, mostly. And ticket taking. Sometimes lobby work. Not exactly… leading man material. But it keeps me moving. Is asking what exactly this checkup is for going to take a long time?
DOCTOR: No, it won’t take long at all to clarify. The theatre or production company should have given us some details. Essentially, they want to make sure you're physically able to handle the demands of the role - stamina, lifting, being on your feet, that sort of thing. Do you happen to know the name of the production or the theatre?
PATIENT: Production… hmm. Let me think. No, I really don't. They just contacted me. Said they needed an older gentleman. That was… Mr. Henderson, I believe. He was very… efficient. All business. They said something about needing proof of… fitness, for insurance reasons, maybe? I don’t recall the specifics. Honestly, all these details slip my mind so easily now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem. It's perfectly understandable. Let's just start with a quick run-through of your medical history then. Have you been seeing a primary care doctor regularly?
PATIENT: A primary care doctor… not regularly, no. Not for many years. I used to, when I was younger. But… things fell by the wayside, you see. I’ve been… relatively healthy, I suppose. A few aches and pains, what you’d expect for someone my age. Nothing major. I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… Oh dear. Let me see. When I was a boy… I had the measles, I think? And chickenpox. But that was… a very long time ago. As an adult… nothing comes to mind. A bad cold here and there. Nothing that required a hospital visit. No, I don’t believe I’ve ever been hospitalized. But, like I said, my memory is… unreliable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. There was something with my back. Years ago. A slipped disc, I think. They… operated. A long time ago. I don't remember the details, only that it hurt terribly for a while, and then… it got better. Mostly. It still bothers me sometimes, especially if I have to lift something heavy. It wasn't a major surgery, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright, a back surgery for a slipped disc. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. A bit of ginger tea if I’m feeling unwell. That’s it. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off it. Said I was fine. That was… quite a while ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, but a history of taking something for blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. A bit of a stuffy nose sometimes during pollen season, but that’s just… seasonal, I suppose. Nothing serious. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. Definitely not to any medications.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's a good start. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s… a long story. My parents… they were both from China. Immigrated here a long time ago. They’re both gone now, unfortunately. As for illnesses… I don’t really know. We weren't a family that talked much about health problems. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. But that was… many years ago. My father… he was always very strong, very healthy. I don’t recall anyone having anything… serious. But truthfully, I couldn’t tell you much. It was a long time ago, and… I wasn’t very involved in their medical affairs.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Brando. It’s common for that information to be difficult to recall. Now, before we move on, can you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, at my age, it’s not terribly exciting! I live alone, quiet life. I enjoy… walking, mostly. Keeps me moving. And I like to read. Historical novels, mostly. Not much socializing, to be honest. I try to eat reasonably well. Lots of vegetables, not too much red meat. I don’t drink alcohol, and I certainly don’t smoke. It’s… a simple life.
DOCTOR: That sounds very healthy, Brando. Just one more question before we get to a quick physical exam. Are there any specific symptoms you’ve been experiencing lately that you wanted to discuss today?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… my knees have been bothering me a bit lately. Just a little ache, mostly when I walk for too long. And sometimes, I feel a bit… breathless, especially when I climb stairs. Nothing too serious, I don’t think. Just… old age, probably. But I thought I should mention it.
DOCTOR: That's good you mentioned it, Brando. We’ll definitely take a look. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam then. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. Just… please be gentle with my knees. They're a bit sensitive, you see. And… how long will this take? I have… an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be very gentle. This shouldn’t take too long at all. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Okay, blood pressure is 145/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Can you please bend them for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: There we go. It’s… a bit stiff, you see. And… a little painful. But I can do it. Just… be careful. It feels… a bit creaky. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. There's some crepitus in both knees, which is common with age. I do feel a little bit of swelling on the inner side of both knees, and it is slightly tender to the touch. Range of motion is somewhat limited, but you’re still able to flex and extend them. Okay, Brando. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it appears you have some osteoarthritis in both knees. It’s a common condition, especially as we get older. It’s causing the pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion you’re experiencing. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on that.
PATIENT: Osteo… what was it? Arthritis… Yes, that sounds about right. My mother had something similar, I think. So… is it serious? Will I need… surgery? I really don't want surgery. Is there anything I can do about it? Some… cream, perhaps? Or exercises? I just want to be able to walk without pain, you see.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis, yes. It’s a degenerative joint disease, meaning the cartilage in your knees is wearing down. It's not necessarily serious in the sense of being life-threatening, but it can definitely impact your quality of life if left unmanaged. Surgery is usually a last resort. We can try a number of things first. I recommend a combination of approaches. First, we can try some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help reduce inflammation and pain. A topical cream, like diclofenac, can also be helpful. And, importantly, physical therapy can strengthen the muscles around your knees, improve your range of motion, and provide you with exercises to manage your symptoms. I’m going to write you a prescription for the diclofenac cream. I'll also give you a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in osteoarthritis. And I'd like you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in about six weeks to see how you’re responding to treatment. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that aggravate your pain, and maintain a healthy weight. Does that sound like a reasonable plan, Brando?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. No surgery, that’s what I wanted to hear. Physical therapy, cream… I can manage that. Six weeks… I'll remember that. I think. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to know there are options. Will the physical therapy be… expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see. And my insurance… well, it’s not very good.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Brando. Physical therapy can be expensive, and I understand your worries about your insurance. Let me see… Okay, it looks like there are a couple of physical therapy clinics in the area that offer a sliding scale based on income. I can provide you with their contact information. Also, I’ll write a note to the physical therapist outlining your specific needs and limitations, so they can work with you to create a manageable plan. Here you are. And I’ll also give you a list of resources for financial assistance with medical care. Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or need help navigating the insurance process. Do you have any other concerns today, Brando?
PATIENT: That’s… very kind of you, Doctor. The sliding scale… that would be a great help. I appreciate you going to that trouble. No, I don’t think that’s all. Just… thank you. You’ve been very patient with an old man who can’t remember things. I have an audition next week. A small part, nothing important. But… it requires a lot of walking. Do you think… should I postpone it? I don’t want to aggravate my knees.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Brando. Postponing it is certainly an option, and if you’re feeling anxious about it, that might be the best course of action. However, if it’s a role you’re really excited about, and you feel up to it, you could try it, with modifications. I recommend taking it slow, taking frequent breaks, and listening to your body. If you start to feel pain, stop and rest. It’s better to be cautious than to push yourself too hard. You could also discuss it with the director and see if there’s any way to adapt the role to reduce the amount of walking. Ultimately, the decision is yours, Brando. I’m just here to provide you with information and support. Do you think you’d be comfortable trying it with those modifications?
PATIENT: Modifications… yes, I suppose I could ask about that. The director is a reasonable sort, I believe. I don't want to let them down. And… it's a small part, nothing crucial. I think… I think I'll try it. With modifications, and if it gets too painful, I’ll stop. I appreciate your advice, Doctor. I suppose that’s everything. Thank you again for your patience. And for not laughing at an old man who forgets everything.
DOCTOR: You didn’t forget everything, Brando, and there’s absolutely no reason to feel embarrassed. It's perfectly normal to have some memory lapses as we get older. I’m glad you’re feeling comfortable with the plan, and I wish you all the best with your audition. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And remember, listen to your body, and take things slow. Have a wonderful day, Brando. And break a leg!
PATIENT: .
