DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. I am Dr. Pipkorn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a cough that won’t quit, mostly. And I get really tired easy now. Seems like I'm always fighting off a sinus thing, too. It's been going on for a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. A persistent cough and fatigue, with some sinus issues as well. “A while” is rather vague, Mr. Pithan. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… maybe six, seven months now? Started last winter, got a little better in the spring, but it came right back when it got cold again. It’s just… lingering. Never really gone.
DOCTOR: Six to seven months… and it recurs with the colder weather. I see. And would you describe this cough as productive – meaning do you bring anything up when you cough – or dry?
PATIENT: Yeah, it’s… productive. I cough stuff up, definitely. Mostly it’s clear, but sometimes it gets… yellowish. Especially when the sinus stuff is bad. It’s… not pleasant.
DOCTOR: Of course not. And when you say “sinus stuff,” what exactly are you experiencing?
PATIENT: Just… pressure, mostly. Behind my nose and in my cheeks. And my head hurts. Sometimes it feels like my ears are full, too. It comes and goes, but when it’s bad, it’s really bad. I’ve tried… some over-the-counter stuff, but it doesn't really do much.
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter medications, I see. And what specifically have you tried?
PATIENT: Uh… decongestants, mostly. And… those saline sprays. You know, the ones for your nose? And… I think I tried something for the head pressure, but I don’t really remember what it was. It didn’t work, so I stopped. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for taking a lot of pills. I just want to get rid of this cough and feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance regarding medication, Mr. Pithan. However, it’s important to have a clear understanding of what we're dealing with before we determine the appropriate course of action. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – such as diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems – that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. Had the usual childhood stuff, but nothing serious. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothing like that. My folks… they lived long lives, too. Mostly just… old age got 'em. I do have… some arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. It flares up sometimes, but I just rub 'em with some liniment.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant past medical history, aside from some arthritis. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. I’ve been lucky, I guess. I try to stay out of doctors' offices as much as possible. That’s why I waited so long to come in about this cough, to be honest. Didn't want to make a big deal out of it. But it’s just… not going away.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, waiting can sometimes complicate matters. Now, regarding family history – are there any illnesses that run in your family – such as heart disease, cancer, or respiratory problems – that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mom’s side… her brother had some kind of lung trouble when he was older. Emphysema, I think? He smoked his whole life, though. My dad's side… nothing really. Just… old age, like I said. They were farmers, mostly. Worked hard, lived long lives. I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. We didn't talk about that stuff much.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of emphysema in an uncle, but otherwise unremarkable. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My dad smoked, but I always hated it. Smelled awful, and he always coughed. No, never smoked. And I don’t drink much either. Maybe a beer now and then, with supper. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. Dust bothers me a little sometimes, but that's just… common sense. I try to avoid dust when I can. But no real allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, Mr. Pithan, before we proceed with a physical examination, I’d like to briefly review your current medications. Are you taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements currently?
PATIENT: Just that arthritis cream, sometimes. Like I said, it's just a liniment. Rub it on my hands when they're achin'. And… I take a multivitamin every morning. That's it. Nothing else. I really don't like taking pills, Doctor. I just want to feel better, you know? This cough is wearin' me down.
DOCTOR: I understand your aversion to medication, Mr. Pithan. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll start by listening to your lungs and checking your sinuses. Please remove your shirt and I'll begin.
PATIENT: Alright. I guess that's alright. Just… try to be quick, if you could. It gets cold in here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pithan. Take a deep breath in… and exhale. Again, please. Your lung sounds are… somewhat diminished bilaterally, with some scattered wheezes. Not alarming, but noteworthy. Now, I'm going to examine your sinuses. This may be slightly uncomfortable. There's some tenderness to palpation over your frontal and maxillary sinuses. Your throat appears slightly inflamed, but no visible exudate. Now, open your mouth and say "ah". Your uvula is clear and there's no significant erythema. Finally, I'll check your ears. Your tympanic membranes appear normal. Alright, that concludes the physical examination. Based on your history and examination, there are a few possibilities we need to explore.
PATIENT: Okay. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it serious? I just want to get rid of this cough, like I said. It’s… it’s been wearin' me down.
DOCTOR: Based on your symptoms and the findings of the physical exam, it appears you may be experiencing a prolonged upper respiratory infection, potentially complicated by some degree of chronic sinusitis and mild bronchitis. However, given the persistence of your cough and fatigue, and the recurring nature of your symptoms, we need to rule out other possibilities. A chest X-ray would be prudent to assess for any underlying pneumonia or other lung pathology. Additionally, I recommend a complete blood count to evaluate for signs of infection. And finally, a sinus CT scan will help us determine the extent of your sinusitis. Do you have any questions before we proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… and a CT scan? That sounds… serious. Is it that bad? I just thought it was a bad cough. And… how much is all that gonna cost? I have insurance, but… well, you know. It doesn't always cover everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pithan, while a chest X-ray and CT scan are not necessarily indicative of a life-threatening condition, they are necessary to obtain a definitive diagnosis and ensure appropriate treatment. Prolonged symptoms warrant further investigation. As for the cost, I understand your concerns. The exact amount will depend on your insurance coverage and deductible. Our billing department can provide you with a detailed estimate before proceeding with the tests. However, delaying diagnosis could potentially lead to more serious complications, which would ultimately be more costly – both financially and health-wise. Do you wish to proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. I guess I don't have much choice, do I? Just… get it over with. I want this cough gone. I just… don't make me come back a whole bunch of times. I have things to do. Just… tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will write you a referral for a chest X-ray and sinus CT scan. You can schedule these at the imaging center across the street – their number is on the referral form. Once you’ve had the tests performed, please bring the results to my office. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest, drinking plenty of fluids, and avoiding irritants such as smoke and dust. I will also prescribe you a course of antibiotics to address the potential bacterial component of your bronchitis and sinusitis. Here are the referral form and the prescription. Please contact the office if you have any questions. We will schedule a follow-up appointment once we receive the results of the tests. Do you have any further questions at this time, Mr. Pithan?
PATIENT: No. I think that's everything. Just… I hope it's not too bad. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Pithan. We will contact you as soon as the results are available. Get well soon.
