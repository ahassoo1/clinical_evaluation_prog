DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my legs. They just feel weak. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a really nasty cold. Not a pleasant experience, I assure you. I usually bounce back quickly, but this weakness…it’s not going away. It’s in both legs, which is what’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Weakness in both legs, you say, and it started after a cold. Okay. And when you say weak, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I can't walk, Doctor. That would be dreadful. It's more…like trying to push through mud. Everything feels…heavy. And sluggish. It takes a lot more effort to do things, even just getting out of a chair. You know? It’s…disconcerting. I’m a tour guide, for goodness sake! I need to be on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Right, a tour guide. That definitely requires being on your feet. So, it's not a complete inability to move, but a significant increase in effort. And you said it started right after the cold broke?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. I started feeling better from the cold—you know, the sniffles and cough finally subsided—and then boom. This started. It wasn't gradual, it was just…there. I thought maybe I hadn’t fully recovered, but it's been days now and it hasn’t improved a single bit. Honestly, it's rather inconvenient. I had a lovely group scheduled for the historical district next week. I'd hate to have to cancel.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to clarify, you haven’t had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms since the cold resolved?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Just…this. The cold was bad enough—the usual aches, the congestion, you know. But once that cleared up, it was just…this leg weakness. No new sniffles, no cough, no aches. It’s very peculiar, Doctor. And rather frustrating, I must say. A good tour guide needs stamina. I'm usually quite active, I walk miles every day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this weakness been getting worse since it started, staying the same, or perhaps even a little better at times?
PATIENT: No, it’s definitely not getting better. It's…stubbornly the same. Maybe, maybe, on a good day, I can convince myself it’s a tiny bit less noticeable, but then I try to walk a bit further and I’m reminded. It feels like I’m fighting against something, and it doesn’t let up. It’s a consistent effort, all the time. I don’t understand it, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or pain in your legs or feet at all?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no pain. That would be…unacceptable. And no tingling, no numbness either. It’s purely weakness. A heavy, sluggish feeling. It’s just…difficult to explain. It’s not like a sharp ache or a burning sensation. It’s more of a…lack of power, if that makes any sense. It's unsettling, to say the least. I’m not getting any younger, but I certainly don't feel old enough for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. I'm going to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation. Just relax on the exam table, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I suppose that’s sensible. Though I must say, I find this all rather…unnecessary. I've always been perfectly healthy. But if you think it's best… Please, do be gentle. I don’t want to pull anything.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Two plus bilaterally. Now, can you please try to push your legs down against my hands?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it feels like you’re testing a child. But fine. There. Is that sufficient? It’s not effortless, you know. It feels…resistant. I’m not suddenly weak, Doctor, just…struggling. It's not like I want to be difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay. 4 out of 5 strength bilaterally. That's…within normal limits, but slightly lower than I’d expect for someone who is a tour guide. Now, let’s check your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch your legs with this cotton swab. Tell me when you feel it.
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? It feels rather…clinical. Yes…yes…there…yes, again. It’s all perfectly normal, you know. I can feel things. I assure you, I’m not…paralyzed or anything dramatic. I just have weak legs after a cold. Is that so hard to believe? I’m starting to feel rather foolish.
DOCTOR: Sensation is intact bilaterally. Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly as well, just to rule out anything else. Sounds clear. Your heart and lungs sound good. Given your history and the exam, it could be post-viral weakness, however, it is important to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a basic metabolic panel and a CBC, just to get a baseline. And, given your age, I also want to order a Vitamin D level. We can also consider a referral to neurology if it doesn't improve within a week.
PATIENT: Neurology? Doctor, really? This is just a bit of leg weakness. A bit! It’s hardly a medical emergency. And all those tests…are they truly necessary? I'm not one for unnecessary procedures, you know. Honestly, it sounds rather…extreme. I was hoping for a simple explanation, perhaps a recommendation for some rest and a good multivitamin. Are you suggesting I'm seriously ill?
DOCTOR: It's not about suggesting you're seriously ill, Ms. Firestone. It's about being thorough. Post-viral weakness is a possibility, yes, and often resolves on its own. However, it's important to rule out other conditions that could be causing similar symptoms. The tests are relatively simple blood work, and will give us a better baseline understanding of your overall health. A Vitamin D deficiency, for instance, can cause muscle weakness. And while unlikely, we need to exclude other potential causes. It's standard practice, and frankly, responsible care. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially given your profession. We can discuss the results when they come back, and if everything is normal, we can revisit the idea of rest and a multivitamin. Would you like me to order those tests for you?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Fine. Order your tests. But if everything comes back normal, I expect a full apology for putting me through all this fuss. And I trust your lab doesn't take all day? I have a tour group scheduled, you know. It's not as if I have nothing to do. And please, no more talk of neurology. It's quite unsettling. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've ordered the labs. They should be available within 24-48 hours. The lab is just down the hall; you can go whenever it's convenient for you. You'll receive a call when they are ready. And I understand your concern about the neurology referral; we can certainly hold off on that for now. Here’s your requisition form. If everything is normal, I will gladly explain why I ordered the tests and address your concerns. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just…try to be a bit less…alarmist next time, Doctor. A little reassurance goes a long way. I’ve been perfectly healthy my entire life, and I intend to stay that way. Very well. I suppose I’ll go and have my blood taken. Don't call me unless it's truly urgent. And please, no talk of neurology. .
