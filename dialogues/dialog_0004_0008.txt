DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Right. Well, it’s… my ear. Feels blocked, you know? Like something’s… full. It’s been like this a while, I think. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. A few weeks, maybe? It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. And is it just a feeling of fullness, or is there any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain… not really pain, no. More like… pressure, sometimes. A dull ache, if I really concentrate on it. But mostly just… blocked. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… there. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a rather subjective term, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Pressure and a dull ache can be associated with a blocked ear, yes. Have you noticed any discharge from the ear?
PATIENT: Discharge? Uh… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve seen. I… I don’t usually look at my ear, to be honest. Should I be? I mean, is that… is that something I should be doing? I just notice it feels… stuffy. Like when you’re flying, maybe? But… all the time.
DOCTOR: No, you are not expected to routinely examine your own ear canal, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It's perfectly alright that you haven't. Let's move on. Have you experienced any hearing loss, ringing in your ears , or dizziness alongside this fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… hearing loss… maybe a little? My wife used to say I didn't listen, but… well, she’s gone now. So… difficult to say if it’s worse now. Ringing… sometimes. A faint ringing. Mostly when it’s quiet. Dizziness… no, not really. I get a bit… unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I just put that down to getting older. It’s probably just… old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No fever, no cough. My sinuses feel a bit stuffy sometimes, but I always assumed that was the weather. I… I had a bit of a cold a few months back, maybe that's related? Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. Everything feels a bit… blurry these days. Is that… helpful? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at remembering details.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. We'll sort through it. A recent cold could be a factor. Let’s do a quick examination of your ear. I'll use an otoscope to look inside and see what's going on. Just lean your head forward a bit. It might be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. An otoscope… is that the light thing? Okay, just… be quick, if you could? I don’t like things in my ears. It makes me… nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some cerumen – that’s earwax – present, and the tympanic membrane – that’s your eardrum – appears slightly… clouded. There's no visible sign of infection, at least not right now. However, the cloudiness and wax buildup could be contributing to the fullness you're experiencing. I also note mild redness of the ear canal. Do you have any allergies to ear drops?
PATIENT: Allergies… ear drops? I… I don’t think so. Never had to use them before, so I wouldn’t know. I’m not allergic to anything, as far as I know. My wife always handled the… the medical stuff. I just… took the pills she gave me. Sorry. Is this… bad?
DOCTOR: No, it's not necessarily "bad," Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It simply means we need to proceed cautiously. Given the cloudiness and redness, I'm going to recommend we start with a simple cerumen removal, and if symptoms persist, we can consider other possibilities. It’s possible you have a mild external otitis, which is an inflammation of the ear canal. I’ll irrigate your ear canal to remove the wax. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Irrigate? With… water? Will it… hurt? My wife… she always said I was a bit sensitive. And I really don’t like anything going in my ears. Is there… another way? Maybe some… pills? Or a cream? I just… I'm not good with procedures, you know? I get anxious easily.
DOCTOR: Pills won't address the physical blockage, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Cream is not typically used for cerumen impaction. The irrigation is a gentle process, using body-temperature water. We can certainly go slowly. And if you find it too uncomfortable at any point, we will stop immediately. However, removing the wax is the first step. We need to see what’s underneath. I understand your anxiety, but avoiding treatment could lead to worsening symptoms or even temporary hearing loss. We can use a smaller syringe and lower pressure if that would make you more comfortable. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A smaller syringe… yes, that sounds… better. Lower pressure. Please. And… and can you explain exactly what you’re going to do? Step by step? Just so I know what to expect. My wife used to explain things very carefully. I… I just get a bit flustered. Honestly, I just want this feeling gone. It's very distracting. .
