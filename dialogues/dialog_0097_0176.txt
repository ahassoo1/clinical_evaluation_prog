DOCTOR: Hi Ivette, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Dr. Georgiou, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they're still going. It’s really annoying, honestly. More than annoying, it’s getting a bit worrisome after so long.
DOCTOR: Hiccups that are lasting a couple of days, that is concerning. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Okay, let's try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Can you tell me a little more about when they started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it was Tuesday, I believe. August 1st. I was at a friend’s barbecue, a little get-together. I was laughing a lot, we were telling stories…and then, just started. At first, I didn’t think anything of it, you know? Hiccups happen. But they just… kept going. And going. I tried drinking water fast, holding my breath…the usual things. Nothing’s worked.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tuesday after a bit of a laugh at a barbecue. And you’ve tried the usual tricks – water, holding your breath. Good to know. Are the hiccups constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, but mostly come. Like, I’ll get a few minutes of peace, maybe, and then bam, another bout. It’s really unpredictable. And sometimes they're just a little ones, and sometimes they’re… big, you know? Like, I can barely catch my breath. It's exhausting, honestly. Especially trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable, with varying intensity, and affecting your sleep. That sounds really frustrating, Ivette. Besides the hiccups themselves, have you noticed anything else going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I’ve been a little… tired, maybe? But that could just be from not sleeping, honestly. Appetite’s normal. No fever, no other pains. Just… hiccups. And a growing sense of irritation, if that counts. I’m a bit of a worrier, you see.
DOCTOR: It does count! Being a worrier is perfectly valid, and persistent hiccups would certainly contribute to that. No fever, appetite’s good, just the fatigue and the hiccups. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I just want this to stop! I’m starting to feel quite silly, constantly hiccuping. A physical exam sounds… sensible. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could just have a seat here. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look at your throat, and feel your abdomen. Nothing too invasive, just a routine check. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go… hic! Sorry. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ivette. Don't apologize! It's helpful for me to hear it as it happens. Everything sounds clear on both sides – no wheezing or crackles. Heart rate is regular. Now, can you open your mouth wide for me, and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Hic! Ah… I really am a terrible patient. Everything looks normal, though, right? My throat? I don’t feel anything wrong. I manage events, you see. I have to be presentable!
DOCTOR: You're a perfectly fine patient, Ivette – hiccups don't change that! And yes, everything looks normal – no redness or swelling, tonsils look good. Now, I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Okay. Ow! There… a little to the left… that’s a bit tender. Not painful, exactly, but… yeah, definitely sensitive. Everything else feels alright, I think. I'm not used to having my tummy poked!
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness to the left. That’s good to know. It doesn't seem like anything acutely concerning, but we'll keep that in mind. Alright, everything else seems normal. Given the history and the exam, it sounds like you have persistent hiccups. It's frustrating, but thankfully, usually not serious. Do you have any allergies or medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And no medications. I try to avoid them if I can, honestly. I prefer herbal teas and a good night’s sleep, when I can get one, that is. Just a bit of chamomile before bed, usually. Nothing else. I’m a fairly healthy person, generally. This hiccup thing is just… bizarre.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, no medications, just chamomile tea. That's good to know. And it is bizarre – hiccups lasting this long are unusual. There are a few things that can cause persistent hiccups – everything from irritation of the diaphragm to certain medications, though those aren’t relevant in your case. Sometimes they just happen, and then go away on their own. Given that it's been two days and it's affecting your sleep, I'm going to suggest a couple of things. First, we can try a medication called baclofen, which can sometimes help calm the diaphragm. It's a muscle relaxant. Second, if the baclofen doesn't work, we should consider some imaging – a chest X-ray just to rule out anything else going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmm… medication and an X-ray? That sounds… a bit much, honestly. I’m not a fan of taking pills unless absolutely necessary, and I try to avoid radiation where I can. Is there… anything else we could try first? Maybe some breathing exercises? A different kind of tea? I know it sounds silly, but I’m just a little hesitant to jump straight to medication and scans.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask, and your concerns are completely valid. It's always best to start with the least invasive options. Medication and an X-ray aren't the only options, and we definitely don't have to jump straight to them. Let's try a few things first. We can try some diaphragmatic breathing exercises – slow, deep breaths focusing on expanding your abdomen. There's also a vagus nerve stimulation technique – you can try gargling with water for 30 seconds, several times a day. And there’s a possibility that something simple, like a small amount of sugar, can disrupt the hiccup cycle. A teaspoon of sugar dissolved in a glass of water could be worth a try. We can also discuss some lifestyle adjustments – avoiding carbonated beverages, eating smaller meals, and avoiding sudden changes in temperature. We can try these things for a week, and if they don't help, then we can revisit the option of baclofen and the X-ray. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better, yes. Breathing exercises, gargling, sugar… I can definitely manage that! No pills, no scans for now. I’m happy to give those a try. Smaller meals, less fizz… I can do that too. It feels… more sensible, honestly. A bit of gentle intervention before resorting to stronger measures. Thank you, Dr. Georgiou. That makes me feel a lot better. Do you have any handouts or links about the breathing exercises or the vagus nerve stimulation?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad we found a plan you're comfortable with. Absolutely, I have a couple of handouts here for you – one on diaphragmatic breathing exercises, and another explaining the vagus nerve stimulation technique with gargling. These also have some links to online videos demonstrating the techniques, if you find that helpful. I also want you to keep a little log of when the hiccups occur, and if any of these interventions seem to help. We can review it when you come back. If the hiccups become severe – meaning you're having trouble breathing, eating, or sleeping – or if you experience any other symptoms, like chest pain or abdominal pain, please don’t hesitate to come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Breathing exercises, gargling, sugar, log the hiccups, and come back if things get worse. I can definitely manage that. Thank you again, Dr. Georgiou. You've been very patient and understanding. I appreciate you listening to my concerns and not just jumping to medication right away. I think I'll head home and give those exercises a try. Hopefully, I'll be hiccup-free by next week!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I'm happy to help. And I truly hope the exercises work! It was lovely meeting you, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Feel better, and I'll see you next week if needed. .
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too, Dr. Georgiou. I will definitely keep you posted. Goodbye!
