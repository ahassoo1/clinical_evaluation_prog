DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning. Just… chest pain. And my heart… it feels like it’s going too fast sometimes. Blood pressure, they said, is not good. Not good at all. I want to get this fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain and a racing heart, and your blood pressure isn't where it should be. I understand you'd like to get this sorted quickly. That's good to hear – being proactive is important. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this chest pain?
PATIENT: More details? Really? It hurts. What more detail do you need? It’s in my chest. Like… a squeezing. It comes and goes. Sometimes when I walk, sometimes just… sitting. Is that enough detail for you? I don't have time for long stories.
DOCTOR: You're right to tell me what's important, and that squeezing pain that comes and goes, especially with walking or even at rest, is important. It’s good you’re paying attention to it. When you say it comes and goes, roughly how long does each episode of pain last?
PATIENT: Eh… a few minutes. Maybe five. Sometimes less. Doesn't last long, thankfully. But it happens… too much. And then my heart… thump-thump-thump. Like a drum. Is that bad? Everything feels… old, you know? Old and tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few minutes at a time, and you feel a racing heartbeat alongside the chest pain. And you describe feeling like everything is old and tired. Just to clarify, is the racing heartbeat always with the chest pain, or does it happen at other times as well?
PATIENT: Mostly with the pain. Sometimes… when I’m nervous. Or after I eat too much. My wife… she says I eat too much. But what can you do? It's good food! But yeah, mostly when the chest hurts. Don't need a long list, right? Just get to fixing it.
DOCTOR: No, this is helpful, Mr. Sobkowic. It’s good to know it's mostly tied to the chest pain, and sometimes with nervousness or after eating. We’ll get to fixing it, I promise. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before – things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, they said recently. Before that? Not really. Old age is a condition, right? My wife keeps saying I need to see a doctor for everything. She worries too much. Cholesterol… I don’t even know what that is. Never had the… the bee-tees, or whatever it’s called. Just… old. Plain old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so recently diagnosed with high blood pressure, but otherwise you haven't had many diagnoses. And you haven’t been tested for high cholesterol or diabetes before. Do you take any medications currently, besides anything for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the… pill. The little white pill. For the pressure. My wife gives it to me every morning. Sometimes I forget, but she reminds me. Don't take much else. I like my food, you know? No pills for good food! Don't want to change things too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the one pill for your blood pressure, taken regularly with your wife's help. That’s good. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – had heart problems, like heart attacks, stroke, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmph. My father… he was always tired. Didn’t do much. But heart problems? Not that I know of. Mother… she lived long time. Healthy, I think. Siblings… I don't really remember them. Long time ago. Family history... not important. I'm the one who's sick now. Let’s just fix me.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history of heart problems. I understand your focus is on getting you feeling better. Now, just a few more questions, then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. My wife would kill me. Always yelling about healthy living. No, no smoke. I drink… sometimes. A little bit of rice wine. But not too much. Mostly just eat. Rice wine is better for you than smoke, anyway. Don’t waste time with bad habits.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No smoking, and just a little bit of rice wine. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. I get itchy sometimes. In the spring. But everyone gets itchy in the spring. No… no big allergies. No… swelling or anything. Just a little itch. My wife gives me something for it. A cream. That's all. Nothing serious. Let's just get this over with. I'm getting tired now.
DOCTOR: Okay, just seasonal itchiness. No serious allergies. Alright, Mr. Sobkowic. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I'll also check your blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen level. If you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be great.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But make it quick. My back hurts. And I want to know what you're going to do about this chest pain. Don't just listen… fix it!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowic, I'm listening now. Your heart rate is a little fast, and your blood pressure is elevated, as you mentioned. I hear a slight murmur, which we'll need to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear, but I did notice you’re a little short of breath with exertion just lying here. Your abdomen is soft. No obvious tenderness. Could you describe what the chest pain feels like right now?
PATIENT: Hmph. Feels… tight. Like a band around my chest. Not bad bad, but… uncomfortable. Like I can’t get enough air. And my heart… it's thump-thumping again. See? I told you! It’s always doing this. Just fix it already. I don't like this feeling. It's scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Tightness in your chest with a racing heart, and feeling short of breath. It’s understandable you’re anxious, Mr. Sobkowic. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m hearing now, it’s important we rule out any serious heart problems. I’d like to order an EKG—that’s an electrocardiogram—to look at your heart’s electrical activity. We’ll also need some blood work, including cardiac enzymes to check for heart damage. And a chest X-ray to see if anything is going on in your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Hmph. Fine. Whatever you need to do. But quickly! I don’t have all day. What will these tests… show? Will it tell you what’s wrong? And can you fix it after the tests? Don't just poke and prod… fix it! My wife will be worried if I’m gone too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Sobkowic, these tests will help us determine what’s causing your chest pain and racing heart. The EKG will look for any abnormalities in your heart rhythm, the blood work will check for damage, and the chest X-ray will help rule out anything in your lungs. The results will help me determine the best course of treatment. It could range from medication adjustments to further investigation with a cardiologist, which is a heart specialist. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology department right away. A nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and take you for the X-ray. It shouldn't take too long. In the meantime, I'm going to get you connected to a monitor to keep a close eye on your heart rate and blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: Cardiologist? More doctors? Hmph. No. Just… fix it. I don't want to see more doctors. And don’t let it take too long. I’m getting old, you know. I don't have time for endless tests and waiting. Just… do what you need to do. And tell me when it will be fixed. That’s all I want to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Sobkowic. I want to assure you that we will move as quickly as possible. I'm not necessarily saying you'll need to see a cardiologist, but if the initial tests show something concerning, it's important to have all the information to provide the best possible care. I’ll be reviewing your test results as soon as they're available, and I'll explain everything to you in detail. I promise to keep you informed every step of the way. Let’s get these tests done, and then we can discuss the results and create a plan together. A nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to get you started. She'll explain the process and answer any questions you have. Do you need anything at all right now – a glass of water, a blanket?
PATIENT: Water would be nice. My mouth is dry. But hurry with the tests. Don’t want to be here all day. And… tell Maria to be gentle. Old bones, you know. Just… get it done.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll get Maria to bring you some water right away, and I'll make sure she knows to be gentle. She's very kind and experienced. I'm going to step out now to review the orders and make sure everything is in place. I’ll be back shortly to check on you. We’re going to take good care of you, Mr. Sobkowic. Just try to relax as much as possible. .
