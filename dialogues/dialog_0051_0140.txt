DOCTOR: Good morning, Antoine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't much time for this. It’s…a bit embarrassing, really. Something’s going on in my mouth. A white coating. It’s unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright, no need to be embarrassed at all. Many things can cause a white coating in the mouth. We'll figure it out. When did you first notice this coating?
PATIENT: A week, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. It’s… difficult to pinpoint exactly. I don’t spend a lot of time examining my mouth, if you understand. It’s just… there. And spreading, I think. It's quite bothersome, especially when eating.
DOCTOR: Okay, spreading… and bothersome with eating. Does it cause any pain, Antoine?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. More… discomfort. A burning sensation, sometimes. And it makes everything taste… off. Like I’ve been sucking on pennies. It's quite inconvenient, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Alright, a burning sensation and altered taste. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside that?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Doctor, I came here because of the white stuff in my mouth, not to list every minor ailment I’ve ever experienced. No, nothing else particularly. Perhaps a little fatigue, but who doesn’t feel fatigued these days? Look, I assure you, I'm a busy man. This is taking up valuable time. Is there a quick fix for this or not?
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Antoine. I assure you, I want to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Before we jump to any conclusions, let me ask a few more routine questions, if you don't mind. It helps me to get a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Medical conditions? No. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I work very hard, I eat a sensible diet… This is likely just a minor irritation. Honestly, Doctor, I don't understand why I need to answer all these questions. I simply want something to clear this up. Married, if that’s relevant. Otherwise, I'm quite unremarkable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a look at your mouth, then. If you don’t mind opening wide for me, please. I'll need a good look at the coating we're discussing.
PATIENT: Just get it over with, Doctor. Honestly, this is rather undignified. And try not to poke too hard. I haven’t much patience for…prodding.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see the coating. It appears to be… patchy, covering a significant portion of your tongue and the buccal mucosa. It doesn’t appear ulcerated, but it is quite thick in some areas. No signs of any other lesions or swelling. Based on what I'm seeing, it could be a few things. Most likely, it’s oral thrush – a fungal infection, sometimes called candidiasis. It's not uncommon, especially if there's been a recent change in your health or if you've been taking any antibiotics. However, to be certain, I'd like to take a swab to send to the lab for testing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A fungal infection? Preposterous. I assure you, Doctor, I maintain impeccable hygiene. Antibiotics? I haven’t touched an antibiotic in decades. This is…insulting, frankly. A swab? Is it absolutely necessary? This all seems rather…excessive for a minor inconvenience. Can’t you just prescribe something to get rid of it? I haven’t got time for laboratory tests. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Antoine. However, a proper diagnosis is important to ensure we’re treating the correct issue. While oral thrush is the most likely possibility given my initial examination, other conditions could present similarly. A swab is a quick and simple test that will give us a definitive answer. If you prefer, we can proceed without the swab, and I can prescribe an antifungal medication. However, if the medication doesn’t resolve the issue, we’ll need to revisit this, and the testing will become necessary then. It may take longer to clear up without knowing exactly what we’re dealing with. What would you prefer?
