DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah. Travel... medicine. Something about travel. My wife... she liked to go places. Now I need... shots? I think. For travel. It was her idea.
DOCTOR: Yes, travel medicine. Of course. So you’re looking for vaccinations or advice regarding travel?
PATIENT: Vaccinations, yeah. That sounds right. She always got all the... things. Before we went. I don’t remember where we are going this time. Somewhere hot, maybe? I just... need to get it done. So I can go. If I go.
DOCTOR: Alright. To best advise you on the appropriate vaccinations, I’ll need a little more information, if you don’t mind. Do you have any records of previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: Records? Uh... no. Not that I know of. She kept everything. All the papers. After... well, everything is at the house. I don't have them with me. I just know she always got poked a lot before a trip.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s alright. We can proceed without them for now. Do you recall roughly where you and your wife typically travelled?
PATIENT: Typically? Hmm... She liked... Asia. Lots of temples, you know? And... warm places. Beaches. And once, a cold place, with mountains. Very cold. But mostly warm. We went a lot of places. She really liked to go. I just... followed.
DOCTOR: Asia is quite broad. Knowing even a general country would be helpful. Were any of these trips to Southeast Asia – places like Thailand, Vietnam, or Indonesia?
PATIENT: Uh... Vietnam, yeah. I think we went to Vietnam. Lots of... scooters. Everywhere. And food. Smelly food. And Thailand, maybe? She liked the... elephants. I don’t really pay attention to the names. She picked everything.
DOCTOR: Vietnam and Thailand. Okay. And approximately when was your last trip?
PATIENT: Last trip... That was... before. Before everything. Uh... last year? No, the year before. I'm not good with dates. It was warm, that I remember. She got all her... things. All the shots.
DOCTOR: Alright. Considering your travel history to Vietnam and Thailand within the last two years, and without knowing your vaccination records, it would be prudent to update some standard vaccinations. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications... No. Not that I know of. She gave me stuff when I got a cold, but I never had a bad reaction. Just... sleepy. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I eat everything. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. She took a lot of stuff. Vitamins. For everything. But me? Nothing. I just... followed her instructions. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. Given your history, I recommend we review your Tdap, MMR, Varicella, Hepatitis A & B, and Typhoid vaccination status. We’ll also discuss travel-specific recommendations considering Southeast Asia. I'd like to do a brief physical exam just to get a baseline, if that's alright with you. It will be quick. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: All those things? Sounds like a lot of poking. And a... exam? I don’t like doctors. She always made me go. Is it really necessary? I just want the shots so I can... go. If I go.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Tayar. The exam is just a standard check – blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs – to ensure you’re fit for travel and vaccinations. It's a quick process, just a few minutes. It’s important to make sure there are no underlying issues that might affect your response to the vaccines. We can proceed with just the vaccinations if you prefer, but I strongly recommend the exam for your safety. Would you like me to explain what the exam involves in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But quick, okay? I don’t like being poked and prodded. She always said I was a baby about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tayar. Quick and efficient is the plan. If you could just have a seat here, we'll start with your blood pressure. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears. It won’t take long at all.
PATIENT: Hurry it up, please. I got things to do. If I go.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, that's within the normal range. Now, if you'll just take a deep breath for me... Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Ears look clear as well. Everything sounds good so far, Mr. Tayar. No immediate concerns. Now, let’s discuss which vaccinations would be most appropriate.
PATIENT: Finally. Just tell me what I need. I don't want to sit here all day. And make it quick, please. I just need the shots so I can... go. If I go. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Tayar. Based on your travel history to Southeast Asia, and assuming you haven’t had these vaccinations recently, I recommend Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations. We should also review your Tdap status to ensure you're up to date on your tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis protection. It's best to get these before your trip to ensure maximum protection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hepatitis... Typhoid... More names. Fine. Whatever you say. Just… do them. Can we get it over with? I don't want to be here all day. She always made a fuss about getting everything perfect. I just want to go, if I go. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. I understand your impatience. We will get this done quickly. I’ll prepare the vaccinations now. I will administer them in your deltoid muscle, on your upper arm. You may experience some mild soreness at the injection site, which should resolve within a few days. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable during the procedure?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. Don’t talk. Just poke. Quick. She always talked too much. And poked too much. Just… do it. Quick, please. Very quick. If I go. I just want to go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. Here we go... first injection... and now the second. There we are, all done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Ouch. That stung. Feels… sore. Is that all? Will it be sore for long? She always said I was a big baby. Can I go now? I just need to get home. If I go.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly normal, Mr. Tayar. It's expected to be a little sore for a few days, perhaps even a week. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if needed. And you're welcome to apply a cold compress to the injection site if that helps. I've documented the vaccinations in your chart. It’s important to keep a record of these for future travel. We’ve also discussed potential side effects. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. I just want to go home. She always had a list of questions. And she always remembered everything. I just... don't. Is there anything else? Can I go now? I need to think about... things. If I go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. You are free to go now. Here is a printout of your vaccination record, as well as a pamphlet on travel health. If you experience any severe side effects – a high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe allergic reaction – please seek immediate medical attention. And please, take care of yourself. And if you do decide to travel, have a safe trip. .
PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Bye. .
