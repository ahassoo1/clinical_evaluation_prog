DOCTOR: Hi Janie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don’t really… remember when it started, honestly. A long time, I think. It’s just… wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness… that’s definitely something we can look into. It is frustrating when it just kind of creeps up on you. You said you don't recall exactly when it started – roughly, would you say it’s been a few months, a year, longer?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… longer than a year, definitely. Maybe… two? Three? It’s hard to say. Things… blur. My husband, he… he always kept track of things. Now… not so much. It just feels like… always.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more than two years of feeling tired. And it's constant, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty much. Some days are… worse than others, of course. But it’s never really gone. Even when I sleep… I don’t feel rested. It's just… a heavy feeling, all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so constant tiredness, even after sleeping. That's helpful. When you are sleeping, are you having any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or do you wake up feeling like you didn't sleep well even if you've been in bed for a good amount of time?
PATIENT: Oh, I fall asleep alright. Too easy, maybe. It’s… staying asleep that's the problem. I wake up a lot. Little things. A noise… just… thinking. And then… I’m wide awake. It takes a while to get back to sleep, and then… I just don't feel like I rested at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty staying asleep, waking up frequently. And not feeling rested even with enough hours in bed. Do you notice anything that makes it worse – like certain foods, drinks, or maybe stress?
PATIENT: Stress, definitely. Things… happened. After my husband… everything’s a bit stressful. And… coffee. I used to drink a lot of coffee, to stay awake, you know? Maybe that doesn’t help. I try not to drink it so much now, but… it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, stress is a big factor, understandably, and you suspect the coffee might be contributing. Good that you’re trying to cut back. Besides the tiredness and trouble staying asleep, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Sometimes… aches. Just… all over. Not bad aches, but… noticeable. And… I forget things. A lot of things. Like… names. Or why I went into a room. Little things, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're experiencing some generalized aches and increased forgetfulness alongside the tiredness and sleep issues. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh… not really. I eat… what I always eat, I think. Not much of an appetite, honestly. But I haven’t lost any weight, that I know of. Everything feels… a bit blurry, remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant changes in appetite or weight. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. I had… high blood pressure, years ago. They gave me some pills for it. I think I still take them. And…arthritis, I think it was. In my hands. Not bad, though. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and arthritis. And you're still taking medication for the blood pressure. Do you know the names of the medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I don’t. My husband… he always took care of that. He filled the little boxes, and I just… took the pills. I have them at home, if that helps? I wouldn’t know where to start looking right now.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Janie. We can definitely look those up. And we can ask the pharmacy too. No need to worry about it right now. Besides those two conditions, any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. That was… okay, I guess. And… my appendix, when I was young. Nothing else, that I remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder and appendix removal. And just to get a complete picture, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother had… heart trouble. And my father… he had diabetes. That’s all I can really remember, honestly. It was a long time ago. Everyone’s gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble and diabetes. And finally, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh no, never smoked. And… hardly any alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Not often, though. It doesn't… agree with me, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very minimal alcohol use. Alright, Janie, this gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological check. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… let’s get this over with, if you don’t mind. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. And again… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Balance is slightly unsteady. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes… Okay, Janie, everything seems within normal limits, but your blood pressure is a little elevated and your balance is slightly unsteady. We'll want to keep an eye on that. I'm also noting your fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and forgetfulness. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. We may also want to consider a cognitive assessment if these symptoms persist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh dear… more tests. Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… please be quick about it. I don’t do well with waiting. The doctor before… he just kept sending me for tests, and nothing ever came of it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Janie, and I apologize if it feels like a lot. We just want to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. These tests will give us a clearer picture. I'll also send a referral for a cognitive assessment, just as a precaution, but we don’t need to rush that. It's good to have a baseline. In the meantime, let’s focus on managing your blood pressure. I recommend continuing to limit your coffee intake and try to incorporate some stress-reducing activities into your daily routine – even just a short walk or some deep breathing exercises can help. We can also talk about medication options if your blood pressure remains elevated. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes… a plan. That’s good. Less coffee… I can try. Stress… that’s harder. I suppose a walk wouldn’t hurt. The tests… just… tell me when they’re done. I really don't want to keep coming back.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll have the lab results sent to my office and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they're available – within a week or so, hopefully. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office right away. We’ll also get a nurse to call you with instructions on how to schedule the cognitive assessment. In the meantime, here’s a printout with some resources for stress management. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I hope… I hope it helps. I really just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janie. I understand, and we’ll do everything we can to help you feel better. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. .
