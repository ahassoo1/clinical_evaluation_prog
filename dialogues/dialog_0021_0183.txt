DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. The tiredness. It’s… a lot. Been feeling it for maybe two months now, I think. Hard to say exactly. It just… is. Like someone took the air out of my tires, you know? Not sick tired, just… empty tired.
DOCTOR: Empty tired… right. Two months. And is this tiredness interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Interfering? Yes. Of course it is. I work with the cloth, the fabrics… making things. It takes… energy. And I don’t have it. My wife, she has to help more now. It’s… not good. I used to do everything. Everything. She’s a good woman, but… she doesn’t know how to do it right.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it’s impacting your work. And you’re saying it’s a noticeable change from how you usually feel. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I… my stomach feels funny sometimes. Not always. More… heavy. And I don’t eat as much. Not because I don’t want to, just… doesn’t seem important. My wife keeps trying to feed me, bless her heart. But it just… sits there. And maybe a little yellow, you know? My skin. She says so, anyway. I don’t really look at myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so stomach discomfort, decreased appetite, and your wife has noticed some yellowing of the skin. We’ll need to look into that. Has there been any change in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… movements? You mean… going to the bathroom? It’s… normal, I think. Maybe a little… paler. Everything is paler now, I guess. The tiredness, the skin… even my appetite. It's all… less. Not bad, just… less.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Not that I know of. I don’t feel hot. And night sweats… well, it gets warm at night, but that’s just the weather, isn’t it? It's August. Always warm. I sleep okay, though. A little restless sometimes, but that’s just my legs. They bother me. Old man problems, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't take anything. Never have. I believe in strong work and good food, that’s all. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Maybe dust, sometimes. But everyone gets a little sneezy around dust, don't they? My wife uses those sprays. Keeps the house clean.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your abdomen. Just lie back on the table, please. And we'll check your skin tone as well.
PATIENT: Abdomen? What for? I told you, my stomach just feels… heavy. What will poking it do? I don't like being poked and prodded. Is this necessary? I just want to know why I’m so tired.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, it’s necessary to gather information. Palpating your abdomen will help me assess if there’s any tenderness or enlargement. It's a standard part of evaluating fatigue and stomach discomfort. It won't be poking, it's a gentle examination. It’s the best way to start figuring out what’s going on. If you're concerned, we can discuss other options, but I need to gather some basic information first. Please, just lie down. It will only take a few moments.
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t be rough. And if it hurts, I’m telling you. I know my own body.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Deep breaths, please. Okay, a little tenderness here on the right side, under the ribs. Not severe, but present. And your skin does appear slightly jaundiced, as your wife mentioned. Now, I'm going to order some blood work. It will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll check your liver function, your blood count, and a few other things. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Liver… function? What does that mean? Is something wrong with my liver? I don't drink! Never have. I eat good food, work hard… why would my liver be… wrong? Blood work… ugh. I hate needles. Is there really no other way? This is all very… upsetting.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, I understand your concern, but it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. Liver function tests simply measure the levels of certain enzymes in your blood. Elevated levels can indicate a problem with the liver, but it could be caused by many things, not just alcohol consumption. It’s a routine test to rule things out. And yes, blood work is necessary. It’s the best way to get an accurate diagnosis. It’s a small prick, and it will give us valuable information. We can minimize your discomfort by using a small needle and being quick. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials?
PATIENT: Latex… hmm. I don't think so. My wife buys the gloves for the garden, but I don't use them. My hands are strong. But... I get itchy sometimes, when I'm working with the wool. The really fine wool. Maybe that's something? It's just a little itch, though. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible sensitivity to wool. We'll keep that in mind. Okay, I'm going to send you to the lab for the blood work now. The nurse will explain the process to you. And then we'll get those results back as quickly as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, dark urine, or significant fatigue, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Emergency room? That sounds… serious. You think I need to go to the emergency room? What are you trying to tell me? Is it something bad? I just want to know why I'm tired! Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, I'm not telling you anything definitively yet. That’s why we are doing the tests. I’m simply saying that if you experience certain symptoms – and I’m emphasizing if – it would warrant immediate medical attention. It's standard precaution. Look, the tiredness is concerning, and we are investigating it. The blood work will give us more information. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to rule out potential causes. I’m going to order the tests now. The nurse will take you to the lab. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests… Everyone just wants to run tests. Fine. Yes, I understand. Just… get it over with. Tell the nurse to be gentle, alright? My veins aren't easy to find. And I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll let the nurse know. She’ll be in shortly. And please try to relax. It will be over before you know it.
