DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. I see you're here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… brings me in? Well, it’s about… a checkup, I suppose. For… work. Something about needing to be cleared for a performance, or something. It’s all a bit foggy, to be honest. They sent me over. I work at the theater, you see. Mostly just showing people to their seats and taking tickets. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: A work clearance, yes. I see. And how long have you been working at the theater, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. A very long time. Decades, I think. Maybe… forty years? Or more? It all blends together after a while, you know? I started when I was quite young, just a boy really. A lot of ushers come and go, but I… I just kept at it. Is that important? I don’t remember exactly when I started, sorry. It was a different time then.
DOCTOR: It can be helpful to have a more precise timeframe, Mr. Krahn, but we can proceed without it for now. Have you noticed any changes in your physical abilities recently that prompted this clearance request?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Well, I get tired easier, I suppose. And my knees… they aren’t what they used to be. Lots of standing, you see. All those years. But nothing… dramatic. I still do the job. I haven’t fallen or anything. It's just… getting older, I guess. I don’t know if that’s what they’re worried about. I mostly just want to get this over with, if you don’t mind. It’s a long walk to get here, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Tiredness and knee discomfort… alright. Are you experiencing any pain in your knees specifically?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. A dull ache, mostly. Especially at the end of the day. And if I bend them too much. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a… stiffness. I try not to think about it too much. Rub a little balm on them and keep moving. Is that… bad? I don’t really go to doctors often. I just try to get on with things.
DOCTOR: No, self-treatment isn't necessarily bad, Mr. Krahn, but it's good you're addressing it now. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Careful now, old bones creaking. There we go. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I just… I worry about falling. It’s the last thing I need. And honestly, I’m not very flexible anymore. Don’t expect any miracles.
DOCTOR: Please just stand comfortably, Mr. Krahn. I’ll be checking your range of motion and stability. Alright, can you bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ooh, there we go… that’s… that's about as far as they go, I think. Feels a little tight. Like someone’s pulling. Not a bad pain, but… noticeable. It's better if I don't rush it. Slow and steady, that's what I always say. They haven't been the same since… well, a long time ago. I don't remember exactly when.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noting some limited range of motion and discomfort with knee flexion. Now, if you could walk a few steps for me, please. Just at your normal pace. I want to see how you move.
PATIENT: Alright… just a normal walk. It's... harder than it used to be. I think I put a little more weight on this side. It just feels… safer. I don’t want to stumble. I've always been careful, but… you get older and things just aren't as reliable, you know? Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. I'm noting a slight antalgic gait – meaning you're favoring one leg to avoid pain. Your range of motion is limited, and you report discomfort. Based on this brief examination, it appears you have some degree of osteoarthritis in your knees. Do you have any history of previous knee injuries?
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? Injuries…? Oh dear. Let me think… a long time ago, when I was a boy, I think I twisted my knee playing… some game. Football, maybe? It wasn't serious, though. Just a bit of a sprain. I walked it off. And… I think I bumped it a few times over the years, moving equipment around the theater. But nothing major. Honestly, my memory is… terrible. It all just blurs together. Is that important? Perhaps this… osteoarthritis is just old age, then? Is there a cure? I really just want to be able to keep working.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis is essentially wear and tear on the joints, Mr. Krahn, and it’s common with age. Previous injuries can contribute, as you mentioned, but it sounds like yours is largely age-related. There isn't a cure, unfortunately, but there are ways to manage the symptoms. We can discuss pain relief options, physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knees, and potentially assistive devices like a cane if needed. Given your age and activity level, I think starting with physical therapy and over-the-counter pain relievers would be a reasonable approach. Have you tried any pain relievers before?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Physical therapy… that sounds like work. And a cane… No, I haven't tried any pain relievers, not really. Just… balm. Rubbing it on. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. My stomach isn't very good. Is there anything else I can do? Maybe just… be careful? And not stand for too long? I don't want to become a burden. I just want to be able to do my job. And honestly, I'm a bit overwhelmed by all this talk of… therapy and osteoarthritis. Can we just… get this clearance done so I can go home? Is that possible? It's been a long morning.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. We can certainly discuss a limited clearance, but I need to be clear: based on your examination, continued standing and walking without any management could worsen your symptoms. I'm willing to provide a temporary clearance for light duty – meaning tasks that involve minimal standing and walking – for one month, with a strong recommendation to begin physical therapy. I will also write a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory cream to help manage the pain. However, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any instability in your knees, you need to stop working and consult with a specialist. Do you agree with those terms?
PATIENT: Light duty… cream… one month… It's… not ideal. But I suppose it's better than nothing. And I do need to keep working. Alright. Yes. I agree to those terms. Light duty, cream, one month. And I’ll… try to be careful. And I’ll see about… therapy. Though I can't promise I'll enjoy it. Thank you, Doctor. I think that's enough for today. Can we just… get this paperwork sorted so I can go home? I just want to sit down.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krahn. I'm entering the orders for the prescription and the referral for physical therapy. I'll also provide you with a note outlining the light duty restrictions for your employer. Here is the prescription and the work note. The physical therapy clinic will contact you to schedule an appointment. Please, take care of yourself, Mr. Krahn. And don't hesitate to contact us if you experience any worsening symptoms. I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I will… try my best. And thank you again for your patience. I think I'll be going now. Have a good day.
