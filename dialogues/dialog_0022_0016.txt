DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… something about my patient, frankly. Old man Hemmings. He’s on blood thinners, you see, and he’s been bruising like a peach lately. It's rather concerning, and his daughter is quite insistent I get a professional opinion. I’ve seen… a lot, in my career, but this seems… excessive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re concerned about Mr. Hemmings and his increased bruising while on blood thinners. And his daughter is rightly pushing for a thorough check-up. That's good of her. Let me pull up his record here. Just to confirm, you are his primary care physician, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. For… quite some time now. Honestly, I'm surprised you haven't seen his chart already. One would think a clinic would have everything readily available. But yes, I'm his primary care. And a rather good one, if I may say so myself. I’ve been practicing pathology for… well, long enough to know when something isn’t right.
DOCTOR: I apologize for that, Mr. Farson. Sometimes the system can be a little slow with transfers. It’s good to hear you’ve been his physician for a while, and that you’re so familiar with his case. Okay, I see here he's on warfarin, as you know. And it looks like his last INR was… July 15th, at 2.3. That's within the therapeutic range. Can you tell me a little more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Yes, warfarin. Standard. The bruising… it’s not the usual little bumps, Doctor. These are… substantial. Thighs, arms, even his back. He claims he barely brushes against things, and these appear. And they’re slow to heal. Worryingly slow. He's a bit of a… hypochondriac, mind you, always claiming something’s amiss, but this is different. His daughter is very concerned about a possible internal bleed, which… frankly, I don’t dismiss entirely.
DOCTOR: I understand. Substantial bruising, slow to heal, and appearing with minimal trauma… that is concerning, especially given he’s on warfarin. His daughter's concern is well-placed. And you said it started recently?
PATIENT: Relatively recently, yes. Within the last… oh, three weeks, I’d say. It was gradual at first – a small bruise here or there – but it’s escalated quickly. He came to me last week, quite agitated, and that’s when I decided a specialist opinion was needed. I’ve adjusted his dosage slightly, but it hasn’t made a noticeable difference. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to suspect something more than just a simple warfarin issue. Perhaps a clotting disorder? Or… something else entirely. He is an older gentleman, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, escalating quickly despite a dosage adjustment… that definitely warrants a closer look. You're right to consider other possibilities beyond just the warfarin. A clotting disorder is a reasonable thought, as is considering other causes related to his age. To get a better understanding, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. And then I'll need to perform a physical examination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A physical examination? With all due respect, Doctor, I’m a pathologist. I've performed examinations for decades. But… alright. Questions first, I suppose. Let’s get this over with. I have other patients to see, you understand. And I'd appreciate it if you kept it concise. I’m not prone to lengthy conversations.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. I simply want to gather as much information as possible. And I appreciate your experience, Mr. Farson. I assure you, I’ll be as concise as I can. Let's start with the bruising itself. Besides appearing with minimal trauma, can you describe the bruises?
PATIENT: They’re… purplish, naturally. Varying shades, depending on their age, I suppose. Some are flat, others are slightly raised. They don’t seem particularly painful, he says, just… tender. And they’re quite large, as I mentioned. Larger than one would expect from a simple bump. And they spread, Doctor. They seem to get bigger overnight. That's what’s truly concerning. It’s not like a normal bruise that gradually fades. These… expand. It’s rather unsettling, frankly. Are you taking notes? Because I doubt you'll remember all of this.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am taking detailed notes, Mr. Farson. Purplish, varying shades, slightly raised in some areas, tender, and expanding… that’s all very helpful. Has he noticed any other symptoms alongside the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… he complains of fatigue, naturally. He’s an elderly man. Always tired. But I attribute that to his age, and his general… pessimism. He's also mentioned some mild joint pain, but again, hardly unusual. He hasn't reported any bleeding from other sites – no nosebleeds, no blood in the stool, no unexplained bleeding gums, thankfully. He did mention a slight headache last week, but he gets those frequently. Honestly, Doctor, it’s difficult to separate his genuine complaints from his usual hypochondria. He tends to exaggerate. A great deal.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue, mild joint pain, a recent headache, but no other signs of bleeding. And we’ll keep in mind his tendency to exaggerate when interpreting his symptoms. Now, let’s move onto his medical history. Do you have a list of his current medications and any previous illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Here. I keep a detailed record, unlike some physicians I’ve encountered. He’s on warfarin, as we’ve established. Lisinopril for his blood pressure, Atorvastatin for cholesterol, and… let’s see… Metformin for mild diabetes. As for previous illnesses… he had pneumonia a few years back, and a knee replacement ten years ago. Nothing significant, really. He’s remarkably resilient for his age. Though, he does complain constantly. You’ll notice that, I’m sure. Do you need me to elaborate on any of that? Because frankly, I’m losing patience.
DOCTOR: This is very helpful, thank you. Warfarin, Lisinopril, Atorvastatin, Metformin, pneumonia a few years ago, and a knee replacement ten years ago. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. He’s remarkably… un-allergic. He’s tried everything, you see. A rather stubborn man, my patient. No, no allergies. He’s quite proud of that fact, actually. He brags about it, believe it or not. "Never been allergic to a thing in my life!" he says. Rather tiresome, honestly. Can we please move on? I have a waiting room full of patients. And I'm sure they have genuine concerns, unlike… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: No allergies. Noted. Alright, Mr. Farson. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll start by checking his blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, and then I'd like to examine the areas where he's experiencing the bruising. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But I assure you, you won't find anything you don't already know. I've examined him for years. But… alright. Proceed. Just try not to take too long. And please, be gentle. He's a sensitive man, despite his… complaints. Honestly, the amount of time I've wasted today… But no, proceed. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let’s take a look at these bruises. The bruising is extensive, as you mentioned, and it does feel relatively soft to the touch. No signs of any active bleeding or inflammation. Similar findings here – widespread bruising, soft to the touch, no signs of acute inflammation. I don't feel any masses or irregularities. I'm also checking for any signs of petechiae or ecchymoses elsewhere on his skin... No significant findings there.
PATIENT: So? What did you find? I told you, nothing significant. Slightly elevated blood pressure, perhaps, but that’s hardly unusual for a man of his age. And the bruising is… well, the bruising is the bruising. It's what brought me here in the first place. Do you have a diagnosis? Or are we simply cataloging the obvious? Honestly, I’ve wasted an entire morning on this. I expect a definitive answer, Doctor. Not a recitation of what I already know.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Mr. Farson. The examination largely confirms your findings. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, and the bruising is extensive, soft to the touch, and without any immediate signs of acute injury or inflammation. However, the extent of the bruising, combined with the rapid onset and lack of response to dosage adjustment, is concerning. While the examination hasn’t revealed an obvious cause, several possibilities need to be investigated. Based on what we’ve discussed, I'd like to order some laboratory tests to rule out potential underlying causes. Specifically, I'd like to check his complete blood count to assess his platelet levels and look for any signs of anemia. We should also run a coagulation panel to assess his clotting factors and confirm his INR is stable. I also think a metabolic panel to assess kidney and liver function is prudent. Finally, I'd like to check his Vitamin K levels. Would you agree?
PATIENT: Vitamin K levels… Hmm. Not a bad idea, actually. I hadn’t considered that. The others… a CBC and a coagulation panel… predictable, but necessary, I suppose. Fine. Order your tests. But I expect a prompt turnaround. I don’t want to wait weeks for results. And I expect a thorough interpretation, not just a list of numbers. I’m a pathologist, Doctor. I understand laboratory data. I need your clinical assessment. And… make sure his daughter doesn't interfere. She tends to overreact. Do you understand? Now, let's get this over with. I have patients waiting. And frankly, I’m beginning to feel rather… depleted.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely, Mr. Farson. We’ll expedite the tests, and I’ll personally ensure you receive a prompt and thorough interpretation of the results. I’ll also make a note regarding his daughter’s tendency to overreact, and we’ll do our best to keep her informed without causing undue alarm. Alright, I’ve ordered the CBC, coagulation panel, metabolic panel, and Vitamin K levels. The lab should be able to draw the samples today. We should have the results within 48-72 hours. In the meantime, I recommend he avoid any activities that could increase his risk of injury. We’ll also continue to monitor his bruising closely. And if he experiences any new symptoms – such as bleeding from other sites, severe headache, or dizziness – he should seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get the results quickly. And be thorough. I expect a definitive answer. Honestly, I’ve wasted an entire morning on this. And frankly, I'm rather disappointed in the lack of progress. But… no. No questions. Let's just hope your tests reveal something useful. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have patients to see. And I expect a call as soon as the results are available. Don't keep me waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I will personally contact you as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the meantime.
