DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… well, it is a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I have been having… a lot of gas. More than usual. It is… uncomfortable. And sometimes… loud. I hope that doesn’t bother you.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Goodstein. These things happen. It's good you're bringing it to my attention. “A lot of gas,” okay. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four weeks ago? It was not sudden, more… a slow build-up. I did not change anything in my diet, I don’t think. I eat mostly the same things. Sandwiches, soup… sometimes a little chicken. Nothing fancy. I do not remember eating anything… new that could cause this.
DOCTOR: Alright, three to four weeks, gradual onset, no dietary changes that you recall. And you said it’s uncomfortable... can you describe that discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, uncomfortable is… a good word. It is a fullness, mostly. Like… too much air inside. And sometimes it is a cramping feeling. Not bad pain, but… noticeable. It happens after I eat, usually. Not right away, but maybe an hour or two after. And… well, sometimes it happens when I am… resting. Like sitting on the couch. It is… awkward.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness, cramping, occurring one to two hours after eating, and also at rest. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, aside from the gas, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No… not really. My stomach does not hurt before the gas, if that makes sense. No nausea, no… changes in how I go to the bathroom. I have been… regular, you could say. And no… weight loss. I feel… okay, otherwise. A little tired sometimes, but I think that is just from work. It is a busy place, the fast food place.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain before the gas, normal bowel movements, no weight loss, just some fatigue from work. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I have not been to a doctor in… a long time, to be honest. Just for check-ups, when I was younger. I do not have any… serious problems. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. I do have Medicare, so they would know if I did, I suppose. I try to stay healthy. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medical conditions. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never been in the hospital. And no surgeries, either. I… I have been very lucky, I think. A few broken bones when I was a boy, playing with my friends, but nothing… serious. Nothing that needed a hospital or an operation. Just bumps and scrapes, mostly.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… hmm. My mother, she is… gone now. And my father, he passed away many years ago. They… they both had stomach problems, I think. My mother had… indigestion, sometimes. And my father, he had… well, I don’t know exactly. Just… stomach troubles. Nothing serious, as far as I know. They were not ones for going to the doctor much, either. It was a different time, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of stomach issues in the family, but nothing specific. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I do not smoke. Never have. And I do not drink alcohol, either. Too expensive, mostly. And… well, I am not that type. I do not use any… recreational drugs. I work hard, I like to eat, and I like to watch television. That is my life. Very simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing. I do not take any pills. Not even for a headache. I just… try to rest. And drink some water. I do not like taking medicine if I can avoid it. It always makes me feel… strange. I prefer to let things heal on their own, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Goodstein, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and make sure everything sounds normal. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better. Please, go ahead. I hope it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your stomach with this. It might be a little cold. Take a few deep breaths for me. Okay… and a little pressure here… any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. It is… a little uncomfortable, but not pain. Just… pressure. Like… a full feeling. It is… hard to explain. It is not like a sharp pain, or anything. Just… fullness. It feels… bubbly, almost. Like there is something moving around inside.
DOCTOR: Alright, I hear some normal bowel sounds, a little bit of gurgling, which isn’t unusual. Your abdomen is soft, no masses that I can feel. You don’t seem to be in any acute distress. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing excessive gas, possibly related to something you're eating or how your body is processing food. However, we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: That… that makes sense, Doctor. I was hoping it was just something simple. So… what do we do now? Do I need… tests? Or… medicine? I am a little worried, to be honest. I just want to be able to sit on the couch without… embarrassing myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Goodstein. We'll take it one step at a time. To start, I'd like to order a simple blood test to check for any underlying issues, like celiac disease or lactose intolerance. And I'm going to recommend a trial of an over-the-counter medication called simethicone, which can help reduce gas. We’ll also keep a food diary for a week, to see if we can pinpoint any foods that might be triggering your symptoms. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… reasonable. A blood test, the simethicone… and the food diary. I can do that. I will write down everything I eat. Even the small things. And… where do I get the simethicone? At the… drug store? I am willing to try anything. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can get simethicone at any drugstore. It’s sold under various brand names, like Gas-X or Mylanta Gas. Here’s the lab order, and this handout explains how to keep the food diary. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and how you’re feeling. If your symptoms worsen significantly before then—severe pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or blood in your stool—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. That… that is very helpful. A blood test, the simethicone, the diary… and the follow-up. I will do my best to follow your instructions. Thank you very much for your time and patience. I appreciate it. I feel… a little better, just knowing what we are going to do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. It was my pleasure. Remember, if anything changes or worsens, don't hesitate to contact us. And try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. .
