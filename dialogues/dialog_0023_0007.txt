DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My back… it’s been painful. I want to get this sorted quickly, if that’s alright. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Quickly” is relative, of course, but we’ll do our best. Now, tell me about this back pain. Where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: It’s… lower back, mostly. Right across here. <gestures to the small of her back with both hands> And sometimes it shoots down my leg, the left one. Not all the time, just when I move certain ways. It started a few weeks back, after I was working on a particularly difficult stretch of fence.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, after fence work… alright. And on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now… maybe a six? It’s not constant, but when I try to bend over, or lift something… it goes up to an eight, quickly. It eases off when I sit still.
DOCTOR: An eight with exertion, six at rest… not ideal. Do you recall anything specific about how it started during the fence work?
PATIENT: I remember it was a hot day. The post holes were hard, rocky soil. I had to really put my back into it, hammering the posts. I felt a sharp pain, like a muscle pulled, but I kept going. Didn’t think much of it at first, just figured I was sore. But it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: A sharp pain initially, then persisting soreness… not surprising. And has anything made it better since then?
PATIENT: Not really. I tried some over-the-counter pain relievers, the kind you get at the store. They take the edge off, maybe, but don’t fix it. Mostly I just try to avoid bending and lifting. Which is difficult, with my work, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Avoiding it isn't a long-term solution, of course. Let's get a bit more detail. Does the pain radiate anywhere else besides down your leg?
PATIENT: No, just the leg. Sometimes a little ache in my hip on the same side, but it’s not bad. It’s mostly the back and the leg. And it’s worse after I’ve been on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to need to ask a few more general questions. Have you had any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Just the pain. It’s a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes a sharp stabbing feeling if I move wrong. But no numbness. I can feel everything.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, have you ever had back problems before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I've been sore after hard work, of course. But nothing that lasted this long, or hurt this much. This is… different. I’m usually quite strong, you know, for my size. <she flexes a bicep briefly>
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about other medical conditions. Do you have any other health problems – diabetes, arthritis, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Just my back, now. And… I'm a widow. My husband passed five years ago. I get Medicare, if that helps. I don’t really go to the doctor much. Mostly just for check-ups, when they tell me to. I’ve always been healthy. Until this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Medicare is helpful to know. And no other significant medical history. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, besides the pain relievers you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just the over-the-counter pain relievers, when I need them. Nothing else. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. <she pauses> Is this going to take much longer? I promised old Man Hemlock I’d help him repair his fence today.
DOCTOR: We’re almost done with the questions, Ms. Reihner. Just a few more, then we'll do a brief physical examination. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything, take anything, usually. <she frowns> Though, I don’t want to take anything, if I don’t have to. And I really should get back to Hemlock’s fence...
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. And I don't drink. Never had the taste for it. Always been a clear head, you see. <she looks expectantly at Dr. Versace> Are we finished with the questions now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Reihner, we are. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical examination. Just so I can assess your back and leg. Can you lie down on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright. If you need me to. <She carefully gets up from the chair, a slight wince crossing her face, and walks toward the examination table. She sits down gingerly.> Just try to be quick, if you would, Doctor. I’m not fond of being prodded and poked.
DOCTOR: I will be as efficient as possible, Ms. Reihner. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your back to assess tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. First, can you point to the exact spot where you feel the most pain?
PATIENT: Right here. <She points to a spot low on her back, slightly to the left of her spine.> And a little bit on either side of it. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, but it’s mostly focused in this area. And when you press here... <she anticipates the touch, bracing herself slightly.> It hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. Tenderness present on palpation, localized to the lumbar region… And I’m going to assess your range of motion now. Can you bend forward and touch your toes, as comfortably as possible?
PATIENT: Oof! I can’t get all the way. It hurts too much. This far is about as good as I can do. <She points to a point about a foot above the floor.> It pulls in my back when I try to go further. And it shoots pain down my leg.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited forward flexion, pain radiating down the left leg with movement… Now, can you lie flat on your back?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. <She carefully lies back down on the examination table, adjusting her position slightly.> Is this going to involve lifting my leg? I don’t like when they lift your leg, it always makes my back worse.
DOCTOR: We'll be gentle. I'm going to perform the straight leg raise test. I'm going to slowly lift your left leg, keeping it straight. Let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg. <She slowly begins to lift Lakiya’s left leg, observing her facial expression and asking periodically> How are you feeling so far, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes… that’s it. That’s the pain. Down my leg. About halfway up. Please stop. That’s enough. That really hurts. <She winces, clutching at her back.> Don't lift it any higher.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We’ll stop there. Positive straight leg raise test… <She makes a note on the chart, then examines Lakiya's reflexes and strength in her legs and feet.> Your reflexes and strength appear normal. However, there is tenderness on palpation of the lumbar spine, limited range of motion, and a positive straight leg raise on the left side. This suggests possible nerve involvement. Now, I want to take a look at your medical history. <She turns to the computer and begins to review Lakiya’s chart.> It says here you haven't had many doctor's visits...
PATIENT: That’s right. I don’t bother the doctors unless I absolutely have to. Always been healthy, as I said. This back pain is… new. <She shifts uncomfortably on the examination table, waiting.> Are you going to send me for one of those… scanning things? The ones where you lie in a tube? I don’t like those either.
DOCTOR: We're not going to jump to scanning things just yet, Ms. Reihner. Based on what I’m seeing and feeling, I believe this is likely a lumbar strain with possible disc involvement causing nerve irritation. However, to rule out anything more serious, I would like to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine. It’s relatively quick, and will give us a better picture of the bones in your back. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An X-ray… alright. If you think it’s necessary. But I really need to get back to work. Old Man Hemlock is counting on me. How long will this take? And will it make my back hurt worse? I don’t want to be laid up for days. <She looks at Dr. Versace expectantly, a worried expression on her face.>
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself will only take a few minutes, Ms. Reihner. And it shouldn't make your back hurt worse. It's just a quick imaging procedure. We’ll get the results back quickly. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to help with the pain and inflammation. Also, I want you to start some gentle stretching exercises, focusing on strengthening your core muscles. I'll have the nurse print out a handout with some examples. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A muscle relaxant and some stretches. And the X-ray. If it gets me back to work, I suppose it’s worth it. Will the muscle relaxant make me… sleepy? I have things to do. And can you write down those exercises in big letters? My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. <She pauses, then adds> And tell the nurse to hurry, please. Old Man Hemlock is waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, the muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, so be careful driving or operating machinery. We'll start with a low dose, and you can adjust as needed. And the nurse will be happy to provide the exercises in large print. I'll write the prescriptions now, and we'll get the X-ray ordered. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. As long as I can get back to work soon. I really appreciate you trying to be quick, Doctor. It means a lot. <She carefully sits up from the examination table, wincing slightly.> Now, where do I go for the X-ray? And will someone tell me how to read these prescriptions? I’ve never had to take anything like this before.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. The X-ray department is just down the hall to your left. The nurse will provide you with detailed instructions on how to take the medications and will explain the prescriptions to you thoroughly. She’ll also schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. Now, let’s get you scheduled for that X-ray and get you on your way to feeling better. I'll have the nurse come in to assist you. <She presses the call button on the intercom.>
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. <She waits patiently, hoping the nurse arrives quickly. She subtly stretches her back, testing the pain.> Hopefully, this will be over soon. I really need to get back to Hemlock’s fence.
DOCTOR: .
