DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh... right. They said something about a check-up? For... work? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I do a lot of ushering, ticket taking... that sort of thing. Just need to get it over with, if you don't mind. I have a show to get back to.
DOCTOR: A check-up for work, you say. And you usher and take tickets… Alright. Well, a general check-up is fine. But “fuzzy” isn't particularly helpful, Mr. Krahn. Can you be a bit more specific about why your employer is sending you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. See, this is what I mean about fuzzy. Something about… a performance physical? Maybe? They said something about needing clearance. Honestly, I just show up and do my job. I don’t usually ask a lot of questions. It involves standing a lot, mostly. And smiling. Is that... helpful?
DOCTOR: "Performance physical"... Right. Standing and smiling. That clarifies… marginally. Alright. So, we'll do a basic assessment. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Not… really. I used to, a long time ago. But things… happened. Divorce, mostly. Changed things. I’m pretty healthy, though, I think. I haven’t been sick sick in years. Just aches and pains, you know? Old age. I don't recall the name of my last doctor, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had any significant illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Nothing major comes to mind. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I guess. And… a bad case of the flu once, but that's about it. No surgeries, no hospitals. I try to avoid those places. Is this taking long? I really should be getting back...
DOCTOR: It's taking as long as it needs to, Mr. Krahn. Your employer requires this assessment, and I need a complete history to ensure it's accurate. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh! Family. Right. My… mother lived to be a very old age. Very healthy, for the most part. Father… not so much. He had… something with his heart, I think. But I don’t know details. We weren't close. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is terrible. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. Though, I try to avoid spicy food. It doesn’t agree with my stomach. But that’s a preference, not an allergy. Is this almost done?
DOCTOR: One last set of questions, then we’ll move onto a physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Never really needed to. Just… occasional aspirin for a headache, maybe. But that’s very rare. Truly, Doctor, I think I'm quite healthy. Can we just… get this over with? I'm starting to feel a little anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Very well. Let's proceed with the physical exam then. Please step onto the scale for me. And please remove your shoes and any heavy outerwear. I need an accurate weight and height.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just... hurry, please? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: 118 pounds… and 199 centimeters. That's… quite slender, Mr. Krahn. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Please extend your left arm. And I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Slender? I’ve always been on the thin side. It’s just… my build. Is that going to hurt? I don't like things tight around my arm. It makes me a bit claustrophobic, actually.
DOCTOR: It won’t hurt, Mr. Krahn. Just relax. Breathing normally, please. Heart rate is regular… a little rapid, perhaps. Lung sounds are clear… but slightly diminished. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please sit comfortably.
PATIENT: Diminished? What does that mean? Is something wrong? I told you, I’m usually fine. Just a bit anxious, maybe. All this poking and prodding... it’s unsettling. Please just tell me if something is seriously wrong. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: “Diminished” simply means they are not as robust as I would expect. It could be nothing, Mr. Krahn. Or it could indicate… reduced lung capacity. We'll need to investigate further. Now, please extend your arms. I'm going to check your reflexes. This will be quick. Just relax.
PATIENT: Hammer? Now what is that for? Is this some kind of test? I really don’t like this, Doctor. I’m starting to feel quite faint. Just… please be gentle. I have sensitive nerves.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… diminished in both arms. And slightly asymmetrical. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. And please try to relax your abdomen. It will be much easier for me to assess.
PATIENT: Abdomen? What are you looking for? I haven't been feeling any pain, if that's what you mean. This is all very… invasive. Please hurry, Doctor. I really need to get back to work. It's a very important show.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is… soft. No masses palpated. But there is some tenderness in the upper quadrants. Alright, Mr. Krahn. That concludes the physical examination. Based on what I’ve observed, and your… limited medical history, I believe we need to conduct some further testing. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a chest X-ray, and a CT scan of the abdomen.
PATIENT: CT scan? Blood tests? What’s wrong? Is it something serious? I told you, I'm fine! I just need to get back to work! A show is opening, Doctor! People are depending on me. You can’t just… order a bunch of tests! What did you find? Tell me now!
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, please calm down. I understand your concern, but I need to be thorough. Your diminished reflexes, decreased lung capacity, and tenderness in your abdomen are concerning. It could be a number of things – pneumonia, a possible neurological issue, even… something more serious. I’m not saying you have anything definitively wrong. But these findings require further investigation to rule out potentially serious conditions. The tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. I'll have the order sent to the lab immediately. They will contact you to schedule the appointments. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid strenuous activity. And if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant abdominal discomfort, you should go to the emergency room immediately. Here’s the referral for the lab and imaging center. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Emergency room? This sounds terrible! I… I don’t understand. A show… opening night… No. No, this can’t be happening. Can’t you just… give me something for the anxiety? Maybe it's just stress? Please. Just something to calm me down. I have to go. I have to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I will not prescribe medication based on your self-diagnosis of “stress.” Your symptoms require proper investigation. I strongly advise you to follow my recommendations. Ignoring these findings could have serious consequences. However, I understand your anxiety. I can offer a referral to a psychologist for stress management techniques. But that is in addition to, not instead of, the necessary medical testing. Here. This is a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a psychologist specializing in performance anxiety. Do not dismiss these concerns, Mr. Krahn. And if your condition worsens, please seek immediate medical attention. .
