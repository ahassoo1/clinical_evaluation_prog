DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Hmm… let me see. My… my son, he said I should come. Something about… needing to know what kind of blood I have? It’s a bit foggy, honestly. He worries so much.
DOCTOR: Right. “What kind of blood you have.” Okay. So, your son is concerned about… your blood type, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Blood type. He said it was… important. For, uh… just in case. He's a good boy, always thinking ahead. I don’t recall why it’s important, though. It feels like something he mentioned about… a hospital? Or maybe a form? Oh dear, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, knowing your blood type is generally a good thing to know, for medical reasons. It's helpful in emergencies, as you said. But I'm a little confused why your son specifically brought you in for that today. Do you have any other symptoms or concerns that brought you in?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, no, nothing like that, dear. I feel alright, for my age. A little creaky in the mornings, but that’s just… getting old, I suppose. No, no symptoms. Just this blood type thing. He can be quite insistent, that boy. Is it… is it something serious to not know? He made it sound so important, but I don’t want to bother you if it isn’t.
DOCTOR: Well, it's not usually a serious issue to not know your blood type, no. But it can definitely make things easier if we did know. Let’s start with some basics then. Have you ever had a blood test before, for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… blood tests. Let me think… I had some tests done, oh, a long time ago. When I was… sick. Not seriously sick, but a bad flu, I think. And… when I broke my wrist, maybe? Yes, that’s right. They took blood then. But I don’t remember what they did with it. Or if they told me anything about it. Everything feels like such a long time ago, you know? It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. So you’ve had bloodwork done before, but you don’t recall your blood type specifically. No worries. I can order a simple blood test to determine that for you today. Just to be safe. Now, while we’re at it, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Chronic conditions… Let me see. The doctor, years ago, told me my… my pressure was a little high sometimes. He put me on a little pill for it. I took it for a while, then… well, I stopped, I suppose. I can’t quite remember why. And… no, nothing else, I don’t think. I used to get terrible headaches, but those have gone away. Mostly. My knees ache, but that's just old age, isn't it? I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mrs. Nini. You are being helpful. It's common to forget details over time. You mentioned a pill for your blood pressure – do you remember the name of it, or what it looked like?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no, I don’t. It was a little white pill, I think. Or maybe a little yellow one. Everything looks the same after a while, you know? I used to keep them in a little bottle, but… well, the bottles got mixed up, and now I just take what my son gives me. He’s very good at keeping track of things. I really don’t remember the name of it, though. I'm sorry. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It can be, yes. Knowing what medications you've taken in the past helps us understand your overall health picture. And mixing up medications can sometimes cause problems. Let’s just say for now you are taking a pill for high blood pressure, as your son provides it. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything, pretty much. I used to love shellfish, but I haven’t had it in years. Not because of an allergy, just… didn’t feel like it anymore. I used to react to bee stings as a child, but that was a long, long time ago. I haven’t been stung in decades. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Unless… my son mentioned something about a rash once, but I don’t recall what caused it. Honestly, my memory is just… patchy. Is this making things difficult? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It’s… alright, Mrs. Nini. We'll work through it. So, you might have a sensitivity to something, but you’re unsure. Okay. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, yes! I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… I broke my wrist, like I mentioned before. They had to put a cast on it. And… let me think… I think I was in the hospital when I was very young, with… with a bad fever? But I don't remember much about it. It was a very long time ago. That’s all I can think of, I’m afraid. I feel like I’m rambling. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mrs. Nini. You're not rambling. Just trying to get a complete picture. So, gallbladder removal, broken wrist, and childhood fever. And you’re currently taking a pill for blood pressure, as given to you by your son. Now, one last thing for now. Do you have any family history of serious illnesses, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Family history… That’s a hard one. My mother… she died when I was young. I think it was… her heart. But I don’t remember the details. My father… he lived a long life, but he had… I don’t know. Something with his lungs, maybe? He smoked a lot. And my brother… he had… something with his stomach, I think. But everything is so long ago, and I wasn’t very close to him. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. Everyone always said our family was… tough. We didn’t talk much about illnesses. Is this information useful?
DOCTOR: It’s… something, yes. It sounds like there may be a family history of heart disease, lung problems, and possibly stomach issues. Alright. Given everything, I'd like to run some basic blood tests. Just to get a baseline and see how things are functioning. We'll check your blood type, kidney function, liver function, and some other routine things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests, yes. Just to be sure. That’s good. Are they… painful? I don’t like needles very much. And will it take long? I have an appointment with my hairdresser this afternoon. A very important appointment! I wouldn’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: No, the blood draw itself shouldn’t be painful, Mrs. Nini. Just a quick pinch. And it shouldn’t take long at all – maybe 15-20 minutes. I'll have the lab technician come in and draw the blood. I’ll also write you a note for your hairdresser, just in case. We can discuss the results when they come back, which should be in a few days. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor, about the note. Yes, that sounds… perfect. A quick pinch and then I can go to my hairdresser. Wonderful. Thank you. Is there anything else I need to do? Or just sit and wait? I do get a bit fidgety when I’m waiting. And I hope the lab technician is gentle! My veins aren’t very good, you know. A bit… hidden.
DOCTOR: I’ll make a note of that for the lab technician. They’re very experienced. Just sit comfortably and try to relax. I'll have them come in right away. While you wait, I'll have my nurse bring you a glass of water. Just try to take deep breaths, and we'll get through this quickly. She will be right in.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very thoughtful. Water would be lovely. I do get a bit thirsty when I’m nervous. And I will try to breathe. Deep breaths. Yes. Thank you again for being so patient with me. It’s just… everything feels so blurry these days. I really appreciate you taking the time.
