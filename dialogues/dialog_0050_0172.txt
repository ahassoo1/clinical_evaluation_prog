DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, well. A social visit, I believe. My husband and I just moved here, you see. New area. Medicare said I should…establish care. It’s all rather tiresome, frankly. Do we have to go into details?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate that establishing care may seem…inconvenient, Ms. Engelhaupt, it is a necessary step for ensuring continuity of your healthcare, and frankly, allows me to properly assist you should any medical needs arise. Even a “social visit,” as you term it, provides an opportunity to review your medical history and current status. Therefore, yes, we do need to go into some details. To begin, have you been experiencing any health concerns recently?
PATIENT: Concerns? Goodness, at my age? What isn’t concerning? Honestly, I can’t recall anything specific. A little… stiffness, perhaps. But that’s just getting old, isn’t it? I assure you, Doctor, I’m quite resilient for my age. It’s probably nothing worth bothering you with.
DOCTOR: "Resilient" is admirable, Ms. Engelhaupt, however, even seemingly minor changes can be indicative of underlying issues. Stiffness, you say?
PATIENT: Well, yes. Mostly in the mornings. Getting out of bed is… an ordeal. And my back, sometimes. But I’ve always had a weak back. My mother always said so. Is this going to take long? I have an appointment with the garden club this afternoon, and they are very punctual.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Engelhaupt. We will proceed as efficiently as possible. This stiffness… is it accompanied by any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, yes, a little. Not a sharp pain, you understand. More of a…dull ache. It comes and goes. Honestly, it’s nothing I haven’t lived with for decades. Probably just arthritis. My sister had terrible arthritis. I really don’t see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Very well. And where exactly do you feel this ache, Ms. Engelhaupt?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, really. Lower back, mostly. And sometimes in my hips. It's hard to pinpoint. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not a doctor! I just want to get this over with. Is there a form I need to sign saying I’ve established care? Perhaps you could just skip to that part?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt, but a thorough assessment is crucial, even if you believe the issue is minor. To properly evaluate this “everywhere” pain, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? At my age? Really! I assure you, Doctor, I know my own body. And I haven't the time for…prodding and poking. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I think I've established enough care for one day. Where do I find the paperwork? I'd like to be on my way. This is simply…unnecessary. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Engelhaupt, while I respect your autonomy, refusing a basic assessment hinders my ability to provide appropriate care. However, I understand you wish to conclude this visit. I will prepare the necessary paperwork for establishing care. But I strongly advise you to reconsider scheduling a follow-up appointment for a more comprehensive evaluation. I will also document your refusal of the physical exam. The forms are there. Please complete them at your convenience. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
