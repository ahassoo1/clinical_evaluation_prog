DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I came in because… I wanted to get tested for HIV. I just… wanted to know my status, really. It's something I've been thinking about for a while now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shaub. That’s a very responsible decision. It’s good you’re taking this step. To start, could you tell me a little bit about why you’re wanting to get tested now?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Honestly? Just… peace of mind. My husband and I… we’ve been together a long time, but life happens, you know? And I just want to be sure. It’s been on my mind lately, and I’d rather know one way or the other. Is that… enough of a reason? I don't have any particular worries, just wanting to be cautious.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shaub. That is a perfectly valid reason. Peace of mind is always a good reason to seek medical attention. And being cautious is commendable. Now, have you ever had an HIV test before?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. This is my first time. I always… put it off, I suppose. It never felt… necessary before, but now… well, now it does. I hope that makes sense. Is it… a difficult test?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Shaub. Many people feel that way. The test itself is quite simple. We can do a blood draw, or a quick oral swab. The swab is less invasive, but the blood draw is generally considered more accurate, especially if it’s been a recent possible exposure. Do you have a preference?
PATIENT: Oh, a swab sounds… much better, honestly. I'm not fond of needles, if you don't mind. A blood draw… that sounds a bit daunting. Is the swab accurate enough? I want to be sure, of course, but if the swab is reliable, that would be wonderful.
DOCTOR: Yes, the oral swab is quite reliable, particularly with the newer tests we use. It’s generally very accurate, but if you’d prefer absolute certainty, we can still do a blood draw. It’s your decision entirely. The swab takes just a few minutes, and the results usually come back within 20-30 minutes. Before we proceed, though, I'd like to ask a few questions to get a better understanding of your risk factors, just to be thorough. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Questions are fine. I have nothing to hide. I just… want to do this right. Twenty to thirty minutes… that's good. I appreciate that it doesn’t take long. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shaub. Let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I've been very lucky in that regard. I watch my diet and try to get some exercise when I can, but… nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. My husband has high blood pressure, but I don't. Is that something you need a detailed history of? His medical records, I mean?
DOCTOR: No, that's alright, Ms. Shaub. His medical history isn’t necessary for this test. Just focusing on yours for now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a young girl, I had my tonsils removed, but that was… oh, goodness, over fifty years ago! And when I had my son, of course, I was in the hospital, but that was… well, a very long time ago now. Nothing since then, not even a broken bone. I’ve been quite careful, I think.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Ms. Shaub. Now, concerning medications – are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, really. And sometimes I take something for my knees, when they're acting up. It's just ibuprofen, nothing fancy. I don't take anything regularly, not unless I'm feeling particularly sore. I try to avoid medications whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve always been pretty good with allergies. My husband is allergic to shellfish, but I’m perfectly fine with it. Nothing bothers me, thankfully. I feel quite lucky in that regard as well. Is this getting to the important part now? The questions about… risky behavior?
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Ms. Shaub. And it’s perfectly alright if you're feeling hesitant. These questions are simply part of assessing your risk factors, and your answers are confidential. Now, have you ever shared needles with anyone, or injected any substances not prescribed by a doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. I've never even considered anything like that. I've always been very cautious, as I said. That's… that's not something I would ever do. I hope that's clear enough. Is there anything else? I’m happy to answer, but those questions… they’re a little unsettling.
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Ms. Shaub. And I apologize if the questions are unsettling; we simply need to cover all bases. Now, in the past five years, have you had any sexual contact with anyone who isn’t your husband?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… no. Not since I’ve been married. My husband and I… we've been together for a very long time, and we've always been faithful to each other. That's… that's very important to both of us. It’s been… decades now. So, no. No, I haven't. Is that… satisfactory? I just… I hope you understand. This is a bit personal, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Perfectly satisfactory, Ms. Shaub. And you’re right, these are personal questions, and I appreciate you answering them honestly. One last question, and it's just a precaution. Have you ever received a blood transfusion, or had any organ transplants?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I've never needed a blood transfusion, and certainly no organ transplants! I've been very fortunate in that regard. I think… I think that's everything, isn't it? Can we… can we get on with the test now? I'm ready, if you are.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Shaub, I believe that is everything. Thank you for your honesty and patience. Now, let’s proceed with the oral swab test. It’s very quick. I'll just need to swab the inside of your cheek for a few seconds. Please open wide…
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead, please. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. This whole thing… it’s a little nerve-wracking, you know? But I'm glad I'm doing it. I just want to know.
DOCTOR: All done, Ms. Shaub. That was very quick, wasn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, it was! Barely felt a thing. Now what? Do we just… wait? How long will it take? And… what if it’s positive?
DOCTOR: Yes, we just wait. The results should be available in about 20-30 minutes. I'm going to step out to process some other paperwork, but I'll be right back with the results as soon as they're ready. Now, about the possibility of a positive result... If that were to happen, it's important to remember that HIV is a manageable condition these days. There are effective treatments available that can allow you to live a long and healthy life. We would discuss all your options, and I would provide you with resources and support. We can also discuss testing for your husband, if you’d like. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. We'll focus on getting the results first. I’ll be right back. Don't hesitate to call out if you need anything.
PATIENT: .
