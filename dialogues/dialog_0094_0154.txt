DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s my… waterworks. They bother me. A lot. It keeps… happening again and again. I don’t… I don’t rightly recall when it started, just that it does. It's… unpleasant. I hope we can get it sorted, quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Waterworks” – so you're experiencing some urinary issues. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. “Happening again and again” – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. “Urinary issues”… yes, that sounds… proper. It feels like I need to… go, quite often. Even when I haven't had much to drink. And it… burns, sometimes. Not always, but often enough to be bothersome. I try to ignore it, but it’s… difficult. It's a… a nuisance, really. I don't remember any specific changes, just that it started being… frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination and sometimes a burning sensation. That gives me a starting point. When you say “frequent,” roughly how many times a day would you say you’re going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… I’m terrible with numbers. More than usual, certainly. Before… well, I don't recall exactly before. But now… I’d say… at least every couple of hours during the day. And… and maybe once or twice at night. It wakes me up, sometimes. It's… inconvenient, to say the least. Is that… is that a lot? I honestly don’t know.
DOCTOR: It's helpful you're sharing this with me, Ms. Wease. Yes, going every couple of hours, especially waking up at night, is more frequent than we’d like to see. And the burning sensation is something we need to investigate. Now, to get a clearer picture, could you describe the burning sensation a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… well, it's not a pain, exactly. More like… a stinging. A discomfort. It happens when I… when I go. It's not with every time, like I said, but often enough. It starts… down there, where you… well, you know. It doesn’t last long, but it’s… unsettling. It's hard to explain. And it’s… it makes me feel… tired. Just thinking about it makes me weary.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a stinging sensation during urination, not a constant pain, and it happens intermittently. And you’ve noticed feeling tired as well. Now, let’s talk about what you drink in a typical day. What kinds of fluids do you usually consume, and about how much?
PATIENT: Oh, fluids… well, I drink… water, mostly. And coffee, in the mornings. Just one cup. Sometimes tea, if it’s cold. Not much juice, I don’t care for it. I don't drink… sodas, never have. As for how much… I try to drink enough, to be polite, but… I don’t measure or anything. Just a few glasses throughout the day. It’s hard to say exactly. I really don't keep track of such things. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Wease. Just water, a cup of coffee, and some tea. It sounds like a reasonable amount of fluid intake. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any change in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood… no, I haven’t seen any blood. Not that I recall, anyway. The color… it's usually… yellow. Sometimes lighter, sometimes darker, depending on how much water I drink, I suppose. As for the smell… well, it smells like… urine. I don’t… I don’t sniff it or anything! I don’t pay much attention, to be honest. It hasn't… bothered me, if that’s what you mean. I really just want this… stinging to stop. It's quite distressing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wease. No blood, no significant change in color or smell, and just wanting the stinging to stop. That's perfectly reasonable. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… well, I was… I was married, once. Does that count? No, seriously… I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing serious. My doctor… well, I saw Doctor Ramirez for years, but that was… a long time ago. He never said I had anything… specific. Just the normal check-ups, you know? I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I’m divorced now, you see, and… things got complicated. I really don't recall any… diagnoses. I just want this over with, if possible. It’s… exhausting talking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. It sounds like you haven’t had any major medical diagnoses in the past. And it's perfectly alright if remembering details is difficult. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… let me think. When I was a girl, I had my tonsils out. That’s it. I don’t believe so. Nothing else. I had a… a difficult pregnancy, once, but I didn’t need a… a C-section or anything. Just… bed rest. And no hospitalizations, not unless you count when I had the flu, once, and stayed home for a week. But that wasn’t a hospital, just… my sofa. No, no surgeries, no hospitalizations. I’m… quite healthy, usually. This… waterworks thing is very unusual for me. I really want to be finished with this now, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child, a difficult pregnancy with bed rest, but no other surgeries or hospitalizations. That's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any medical conditions like diabetes, kidney problems, or urinary issues?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s… difficult. My mother… she had a bad heart, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my brother… he drank too much. He had… problems. I don't recall any specific… kidney issues or anything like that. My father… he was a quiet man. He worked in the fields. I don't know much about his… health, to be honest. We weren't… close. No, I don’t think so. No one in my family had… waterworks problems, like me. It’s all very… hazy. I really… I really just want this sorted out, Doctor. Is there anything I can do to make it go away?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. A mother with heart problems, a brother with alcohol issues, and not much known about your father’s health. Okay. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Heavens, no! I've never smoked in my life. Never even tried it. It’s… dreadful. No, absolutely not. I don't approve of it. My mother always said it was… bad for you. No, no smoking. And I don’t drink much alcohol, just a small glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But not every night. Is that… acceptable? I really want this over with, Doctor. It's tiring recalling all this.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Wease. No smoking and only occasional, small amounts of alcohol. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. I don't think so. I had a rash once, when I was a child, from… poison ivy, I think. But that wasn't a medication. And I can’t recall any… allergic reactions to any drugs. No, I don't have any allergies, not that I'm aware of. No, absolutely none. Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite healthy, usually. This… waterworks thing is very distressing, and I just want it to stop. Is there anything you can do? I'm really tired now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease. No known allergies. Thank you for providing me with all of this information. It’s been very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a brief examination of your pelvic area. This will help me to narrow down the possible causes of your symptoms. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I suppose so. If you have to. I don’t… I don’t like being poked and prodded, but if it will help… Yes, alright. But please be… gentle. And quick, if possible. I’m really not feeling well, and I’m… a bit anxious. Just… please be as quick and gentle as you can. Is that alright? I really just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. I will be as gentle and quick as possible. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay. Everything sounds normal there. Now, I'm going to ask you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to do a quick external examination of your pelvic area. I'll use gloves and will explain each step before I do it. It’s just a quick check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… lie down? Well… alright. But please be… discreet. And quick. I’m really not comfortable with this, Doctor. I’ve… I haven’t been examined in years. Just… please be as fast as you can. And explain what you’re doing, like you said. I’m… a bit nervous. Is it going to hurt? I don’t want any… pain. Just get it over with, please. Quickly and gently. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. I will be as discreet and gentle as possible. I will explain each step before I do it, and we can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen and then do a quick external examination of your pelvic area. It shouldn’t hurt, but you may feel some pressure. Okay. Everything feels normal overall, but I do notice a little tenderness when I press here, in your lower abdomen. It’s not severe, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Alright. Now, I think it’s best to order a urine test to check for infection or other abnormalities. This will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a urine test? Yes, alright. That sounds… sensible. If it will help find out what’s wrong. It’s… a little undignified, but I suppose it has to be done. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And it won't… hurt, will it? Just… please hurry. I'm really tired now, Doctor. And a bit… distressed. Just a urine test, then? Nothing else? I just want to know what's wrong and get it fixed. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a urine test. It’s a very simple procedure, Ms. Wease. You’ll just need to provide a sample in a cup. It won’t hurt at all. The nurse will give you instructions on how to collect the sample. While we wait for the results, I also want to discuss some general measures you can take to help relieve your symptoms. Drinking plenty of fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and urinating frequently can all be helpful. Once we have the urine test results, we can determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… fluids and avoiding… things. Yes, alright. I can try that. I suppose it’s better than nothing. Drinking more water… I can manage that. And avoiding coffee… well, it's not my favorite anyway. I just want this… discomfort to stop. And to know what's wrong. Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? Please be honest. I don’t want to be… alarmed. Just tell me the truth. And hurry with the results, please. I’m really anxious now.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Wease. It’s good that you’re asking directly. At this point, it’s too early to say definitively whether it's something serious. The most common cause of your symptoms is a urinary tract infection, or UTI. UTIs are usually easily treated with antibiotics. However, there are other possible causes, and that’s why it’s important to get the urine test results back. I’ll have the nurse come in to collect the urine sample right away. It typically takes about an hour to get the results back, and I will let you know as soon as I have them. In the meantime, please try to relax and drink plenty of fluids. I'll also have the nurse bring you a glass of water now. Just try to take deep breaths, and we’ll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll be right back with you as soon as I have the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… antibiotics… that sounds… hopeful. A UTI… well, if that’s all it is… Yes, alright. Water… that’s good. I can manage that. Just… hurry, please. I’m really anxious. And… thank you, Doctor. For being… kind. Just get the results quickly, and… tell me what to do. I want this… discomfort to stop, and… to go home. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. I understand. I will get the results back to you as quickly as possible. I’ll let you know as soon as I have them, and we’ll discuss the best course of treatment. The nurse will be in shortly to collect your sample. Please let me know if you need anything at all. I’ll be right back.
