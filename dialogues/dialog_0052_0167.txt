DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my foot… it’s been botherin’ me. A sore, really. It won’t go away, and it hurts when I walk. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It’s a problem, because I like to walk with the little ones at the school.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Mr. Stoegbauer. A sore on your foot that’s causing pain with walking, particularly when you're walking with the children at school. I understand how concerning that can be. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you describe the sore itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it? It’s… red. And kinda deep. Not a little scrape, you know? It’s… wet sometimes. And it smells a little bit. I try to keep it clean, but it just doesn’t seem to get better. It’s been like this for… oh, maybe a month now? Longer, even. I forget easy these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Stoegbauer. Red, deep, sometimes wet, with a slight odor… and present for at least a month, possibly longer. That helps me begin to form a picture. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms associated with the sore?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. My leg feels kinda warm sometimes, the one with the sore. Not hot, just… warmer than the other one. And sometimes I feel a little tired, but I’m old, so maybe that’s just old age! I don’t know if that’s the foot or just me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Stoegbauer. Warmth in the leg and feeling a bit tired. It’s good you’re aware of these things and trying to differentiate what might be related to the foot versus just general aging. To get a more complete picture, could you please tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Oh dear. Well, the doctor told me a long time ago I got the sugar sickness. Diabetes, they call it. Been havin’ that for… a long time. And I had my gallbladder out when I was younger. That was a bad time. Other than that… I don’t really remember much. I see the doctor every year for check-ups, but I forget what he tells me half the time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Stoegbauer. Diabetes and a past gallbladder removal. That’s very helpful information. Knowing you have diabetes is particularly relevant given the symptoms you’re describing with your foot. Do you currently take any medications for your diabetes or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I take a little white pill every morning. And a little blue one at night. I think they’re for the sugar. The doctor keeps changing them, so I don't always remember the names. And sometimes I take something for my blood pressure, but only when it gets high. My daughter helps me keep track of it all, mostly. She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s good you have your daughter helping you with your medications. Knowing you’re on medication for diabetes and blood pressure is important. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything my wife used to make. She made good food. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. But I could be wrong. It’s been so long.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Stoegbauer. No known allergies. I appreciate you sharing that, and I understand your thoughts about your wife. To get a clearer picture of what's going on with your foot, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. My foot is achin’ a bit, so if it hurts, just tell me. I’m an old man, I’ve had worse.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Stoegbauer. I appreciate your trust. Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. I've examined your foot. I observe redness and an open sore on the bottom of your foot near your toes. The area is warm to the touch and tender when I palpate it. Your pulses are present, but slightly diminished. I also note some surrounding inflammation. It appears there is some depth to the wound. Based on my examination and your history of diabetes, I'm concerned about a possible diabetic foot ulcer. These ulcers can be slow to heal and prone to infection.
PATIENT: Diabetic… foot… ulcer? That sounds… bad. Infection? Oh dear. What does that mean, Doctor? Will I have to have my leg cut off? My daughter always worries about things like that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Stoegbauer, and it’s perfectly natural to feel worried when you hear terms like “ulcer” and “infection.” Let me assure you, amputation is not the first course of action, and in many cases, it’s avoidable. However, because you have diabetes, it’s important to take this seriously and address it promptly. A diabetic foot ulcer is essentially an open sore that develops on the foot due to nerve damage and poor circulation associated with diabetes. The diminished sensation makes it harder to notice small injuries, and the poor circulation slows down the healing process, making them susceptible to infection. To determine the extent of the ulcer and rule out any deeper infection, I’d like to order some laboratory tests, including a blood sugar level, a complete blood count, and a wound culture. The wound culture will help us identify any bacteria present and determine the appropriate antibiotic treatment if needed. I also recommend an X-ray of your foot to check for any underlying bone infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests… X-rays… Oh my. That sounds like a lot. But if it helps, Doctor, then yes. Do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want it to get better, so I can walk with the little ones again. They miss me at school. And I don’t want my daughter to worry too much. She’s been through enough.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Stoegbauer. You want to get back to walking with the children and minimize worry for your daughter. That's a very admirable goal, and we will work together to achieve that. Alright, I am ordering the blood work and the X-ray now. The lab will draw a sample of your blood, and then you’ll go to the radiology department for the X-ray. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, it's crucial to keep weight off your foot as much as possible. I recommend avoiding walking on it unless absolutely necessary. I will also give you a prescription for a special dressing to keep the wound clean and protected. Additionally, I’ll provide a referral to a podiatrist for specialized wound care. They are experts in treating foot ulcers, and their expertise will be invaluable. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Podia… what did you call them? Experts in feet? That sounds good. I'm glad you’re sending me to someone who knows about feet. And a special dressing… okay. Keep weight off my foot… that’ll be hard. But I’ll try. I guess my question is… how long will it take to get better? Will I be able to walk with the children this school year?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Mr. Stoegbauer, and one that I wish I could answer definitively. The healing time for a diabetic foot ulcer can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the size and depth of the ulcer, your blood sugar control, your circulation, and overall health. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to give a precise timeframe without the results of the tests. However, with proper wound care, good blood sugar control, and the expertise of the podiatrist, many ulcers can heal within several weeks to several months. Our goal is to get you back to walking with the children as soon as it's safely possible. We will monitor your progress closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed. I will also discuss strategies with you to optimize your blood sugar control, as that is crucial for healing. To give you a more realistic expectation, we need to see the test results first. Once we have those, we can develop a more tailored plan and provide a more accurate estimate of healing time. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’ll try my best to take care of my foot and keep my sugar down. And I’ll see the podiatrist. Thank you for your help, Doctor Shely. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Remember, we’re a team in this, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood and provide you with instructions for the X-ray. Once you've completed those tests, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any signs of infection, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, fever, or pus drainage, please contact the clinic immediately. Take care, Mr. Stoegbauer, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
