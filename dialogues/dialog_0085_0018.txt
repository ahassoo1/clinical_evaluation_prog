DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I’m not entirely certain why I’m here, if you don’t mind my honesty. Something about… going to the bathroom quite a bit, I believe? It’s all rather hazy, to be frank. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. It's common for things to be a little unclear, and we can certainly sort it out together. So, you've been experiencing a frequent need to use the bathroom?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. More often than… well, than is comfortable. It's not painful, thankfully, just… disruptive. And a good deal of it, each time. I find myself planning my day around it, which is rather silly, isn’t it? Do you need me to… elaborate on what I mean by “a good deal”? I apologize for the vagueness. It’s terribly frustrating for everyone, I expect.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Mr. Verbos. It's helpful that you’re able to describe it as disruptive and that you're planning your day around it. "A good deal" is fine, but if you could give me a rough estimate – perhaps how many times you're going to the bathroom in a typical day compared to, say, a few months ago – that would be very useful. And have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me see… a typical day… compared to a few months ago… Goodness. That’s a difficult question. I… used to be able to go several hours without a need, I think. Now? Perhaps every couple of hours, maybe less. It fluctuates. As for changes in the… output… I haven’t actively looked, if I’m honest. I suppose it looks normal. Pale yellow, like it should. I haven't detected any unusual smell, no. Is that something I should be doing? Checking the… odor? I feel terribly unobservant now.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Verbos, don't feel bad at all. It’s not something everyone does, but it can be helpful information. So, increased frequency over the last few months, pale yellow urine with no noticeable odor changes. Have you noticed any difficulty starting the stream of urine, or any feeling of not being able to empty your bladder completely?
PATIENT: No difficulty starting, thankfully. A strong stream, as it were. And… yes, now that you mention it, I do sometimes feel like there’s a little left behind. Not a significant amount, but… noticeable. It’s a bit of a relief to finally put a name to that feeling. I’ve just been assuming it was my imagination, perhaps. Is that… important? The feeling of incomplete emptying, I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Mr. Verbos. The feeling of incomplete emptying, along with the increased frequency, is helpful information. Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. I’ve been… rather thirsty lately, I suppose. More so than usual. I find myself reaching for water quite often. And… a bit tired, perhaps. Nothing dramatic, just… a general lack of energy. I thought it was just the summer heat, to be frank. Is that relevant? My wife, bless her soul, keeps telling me I should slow down, but… well, she always says that.
DOCTOR: Those are both relevant, Mr. Verbos – the increased thirst and the fatigue. Have you experienced any weight loss recently, even unintentional?
PATIENT: Weight loss… That’s a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, I must admit. My trousers feel a bit looser, perhaps. But that could be the heat, or… well, I’ve been eating less red meat, trying to be healthier. It's difficult to say. I wouldn’t say I’ve intentionally lost weight, but… a few pounds, perhaps, over the last month or so? It’s not something I’ve paid close attention to. I apologize for my lack of precision. It’s infuriating, this vagueness.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Verbos. We can work with that. A potential slight weight loss along with the increased frequency, thirst, fatigue, and feeling of incomplete emptying… Before we move on, have you had any fevers, chills, or any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No fevers or chills, Doctor. And no pain in my back or side. Not that I’ve noticed, at least. I'm rather good at ignoring discomfort, I'm afraid. My wife says it’s a Czech trait. Stubbornness, she calls it. But no, no pain. I can honestly say that. Is that… helpful? Knowing what isn’t happening? I sometimes feel like I’m providing more information about my general character than my symptoms.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Verbos! Knowing what isn't happening helps us narrow things down. Alright, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: A primary care physician… Yes, I believe so. Doctor Havelka. He’s… retired now, I think. I haven’t seen him in a couple of years. I used to go for annual checkups, but… well, things slipped when he left. I’m fairly healthy, generally. No major illnesses, as far as I know. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. And a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. I have a list of my medications at home, if that’s important. My wife keeps it meticulously organized.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Knowing about the high blood pressure is important, and we’ll get that list of medications shortly. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was a boy, a very long time ago. And… a hernia operation, perhaps fifteen years ago? It was quite minor, really. Recovered very quickly. And… no, I don’t believe I’ve been hospitalized for anything else. Nothing serious, at least. Just the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing memorable. Is that sufficient? It’s all rather hazy, as you know. I apologize for my poor recall. I’m afraid I’m not much help with specifics.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Mr. Verbos. You're providing what you recall, and that's perfectly fine. Appendix removal and a hernia repair. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems, cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a difficult one. My father had… heart problems, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young, so I don't recall the specifics. And my mother… she had diabetes, towards the end of her life. She wasn't very healthy, to be frank. As for other conditions… I’m not entirely certain. We weren’t a very close family, and medical information wasn’t something we discussed openly. My wife might know more, if you’d like to ask her. She has a remarkable memory for such things. I’m afraid I’m drawing a blank, as usual. Is it important to know about distant relatives? My grandmother, perhaps? I barely remember her.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Heart problems in your father and diabetes in your mother. We can certainly ask your wife for more details if you'd like. Now, let’s talk briefly about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’ve never smoked. Never had the inclination. My wife… she used to smoke, a very long time ago, but she quit years ago. I’m quite proud of her for that. A very healthy habit, quitting, of course. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. And a beer now and then. But nothing excessive. I try to maintain a moderate lifestyle. And I walk regularly, when the weather permits. I’m not a couch potato, if that’s what you’re asking. I like to keep active, as much as my aging body allows.
DOCTOR: Good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any allergic reactions to medications, as far as I recall. And no food allergies. I eat pretty much everything. My wife is the fussy eater, not me. She has a sensitive stomach, you see. But I… no, no allergies. I’m quite fortunate in that regard. I can’t think of anything at all that I’m allergic to. Is that… conclusive? Should I ask my wife, just to be certain? She’s remarkably thorough, as you know. I wouldn’t want to overlook anything important.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Verbos. No known allergies. Okay, thank you for all of that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. That will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment implicitly. Blood pressure, heart, lungs… abdominal exam. Go right ahead. I’m… not particularly fond of medical examinations, to be honest, but I understand they’re necessary. Just… please be gentle? My wife always says I have a delicate constitution. But do whatever you need to do. I’ll try to remain as still as possible.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verbos. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Not drastically high, but higher than we’d like. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, normal breath sounds. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I do feel a slightly enlarged bladder. Not significantly enlarged, but noticeable. That’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems relatively normal, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure and the enlarged bladder. Based on everything you’ve told me and the exam findings, I'm considering a few possibilities. The frequent urination, thirst, fatigue, and enlarged bladder point towards possible overactive bladder, diabetes, or even a urinary tract infection, although you don't have any pain or fever. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a blood glucose test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A urine analysis and a blood glucose test… Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever will help determine the cause. Overactive bladder, diabetes, urinary tract infection… I must confess, I’m not entirely familiar with those conditions. Are they… serious? I apologize for my ignorance, but I tend to avoid dwelling on medical matters. I trust your judgment implicitly, of course. Whatever tests you deem necessary, please proceed. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a garden party next week that I’d rather not miss. It’s my niece’s birthday. A small affair, but… important to her.
DOCTOR: They can be, Mr. Verbos, but many are manageable with medication or lifestyle changes. We'll know more once we have the results. The lab work should take about 2-3 business days. I’ll have the results sent to my office, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’d like you to try to drink a little less fluid in the evenings, especially caffeinated beverages, and try to empty your bladder completely each time you go. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Less fluid in the evenings… no caffeinated beverages… empty my bladder completely… Yes, that makes sense. I suppose I do have a tendency to sip water throughout the evening. And I suppose I don’t always… concentrate on emptying my bladder fully. I tend to rush things, if I’m honest. Well… yes, I suppose I have one question. Is there anything I should be… avoiding? Any particular foods or activities that might exacerbate the condition? I tend to garden quite a bit, quite strenuous work, actually. I wouldn’t want to make things worse. And… is there any chance it’s just… old age? I apologize for my rather blunt question, but… well, one does get older, doesn’t one?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Verbos. It’s good you’re thinking about those things. While aging can certainly contribute to some urinary changes, we want to rule out any underlying causes first. As for avoiding anything specifically, no, not at this point. Continue with your gardening, but be mindful of staying hydrated, especially in the heat. Try to take breaks and drink water gradually throughout the day, rather than large amounts at once. We’ll have a clearer picture once the lab results are back, and then we can discuss any necessary lifestyle modifications or treatment options. I'm going to write you a prescription for a repeat blood pressure check in one month, and I'll give you the lab requisition form now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Repeat blood pressure check… lab requisition… Yes, that’s very kind of you. No, I believe that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for your time and patience. You’ve been very… reassuring. I tend to worry, you see. It’s a Czech trait, I suspect. But you’ve put my mind at ease, at least for the moment. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with your receptionist, then. And… thank you again. .
