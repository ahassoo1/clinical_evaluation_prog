DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, it’s about feeling tired during the day, even though I’m using a machine at night for my sleep apnea. It just…doesn't seem to be helping as much as I thought it would.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're still experiencing daytime fatigue despite using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea. That’s good you're addressing it – it’s important to get that sorted. Could you tell me a little more about how tired you feel?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I’m falling asleep standing up, Doctor, but I definitely have to push myself to get through the afternoon. A lot of naps, you know? And I find myself dozing off in my chair while I read – which I love to do. It’s frustrating. I used to have so much energy, even at my age! It feels like I’m in a fog most of the time, too. Not sharp like I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're needing naps to get through the day, you're dozing off while reading, and you're experiencing some cognitive difficulties – a feeling of being “in a fog,” as you put it. That's helpful. And how long has this been going on despite using the CPAP machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I started the machine, must be… six months now, maybe a little more. It was good for a while, honestly. I felt a real difference at first. But this tiredness crept back in, oh, I’d say about three months ago. It's been getting gradually worse since then. I try to be consistent with it, I really do, but… it doesn't always feel like enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so improvement initially, then a gradual return of fatigue over the past three months despite consistent CPAP use. We'll need to investigate why that might be. First, let's talk about the CPAP itself. Do you know what pressure setting it's on?
PATIENT: You know, Doctor, that’s a good question. I honestly haven’t the slightest idea. The technician set it up when I first got it, and I’ve just been using it as instructed. I’ve never been told to adjust it or anything. It has a number on the side, but I didn’t pay attention to it, I just turn it on. It’s a Philips Respironics machine, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It's common not to remember those details. We'll look that up in your records. Alright, it looks like you’re on a pressure of 10 centimeters of water. That's a fairly standard starting pressure. Do you ever notice if the mask is leaking when you sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Sometimes. Especially if I move around a lot in my sleep. My wife used to complain about the whistling noise, but she’s… well, she’s not here anymore. But yeah, I'd wake up and feel air on my face sometimes. I try to tighten it, but it’s hard to get it just right, you know? Too tight, and it hurts, too loose and it leaks. It’s a bit of a balancing act.
DOCTOR: Okay, mask leakage is a definite possibility then. That can significantly reduce the effectiveness of the CPAP. Besides the fatigue and the mask issues, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My ankles have been a bit swollen lately, especially at the end of the day. I just figured it was from sitting too much, I used to be a professor, you know? Lots of hours at my desk. And… I’ve been a little more thirsty than usual, but I drink a lot of water anyway. Oh, and my weight’s been creeping up a little bit, despite not eating much differently.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankle swelling, increased thirst, and some weight gain. Those are all things we need to consider. Do you have a history of high blood pressure or diabetes, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been diagnosed with either one. I’ve always been pretty healthy, actually. A little arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I suppose. My father had heart problems, though. He was a smoker, unfortunately. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no personal history of high blood pressure or diabetes, but a family history of heart problems. That's good information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your legs and ankles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Okay, your heart sounds regular, but a little bit of a murmur. Not particularly concerning, but we’ll keep it in mind. Lungs are clear. Now, blood pressure is 145/90, which is a little elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. And yes, I do notice some mild swelling in both ankles. Let's take a look at your weight and height. Okay, BMI is 35.5, which places you in the obese category. Now, I'd like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, blood sugar, and thyroid levels. We should also do an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very thorough. Absolutely, let's do all of that. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to have them done. I want to get to the bottom of this tiredness. It’s just…wearing me down. I appreciate you taking the time to look into everything so carefully.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. It’s my job. Okay, I’ve ordered the tests. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you right away. They'll need a sample of blood and will do the EKG there as well. I’ll also have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results, probably in about a week. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything you’d like me to clarify before you go to the lab?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds very clear. Chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness… I understand. Thank you so much for your time and attention. I feel much better knowing we’re getting this properly investigated. And thank you for explaining everything so well. I really appreciate it. I’ll head down to the lab now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. Please don't hesitate to ask if any questions come up. I’ll see you next week. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: .
