DOCTOR: Hi Terasa, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well… it’s a bit hard to explain, really. My hearing… it comes and goes. And sometimes I feel so dizzy. Like the room is spinning. It’s been happening… well, for a while now. My husband… he used to say I should get it checked, but… he’s gone now. And my daughter… she’s the one who finally made the appointment. Honestly, I don't remember exactly when it started. It just… does.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds frustrating when things come and go like that, and it’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in. It's completely normal to not remember specific dates when you're dealing with something ongoing. So, the hearing loss and dizziness… do they happen at the same time, or are they separate issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Separate, I think. Usually. The dizziness… it comes on its own more often. Just… whoosh. Like someone spun me around too fast. The hearing… that's more random. Sometimes I'll just… not hear things. Or things sound muffled. It’s hard to say which comes first, or if they’re even connected, to be honest. My memory… isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, we’ll sort through it together. It's helpful to know they often happen separately. And it’s very common for memory to have fluctuations, especially with changes as you get older. When you experience the dizziness, can you tell me how long it lasts?
PATIENT: Oh, um… how long? That’s a good question. Not long, usually. Just… minutes. Maybe five or ten minutes? Sometimes it feels longer, but my daughter says it's not. She times it. She's very good like that. But it's enough to make me feel… unsteady. I have to sit down. And sometimes I feel a bit sick to my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a few minutes at a time, and it’s sometimes accompanied by nausea. That’s good information. And it’s wonderful you have a daughter who is so attentive and helpful! Now, with the hearing loss – when you notice it, is it in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a tricky one. I think… usually just one ear. The left one, maybe? Or is it the right? I honestly can’t always tell. It's funny, isn't it? You don’t notice these things until they stop working properly. I’ve never really paid much attention to which ear it was. It just… goes quiet.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all – it’s very common to not notice specifics until something changes. Okay, let’s try this: when you’re experiencing the hearing loss, can you describe what it feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… feels like… everything is muffled, like someone put cotton in my ear. Or like I’m underwater. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… quiet. Like the volume has been turned way down. And sometimes, it feels like there's a buzzing sound, too. A low hum. But that doesn’t happen every time. It’s all a bit… confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled sounds, a low hum sometimes, and it doesn’t cause pain. That's very helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about other things going on. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears at all, even when you aren’t experiencing the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Ringing… oh dear. Yes, sometimes. Not all the time. It's a… high-pitched ring. Like a tiny bell. But it comes and goes, just like everything else. It’s not constant, thankfully. My daughter asked me about it too, I remember that. She writes everything down, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, a high-pitched ringing that comes and goes. That’s good to know. Let’s switch gears a bit. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold, flu, or ear infection?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… I had a bit of a cold last month, I think. Or was it two months ago? It wasn't a bad one, just a sniffle and a cough. Nothing serious. And… I had a fall a few weeks back. Just tripped over the rug. Didn’t hurt myself too badly, just a bit bruised. My daughter was very worried, of course. She wanted me to go to the hospital, but I told her I was alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cold a month or two ago and a recent fall. Knowing about the fall is especially important. Did you hit your head at all when you fell?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little bump on the head. Nothing major, honestly. Just a small bruise. It didn’t hurt that bad. I was more shaken up than anything. My daughter fussed over me for days, making sure I was alright. She really is a good girl. I think she worries too much, but… it’s nice to be cared for.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small bump on the head from the fall. Even a small head injury can sometimes cause symptoms later on, so it’s good to know. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… The doctor told me I had high blood pressure, years ago. I’m on medication for it. And… my daughter says I have something with my cholesterol. She handles all the paperwork, so I don't really remember the details. I get all my prescriptions filled at the pharmacy, and I take them like I’m supposed to. That’s about all I can tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and high cholesterol. I can certainly access your medication list from the pharmacy records, so we don't need to worry about getting the specifics right now. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve never really had an allergic reaction to anything. I used to get mosquito bites all the time when I was younger, but that's about it. My daughter always checks when I get new prescriptions, just in case. She’s very thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your ears, and do a few balance tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this sorted out, if you know what I mean. It’s all a bit worrying, and I’d like to know what’s going on. Please, go ahead. I hope it doesn’t take too long, though.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It shouldn’t take too long. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your ears. There’s a little bit of wax build-up in both ears, but nothing significant. Now, I’m going to check your balance. I’d like you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Just try to maintain your balance for as long as you can. Let me know if you feel unsteady.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Closed eyes… Oh dear, I feel a bit unsteady already. It’s… hard to keep my balance. My daughter would be much better at this, she's very steady on her feet. Oh, I think I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do. That’s perfectly alright. It’s important to be safe. Okay, so you did experience some unsteadiness with your eyes closed. That's a helpful observation. Now, I’m going to do one more quick test. I’m going to ask you to walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for a few steps. Again, let me know if you feel unsteady. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A straight line… I haven’t done that since… well, a long time ago. But alright, I’ll try. Just… please be patient with me. Oh dear… this is harder than it looks. I think I’m going to sit down again. It’s making me feel quite dizzy.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That's perfectly alright. Don’t push yourself. It sounds like we're definitely seeing some balance issues. Okay, Terasa, based on what you've told me and the quick exam we did, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms of vertigo, which is a sensation of spinning, often accompanied by dizziness and balance problems. The hearing loss could be related, or it could be a separate issue. Given your history of a recent fall and the balance issues we saw, I think it's important to get some further testing done to rule out any underlying causes. I’d like to order an audiological evaluation to assess your hearing and inner ear function, and an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An MRI… that sounds… serious. Is it really necessary? I just want to know why I keep feeling dizzy, not… all that. But… alright, if you think it's best. My daughter always says it’s best to be careful. So, yes, alright. Do whatever you think is necessary. But please, don’t rush me. And can you explain everything to my daughter too? She’s much better at understanding these things than I am.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand your concerns. An MRI is a precaution, and it will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. It’s a non-invasive test, although it does require you to lie very still for a short period of time. And yes, I will absolutely explain everything to your daughter. She can be present during our follow-up appointment, and we can discuss the results together. I’ll also write a detailed summary of our findings and the plan for testing. In the meantime, to help with the dizziness, I recommend avoiding sudden movements and staying well-hydrated. If you feel a dizzy spell coming on, sit down immediately. I'm also going to prescribe you some medication to help manage the symptoms – it's an antihistamine, which can often help with vertigo. It can cause some drowsiness, so be careful when driving or operating machinery. I’m also going to give you a referral to an ENT specialist – that's an ear, nose, and throat doctor – who can further evaluate your hearing loss and inner ear function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… a lot. But yes, alright. Medication and a specialist… I trust your judgement, Doctor. And yes, please explain everything to my daughter. She can come with me to the follow-up appointment, definitely. I just… I just want to feel normal again. I miss being able to hear properly, and I don’t like feeling dizzy all the time. It’s… unsettling. But thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. And for explaining everything so patiently.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. I understand how unsettling it can be, and we’ll work together to get to the bottom of this. It’s completely normal to feel anxious and overwhelmed, and I want you to know that I’m here to support you every step of the way. I'm going to have my nurse come in and give you the prescription and schedule your follow-up appointment. She’ll also give you some written instructions about the medication and the MRI. She can also answer any questions you have before you leave. Do you have any questions for me right now, before she comes in?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. Not right now, anyway. I’m sure I’ll think of something later. Just… thank you again, Doctor. And thank you for being so kind. It means a lot. I just hope… I just hope this all works out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll do everything we can to help you feel better. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
