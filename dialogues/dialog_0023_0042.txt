DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Please, call me Londell. Well, I reckon I'm getting on in years, and my daughter, bless her heart, she thought I ought to get things checked out. A “Men’s Health Optimization Visit,” she called it. Sounds fancy. Mostly, I just want to make sure everything’s still… working the way it should, you know? I feel alright, for sixty-nine, but you never know.
DOCTOR: A “Men’s Health Optimization Visit,” yes. Your daughter is… proactive. Very well. “Working the way it should” is… a vague assessment, Londell. Let’s try to be a little more specific. Are you experiencing any particular symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific, you say? Let me think… well, I get up a couple of times a night to… use the restroom. More than I used to, that is. And… sometimes it’s a bit of a struggle to… start things, if you catch my drift. Not every time, mind you. Just… sometimes. And I tire a bit easier than I used to when I'm working on my etchings. That's about the biggest things, I suppose. Oh! And my knees ache a bit when the weather changes. Is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Nocturia, hesitancy, fatigue… and chondromalacia. Right. Let’s document this properly. You mentioned getting up multiple times at night to urinate – how many times would you estimate, on average?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… most nights, two or three times. Sometimes just the two, if I don't drink too much water before bed. But three is pretty common. Used to be I could sleep right through, not have to stir at all. It’s been happening for… oh, maybe six months or so, I’d say. It’s not keeping me up all night, just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Two to three times per night for six months. Significant. And this difficulty initiating urination… is it consistent, or does it vary depending on the day?
PATIENT: It varies, for sure. Some days it's fine, no trouble at all. Others... well, I have to wait a bit, kinda strain a little. It doesn't hurt, exactly, just… takes a moment. It seems worse if I’m a bit dehydrated, I think. Or if I've been doing a lot of bending over with my work. Does that make sense? I try not to drink too much coffee, but I do enjoy a cup in the morning.
DOCTOR: Variability, correlation with dehydration and bending, and minimal caffeine intake. Noted. We'll need to rule out a few possibilities. Now, let's move on to your fatigue. You mentioned it occurring with your etchings. Could you describe what you mean by "fatigue"?
PATIENT: Well, I used to be able to work on a plate for hours, not even notice the time passing. Now, after a couple of hours, my hands start to ache, my back gets stiff, and I just... lose interest. It’s not like I'm exhausted, just… worn out. I have to take more breaks, and I don't get as much done in a day as I used to. It’s frustrating, because I love my work, and I don’t want to slow down. And it's not like I'm doing anything different, the same techniques, the same materials… just takes me longer now.
DOCTOR: A decrease in stamina with continued effort. Interesting. I'm going to need to conduct a physical exam. Please, if you’ll excuse me, we'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'd like to palpate your abdomen, and we'll do a quick neurological assessment. After that, we can check your reflexes and joints. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Sounds alright to me, Doc. I don't believe I have any allergies. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I’m not allergic to bee stings or anything like that, and I can eat pretty much anything. My daughter always asks me that too, just to be sure. She's a worrier, that one. Go ahead when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. First, let's take your blood pressure. 148 over 85. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds normal, lungs are clear. Now, if you'll expose your abdomen, I'd like to palpate it. No masses or tenderness. Soft, non-distended. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Now, let's check your joints… knees, in particular. Some crepitus on range of motion, slight tenderness to palpation on the medial aspect of both knees. No effusion. Now, stand up, if you would. Gait is stable, no obvious abnormalities. Alright. That gives us a starting point. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a prostate-specific antigen test, and a urinalysis. We also need to rule out any urinary tract infection and check your kidney function. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Whew. That was a lot. Sounds thorough, Doc. I understand. Blood work, urine sample, checkin' for… infections and how my kidneys are doin'. And somethin' about my… prostate? Is that somethin' I ought to be worried about? I never had any trouble… down there, if you catch my drift. But I’m happy to get it checked out, if you think it’s necessary. Just a little worried about what all this means, is all. Is it likely to be somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: The prostate-specific antigen test is a screening test. It will help us determine if further investigation is necessary. It's not necessarily indicative of a problem, but it is a standard part of a men’s health assessment, particularly at your age. As for whether it's likely to be serious… it’s premature to speculate. We are gathering information. It is far more likely to be a benign condition, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, but we need the results of the tests to be certain. I will also need to review your past medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had pneumonia when I was a young man, but that was over fifty years ago. Recovered fully. And my wife, God rest her soul, she passed away five years ago from… complications with her heart. Other than that… no, nothin’ major. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I’ve always been active, worked with my hands, and I try to eat a good diet. I don't smoke, and I only drink socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner a couple of times a week. I take a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. I don't think there's much else. Do you need to know about childhood illnesses or anything? I don't really remember much of that.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia as a young man, no other significant medical conditions, wife passed away five years ago from cardiac complications, no smoking, minimal alcohol intake, multivitamin use. Noted. We will proceed with the laboratory work. The nurse will draw the blood and collect a urine sample. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doc. You've covered everything pretty thoroughly, I reckon. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen and not rushin' me. It's good to know someone's lookin' out for an old man like me. Just… let me know what the tests say, alright? And if there's anything I ought to be worried about, don’t sugarcoat it. I can handle the truth.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kammann. The nurse will be in shortly. We will contact you with the results as soon as they are available. And I assure you, I will be forthright with you. Do you need a work note for any time off?
