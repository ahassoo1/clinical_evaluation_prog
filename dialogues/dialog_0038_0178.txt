DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…this cough. It won’t quit, and I’m tired all the time. Seems like I get a sinus infection right after it lets up, too. It's been going on for a while now, and I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a persistent cough and feeling tired, with sinus infections following it. I understand. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. First, can you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: Well, it started…I don't know, maybe last fall? It's a wet cough, lots of phlegm. Not much when I first wake up, but it gets worse throughout the day. Especially if I…move around too much. Or if it’s cold. Does that make any sense? It just feels…deep in my chest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A wet cough that worsens with activity and in the cold, and feels deep in your chest. That’s helpful. And you said it started last fall?
PATIENT: Yeah, around then. It kinda went away for a bit during the warmer months, but it came back stronger this winter. I thought it was just a bad cold at first, but it hasn’t really gone away, you know? It just…cycles. Cough, then a sinus thing, then the cough again. It's exhausting.
DOCTOR: Right, so it seems to be seasonal, with a tendency to recur. And the sinus infections follow pretty closely after the cough subsides?
PATIENT: Pretty much. My nose gets all stuffy, then my head starts aching…it feels like pressure behind my eyes. And I get real tired when it hits. It usually lasts a week or so, then the cough starts up again. I take some over-the-counter stuff for it, but it doesn't seem to really do much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a recurring cycle of cough, sinus congestion with headache and fatigue… and the over-the-counter medications aren't providing much relief. Let’s talk about your past medical history for a moment. Have you had any other significant illnesses or health problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had pneumonia when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, but that's about it. Nothing serious. I don't really go to the doctor much. I try to stay healthy. Eat okay, get some fresh air when I can. I don’t smoke, never have.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No major medical problems, pneumonia as a child, and no smoking history. That's helpful. And what about any surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. I've been lucky, I guess. I avoid hospitals if I can. Not my favorite place.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Let’s move on to your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, children – have any health conditions, like lung problems, allergies, or frequent infections?
PATIENT: My mother…she had bad allergies when she was older. Lots of sneezing, runny nose. And my older brother, he had asthma as a kid, but he grew out of it, I think. Other than that, not really. Everyone else was pretty healthy. My grandfather, on my mother's side, he always had a bad cold in the winter, but that was just…old age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, allergies in your mother, and asthma in your brother when he was younger. That’s good information. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: What do you mean by that? Like…what do I do for fun? I don’t really understand what that has to do with my cough.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Mr. Pithan. It’s just to understand your lifestyle and potential exposures. Things like where you work, if you have any pets, and if you’ve traveled recently. For example, do you work indoors or outdoors?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. I work at the food processing plant. Mostly indoors, cutting and packaging meat. It gets pretty cold in there, sometimes. And dusty, with all the…well, everything. I’ve been there for…almost fifteen years now. No pets. And haven't traveled nowhere in years. Just stay local.
DOCTOR: Okay, working at the food processing plant, indoors, potentially cold and dusty, for fifteen years. That's important. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let's quickly go over any allergies you have to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't have any allergies that I know of. I've eaten everything put in front of me, and I've taken a few different medicines over the years for colds and headaches, never had a reaction. I think I would have noticed if I was allergic to something, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You would, yes. Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Pithan, it sounds like you’ve had this cough for a significant amount of time, with a cyclical pattern, and it’s associated with sinus symptoms. We’ve covered your medical, surgical, family, and social history, and confirmed no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your sinuses, and take your temperature and blood pressure. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Let's get it over with. The sooner I know what's going on, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you could please take a deep breath for me…and exhale slowly. Good. Okay. Your breathing sounds a little…wheezy, especially on the right side. Not dramatically so, but noticeable. I'm also going to palpate your sinuses now to check for tenderness. Ouch. Okay, tenderness on the right frontal sinus. And your temperature is 99.2 Fahrenheit, and your blood pressure is 130/80. So, wheezing in the right lung, tenderness in the right frontal sinus, and a slightly elevated temperature. We'll need to consider a few possibilities here. Do you have any pain anywhere else besides your sinuses?
PATIENT: No, just the sinuses. Maybe a little tired, but that's from the cough, I think. Not really any pain anywhere else. The wheezing…is that bad? What does that even mean? I don't know anything about lungs.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, and it’s perfectly normal to feel uncertain about medical terms. Wheezing means there's some narrowing in your airways, which makes it harder for air to get through. It can be caused by a lot of things, like inflammation, mucus, or swelling. It's not necessarily immediately alarming, but it’s something we need to investigate. Given your history, the cyclical nature of your symptoms, your exposure at the food processing plant, and the findings on the exam, I’m suspecting a couple of possibilities. It could be chronic bronchitis, potentially exacerbated by irritants in the workplace, or we need to consider a possible sinus infection contributing to the cycle. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung issues. I'd also like to get a sample of your sputum – that’s the mucus you cough up – to check for any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray and…a what-now? You want me to cough into a cup? Look, I just want this cough to go away. Is that really necessary? I don't like hospitals, and I don't like tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Pithan. I wouldn't order these tests if I didn't think they were important to get an accurate diagnosis and find the best way to help you feel better. The X-ray will allow us to see if there's anything going on in your lungs that's causing the wheezing, and the sputum sample will help us identify if there's an infection causing the cough. Think of it as gathering information so we can get to the root of the problem. The sputum sample is just coughing into a cup, yes, and it’s a relatively quick and painless process. We can do that right here in the office. The X-ray will require a visit to the radiology department, but it’s a simple procedure. If we don't investigate, we risk missing something more serious, or continuing to treat the symptoms without addressing the underlying cause. Would you be willing to consider these tests?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. But the sooner it's over, the better. Just…tell me exactly what I need to do, and let's get it done. No messing around. Cough into a cup, you say? What kind of cup?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pithan. I appreciate your willingness to proceed. That's the right attitude. It’s a sterile collection cup, I'll give you one right now. First thing in the morning, before you brush your teeth, try to cough up as much sputum as you can into the cup. Just a normal, deep cough will do. We’ll need a good amount, about a teaspoon or two. If you don't have much first thing, try again throughout the morning. I’ll give you a requisition form for the X-ray as well. You can take that to the radiology department at the hospital - it's about ten minutes from here. They’ll need your insurance information. Once we have the results from both tests, we can discuss them and determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. A teaspoon of…phlegm. Wonderful. Okay, give me the cup and the paper. I guess I’ll go cough up a teaspoon of my lungs in the morning. Just…let me know when you expect the results. The sooner, the better. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright, here’s the sterile collection cup and the requisition form for the X-ray. The lab will need your full name and date of birth when you submit the sample. The radiology department should be able to schedule the X-ray fairly quickly. Once they've completed it, they'll send the results directly to my office. I typically get those results within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and avoid any irritants, like smoke or dust, as much as possible. If your symptoms worsen significantly, or you develop a fever, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just…get the results back quick. Thanks, Doctor. I'll see you when you get the results. .
