DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Osterholm. It's... well, I've been bruising a lot easier lately. Like, with nothing much happening, you know? It's kinda worrying me. I'm on a blood thinner, so I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A blood thinner, right. And you’re noticing increased bruising despite being on it?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. I should be less likely to bruise, shouldn't I? It's not like I'm bumping into things or anything. Just... appearing. Mostly on my arms and legs, I think. It's been going on for maybe a couple of weeks now? Hard to say exactly, honestly.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks. Okay. And what blood thinner are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Um... let me think. It’s… Warfarin. Yeah, Warfarin. Dr. Lee put me on it about six months ago for, uh, a flutter thing in my heart. It was a quick in-and-out procedure, but he said I needed to stay on it for a while. I try to remember to take it every day, but sometimes… well, life happens, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Warfarin. And you said Dr. Lee started you on it six months ago. Are you getting your INR checked regularly?
PATIENT: INR… oh, is that the blood test? Yeah, I go every month to the lab down the street. They call me with the numbers, usually. I haven't had one in, let me see… about three weeks, I think. I was going to schedule it, but then things got busy. Is that bad? I just figured if the bruising was that serious, they'd call me, right?
DOCTOR: "Figured" isn't really a substitute for knowing, Ms. Hainley. Three weeks is… less than ideal when you're on Warfarin. We need to see where your levels are at. It’s possible your dosage needs adjusting. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other unusual bleeding?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay, you’re right. Sorry. I just... I don’t always think things through. No, no other bleeding. Not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little more nosebleeds than usual, but I get those sometimes anyway, especially when it's dry. Nothing major, definitely not like… a constant drip or anything. And no blood in my pee or anything scary like that. I hope not, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any easy bleeding from cuts, scrapes, or when brushing your teeth?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that you mention it, yeah. I cut my finger pretty bad a couple of weeks ago, just peeling a mango. And it took forever to stop bleeding. Like, way longer than it should have. I had to hold pressure on it for a good ten minutes. And... yeah, sometimes my gums bleed a little when I brush, but I always thought that was just because I brush too hard. Maybe it's not just brushing too hard?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound like it’s just brushing too hard, Ms. Hainley. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I want to check for any signs of bleeding, and just get a general sense of things. Then we’ll get a blood draw done to check your INR and some other basic levels. That’s the best place to start. Can you roll up your sleeves, please?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Here you go. I didn't even realize I had so many, honestly. I just thought they were from bumping into things. See? I’m a klutz. Hopefully it's just the Warfarin, and not something worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. The bruising is… fairly widespread. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. Deep breaths, please. Everything sounds… normal, for now. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels tender or painful.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breaths. And... no, nothing feels particularly painful. Maybe a little sensitive right here… But I think that’s just… gas, probably. I had a big salad for lunch. I get gas easily. Sorry, I'm not very helpful. I just want to know if I'm going to be okay.
DOCTOR: Right. Gas. I’m going to order a CBC – that’s a complete blood count – to check your red and white blood cell levels, and platelets. And, as I said, your INR. We need to see those results before we can say anything definitive. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any activities where you could easily injure yourself. No heavy lifting, no contact sports… and try to be careful even with everyday tasks. Here's the order for the lab work. They should be able to get it done quickly. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now. After the results are back, we’ll call you to discuss them. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… scary, honestly. A complete blood count. Is that bad? And… no contact sports? I haven't done a contact sport since high school! But… no, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… please call me as soon as you have the results? I really don't want to wait. And thank you, Dr. Osterholm.
DOCTOR: Yes, we will call you as soon as we have the results. It's standard procedure, Ms. Hainley. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Try not to worry too much, okay?
