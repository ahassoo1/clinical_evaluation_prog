DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well… I been getting this… flushing. Like, my face gets really red. And sometimes my neck too. It’s been happening a few times now, not every day, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing – redness of the face and neck, you said. And it's been happening intermittently, not a constant thing. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That's a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. I think… maybe after I eat? Not always, though. Sometimes just… happens. I was gardening yesterday afternoon and felt it then, too. Sun was pretty strong. I don’t… I don’t know if that matters. It just feels warm and then… red. It’s not painful, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be triggered sometimes by eating, sometimes by being in the sun, and sometimes it just happens without a clear trigger. And you said it's not painful, just warm and noticeable. About how long does the flushing last each time?
PATIENT: Let me think… usually… maybe ten, fifteen minutes? It comes on pretty quick, and then fades after that. Not hours, definitely. Just… a little bit of time, then it goes away. Like a wave, you know? Comes and goes. I haven’t been keeping track, sorry. I just… noticed it more lately.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all. That's very helpful information. "Like a wave" is a good way to describe it. And it's becoming more noticeable recently. Do you notice anything else happening when you flush?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… sometimes my heart feels… a little fast. Not like, racing, but… quicker than usual. And maybe… a little bit sweaty. Just my face, though. Not the whole body. And… I think I get a little bit dizzy sometimes, but that could be something else. I get dizzy sometimes anyway. Old man things, you know?
DOCTOR: Old man things happen to all of us, Mr. Withycombe. It's good you're telling me everything, even the "maybe" things. So, faster heartbeat, facial sweating, and occasional dizziness along with the flushing. Have you had any other symptoms at all – headache, nausea, any changes in your bowel habits, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. No headaches. No… what did you say? Bowel habits? Everything is… regular, if you want to know. I haven’t been feeling sick to my stomach or anything like that. Just the flushing. And feeling a little tired lately, but I’m always a little tired. I thought that was just getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea, regular bowel habits, and feeling tired, which you attribute to age. That’s understandable. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that have been diagnosed – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, actually. I used to go to the doctor regularly when my wife was alive, but after she passed… I just… didn’t. It's been a few years. I’ve never been told I have anything… serious. Just the usual old man aches and pains.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for things to get overlooked after a significant loss. I'm glad you're here now. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Not even for my tonsils when I was a boy. My wife always said I had a weak constitution, so the doctor didn’t want to risk it. She worried about everything. A good woman, she was. But no surgeries. Just… regular doctor visits when she made me go.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure – anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one. My wife came from a big family, and they all had… something. I don’t really remember exactly what. Maybe heart trouble, on her mother’s side. My side… my parents were from India, and we didn’t really talk about those things. We didn’t see doctors much, if you know what I mean. We had home remedies for everything. Sorry, I’m not much help on that one.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Withycombe. It’s common for family medical history to be unknown, especially with different cultural backgrounds and healthcare practices. We’ll move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything! Indian food, American food… I don't think I've ever reacted to anything. My wife was the picky eater, not me. She had a little trouble with shellfish sometimes, but I never had a problem. She always said I had an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. My wife… she had a lot of medications. I always said it was the pills making her sick, not what she had. So, no, no medications. Just… trying to stay healthy on my own.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe, that's very helpful. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, so anything you want to look at, go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure is 140/85. That’s a little elevated, but not dramatically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s take a look at your skin… I notice some mild redness on your cheeks and neck. No rash or other concerning lesions. Overall, your skin looks normal aside from the flushing you described.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that… bad? The blood pressure? I don't really know what all those numbers mean. I always left that to my wife. She was very good with all that medical stuff.
DOCTOR: It’s not bad necessarily, Mr. Withycombe, but it is something we want to monitor. 140/85 is considered Stage 1 hypertension. It means your blood vessels are working a little harder than they should. We can discuss lifestyle changes to help lower it – things like diet and exercise. And if it remains elevated, we may consider medication. But let’s not worry about that right now. Given your symptoms – the flushing, occasional dizziness, faster heartbeat, and slightly elevated blood pressure – I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? I don’t like needles. But… if you think it’s important, I’ll do it. I want to know what’s going on. I just… don’t like needles. Where will I have to go for those? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Mr. Withycombe. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. The blood draw itself is usually quick – just a few seconds of mild discomfort. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will do their best to make it as painless as possible. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so you wouldn't have to go anywhere else. I’ll give you a requisition form, and they’ll take it from there. It’s just a small amount of blood, and it will give us a lot of information. While we wait for the results, I also recommend keeping a log of when you experience the flushing. Note what you were doing, what you ate, and any other symptoms you noticed. That will help us identify any potential triggers. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: A log… like a diary? My wife kept a diary. Very detailed. I never could get into that. But… I can try. It’s not going to be as good as hers, I can tell you that. And I'll try to write down when the flushing happens. I just… don’t make any promises. I forget things, you know? But I'll do my best. So… a log and the blood tests. Okay. What about… what if it's something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're thinking ahead, Mr. Withycombe. It's understandable to be worried, but let’s not jump to conclusions until we have the results. Most of the time, flushing is caused by something relatively harmless – things like diet, stress, or medications. However, it's important to rule out anything more serious. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health and identify any potential underlying conditions. If we do find something concerning, we’ll discuss the best course of treatment and make sure you get the care you need. I’ll explain everything clearly and answer any questions you have. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and keeping that log. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work and a small notepad to keep track of your flushing episodes. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all for now. Just… the log and the blood tests. And… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. I haven’t been to a doctor in so long… it’s a little overwhelming. I’ll try my best to keep track of everything. And… I’ll try not to worry too much. But it’s hard.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It’s my job to be patient, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed after a long time without seeing a doctor. Take things one step at a time. I’ll have the nurse give you the requisition for the blood tests and the notepad before you leave. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’ll figure this out together. I’ll see you back here for a follow-up appointment once the results are available. Have a good day, Mr. Withycombe.
