DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sayar. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I need it for a trip I’m planning.
DOCTOR: Alright, a fitness-to-fly form. I can certainly help with that. To do so accurately, though, I’ll need some more information. Could you tell me a bit about why you need the confirmation?
PATIENT: It’s because of… well, my husband passed away last year, unexpectedly. He was… on a plane when it happened. I haven't flown since, and honestly, I'm a bit anxious about it. The airline just needs a doctor to say I'm okay to travel, that my health won’t be a problem. It’s mostly just… a psychological thing, I think. But they’re being very strict.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sayar. That’s completely reasonable, and I'm very sorry for your loss. It's perfectly normal to experience anxiety after such a traumatic event. We can absolutely work through this. To properly assess your fitness to fly, I’ll need to ask a few questions about your overall health and any symptoms you may be experiencing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That's fine. Ask whatever you need to. I just… want to get this sorted, if possible. I haven’t really talked about it much, to be honest. So, maybe it’ll be good to get it all out.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. It takes courage to discuss difficult experiences. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've always been pretty healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing, but nothing major. No ongoing conditions, no prescriptions… I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up quickly with rest and some over-the-counter medicine. Other than that… nothing. I’m on Medicare now, of course, since… well, you know. But that’s just standard for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the bronchitis?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And only the bronchitis, briefly, a couple of years ago. I broke my arm when I was a child, climbing a tree, but that’s about it. It healed perfectly fine, no lasting issues. Honestly, I’m a bit of a worrywart, so I always go to the doctor if something feels off, but it’s usually nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure when she was older, but she lived to be eighty-five, so it didn't seem to bother her too much. My father… he had some heart trouble later in life, but again, he lived a long life. My grandparents… they mostly just died of old age, to be honest. Nothing really… concerning. No history of mental health issues, either, as far as I know. We weren't really a family that talked about those things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: I try to eat pretty healthy. Lots of vegetables, lean protein. Not much junk food, although I do have a sweet tooth. I walk every day, usually about thirty minutes, just around the neighborhood. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven't really felt like it since… well. I try to get enough sleep, but sometimes the anxiety keeps me up. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Sayar. We're getting a good picture here. And just to confirm, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No allergies. I can eat anything, take any medicine. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. Honestly, it's usually the thought of getting sick that bothers me more than anything. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, if I'm being honest. But it's mostly just… anxiety. Is this getting tedious? I feel like I'm just rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Sayar. This is very helpful, and you're not rambling. It’s important for me to understand what you’re experiencing, and you’re doing a great job describing it. Now, let’s talk a bit about how you've been feeling emotionally. Aside from the anxiety related to flying, have you been experiencing any other symptoms like sadness, difficulty concentrating, or changes in your sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Well… the sleep, definitely. I wake up a lot, and even when I do sleep, it’s not restful. And concentrating… it’s hard. I used to love reading, but I can barely focus long enough to get through a chapter now. I’ve definitely been… sad, I suppose. It’s not constant, but it comes in waves. Especially around… certain dates. Or when I see couples traveling, you know? It just… reminds me. I haven’t been eating much either, although I'm trying to force myself. It's just… everything feels a bit… muted, I guess. Like I'm watching life through a fog. I don’t think it’s depression, exactly. I just… miss him. A lot.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Ms. Sayar. Grief can manifest in many different ways, and what you’re describing sounds very consistent with that. Okay. Before I make any recommendations, I’d like to do a brief physical exam just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’m just… glad to be talking about it, honestly. It's been bottled up for so long. So, yes, a physical exam is fine. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological check. Nothing too involved, just to make sure everything is functioning as it should. If you could just sit here for me, that would be great.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I’m… not really a fan of doctors' offices, if you can’t tell. But I appreciate you being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Ms. Sayar. We’ll take it slow. Just relax your arm for me… Excellent. Your blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is perfectly normal. Pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are strong and regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes… left, right, up, down… good. And can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Everything feels… okay. A bit nervous, but okay. Is something wrong? I always worry that something is wrong. I know it's silly.
DOCTOR: No, everything is okay, Ms. Sayar. That was just to check your reflexes and basic neurological function. Everything appears normal. It's perfectly understandable to feel nervous, especially given everything you've been through. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing significant anxiety related to grief and a fear of flying. There's no medical reason preventing you from traveling, but I do have some recommendations.
PATIENT: Oh. Good. That’s… a relief. So, what kind of recommendations? Is it medication? I’m not really a fan of taking pills, if I’m honest. But I’m willing to try anything, as long as it helps. I just… want to be able to go on this trip. It’s important to me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sayar. I wouldn't prescribe medication at this point, unless you specifically requested it. In your case, I think a more conservative approach would be beneficial. I recommend considering some strategies to manage your anxiety. Things like deep breathing exercises, mindfulness techniques, or even talking to a therapist could be incredibly helpful. I can provide you with some resources for mental health professionals in the area. Additionally, there are some excellent self-help resources available online, specifically designed for managing fear of flying. I can email you some links. Finally, on the day of your flight, I suggest bringing a calming activity with you – a book, music, or anything that helps you relax. Would you be interested in a referral to a therapist specializing in grief and anxiety?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds… very reasonable. I think I’d be open to a referral, yes. A therapist might be good. I feel like I need someone to… talk to, without worrying about being a burden. And the resources, definitely. I’m willing to try anything, as long as it helps. So, yes, please. A referral and the links. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And… patient. I really appreciate it. And… will you still write the letter confirming I’m able to fly? Assuming, of course, I start working on some of these things?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Sayar. I'm happy to write the letter. I’ll include a statement that you are medically cleared to fly, with the recommendation that you utilize coping strategies to manage anxiety. I’ll also include a brief summary of our conversation for the airline. I'll have my nurse email you the links and the referral information after our visit. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That covers everything. You’ve been… wonderful, Doctor. Truly. Thank you again. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And for not judging me for being a bit… anxious. I think… I think I can actually face this trip now.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Sayar. It was my pleasure. Remember, taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. And have a wonderful trip.
