DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get straight to it. I want to… have a baby. And I want it to be easy. My first one… well, it wasn’t. I just want to make sure everything’s okay before I even try, you know? Don't want any surprises this time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s very smart to get things checked out beforehand, especially after a difficult pregnancy. We can definitely do that. “Easy” is a good goal! To start, let’s talk a little bit about your previous pregnancy – if you're comfortable sharing. Can you tell me a bit about what made it difficult?
PATIENT: Difficult is… putting it mildly. Honestly, I don't remember all the details. It was a long time ago. But there was… a lot of morning sickness. Like, all day sickness, for months. And then… I think I was really tired? And the doctor kept saying something about my… iron? It was just a mess. Look, I just want to avoid all that again. I’m not trying to relive it, okay?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand. It sounds very unpleasant, and it's perfectly alright if you don’t recall every detail. We can work with what you do remember. Severe nausea and fatigue, and a possible issue with your iron levels… those are good things to know. To get a clearer picture, and to help us avoid repeating that experience, could you tell me how old you were when you had your first child?
PATIENT: Ugh, numbers. Honestly… I think I was… around thirty? Maybe thirty-one? It was a while ago, so things are a bit fuzzy. My husband… he always remembered everything. He's the one who kept track of dates and stuff. It’s just… hard without him.
DOCTOR: I see. Thirty or thirty-one… that’s helpful. And I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. Losing someone makes it difficult to remember things, and it's completely understandable that details are fuzzy right now. Before we go further, and just for my records, can you confirm your date of birth for me?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have it memorized. It was… November 14th, but the year… ugh, look, do you need to know? Is it really that important? It was a long time ago!
DOCTOR: It is important, Carmaleta, just to make sure all the medical information is accurate. Knowing your age helps us understand your risk factors and ensure we're providing the best possible care. It’s alright if you don’t remember, though. Let me quickly check your chart… Ah, here we are. November 14th, 1981. That makes you 43 years old. Now that we have that clarified, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No! Nothing like that. I’m… pretty healthy, actually. Always have been. I mean, aside from the pregnancy. I eat alright, I try to walk when I can… nothing major. Private insurance, you know? They wouldn't cover me if I was falling apart.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Carmaleta. Maintaining good health is very important. And yes, insurance can certainly be a motivating factor! Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think... No. No surgeries. Not that I recall, anyway. Maybe I had my tonsils out when I was little? But honestly, it was so long ago, I can barely remember. I really don't dwell on the past. It’s just… upsetting.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries to note, or none that you recall. That's good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a multivitamin. Old lady stuff, you know? And sometimes, if I get a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. But that’s it. I don’t like taking a lot of pills. Makes me feel…icky.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I eat everything. Seriously. My husband used to tease me about having a cast-iron stomach. It’s a blessing, really. No allergies, no problems.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No allergies to note. Now, thinking about your family history - are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history... that's a long story. My mother... she had high blood pressure, I think? And her sister had... something with her heart. But honestly, we weren't a close family. I didn't pay much attention to all that stuff. It’s all just… a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not always easy to have a complete picture of family medical history. High blood pressure in your mother and heart issues in her sister are good things to note, though. Now, I want to ask a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! I would never. I’m a health-conscious person. And after my husband passed… well, I certainly don’t need anything else to worry about. No, no smoking, no drinking, no… anything like that.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Carmaleta. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is important, and I commend you for that. Okay, we've covered a lot of ground. Now, just to confirm, you’re hoping to get pregnant. Are you currently trying?
PATIENT: No. Not yet. I want to get everything checked out first. That’s why I'm here, remember? I don't want to waste my time, or get my hopes up. I just want to know if there’s anything… wrong. Before I even start trying. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. That's a very sensible approach, and exactly the right reason to come in for a preconception checkup. Okay, Carmaleta. So, to summarize, you’re 43 years old, no known allergies, no current medications aside from a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen, no smoking or alcohol use, and a history of a difficult first pregnancy with severe nausea and fatigue. To get a better understanding of your current health, and to rule out any potential issues, I’d like to do a physical exam and order some blood work. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever gets this over with faster. Blood work and poking and prodding… lovely. Just… let’s just get it done. I have things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll be as efficient as possible. The physical exam will just be a routine check – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick abdominal exam. The blood work will help us assess your hormone levels, iron stores, and overall health. Let’s start with the physical exam. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just… try not to take too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, 130 pounds. And your height is 164 centimeters, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes. That's right. Can we please just hurry this along? I don't enjoy being poked and prodded, and I'm sure you have other patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll move as quickly as we can. Now, if you could please have a seat on the exam table, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Your heart rate is regular and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 128 over 76. That's a normal reading. Finally, I'll just do a quick abdominal exam. No tenderness or abnormalities noted. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Now, for the blood work, I'll need to draw a few vials of blood. Do you have a preference for which arm?
PATIENT: Ugh, just… whichever one is faster. I really don’t care. Just… get it over with. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Okay. Left arm it is. Just a quick pinch. There we go. All done. A few seconds of pressure to stop the bleeding... and you’re all set. The lab results will take a few days to come back. I'll have the nurse contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just tell me when I can start trying again, if everything’s okay. That’s all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Carmaleta. Once the lab results are back, we'll review them together. If everything looks good, we can discuss timing for trying to conceive and address any concerns you may have. It's generally recommended to start taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid now, even before we get the results, as it's important for early fetal development. The nurse will also provide you with information about prenatal care and resources available in the area. Do you have any questions about prenatal vitamins or prenatal care?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Prenatal vitamins, got it. Look, I don’t need a whole lecture, okay? I just want to get pregnant. Is that so much to ask? Just tell me where the nurse is, and let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It’s alright. The nurse’s station is right outside the door. She can give you information about prenatal vitamins and answer any further questions you might have. I want to assure you that we’re here to support you through this process. We will contact you as soon as the lab results are available. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any urgent concerns.
