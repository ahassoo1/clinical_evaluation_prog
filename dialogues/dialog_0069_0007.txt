DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because I am in quite a bit of pain. It’s…well, it’s my back. It’s been bothering me for some time now. I would like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Reihner. We'll do our best to figure things out. “Some time now” is a bit vague, though. Could you tell me when the back pain started?
PATIENT: Let me think… It began approximately six months ago. It started gradually, a dull ache after a long day of work. I work as a fence erector, you see. Heavy lifting, a lot of bending… it’s physical work. It has worsened steadily since then. I don't recall any specific injury that started it, just…slowly getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, gradually worsening with your work as a fence erector. That gives me a good starting point. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It’s…a deep ache, mostly in my lower back. Sometimes it shoots down my leg, a little bit, on both sides, but mostly stays in my back. When I bend over, or twist, it gets much worse. Standing for long periods is also difficult. It feels like…a weight is pressing down on me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A deep ache in the lower back, radiating down both legs sometimes, worsened by bending and twisting, and difficultly with prolonged standing. That sounds like it could be a number of things. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…yes, a little. Mostly in my feet, at the end of the day. It’s not constant, just a slight…pins and needles feeling. It goes away when I sit down and rest. I hadn’t thought much of it, to be honest. I just assumed it was from being on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent pins and needles in your feet at the end of the day. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness…not exactly. It’s more…difficulty. Lifting heavy things is harder now, of course, because of the pain. But I can still walk and stand, though not for very long. I find myself having to be more careful when I move. It’s not a sudden weakness, just…a lessening of strength, perhaps. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That's a good way to describe it - a lessening of strength. Alright. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: Oh. Um…no, not that I’ve noticed. Everything is…normal, in that regard. I apologize if that is too much information. It's just…an odd question. I’ve never been asked that before.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Reihner. It’s a standard question to rule out any serious nerve involvement. We need to cover all possibilities. Before we move on, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor prescribed for my blood pressure. A small white pill, once a day. And sometimes, when the pain is very bad, I take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you know. Nothing else. I do not like taking too many pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of. I've eaten…everything, over the years. And I've never had a reaction to any medicine. I am Lakota, and we eat a lot of different plants and foods, so I would know if I had an allergy. It's part of our tradition to know what is safe.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing much, thankfully. I had pneumonia when I was a child, a very bad case, but I recovered fully. I broke my arm once, falling off a horse when I was younger. Otherwise, I've been relatively healthy. My husband…he had some heart trouble, but he passed away five years ago. That’s why I am on the blood pressure medication now, the doctor said it was precautionary.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia as a child, a broken arm, and currently on medication for blood pressure. I'm sorry to hear about your husband. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: My mother had arthritis, in her hands and knees. It slowed her down in her later years. And my father…he had diabetes. Both sides of the family, really, a lot of trouble with those conditions. It's something we worry about. I try to eat healthy, but…it’s hard sometimes. It's in our genes, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information. Now, lastly, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? I live alone, as I mentioned, since my husband passed. I don’t drink or smoke, never have. I spend most of my time with family. My children and grandchildren visit when they can. I go to church regularly. I spend a lot of time outdoors, when my back isn’t bothering me, gardening and visiting with family. Not much else, really. I keep to myself, mostly. Is there something specific you need to know? I would like to finish this as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Reihner. Just trying to get a complete picture. Okay, no smoking or alcohol, active family life, and active in your church. That’s good. Alright, that gives me a lot to work with. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'm going to check your back's range of motion, feel for tenderness, and do a few neurological tests to assess your reflexes and strength. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. I suppose it is necessary. Please be gentle, if you would. The pain is quite sensitive. I just hope you can figure out what is wrong so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, I'm gently feeling along your spine now. There's some muscle spasm present, particularly in the lower back. And I'm having you bend forward, backward, and to each side... There's decreased range of motion with forward flexion, and it elicits pain. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes in your legs... Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups, which is also good. However, I do note some slight pain with straight leg raise on both sides, at approximately 30 degrees. This suggests some possible nerve root irritation. Okay, that's all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: That…that does hurt a bit, when you lift my leg like that. Like a shooting pain down my leg. But not constant, like I said. Mostly just when you move it like that. So, what does all of this mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I need to know if I can still work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. Based on your history and the physical exam, it sounds like you are likely experiencing a lumbar radiculopathy, which means irritation of a nerve root in your lower back. The pain radiating down your legs, the slight numbness in your feet, and the positive straight leg raise test all point to that. The muscle spasm is a natural reaction to the pain. Now, it’s hard to say definitively what's causing the radiculopathy without further imaging. It could be a herniated disc, spinal stenosis, or degenerative disc disease. These are all common causes, especially with your profession and family history. It’s not necessarily serious in the sense that it’s immediately life-threatening, but it is something we need to address to prevent it from worsening. As for working… that's a bit tricky. Continuing to do heavy lifting and bending while experiencing this pain could aggravate the condition and potentially lead to more significant nerve damage. I would strongly recommend modifying your work duties for now, avoiding heavy lifting and repetitive bending. I would like to order an MRI of your lower back to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds expensive. And time-consuming. But…if it’s necessary to know what is going on, then I suppose so. I do not want this to get worse. I rely on my work to support myself. So, you are saying I should stop lifting? Even light things? That is difficult, Doctor. Everything I do involves lifting. What are my options, if I do have a herniated disc or…whatever you said? Is there medicine that can help? Or…surgery? I do not want surgery, if at all possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Reihner, I understand your concerns about the MRI and your work. We can discuss options for financial assistance with the MRI if needed. And yes, it would be best to avoid heavy lifting and repetitive bending as much as possible until we know more. Perhaps focus on lighter tasks for now. As for treatment options, a lot depends on the severity of the findings on the MRI. Most cases of lumbar radiculopathy can be managed conservatively with physical therapy, pain medication, and lifestyle modifications. Pain medication options include NSAIDs like ibuprofen, which you're already taking, but we may consider stronger medications if needed. We can also discuss muscle relaxants to help with the spasm. Physical therapy can help strengthen your core muscles, improve your posture, and teach you proper lifting techniques. Surgery is typically reserved for cases where conservative treatment fails, or if there is significant nerve compression causing weakness or loss of bowel or bladder control. It's not usually the first line of treatment. Let's start with the MRI. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more tailored treatment plan. Would you like me to go ahead and order that for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Order the MRI. I need to know what is going on, so I can make a plan. And…please, if you have any information about financial assistance, let me know. I do not have much money saved. And can you write down the name of the physical therapy place you recommend? I would like to look into that as well, once I know the results. I want to be proactive. I just…I want to get back to work, and I want to be able to support myself. It’s all I have. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time, and your explanations. Even though it’s not good news, I feel better knowing what we are dealing with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Reihner. I understand. We’ll get this sorted out. Here is the referral for the MRI. You can schedule that at your convenience. The physical therapy list includes several options in the area, and I’ve included their contact information. This pamphlet has information on programs that may help with the cost of the MRI and physical therapy. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a course of muscle relaxants to help with the spasm in the meantime. Take them as directed. I will follow up with you after the MRI results are in to discuss the findings and create a plan. In the meantime, avoid heavy lifting, rest when you need to, and let me know if your pain worsens or if you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness or bowel or bladder changes. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. Thank you again for your help. I will schedule the MRI as soon as possible. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. .
