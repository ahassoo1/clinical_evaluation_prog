DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. Welcome. My name is Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this… weakness. It’s getting worse, you see. It started slow, a little wobble here and there. But now… now it’s harder to do things. Harder to walk, even. It’s been going on for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness… that’s a good place to start. And you said it’s been going on for a while. Can you tell me a little more about how it started, and how it’s progressed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, maybe two, three years ago? It was just in my legs, a little tired feeling after walking a bit. I didn’t think much of it at first, just getting old, you know? But then it started to spread. Now my arms feel it sometimes too. And it’s not just tired. It’s… harder to move them, like they don’t want to go where I tell them to. It’s hard to explain. It’s not pain, just… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand, it sounds frustrating when it’s hard to explain. Not pain, just… difficulty with movement. And it’s spread from your legs to your arms over the past two or three years. Could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I mostly stay home now. My wife, Leilani, she does most of the cooking and cleaning. I used to love gardening, you know? Big garden. But that’s hard now. Too much walking, too much bending. I sit a lot. Watch TV, read the paper. Leilani helps me get around the house. I try to do what I can, but… it gets harder each day. She's a good woman, Leilani. Very patient. I help where I can, little things, but mostly I rest.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a lovely garden, and it’s wonderful to have such a supportive wife. Okay, so mostly resting, with some help from Leilani. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes my vision gets blurry, but I thought that was just my eyes getting old. And sometimes I feel… tired. Very, very tired. Even after sleeping. Not just tired like needing a nap, but… worn out. And sometimes I get… numb. Like pins and needles, in my hands and feet. It comes and goes, that numbness. Is that… is that important, Doctor? I’m not sure what’s important and what’s not.
DOCTOR: Yes, those things are definitely important to know. Blurry vision, fatigue even after sleeping, and numbness in your hands and feet. Let me ask – has anything specific made the weakness, numbness, or fatigue worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hot weather makes it worse, I think. When it's very hot, I get more tired and the weakness feels stronger. And… stress makes it worse too. If I get upset or worried, it feels… harder to move. It’s hard to explain, but… like my body gets heavier. It doesn’t seem to get better with resting, really. It just… stays. Sometimes a little better, sometimes a little worse, but mostly… just stays.
DOCTOR: Okay, hot weather and stress seem to worsen things, and resting doesn’t provide much relief. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, alright. Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor gave me some pills and it’s been under control for many years. And I had a bad flu a few years back, but that was it. Oh! And I had some problems with my back when I was younger, working with heavy things, but they fixed it with… with exercises, I think. Never anything serious, though. I don't remember any other diagnoses. Leilani would know better, she remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so controlled high blood pressure, a past issue with your back, and a bad flu a few years ago. And Leilani has a good memory. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was young, a long time ago. That's the only surgery I can remember. And I had a few… a few things done on my knees years ago, when I was playing sports, but they weren't really surgeries, just… injections. Nothing major. Does that make sense, Doctor? I try to remember, but it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Appendix removal and some knee injections in the past. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the pills for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, the pills for the blood pressure, Leilani gets them filled every month. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when my joints get really sore. Just when they’re bad, though. It's a little white pill, I think. And… sometimes a pain reliever for my back, but not often. Is that all, Doctor? I forget these things, you know. Leilani keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for your blood pressure, something for arthritis as needed, and a pain reliever for your back occasionally. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I've never had any bad reactions to anything, as far as I remember. Leilani would know if I did. She’s very careful about what I eat and what medicines I take. I don’t have any allergies to food, and I haven't ever had a rash or trouble breathing from anything. But let me ask Leilani, just to be sure. She has a better memory than me. Is that alright, Doctor? I’d rather be safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Astore. It's always best to be cautious, and Leilani's input is very valuable. Before we move on, let me ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… My mother, she had heart problems when she was older. She had to have surgery. And my brother, he had diabetes, but he didn't take care of himself. He passed away a few years ago. And… my cousin, on my wife’s side, she had something with her nerves, something that made her weak, but I don’t remember what it was called. It was a long time ago. They lived on the other island. It wasn’t very common, as far as I know. Is that helpful, Doctor? It’s hard to remember all these things, you know. Family is big, and we don’t see each other often.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Heart problems in your mother, diabetes in your brother, and a neurological condition in your wife’s cousin. Okay, Mr. Astore. I appreciate you sharing all of this information with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes, strength, and balance. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I trust your judgement. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? It’s been worrying me. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. I’ve finished the exam. I did find some things that are worth noting. Your blood pressure is a little high, your heart rhythm is irregular, and your reflexes and strength are diminished, especially in your legs. Your balance is also somewhat impaired. Now, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests and a scan of your brain, if that's alright. The blood tests will help us check for things like diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and thyroid problems. The brain scan will help us rule out any structural problems that could be causing your symptoms. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s happening, you know? Blood tests and a scan… alright. I trust your judgement. Will the scan… will it hurt? I don't like being closed in, if that makes sense. It makes me a little anxious. But I'll do whatever I need to do to find out what's going on. What do I need to do to get those tests done?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mr. Astore. It's common to feel anxious about scans. The scan we're ordering is an MRI, which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It doesn't involve any radiation, and it’s generally very safe. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It can be a bit claustrophobic, but we can give you medication to help you relax if you're feeling anxious, and you can have headphones to listen to music during the scan. The whole process usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. We'll have the lab technician draw some blood samples from your arm. That will only take a few minutes. Once we have the results from both the blood tests and the MRI, we can discuss them with you and determine the best course of action. I will write you an order for these tests now. You can take it to the lab and the radiology department, and they will schedule your appointments. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. So, I just take this paper to the lab and the radiology department, and they’ll set up the appointments? It shouldn't be too difficult. And you said they can give me something to help me relax during the scan, if I get anxious? That’s good to know. I appreciate that. Will they tell me the results, or do I come back to see you? I don't want to worry Leilani before we know something for sure.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're exactly right. You take this order to the lab and radiology, and they'll schedule the appointments for you. And yes, they can definitely give you something to help you relax during the scan if you’re feeling anxious. Just let them know when you arrive. We will review the results together, Mr. Astore. I won’t have the results immediately – it usually takes a few days for them to come back. Once I have them, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. That way, we can discuss everything thoroughly. And it’s perfectly alright to hold off on sharing anything with Leilani until we have a clearer understanding of what's going on. I respect your privacy, and it's best to have all the information before discussing it with anyone. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you very much for listening to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing that we’re trying to find out what’s going on. And thank you for understanding about Leilani. She worries easily. I appreciate your kindness, Doctor. I’ll take this paper to the lab and radiology department, and I’ll wait to hear from your office. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And please, take care of yourself. Have a good day as well, Mr. Astore. And I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results.
