DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my leg. It’s been swelling up, and it started after… after the cancer treatments. It’s just… uncomfortable, you know? I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand. Swelling after cancer treatments is certainly something we need to investigate. "Uncomfortable" is a good way to describe it, and it's good you're getting it checked out. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when the swelling started in relation to your treatments ending?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The treatments… they finished maybe… three months ago? Yes, three months. And the swelling… it didn’t start right away. Maybe a month ago? A little after that, I think. It was slow, it didn’t just poof happen one day. It just… got bigger, slowly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a month after your treatments finished, and it's been gradually increasing. That's helpful to know. And where exactly is the swelling located?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my left leg. My calf, mostly. And my ankle is a little puffy too. Not my whole leg, just… that part. It feels… tight, like a band around it.
DOCTOR: Alright, mostly in the left calf and ankle, with a feeling of tightness. Have you noticed any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: Not really pain, no. More… heavy. And sometimes it feels warm. Like… a little hot, if I touch it. But no sharp pain, no. Just… not comfortable, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy and warm to the touch, but no sharp pain. That's good information. Have you noticed any changes in the skin color or texture in that area?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… I don’t think so. Maybe a little… redder? But I have… sensitive skin, so it’s hard to tell. It doesn't look bad, if that makes sense. Just… different than my other leg.
DOCTOR: That's fair, and good you've noticed a difference compared to your other leg. A little redness is noted. Now, thinking about other symptoms, have you experienced any shortness of breath, chest pain, or coughing recently?
PATIENT: Oh no, no chest pain, no coughing. I get a little… breathless sometimes, just walking up the stairs, you know, being my age. But that’s just… me! Not new, not with the leg. Just… old lady stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, no new shortness of breath, just your usual activity-related breathlessness. And have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I feel warm sometimes, but that’s the summer, you know? And no chills, no sweats at night. I sleep okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills or night sweats. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Besides the cancer treatments, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Um… I had high blood pressure, a long time ago. But the doctor said it was okay now, with the pills. And… no, nothing else, really. No heart problems, no clots. Just the blood pressure, and the cancer, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled high blood pressure and a history of cancer treatments. Are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the one pill for the blood pressure. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it’s really bad. But not every day. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Alright, one blood pressure medication regularly and something for arthritis as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can eat anything, take anything, mostly. Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to take your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then I'd like to take a look at your leg, and maybe listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on with my leg, you know? It’s just… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Let's get started. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6, which are all within normal limits. On examination, I do note some swelling in your left calf compared to your right. It is warm to the touch. I don't feel any significant tenderness when I press on it. And your pulses in both legs feel equal. I listened to your heart and lungs and didn’t hear anything unusual. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, the swelling could be related to a few things. It could be a simple fluid buildup after treatment, or something called lymphedema, which can happen when the lymph system isn't draining properly. Less commonly, it could be a blood clot, though the absence of significant pain and tenderness makes that less likely. To be safe, and to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. This will help us see if there's a clot, and assess the blood flow. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a Doppler ultrasound? Sounds… complicated. But if you think it’s best, yes, alright. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. What does it feel like?
DOCTOR: It's not complicated, Ms. Queener, it's a painless imaging test. It uses sound waves to create a picture of the blood vessels in your leg. You'll lie on your back, and a technician will apply a gel to your leg and move a small device – the transducer – over the skin. It doesn't hurt at all, and it takes about 30-45 minutes. While we wait for the ultrasound results, I'm going to recommend you elevate your left leg whenever possible – when you're sitting or lying down. And I'll prescribe a compression stocking for you to wear during the day. These can help reduce swelling and improve blood flow. Do you have any questions about the ultrasound, the compression stocking, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Compression stocking? Like… tight socks? Oh dear. Okay… elevating and tight socks. I can do that, I think. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… when will I get the results? And… will it hurt if it is a clot?
DOCTOR: Yes, a compression stocking is like a tight sock, but it provides graduated compression, meaning it's tighter at the ankle and looser as it goes up the leg. It helps support the veins and reduce swelling. The ultrasound results usually come back within 24-48 hours. The clinic will call you with the results as soon as they are available. And to answer your question about a clot, if it is a clot, you would likely experience more significant pain, redness, and warmth, and the swelling would worsen quickly. But remember, based on the exam, that's less likely. We are doing the ultrasound just to be absolutely sure. In the meantime, if you notice any sudden increase in pain, redness, or warmth, or if you develop any shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Elevate, tight socks, call in 24-48 hours. And go to the hospital if it gets worse. Oh dear. Well… thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing too bad. I guess I’ll go home and put my leg up.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. You've got this. We're just being cautious, and it's good you're getting it checked out. I’m optimistic it's something manageable. Here's a prescription for the compression stocking and a note for your primary care physician summarizing our visit and the ultrasound order. If you have any questions or concerns before the results come back, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and try to relax as much as possible. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor Dashevsky. I will. And… thank you again.
