DOCTOR: Good morning, Ebony. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been… forgetting things. Not huge things, not yet, but enough to worry me, you know? It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're addressing this now. Memory changes can be concerning, but often there are very reasonable explanations. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. First, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by “forgetting things”?
PATIENT: Hmm, okay. Well, like… I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and the word I want just… vanishes. It’s not constant, it’s just… happens. And I’ve started writing things down constantly because I’m afraid I’ll forget appointments or things I need to do. It's also little things, like where I put my keys, but that happens to everyone, right? I just feel like it's happening more and more often.
DOCTOR: Right, that does sound frustrating. Forgetting why you entered a room or having trouble finding a word are fairly common experiences, especially as we get busier. The fact that you’re noticing it enough to write things down is sensible, though. To get a better idea of what’s happening, let’s go through some things. When did you first start noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. It's hard to pinpoint exactly… I'd say maybe… six months ago? It started gradually, so I didn’t really pay much attention at first. Just thought I was stressed or tired. But then it kept happening, and I started to worry. It’s definitely been more noticeable in the last three months, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Gradual onset is helpful to know. And it’s good you’re able to pinpoint roughly when it started. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… I mean, I’ve been a little more… irritable, maybe? My friends have said I seem a bit more easily frustrated than usual. And I’ve been sleeping… not terribly well, to be honest. Not bad sleep, just not as restful as it used to be. I wake up a few times during the night. But other than that… no, not that I’ve noticed. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, irritability and some sleep disturbance. Those can definitely contribute to memory issues, but it's good we're exploring all possibilities. Let’s talk a bit about your past medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was it. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. I generally consider myself pretty healthy. I do take a multivitamin, but that's about it. Oh! And I had the flu shot last fall, of course. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No major medical conditions is helpful. And yes, the flu shot is relevant – just good to have a complete picture. Gallbladder removal ten years ago shouldn't be directly related to this, but we keep track of everything. Now, do you have any family history of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… she did get quite confused towards the end of her life. The doctors said something about dementia, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don't really know the details. My mother doesn’t have any memory issues, as far as I know. And my father… he’s still very sharp for his age, thankfully. So, not a strong family history, I guess? But that grandma… it always worried my mother a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. A history of dementia in a grandparent is something to be aware of, even if we don't have a lot of details. It doesn't mean you'll experience the same thing, but it's useful information. Let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no! I don’t smoke. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once or twice a week, but that’s it. And I’ve never touched drugs in my life. I try to be healthy. I eat pretty well and I walk most days. I mean, I’m a dentist, I tell other people what to do to be healthy! I should probably be better at it myself, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Moderate alcohol consumption is generally not a concern, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is excellent. It’s good you’re actively trying to take care of yourself. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are there any allergies I should be aware of – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, take most medications without a problem. No latex allergy or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky in that regard, actually. I always feel bad for people with lots of allergies! So, no, nothing I need to worry about there.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No allergies is always helpful. Alright, Ebony, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also do a brief neurological exam, checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination, and do a very short memory test. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. I just want to figure out what's going on, you know? Hopefully it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Heart and lungs sound clear. Reflexes are normal, and your balance is good. Now, let’s see… you remembered two out of the three words I asked you to recall, and the simple calculation was correct, but it took a little longer than usual. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable, but the slightly delayed recall is something to note. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory issues – things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or early signs of inflammation. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood tests seem like a good idea. Better to be safe than sorry, right? I'd rather know what's going on, even if it's nothing. So, yes, please order the tests. What kind of tests are you thinking of, if you don't mind me asking? I'm not a doctor, so I don't really know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to assess your thyroid, a vitamin B12 and vitamin D level, and a folate level. These tests can help identify a lot of common causes of memory problems. We'll also do a urinalysis just to get a complete picture. The lab will draw blood, and you'll provide a urine sample. It should be fairly straightforward. The results usually take a few days to come back. While we're waiting for the results, I’d like you to keep a daily journal of your memory issues – when they occur, what triggers them, and how severe they are. That will help us track your symptoms and see if there's any pattern. Do you have any questions about the tests or the journal?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very reasonable. I can definitely do a journal. It’s a good idea, actually. I've been meaning to write things down more anyway. And the tests sound… thorough. Good. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… when will I hear about the results? And do I need to do anything special to prepare for the blood tests? Like fast beforehand or anything?
DOCTOR: Good. I’m glad you feel comfortable with the plan. The lab will contact you directly to schedule the blood tests. You will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand – that means no food or sugary drinks. You can drink water, though. They’ll give you specific instructions when you schedule the appointment, but it's best to be prepared. As for the results, I'll review them as soon as they come back, usually within 3-5 business days. I’ll then call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as confusion, difficulty speaking, weakness, or vision changes, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful and explained everything clearly. I feel much better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ebony. I’m glad I could help. It’s always best to address these concerns proactively. I’ll have the lab orders sent to the front desk, and they’ll provide you with the necessary paperwork and instructions. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I’ll speak with you soon.
