DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about some swelling, I think. It's… it’s hard to explain, honestly. My memory isn’t the best, and I’m not entirely sure when it started, or exactly what’s going on.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jahaad. We’ll take our time and figure it out together. It’s common for things to be a bit unclear when you're first noticing something new. Let’s start with the swelling. Where exactly are you experiencing the swelling?
PATIENT: It’s mostly on my face, Doctor. My cheeks, maybe? And… possibly my jaw? It’s difficult to pinpoint, truthfully. It comes and goes, so sometimes it’s harder to notice. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Jahaad. It’s helpful just to get a general idea. So, it’s primarily on your cheeks and possibly your jaw, coming and going in intensity. Now, can you describe the swelling a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it doesn’t hurt, not really. It’s more… puffy, I suppose. Like I haven’t slept well, but it’s not from lack of sleep. It’s… soft to the touch, I think. And sometimes it feels… warm? I’m not sure if that makes sense. It’s not painful, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy, soft to the touch, and occasionally warm. No pain associated with it. That’s good information. And how long would you say this has been going on, even approximately?
PATIENT: That’s… the hardest part, Doctor. Weeks, I believe. Perhaps a month or two? It’s very fuzzy. I sometimes think it gets worse after I’ve been… outside, maybe? But I can’t be certain. It’s really quite frustrating, not remembering properly.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating when things aren’t clear, Jahaad. We’ll do our best to piece it together. So, weeks to a couple of months, possibly worsening with being outdoors. To get a better understanding, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I haven’t felt unwell, if that makes sense. No fever, no chills. I haven’t had any trouble breathing or anything like that. Occasionally… just occasionally, my skin feels a little itchy where it’s swollen, but it’s not constant. And… I think I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but I put that down to work. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Jahaad, thank you. So, no fever, chills, or breathing difficulties. Occasional itching and a bit of fatigue, which you attribute to work. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so, Doctor. I’ve never knowingly had a reaction to anything. I don’t have any drug allergies, to my knowledge. I’ve always been quite careful with what I eat, so I haven’t had any food allergies either. But… it’s possible I’ve forgotten something. I apologize again for being so uncertain.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Jahaad. It's perfectly alright. We can always refer to your records if they are available. So, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications regularly. Not even vitamins, or anything like that. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I haven't felt the need to. I occasionally take something for a headache, but that’s very rare. Nothing consistent, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t been diagnosed with any chronic conditions. I’ve always been reasonably healthy, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – chickenpox, measles… but nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalized, or had any major surgeries. I really don’t have much of a medical history, to be honest. It’s… almost embarrassing, how little there is.
DOCTOR: That’s not embarrassing at all, Jahaad! In fact, it’s wonderful to hear. It makes things a lot simpler. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of autoimmune diseases, skin conditions, or allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult one, Doctor. My mother… she had some skin issues when she was younger, I believe. Nothing serious, just… some rashes from time to time. And my grandfather… he had something with his joints, I think. But I don’t know the specifics. We weren’t very close, and my family isn’t very forthcoming with medical information. I’m afraid I don’t have much to offer on that front either. It’s… frustrating, not knowing these things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jahaad. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. So, a history of some skin issues in your mother and something with the joints in your grandfather – that gives us a little something to work with. Finally, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week, but that’s it. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a relatively quiet life, to be honest. I work a lot, and when I’m not working, I enjoy reading and spending time with friends. I try to stay healthy and avoid anything that might be detrimental to my well-being.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jahaad. That's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to take a closer look at the swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I’m ready whenever you are. I’m hoping you can shed some light on what’s causing this.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit up straight and relax, that would be great. I’m going to start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then, I’ll examine the areas where you’re experiencing the swelling. Your blood pressure is 128/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. All within normal limits. Okay, I’m feeling some mild tenderness when I press on your cheeks. The swelling appears to be fairly symmetrical – meaning it’s roughly the same on both sides. Your ears look clear. No signs of infection. There’s no obvious lymph node swelling in your neck. Your skin feels warm and slightly dry. I don't see any rashes or lesions. Based on the physical exam, the swelling doesn't seem to be caused by an obvious infection or inflammatory process. It's mild, symmetrical, and without significant tenderness. The dryness of your skin could be contributing to the sensation of swelling.
PATIENT: So… it’s not anything serious, then? The dryness of my skin… could that really be causing this? I hadn’t considered that. I suppose I’ve been working long hours indoors with the air conditioning on, so that makes sense. But it still feels… unsettling. It comes and goes, and it’s hard to ignore.
DOCTOR: It's good that it doesn't appear to be anything serious, Jahaad. While the dryness could be a contributing factor, it’s also possible that it's a combination of things, or something else entirely. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. To rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests. A complete blood count will check for any signs of infection or inflammation. We’ll also check your thyroid function, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause swelling. And finally, I'd like to test for any allergies, just to be safe. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If it will help determine the cause, then please go ahead. I'd rather be thorough than leave things uncertain. Blood tests are fine with me. Would I need to fast beforehand? And where would I go to have those done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. You will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood tests – that means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. You can go to the lab at [Name of local lab], located at [Address of local lab]. I’ll send the requisition electronically to them, and they should be expecting you. They are open from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend using a good moisturizer on your face twice a day, and staying well-hydrated. Do you have any questions about the blood tests, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very clear. No, I don’t think I have any immediate questions. Moisturizer and hydration… that sounds manageable. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate this, Doctor. It’s been… unsettling, not knowing what’s causing it. Hopefully, the blood tests will shed some light on things. And thank you for sending the requisition electronically – that’s very convenient. I think that’s all for now. I’ll see you again once the results are back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. I understand it can be unsettling when you're not sure what's going on. That's what we're here for. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, difficulty breathing, or significant pain – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, I'll see you in a few days. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Solero. You too. I will certainly keep you informed if anything changes. Have a good day.
