DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah. My nails. They... not good. Something wrong with them, I think. I don't remember what exactly, just... wrong. They look funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, “something wrong with them, they look funny.” I understand. Can you tell me a little more about how they look funny?
PATIENT: Ugh. It's hard to explain. Like… different colors? And… bumpy. Not all of them, just some. And they feel… thick. Not like they used to, you know? I don't do nails, not fancy stuff. Just… normal. It's been a while, I guess. I don't keep up with things.
DOCTOR: Alright, color variation, bumpy texture, and thickening… and this has been going on for a while now. Okay. Ms. Thut, do you notice it on all your fingernails, or just a few?
PATIENT: Just a few. Maybe… three? On this hand, definitely. And I think one on this hand too. Not the little ones, the bigger ones. It's just… weird. I don't know why they changed. I didn't do anything different!
DOCTOR: Okay, a few of the larger nails. I understand. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with these nails?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. They don’t hurt. They’re just… annoying, I guess. Like, I keep catching them on things. And they don’t look nice. Honestly, they look kinda gross. I keep trying to file them down, but it doesn't help much.
DOCTOR: No pain, just catching them on things and they’re aesthetically bothering you. Okay. Ms. Thut, have you ever had any issues with fungal infections before?
PATIENT: Fungus? Oh, goodness no. Never. I stay clean. I mean, as clean as a person can be, right? I don't go around in dirty places. Is that what you think it is? Sounds awful.
DOCTOR: It's just something I need to rule out, Ms. Thut. Fungal infections are fairly common, and don't necessarily mean you aren't clean. It's just something we need to investigate. Now, have you noticed any changes to your skin around the nails?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm… let me see. Not really. Maybe a little red sometimes, but that's probably from me trying to file them down, right? They get kinda… rough. I don’t think anything special. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to my hands. They just are.
DOCTOR: Okay, some roughness around the nails, possibly from filing. And no other changes to the skin around them. Ms. Thut, are you experiencing any other symptoms – anything at all – like fatigue, fever, or joint pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No. Nothing like that. I get tired, sure, but who doesn’t? And my joints ache a little, but I’m getting old, aren’t I? That’s just… part of life, right? I don’t have fevers or anything scary like that. Just… regular old lady stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, fatigue and joint pain are within normal limits for your age. Now, I'd like to take a closer look at your nails, if that's alright. And perhaps we can do a quick examination of your hands and skin to get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you need to do. Just... don't take too long, alright? I have… things to do. Not important things, but things. And I don’t like doctors poking around too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick as possible. Alright. I'm observing some changes in the nails on your right hand, specifically the second, third, and fifth digits. There's a noticeable discoloration, a thickening of the nail plate, and some ridging. The nail beds appear to be well-perfused, thankfully. I don't see any significant inflammation of the surrounding skin. I'm going to document these findings. It could be a fungal infection, Ms. Thut, but it’s also important to rule out other possibilities. To be sure, I'd like to take a small nail clipping for a fungal culture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A clipping? Oh, goodness. You want to cut my nails? Now? I just got them… well, not got them done, but I filed them. And you’re sure you can’t just tell me what it is? It sounds awful, clipping them. What if it hurts?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Thut. It’s a very small clipping, just a tiny piece of the affected nail. It shouldn’t hurt at all. It's like trimming a hangnail, really. It’s the most accurate way to determine if a fungus is present. And I wish I could just tell you definitively, but I can't without further testing. There are other conditions that can cause similar changes to the nails, and we need to rule those out as well. It's important to get an accurate diagnosis so we can get you the right treatment. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If it's just a tiny bit... and it won’t hurt... I guess. Just get it over with. And be quick about it, alright? I really don’t like this. Explain it, fine, but the less talking, the better. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick as possible. I’m going to use a small nail clipper to carefully trim a tiny piece from the edge of the affected nail. It won't go deep, and it shouldn't cause any discomfort. Then, I'll place the clipping in a special container and send it to the lab for analysis. The results usually take about two weeks. There we go. Just a tiny piece. See?
PATIENT: Ugh. That looks awful. Well, get it away from me. And tell me, what happens if it is fungus? What do I have to do? I don't want to be taking pills or anything. I don’t like medicine.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If it is a fungal infection, there are a few different treatment options available. The most common is an oral antifungal medication, which is taken by mouth. However, as you mentioned, you're not keen on taking pills, so we can also consider a topical antifungal medication, which is applied directly to the nail. Topical treatments take much longer to show results, and they're not always as effective as oral medications, but they're a good option if you prefer to avoid pills. We can discuss the pros and cons of each option once we have the lab results. It’s important to weigh the benefits and risks and choose the treatment that's right for you. For now, let’s just get the sample sent to the lab and see what the results say. In the meantime, you can keep your nails trimmed short and dry to help prevent the infection from spreading, if it is indeed a fungal infection. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Trimmed short and dry… yeah, alright. I can do that. It's just… everything feels so complicated. Is there anything else I need to do? I don't want to forget something. My memory is terrible.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be a bit overwhelming. For now, just keeping the nails trimmed short and dry is the most important thing. Also, avoid sharing nail clippers or other personal hygiene items with others. And if you notice any changes to other nails, please let me know. I'll also send a note to your primary care physician to let them know about this visit and the lab results. It’s always good to keep them in the loop. To summarize, we’ve taken a nail clipping for a fungal culture, and we’ll follow up in about two weeks once the results are available. In the meantime, keep your nails trimmed short and dry, and avoid sharing personal hygiene items. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Short and dry, don’t share. Two weeks. Okay. I think… I think that’s everything. Can I go now? I really need to… do things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Thut. I’ll have the nurse come in to review the discharge instructions with you and schedule your follow-up appointment. Thank you for coming in today. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up.
