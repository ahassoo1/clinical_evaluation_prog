DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Hmm… my wife, she want… baby. We old, you know? I make little things… with metal. She say maybe… help make baby? I forget… what she say exactly. Something about… planning? It good to plan, yes?
DOCTOR: Planning, yes. Certainly. Though, at your age… it's… unusual. Let's clarify a few things. You said your wife wants to have a baby?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. She very happy. Always happy. We been married… long time. Very long. I think she think… a baby would make her even happier. But… maybe difficult? She worry a little, and I worry with her. I not so good with… numbers and dates, you understand? My hands better with… the metal.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's start with some basics. You mentioned you and your wife have been married a long time. Can you give me a rough estimate of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time. Very long. More than… ten years. Maybe… twenty? I forget the number, Doctor. It was… before the big rain. We live here always. She remember the numbers better, my wife. She good with… remembering. I remember making things… little cars and… animals.
DOCTOR: Twenty years is… significant. And you’re both currently healthy, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Healthy? Yes, I think so. I work with my hands every day. Good exercise, you know? No big sickness. Sometimes… a little ache in my back, but nothing serious. My wife, she walk every morning. Very strong woman. She take… pills for her water. Something about her blood? I don’t know the name. But she see the other doctor… regular. She good at taking care of herself.
DOCTOR: Alright. She takes medication for her blood… do you happen to know which medication?
PATIENT: Medication… hmm. Small white pill, I think. She take it with the… breakfast. And another one… a little blue one, sometimes. She say it for… pressure? I really don’t know, Doctor. She keep the bottles. I just make things. Metal things. She worries about the names. I forget easily.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's important we have a clear understanding of her medical history. I'm going to need to access her records from her other physician. Do you know who that doctor is, and where they are located?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Doctor… Miller. She see Doctor Miller over in… the town. Not far. Small building. By the… the bakery. Everyone know Doctor Miller. She very nice lady. She check my wife all the time. I go with her sometimes. Yes, Doctor Miller. She good doctor. I think she know everything about my wife.
DOCTOR: Doctor Miller… yes, here we are. Okay. It seems she's been managing your wife's hypertension and… ah, yes, she’s also being treated for early-stage kidney disease. Mr. Carlotta, with all due respect, attempting to conceive a child at your age, and with your wife's existing medical conditions… it presents significant risks to both of you.
PATIENT: Risks? Oh… dear. What kind of risks? She very strong, my wife. But… kidney? I did not know. She never say… much. Just pills. We want… happy. Just a small baby… to love. Is… is very bad? We can… stop, if it is too dangerous. She… she not want to be sick.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, kidney disease means her kidneys are not functioning properly. Pregnancy puts significant strain on the kidneys. It could lead to serious complications—even failure. And at your age, the risks of chromosomal abnormalities in the child are also substantially increased. I strongly advise against attempting to conceive. We can discuss alternative options, perhaps exploring the possibility of a grandchild through other means. But a biological child, given the circumstances… it's simply not a realistic or safe path.
PATIENT: Oh… dear. Failure? No… no, that is… bad. She… she would be very sad. Chromo… what did you say? I don’t understand… the big words. She want a baby with me. A little part of us… both. Other means…? What… what do you mean? We just want… a family. Is there nothing… nothing at all… to help? Even a little bit?
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I understand your desire for a family. However, we must be realistic. Given your wife's age and pre-existing conditions, even attempting to conceive would be irresponsible. There are other ways to expand your family—adoption, for example. Or focusing on the relationships with existing family members. As for medical interventions… there are fertility treatments, but they carry significant risks even in healthy individuals. In your wife's case, they are simply not advisable. I will not perform any procedures or prescribe any medications that could jeopardize her health. We can discuss managing her existing conditions, but that is the extent of what I can offer.
PATIENT: No… baby… no baby. She… she will be very, very sad. Adoption… she always say… her own. Part of us. I… I don’t know what to tell her. She is… the sunshine. If I tell her no… Sunshine… will go away. I… thank you, Doctor. For… telling me truth. Even if… hard to hear. .
