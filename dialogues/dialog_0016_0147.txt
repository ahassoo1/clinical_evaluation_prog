DOCTOR: Hi Amy, welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I wanted to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. That’s good you’re getting it checked out. When you say “a little while”, can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Probably… around three months, maybe? It wasn't very noticeable at first, just felt a bit different. But it’s grown a little bit over that time, so that’s why I decided to come in. It doesn't really hurt, just… is there.
DOCTOR: Alright, three months. And it’s not painful, just present. That's helpful to know. Is it a constant size, or does it fluctuate – does it feel bigger sometimes than others?
PATIENT: It seems pretty consistent, actually. I haven’t really noticed it changing much in size day to day, no. Maybe a tiny bit after I eat, but it's hard to say if that's just my imagination. I haven't been tracking it or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent size, maybe slightly larger after eating. Do you remember anything specific happening around the time you first noticed it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… honestly, not really. Things were pretty normal then. Work was busy – I was rehearsing for a show – and I was just trying to keep up with everything. I don’t recall any injury or illness around that time. It just… appeared, gradually.
DOCTOR: Alright, no specific event. Okay. And where exactly in your lower abdomen is the lump located?
PATIENT: It’s… sort of in the middle, a little bit to the left. Not right on my hipbone, but definitely below my belly button. It’s difficult to describe exactly. Like, if you drew a line down the middle of my stomach, it's a bit off to the left side of that line.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little to the left of midline, below the belly button. And would you describe it as firm, soft, or something else?
PATIENT: Hmm… firm, I think. Not rock hard, but definitely not squishy like fat. It has a bit of give, but it feels… solid. It's not painful when I press on it, just… there. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. Firm, not painful to the touch. Okay. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with this lump?
PATIENT: No, not really. No changes in my bowel habits, no weight loss, no fever or anything like that. Just the lump. Everything else feels normal, thankfully. Is that unusual? Should I be experiencing other things?
DOCTOR: No, it's not unusual to have a lump without other symptoms, but we want to figure out what it is. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It'll just involve feeling around in your abdomen. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’d like to know what’s going on, so anything you can do to help figure it out is good.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay… I’m feeling around now. I can definitely feel a firm mass, about… two centimeters in diameter, located slightly left of midline, as you described. It’s not tender to the touch, and it feels fairly well-defined. I don’t feel any rebound tenderness or guarding. It does seem to be fixed – meaning it doesn't move around easily when I press on it. I’m also listening to your bowel sounds, which sound normal. Do you feel any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. It just feels… like something’s there, as usual. That sounds… concerning, about it being fixed. What does that usually mean? Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking. "Fixed" can mean a few different things, and it's not automatically bad. It simply means it’s not freely moving under the abdominal wall. It could be a number of things. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a couple of tests. First, a complete blood count to rule out any infection or inflammation. And second, an abdominal ultrasound. That will help us visualize the mass and determine its characteristics – size, shape, and whether it's solid or fluid-filled. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. Blood work and an ultrasound… definitely. Whatever it takes to find out what's going on. I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need a referral for the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: Good. The blood work should be back within a day or two. As for the ultrasound, I'll send a referral to the imaging center down the street – they usually have appointments available within a few days. They will contact you directly to schedule. Once the ultrasound results are in, we'll review them together and discuss the next steps. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Nothing that I know of, anyway. No reactions to medications or anything like that. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Maskal. It makes me feel a little bit better knowing what’s going on and what the plan is.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help. Okay, just to quickly recap, we’ve discussed the lump in your lower abdomen, its location, and characteristics. We're ordering a complete blood count and an abdominal ultrasound. I’m also documenting your height and weight as 160 centimeters and 129 pounds respectively, and that you are insured with Medicare. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I really appreciate your patience and explanations. I suppose… I’ll just wait for the imaging center to call now?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. The imaging center will call to schedule the ultrasound. If you don't hear from them within 24-48 hours, please give my office a call and we can help facilitate the scheduling process. Here's a copy of the lab requisition form and the ultrasound referral. I'll also send the results to your primary care physician, as a courtesy. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. Maskal. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I'll wait for the call from the imaging center and will reach out if I haven't heard anything. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could help. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I will see you when the results are in. Have a good day as well.
