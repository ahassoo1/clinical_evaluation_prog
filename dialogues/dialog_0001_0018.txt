DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather a bothersome thing, really. I seem to be going to the restroom… quite a lot. More than usual, certainly. It’s been happening for a little while now, though I can’t say exactly how long. Time does seem to slip away, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Frequent urination. And you say "a little while"?
PATIENT: Yes, “a little while.” Perhaps a month? Or maybe a bit longer. It's difficult to be precise. I haven’t been keeping… meticulous records, if you understand. It's not a sudden change, Doctor, more of a… gradual increase. It's just become noticeable enough to warrant a visit. I do find myself waking up a couple of times during the night to go as well, which is… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Disruptive. And is it… just frequency, or are you experiencing any burning, pain, difficulty emptying your bladder, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no burning or pain, thankfully. And emptying… yes, that seems normal enough. It doesn’t feel like I’m… holding anything back, if that makes sense. Just… going more often. A lot more often. It's mostly just inconvenient, really. Though I admit, it is a little worrying. I don't recall anything specific that triggered it, either. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Not intentionally, no. I eat… reasonably, I suppose. I haven’t started drinking any more fluids than usual, at least not that I’m aware of. I have a cup of coffee with breakfast, as I always do, and perhaps a glass of water with dinner. No new teas or… fizzy drinks. I can’t honestly say there’s been a noticeable shift in what I consume. Though, now that you mention it, I believe Mrs. Novak next door did offer me some rather large plums last week... Could that be it? I ate quite a few.
DOCTOR: Plums. Right. Let's move on. Any family history of… bladder issues, kidney problems, diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she passed away some time ago. I believe she had some… circulatory problems, if I recall correctly. Nothing specific related to the bladder, no. And my father… he was a very stoic man. He didn't speak much about ailments. I don't believe he had any major health concerns, but then again, I wasn’t privy to all the details. As for diabetes… I don’t believe so. Though, with my memory… I couldn't say with absolute certainty. It was a long time ago. I believe my sister, Eliska, had some issues with her… eyesight, but I don't think it was related to anything like that. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Somewhat. Okay. Let’s do a quick exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and I'll need a urine sample. Standard procedure. Just to rule things out. Don't worry about it.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. Whatever you deem necessary. Listening to my abdomen… and a urine sample. I can manage that. Where shall I… provide the sample? Is there a restroom nearby?
DOCTOR: Down the hall, first door on the left. There's a cup in there. Try to get a mid-stream sample, if you can. And I’ll get things ready in here. Take your time.
PATIENT: Very good. A mid-stream sample. I believe I recall the instructions. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: ...
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I hope that was sufficient. It wasn’t terribly… plentiful, but I did my best. I do apologize if it's not a perfect specimen.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me run this quick dipstick test. Okay… not a lot of protein, no blood, glucose is normal. That’s… not immediately alarming. Now, let's listen to your abdomen. Lie back on the table, please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. I do hope everything is alright. I confess, I'm not particularly fond of medical examinations. It always brings back… unpleasant memories. But I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Okay… sounds clear. No masses, no tenderness. Any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: No, no significant pain. Perhaps a little… discomfort, but nothing I would describe as alarming. It’s… a general feeling of… being examined, if that makes sense. I'm not accustomed to having my abdomen tapped, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, everything seems normal physically. Given your age and the lack of any concerning findings, it's likely… benign prostatic hyperplasia – BPH. An enlarged prostate. It’s common as men get older. That explains the increased frequency, especially at night.
PATIENT: An enlarged… prostate? Is that… serious, Doctor? I confess, I'm not familiar with that term. Will I require… surgery? I do hope not. I’ve never been one for hospitals or… invasive procedures. Is there anything I can do to… alleviate the symptoms? Perhaps a change in diet? Or some sort of… medication? I would prefer to avoid any drastic measures, if possible.
DOCTOR: It’s not immediately life-threatening, no. Most men deal with it eventually. Surgery is a last resort. We can try some lifestyle modifications – reduce fluid intake before bed, avoid caffeine, and we can discuss a medication. An alpha-blocker, usually. It helps relax the muscles in the prostate. It might have some side effects – dizziness, low blood pressure – but they’re usually manageable. Here’s some information on BPH and the medication. Read it over. And I’ll write you a prescription for tamsulosin. Start with a low dose. If it doesn’t help, or the side effects are too bothersome, we can adjust it. Come back in a month, and we’ll see how you’re doing. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Tamsulosin… yes, I see. Side effects… dizziness and low blood pressure. I confess, I'm not thrilled at the prospect of either. But I suppose it’s better than… surgery. A month, you say? And reduce fluids before bed… and avoid caffeine. I can manage that, I believe. Just one question, Doctor. Is this… common in my family? Would my sister, Eliska, need to be concerned? And… is it something I could have prevented? Perhaps by… eating more plums, or less of them? I do apologize for the rather silly question. It’s just… I like to understand these things, if possible.
DOCTOR: It's not hereditary, no. Your sister is fine. And no, you didn't cause it by eating plums. It's just… age. Things wear out. It's not preventable. Really, you're overthinking this. Any other questions, or can I get you out of here?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Thank you for your time… and your… patience. I apologize for my incessant questioning. I do tend to… overthink things, as you correctly pointed out. I shall take the medication as prescribed, and… avoid plums. And I will return in a month, as you instructed. Good day, Doctor Pehrson. .
