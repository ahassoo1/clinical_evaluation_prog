DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Leidy Eaddy. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… something about being awfully tired. Just… tired. And the young man at the lab said something about my… numbers being off. Creatine… something? Honestly, I don’t keep track of all that. It’s probably just old age, if you want to know the truth. I’ve always been a hard worker though, you know. A commercial diver doesn’t get much rest.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “tired” is rather nonspecific, isn't it?
PATIENT: Nonspecific? It means I’m exhausted! More than usual, anyway. I used to be able to work all day and still have energy for… things. Now, I just want to sit. And my muscles ache. Not all the time, but… enough to notice. It's not like I'm expecting you to fix old age, dear, but it's bothersome.
DOCTOR: I see. And this fatigue… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… a while. Months, I suppose. It comes and goes, you know? Some days I feel alright, and other days… well, like I said. Just… drained. It's hard to say exactly when it started. I’ve been busy, dear. Always busy.
DOCTOR: Busy is understandable. However, to get a better understanding, Ms. Oitker, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day? Honestly, it depends. My husband, Tenzing, does most of the heavy lifting now. I used to be the diver, you know. But these days… I mostly oversee things. Check the equipment, make sure the boat's in order, handle the paperwork. Sometimes I'll go out on the boat with Tenzing, but I don’t do much diving myself anymore. Mostly just… watch. And worry. It's a lot of responsibility, running a business.
DOCTOR: I see. And you mentioned muscle aches. Where exactly are you experiencing these aches, and would you describe them as constant, or intermittent?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not one place, dear. It's… everywhere, really. My legs mostly, and my back. And sometimes my arms. It’s not constant, no. It comes and goes. Like a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, not terrible. Just… unpleasant. It's probably just the weather. Dampness always gets to my bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to other matters. Do you have any difficulty breathing, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? Not… usually. No. I get a little winded sometimes, climbing stairs, maybe. But that’s just because I’m not as young as I used to be. I haven’t noticed anything… wrong, exactly. Look, I've spent my life underwater, if I had trouble breathing, you’d know about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me think… Now that you mention it, maybe a little. But I always thought that was just from being on my feet too much. Overseeing things, you know. Running back and forth. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those sorts of things. Tenzing notices things like that more than I do.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your diet, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Diet. Well, we eat… normally. Tenzing does most of the cooking. He makes a good dal bhat, if you know what that is. Rice and lentils. And vegetables. It’s… healthy, I suppose. We don't eat a lot of… processed things. I try to stay away from too much sugar, but sometimes I have a little mithai with my tea. It’s important to enjoy life, you know.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I haven't taken much medicine in my life. A little headache now and then, maybe. Nothing serious. I prefer to let things heal on their own. All those chemicals… I don’t trust them.
DOCTOR: I see here you had a bout of pneumonia in 2018, Ms. Oitker. Do you recall that?
PATIENT: Pneumonia? Oh, goodness. That was… a long time ago. I remember being very sick. Stuck in bed. Tenzing took very good care of me. It was a bad winter, I think. Lots of coughing. But that was ages ago. I recovered, didn’t I? I’m still here.
DOCTOR: Yes, you recovered. Now, Ms. Oitker, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Go ahead. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just… don’t poke too much. I’m an old woman, my bones are fragile.
DOCTOR: Very well. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I do hear some… diminished breath sounds, particularly in the lower lobes. And as you mentioned, there is some mild pitting edema present bilaterally. Reflexes are… within normal limits. We’ll need to run some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Specifically, I want to check your kidney function and look for any signs of inflammation.
PATIENT: Inflammation? Goodness. Is something seriously wrong? I told you it was probably just old age. Are you sure it's not just… the weather? I don't like the sound of blood work. Lots of poking and prodding, I presume? And waiting? I haven't got time for waiting, dear. I’ve got a business to run.
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, I understand your concerns. But it’s important to rule out any underlying medical issues. The blood work will help us to determine the cause of your fatigue and the edema. It's a standard procedure. It will involve a small amount of blood being drawn from your arm. And while I can't say definitively what's going on without the results, your symptoms do warrant further investigation. I will also order a urine sample. I’m going to order these tests now. The lab technician will explain the procedure to you. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Urine sample and blood work? Honestly, it sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing. But… alright. Fine. If you insist. But if it turns out to be nothing, I expect an apology. And I hope it doesn't take too long. Tenzing will be wondering where I am. And tell me… will it hurt? I don't like needles. Not at all.
DOCTOR: The blood draw may cause a slight pinch, Ms. Oitker, but it is generally well-tolerated. The urine sample will be a simple collection. I assure you, we will do everything we can to make you comfortable. The lab is just down the hall. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to rest and stay hydrated. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Rest? Hydrated? Easy for you to say, dear. Running a business doesn't allow for much resting. But alright, I’ll try. And no, I don’t think so. Just… get it over with quickly. And tell the young man to be gentle with the needle. Honestly, I’ve had enough poking for one day. I suppose I’ll go and see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab technician is expecting you. Please let me know if you have any trouble locating them. I will review the results as soon as they are available. Have a good day, Ms. Oitker. .
PATIENT: Fuss, that’s all it is. Fuss and poking… A good day? Hardly.
