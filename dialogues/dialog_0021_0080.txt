DOCTOR: Alright, well, have a seat. So, Thyra, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Havird. Thanks. I’m just here to get some forms filled out, really. Medicare sent me a bunch and said I needed a doctor to sign off on ‘em. It’s mostly just stuff about… well, I don’t even really know what it’s about, to be honest. They just said I needed to bring ‘em in.
DOCTOR: Forms. Right. Medicare and their… paperwork. Honestly, it's a mess. Let me see ‘em. I'll take a quick look. Don't worry too much about what they say, I'll sort it out. Though, it'd be helpful if you had any idea what these are for. Are they new patient forms?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see… I think they might be new patient forms? I haven’t been to a doctor in… a while. Honestly, everything looks pretty much the same to me – lots of boxes and questions! I don’t recall getting anything specifically about being a new patient, though. Just a big envelope from Medicare.
DOCTOR: Right, well, it seems Medicare is trying to get everything straightened out with your tribal affiliation. Good. That’s… something. Have you ever had any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Significant medical problems? Not really, no. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, you know? A bad sprain in my ankle a few years back when I was helping my husband with some work around the ranch, but that healed up fine. Nothing… serious. I try to stay healthy, eat good food, get enough sleep. I guess that’s why I haven’t been in here much! Is this something I need to list on the forms?
DOCTOR: Colds and flu are… normal. The ankle sprain, yes, that’s something. We need to document everything. It's all about liability these days. Any family history of… anything?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Let me think. My grandmother, on my mom’s side, she had diabetes. And my dad’s brother, he had heart trouble. But other than that… not really that I know of. A lot of folks in my family just… didn’t go to the doctor much, you know? So we didn’t really talk about these things. Does that help? Is this important? I don't want to leave anything out.
DOCTOR: Diabetes and heart trouble. Okay, noted. It’s… helpful. Barely. Look, a lot of people don’t prioritize healthcare, I understand. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I haven’t taken a lot of medication in my life, so… I don’t think so. I’m usually pretty careful about what I put in my body, and I let my husband know if I try anything new, just in case. Is there anything specific I should be watching out for? It’s just, I haven’t had to deal with this stuff much.
DOCTOR: No allergies. Good. That simplifies things. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. Just vitamins sometimes, but that’s it. A multivitamin when I remember, and sometimes extra Vitamin D in the winter. But that’s really all. I try to get most of what I need from my food, you know? Is that something I need to write down? The vitamins? I always forget what’s important and what’s not.
DOCTOR: Vitamins… technically, yes, you should mention them. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Routine. Just to be thorough. If you could just hop up there, please.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. That sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I always feel a little awkward at the doctor's office, honestly. It's been so long since I've had a check-up.
DOCTOR: Just relax. 128 over 76. Not bad. Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Soft, non-tender. Everything seems… normal. For now.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. I was worried something might be wrong, since it’s been so long. What happens next? Do I still need to fill out all these forms? I’m just hoping Medicare doesn’t need a whole lot more information. It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, you still need to fill out the forms. Medicare requires documentation, regardless of whether or not anything is actually wrong. It's bureaucracy. We've covered the basics. No significant findings on exam. Family history is… vague. For now, I’ll just document that you’re a healthy 35-year-old female presenting for a Medicare physical. I suggest you schedule a follow-up appointment in a year, just to keep things up-to-date. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A year? Okay, that sounds… reasonable. I guess. Um… no, I don’t think so. Just… thank you for seeing me. And for not finding anything seriously wrong! I appreciate it. So I just need to finish filling these out, and then I’m good to go? Is there anything specific I should write in the “reason for visit” section? I don’t really have a “reason,” since it’s just for Medicare.
DOCTOR: Write "Medicare Annual Physical". That's sufficient. You can finish the paperwork over there. I’ll be back to review it once you’re done. Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any… questions. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. Medicare Annual Physical… right. .
