DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve just been… forgetting things. Little things, mostly, but it's happening more and more often, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Memory issues can be concerning. “Little things,” you say… can you give me some examples?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Like, I left my keys in the fridge yesterday. And I totally forgot I had a dentist appointment last week – my neighbor had to remind me! Then there was… oh, what was I going to say? See, that’s what I mean! It’s not huge things, but it’s… frustrating. And a little scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. So, misplaced items, forgotten appointments… and you’re experiencing difficulty recalling things as you speak. How long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. That’s a good question. It feels like… maybe six months? It started slowly, just a few little slips here and there. But definitely getting worse the last couple of months. It's hard to say exactly, to be honest. It’s not like there was a specific day it started, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Gradual onset is common. And you said it’s been worsening over the last couple of months. Are these memory lapses interfering with your daily activities—work, social life, things like that?
PATIENT: Well, work is… okay. I’m a dentist, so I’m pretty focused when I’m doing something. It's more things outside of that, I guess. I’ve forgotten a few dates with friends, had to cancel plans because I double-booked myself. It's just… annoying. And I worry about it getting worse, and then not being able to work at all. That's a scary thought.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And do you notice any difficulty with things like finding the right words, or understanding what people are saying?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not all the time, but… yes. Like, I'll be talking and… the word will just be gone. It's on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t pull it out. Or I’ll be listening to someone and have to ask them to repeat something. It's not constant, but it happens enough that I've noticed. It's… embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any history of… head injuries, strokes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I was a pretty clumsy kid, maybe a few bumps and bruises, but nothing serious. No strokes, no concussions… I don’t think so, anyway. I had the usual childhood illnesses, chickenpox, measles… but nothing major as an adult. I had my appendix out when I was 16, but that was a long time ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Just documenting, Ms. Heidenthal. Appendectomy doesn’t sound relevant, but we need to be thorough. Any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… I have high blood pressure, but it's pretty well controlled with medication. And… oh, I had a bout of pneumonia a couple of years ago, but I recovered fully. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with medication. Pneumonia, recovered. Good. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Really, that’s about it. I don't like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m pretty boring that way, honestly. No allergies, no major health problems… or wasn't before this memory stuff started.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ms. Heidenthal, based on what you’ve told me, it could be a number of things. Stress, lack of sleep, even vitamin deficiencies can sometimes cause memory issues. But given the progression and your description, we need to investigate further. I’d like to start with a brief physical exam and then order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. I want to figure out what's going on, so whatever you think is best. A physical exam and blood work… that seems sensible. I'm a little nervous, but I understand. Let's get started.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright. Let’s start with your vital signs. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, and then we’ll do a basic neurological exam - check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. It’s a fairly quick process. If you’ll just have a seat here…
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m just going to check your blood pressure now. Try to relax and keep your arm still. Blood pressure is 135/85. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to ask you to relax your legs while I gently tap on your knees and ankles…
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead. I’m a little nervous, but I’ll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Finally, I'm going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is that okay? I haven’t really been getting a lot of exercise lately, so I might be a little wobbly.
DOCTOR: Your gait is slightly unsteady, but within normal limits for someone who hasn't been exercising regularly. There's no significant imbalance or weakness. Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. That completes the basic physical exam. Everything appears generally normal, but we still need to get some blood work to rule out any underlying causes for your memory issues. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin B12 level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Absolutely, do whatever you think is best. Blood work is fine. When will I know the results? And will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab usually takes 24-48 hours to process the results. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they're available. And yes, I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the next steps. How does next week look for you?
PATIENT: Next week… hmm. Let me think. Monday is good. Or… Wednesday afternoon would work, too. I’m a dentist, so my schedule is a little flexible. Which day works better for you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Wednesday afternoon works perfectly. Let’s schedule you for Wednesday at 2:00 PM. My nurse will call to confirm. Now, do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Heidenthal?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything really well, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I'm a little anxious, of course, but I feel better knowing we're doing something to figure this out. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I understand your anxiety, and we'll get to the bottom of this together. In the meantime, try not to stress too much, and if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. My nurse will be with you shortly to schedule the blood work and confirm your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Ms. Heidenthal.
