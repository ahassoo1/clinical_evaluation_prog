DOCTOR: Hi Tasmia, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time. My blood pressure’s been high, that’s what the machine at the pharmacy said. My husband made me come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good your husband is looking out for you. Even if it feels like worrying, it's good to get things checked out. "High" can mean a lot of things, though. Do you happen to remember what the numbers were when the machine at the pharmacy took your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I just saw the “high” part flashing. Numbers aren't really my thing. I just know it was enough for him to schedule this whole thing. He’s always been a bit dramatic.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. We can definitely get a reading here and see what's going on. It's good we're checking it out regardless. Has this happened before, where you've noticed a high reading on a machine somewhere?
PATIENT: Ugh, maybe once or twice at work when they do those health screenings. They always rush you through those, though. I didn’t pay much attention. It usually went back down on its own. I don’t remember specifics. Honestly, I'm busy, and I don't keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. It sounds like it might have been temporary before, but let’s get a reading now to be sure. And we can talk about what might be causing it, even if it is temporary. Before I take your blood pressure, can you tell me a little bit about any other health concerns you have?
PATIENT: Health concerns? Look, I work. I’m on my feet all day, doing engineering stuff. It’s a physical job. I don’t have health concerns. My husband’s the one who's always convinced I’m about to fall apart. I eat okay, I guess. I don't sit around eating junk food all day, if that’s what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Being on your feet all day is physically demanding, and that can definitely affect things. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any symptoms alongside this high blood pressure reading?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I feel… normal. Tired, sometimes, from work. But that’s just… work. I don’t get headaches or anything like that. Maybe a little dizzy sometimes, but that's probably from being on my feet for twelve hours. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and occasional dizziness... those are good things to mention. Just trying to get a full picture. The dizziness – does it happen when you stand up quickly, or is it more random?
PATIENT: It's usually when I stand up too fast. Like, if I've been bending over something for a while, and then I try to get up quickly. Happens every now and then. It's not a big deal, honestly. Can we just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand you're busy. That dizziness when standing up quickly is helpful information. It's called orthostatic hypotension, and it can sometimes be related to blood pressure. Let’s take your blood pressure and pulse now. Then, I'll do a quick physical exam, just to be sure everything else looks okay. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… hurry. I really don’t have all day. I told my boss I’d be back by lunchtime.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just roll up your sleeve, please. And relax your arm. I'm going to inflate this cuff, and it'll squeeze for a moment. It doesn't hurt, just feels a little tight. Okay, your blood pressure is 150/95. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now, and then I'll quickly check your reflexes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: 150/95? Is that bad? My husband is going to have a field day if that’s bad. Look, I don’t like being squeezed. And I don’t like people listening to my heart. But fine. Just get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: It's a little elevated, yes. It doesn't automatically mean there's something seriously wrong, but it's good we're looking into it. And I'll be as quick as possible. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and equal in all extremities. Okay, everything sounds and feels normal so far. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t take anything. I don't need anything. I get sick as rarely as possible. My husband tries to get me to take vitamins, but I refuse. I'm perfectly healthy, or I was, before all this worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, no current medications. That's good. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history? Really? My mom’s side, they've got… diabetes, I think. And heart stuff. Old age stuff, mostly. My dad’s side, they’re all pretty healthy, actually. Hunters and farmers, strong people. That’s about it. It’s not like I can change my genes, is it? So what's the point?
DOCTOR: That's a fair point, you can't change your genes, but it does help us understand your risk factors. Knowing about the diabetes and heart issues on your mom’s side is helpful. And it's good to hear your dad’s side has a history of good health. Just one more question for now. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Are you serious? I have a job. I don’t have time for any of that. My husband would kill me if I did. Honestly, are you trying to make me feel bad? I'm a responsible adult. Let's just get to the point. What's wrong with me?
DOCTOR: No, not at all! I'm just gathering information to get a complete picture of your health. It sounds like you live a very healthy lifestyle, which is great. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and the elevated blood pressure reading, it's likely you have what we call "essential hypertension," meaning high blood pressure without a clear underlying cause. But we need to rule out any other possibilities before we can say for sure. I'd like to order a few blood tests, just to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and cholesterol levels. And a urine test, just to make sure there aren't any hidden issues. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Urine tests? Now you're just trying to scare me. This is ridiculous. My husband is going to be so smug. Look, I don't want any tests. I feel fine. It's probably just stress. All this worrying, all this poking and prodding... it's raising my blood pressure! Can I just go home now?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if this feels stressful. But even if you feel fine, high blood pressure can damage your organs over time without any noticeable symptoms. The tests will help us determine if there's an underlying cause or if we just need to focus on managing your blood pressure. I strongly recommend the tests, Tasmia. If we rule out other causes, we can discuss lifestyle modifications – like stress reduction techniques, diet changes, and exercise – to help lower your blood pressure naturally. If those aren't enough, we can consider medication. But we need information first. I'm concerned about your blood pressure reading, and I want to be thorough. I won't force you to have the tests, but I want to make sure you understand the potential risks of leaving this unaddressed. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I’ll do the stupid tests. But I’m telling you, it’s just stress. My husband is going to be so happy. Can I at least get a referral for a massage or something? This whole thing is making my blood pressure even higher just thinking about it. Just hurry up and tell me what I need to do. And I want it to be quick. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. We’ll get the lab orders done quickly. Okay, I’m printing out the lab requisition now. You’ll need to provide a blood sample and a urine sample at the lab. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They're open until 5pm today. As for the massage, that’s a great idea! I can write you a referral for a licensed massage therapist. Stress management is a very important part of controlling blood pressure. I'll also give you a handout with some information about hypertension, lifestyle modifications, and stress reduction techniques. In the meantime, I recommend trying some relaxation exercises – deep breathing, meditation, yoga – and reducing your caffeine and sodium intake. Once we get the lab results back, we can discuss a more tailored plan. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to go over everything. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Fine. One week. Just… don’t call me with any surprises. I don’t need any more stress. And I don’t want a lecture about eating right. I'm a grown woman. Just get me the results. Let me go now. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. I’ll make sure the results are sent to you promptly. And I promise, no lectures. I’m here if you have any questions. Take care of yourself, Tasmia. And try to relax. .
