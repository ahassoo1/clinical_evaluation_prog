DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I’m Dr. TodoroVICH. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… I have been having trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I breathe. It is… uncomfortable. Especially when I walk.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A whistling sound, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… a small bird, maybe? But inside my chest. It comes and goes. Not all the time. More when I am doing something. Like walking up the stairs. Or carrying groceries. It’s not a pain, exactly. Just… hard to get my breath.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Maybe… two weeks? It started slowly. I thought it was just because I pushed myself too hard in the garden. I like to work outside, you see. But it has not gotten better. It feels… worse, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you having any other symptoms with the whistling?
PATIENT: Other… problems? Let me think. Sometimes… I feel a little tired. More tired than usual. And maybe… a little bit of coughing. But not much. Mostly just this… whistling. And the tiredness. Oh! And my chest feels… tight. Like a band around it, sometimes. Not a painful tight, just… squeezed.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… No, not that I have seen. I check them sometimes. My daughter tells me to. She worries. But no, they look… normal. I do wear slippers most of the time, though. Perhaps that is why I haven’t noticed?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No, not that I know of. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. But I don’t think he had a problem with his heart. I have had my checkups, every year. The doctor always said I was… strong. I was very active, even when I was older. I used to be a trainer, you see. For athletes. Perhaps they would have noticed something then?
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about asthma, or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Asthma… no. Never been told I have asthma. Bronchitis… I had a bad cough once, a long time ago. Maybe twenty years ago? The doctor gave me something for it, and it went away. But I don’t… I don’t think that is what this is. This is different. It's more… inside. And the whistling. Bronchitis didn't whistle, did it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen levels, and just take a look at your overall condition. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… good. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I will try to be very still.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. And again… Alright. I'm hearing some wheezing in your lungs, particularly on the lower lobes. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but regular. Oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a bit low. No significant swelling in the ankles. Your blood pressure is 140/90. Hmm. So, it sounds like you likely have some mild bronchitis, possibly with a bit of asthma component developing. It’s not terribly concerning at this point, but we need to address it.
PATIENT: Bronchitis… and asthma? Oh dear. I… I don’t understand. I have never had asthma. Is it… serious? Will I need… medicine? I do not like taking pills, Doctor. I prefer to be… natural. Is there something else it could be? Perhaps it is just… old age?
DOCTOR: Well, sometimes things develop with age, Mrs. Kilton. It doesn't mean it's serious, but it does mean your body is changing. And frankly, relying on "natural" remedies for something like this is… unrealistic. You’re not a young woman anymore. We’ll start with a bronchodilator inhaler to open up your airways. It’s not a “pill,” it’s something you breathe in. And a short course of steroids to reduce inflammation. It's a standard treatment. I'll write you a prescription. It should help with the wheezing and shortness of breath. We’ll see how you respond and adjust from there. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I do not think so. Not that I have ever noticed. My daughter is the one with allergies. She is allergic to… cats, I think. And something in the flowers. But me? No. I have taken medicine before, when I broke my arm. And something for the pain in my back. But I did not have any… reaction. I might be allergic to… dust? Sometimes I sneeze when I clean. But that is all. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known drug allergies noted. Here's your prescription. Take the inhaler as directed, two puffs every four to six hours as needed. And the steroids, one pill a day for five days. It's important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better. I’m also going to recommend you get a flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. You’re at higher risk of complications with respiratory infections. Any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… a lot of medicine. And vaccines. Will the medicine… make me tired? I like to be active, you see. I have my garden. And I walk with my friends. I do not want to be stuck inside. And… is it safe? I hear things on the television. About… side effects. Perhaps… perhaps a smaller dose? Or something… less strong? I am an older woman, Doctor. I am not as strong as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, I understand your concerns, but you’re overreacting. These are standard medications, perfectly safe for most people. A smaller dose won’t do anything. You need the full course to clear the inflammation and open your airways. As for the side effects, they are minimal. Maybe a little dryness in your mouth, or a slight tremor. It’s better than ending up in the hospital with pneumonia. And frankly, you’re not as young as you used to be, and your body needs help. Just follow my instructions, and you’ll be fine. I'm scheduling a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your progress. Don’t wait longer than that if you don't feel better. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… Doctor. I understand. I will… try. I will take the medicine. And… I will come back in two weeks. But… it is a lot. Are you sure there is nothing else I can do? Some… herbal tea? Or… a special diet? I just… I do not like feeling weak.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, I’ve given you my professional advice. I suggest you follow it. Herbal tea won’t cure bronchitis. A special diet won’t open your airways. Next patient. .
