DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mrs. Minatra. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I received a letter regarding some… unusual results from a test I had done on my stomach. An endoscopic test, I believe it was called? The doctor who performed it said I should follow up with someone, and my primary physician suggested I come here. I must confess, I wasn’t entirely certain what it all meant, and I hoped you could explain it to me.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy, yes. Those can be… concerning, depending on what they find. It's good you're following up. Do you recall when this test was performed, Mrs. Minatra?
PATIENT: Certainly. It was… let me see… it was on the 17th of June, this year. Yes, June the 17th. At St. Luke’s Hospital, with Dr. Ramirez. He was very kind, but rather rushed, I thought. He mentioned something about… inflammation, perhaps? And that’s why he wanted me to see someone specializing in… well, I suppose what you do, Doctor. Is that sufficient information?
DOCTOR: June 17th… yes, here we are. Dr. Ramirez. “Inflammation” is… broad. The report indicates some mild gastritis, and a few polyps were found. Have you experienced any specific symptoms, Mrs. Minatra?
PATIENT: Gastritis… polyps… Oh dear. No, I don’t believe I’ve experienced anything specific, no. Perhaps a little indigestion from time to time, but I attribute that to the spices in my cooking, honestly. And I am getting older, after all. I have noticed… a slight change in my bowel movements, perhaps? Not severe, but… different. A bit looser than usual. Is that what you mean by ‘symptoms’, Doctor? And… are these polyps something to be worried about?
DOCTOR: “Slight changes” are rarely helpful, Mrs. Minatra. We need specifics. How often have you noticed these looser bowel movements?
PATIENT: Let me think… perhaps three or four times a week, in the last month or so? It isn't constant, not every day. And usually it’s just the first movement of the day. The rest are… normal, I suppose. Though, I do apologize, I am not accustomed to discussing such matters with… well, anyone, really. It feels a bit… indelicate. And… I don’t believe there’s been any blood, if that’s what you were going to ask.
DOCTOR: Three or four times a week… alright. And have you noticed any other changes in your appetite, weight, or energy levels?
PATIENT: My appetite has been… normal, I believe. Perhaps a little less than usual, but I've been preoccupied with… well, with my late husband’s affairs, still. It’s been nearly a year, but there's always paperwork. As for my weight… I haven't weighed myself recently. I'm rather petite, you see, and haven't noticed any significant changes. And my energy… well, I tire more easily these days, but I attribute that to my age, truthfully. I do try to remain active, gardening mostly. Is this information helpful, Doctor? I want to be as precise as possible.
DOCTOR: Gardening is good. Now, Mrs. Minatra, have you ever had any issues with constipation?
PATIENT: Constipation? Not particularly. I’ve always… been rather regular, thankfully. A bit too regular, perhaps, if I’m honest. Though, as I mentioned, things have been slightly different lately. More frequent, looser… it’s a bit unsettling, truthfully. I've never experienced anything like this before. Is that significant, Doctor? Does it indicate a more serious problem? I am starting to feel quite anxious, I must confess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… let me see. I had a bout of bronchitis a few years ago, but that cleared up completely. And I've always had slightly high blood pressure, but it's been well-managed with medication for many years. Just a small dose, nothing significant. Doctor Morales prescribes it. Otherwise… no, I don't believe so. I've been quite fortunate, all things considered. Is there anything specific you are looking for, Doctor? Perhaps a family history would be more helpful? My mother had arthritis, but that was many years ago.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure… what medication are you currently taking for that, Mrs. Minatra?
PATIENT: Let me see… it is… Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once daily. I’ve been taking it for… oh, nearly fifteen years now, I suppose. Doctor Morales checks my blood pressure regularly, and he assures me it’s well-controlled. I try to be diligent about taking it, though sometimes I forget, if I’m particularly preoccupied. But I always remember eventually. I hope that is sufficient information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not to my knowledge. I’ve never had any adverse reactions to any medications. I've taken antibiotics many times, and pain relievers when necessary, without any problems. And no allergies to food, or pollen, or animals… I’m quite fortunate in that regard, truthfully. Is that helpful, Doctor? I want to ensure I’m providing you with all the necessary details.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Minatra. And have you had any previous surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Yes, actually. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, perhaps… twenty years old? It was a very simple procedure, and I recovered quickly. And… oh, yes. I had a hysterectomy in my late thirties. Doctor Ramirez performed that one as well, at St. Luke’s. Aside from those two, no, I haven’t had any other surgeries. Is that sufficient, Doctor? It was quite some time ago, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mrs. Minatra, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not at all. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea, truthfully. A healthy lifestyle is very important to me. Gardening keeps me quite active, and I try to eat a balanced diet. Is that what you were hoping to hear, Doctor? I apologize, I’m not accustomed to discussing such personal matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to examine your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh! A little, yes. Right… there. Not sharp pain, exactly, but… a dull ache. It’s been there for a few days, intermittently. I hadn’t mentioned it because it wasn’t particularly bothersome, truthfully. Just a slight discomfort. Is that… concerning, Doctor? It feels a little sensitive when you press there.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your bowel sounds are present. Given your symptoms and the findings from your endoscopy, I recommend we order a CT scan to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It will help rule out any serious issues.
PATIENT: A CT scan… Oh dear. Is that… is that serious, Doctor? What are you looking for, exactly? I must confess, I’m starting to feel quite anxious. A dull ache and a CT scan… it doesn’t sound very reassuring. Are you concerned about something specific, Doctor? Perhaps you could explain it to me in… simpler terms? I do apologize for my apprehension, but I’m not a medical professional, and I find these things rather frightening.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Minatra, it's standard procedure to investigate these things thoroughly. The CT scan will allow us to visualize your intestines and surrounding organs. We need to rule out things like diverticulitis, or, less likely, a blockage. Given your age and the changes you've described in your bowel habits, it's important to be cautious. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to investigate. I’ll write up the order for the scan now. You’ll need to schedule it at St. Luke’s radiology department.
PATIENT: Diverticulitis… a blockage… Oh dear. Very well, Doctor. I understand. St. Luke’s… I suppose I can schedule it there. When should I schedule it for, do you think? And… will I need to do anything to prepare for the scan? I do apologize for asking so many questions, but I prefer to be well-informed. Is there anything I should be particularly concerned about, Doctor? Or any warning signs I should look out for in the meantime?
DOCTOR: You don't need any special preparation for the CT scan. Just drink plenty of fluids beforehand. In the meantime, if you experience severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, go to the emergency room immediately. Those would be signs of a more serious complication. Here's the order for the scan and a list of contact information. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once you've had the scan. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Severe pain, fever, nausea… very well. I will be vigilant, Doctor. Thank you. No, I believe that is all for now. Thank you for your time and… for explaining everything to me, despite my apprehension. I appreciate your thoroughness, even if it is rather… unsettling. I suppose I will schedule the scan as soon as possible. Thank you again, Doctor Kur.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let my staff know when you schedule the scan.
