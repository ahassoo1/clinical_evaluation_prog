DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sachar. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I received a notice about being checked to see if I qualify for some home health services… or hospice, I think it said. To be honest, I’m not entirely sure what it all means, but I thought it best to come in and find out. I’m Calin Sachar, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the outreach program. Quite… proactive, if you ask me. And I have your name here, Ms. Sachar. Frankly, these notices are often sent out rather liberally. So, let’s start with this: are you currently experiencing any health problems?
PATIENT: Well, yes, Doctor. I have been… not feeling my best lately. It’s a bit hard to explain. I get very tired, even after a full night’s sleep. And my back… my back has been giving me trouble for a while now, especially after work. I do pressing, you see, so I’m on my feet a lot and bending over the machines. It's just… a general achiness, really. Nothing specific I can really point to, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and back pain… a common complaint. How long have you been feeling this tiredness, Ms. Sachar?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been creeping up on me, Doctor. I’d say… maybe six months, at least? It started slowly, just feeling a little more worn out than usual at the end of the day. But it’s gotten progressively worse. Now, it’s hard to get through a full workday without needing to sit down for a bit. And honestly, it’s starting to affect things outside of work too. I don’t have the energy to do much when I get home.
DOCTOR: Six months… and has anything changed in those six months?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, Doctor. Work’s been the same, same shifts, same machines. I haven't started any new medications, haven't been travelling… Oh! Actually, my divorce was finalized about four months ago. It’s been… difficult, emotionally, of course. But I didn't think… I mean, I didn’t think that would be causing the tiredness, exactly. Just… a lot to process. Would that have an effect?
DOCTOR: Emotional stress can certainly manifest physically, Ms. Sachar. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, regarding this back pain… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It’s usually worst at the end of the day, after a long shift at work. And sometimes, if I move the wrong way, it’ll really shoot up my back. But it’s not always there. Some mornings I wake up feeling alright, and then it gradually gets worse as the day goes on. It doesn’t radiate down my legs or anything, if that makes sense. Just… a dull ache mostly, and then a sharp pain now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… Hmm. I’ve been a little bit… breathless lately, I suppose. Not like, out of breath from climbing stairs, but just… winded more easily than usual. And I’ve noticed I’ve been losing weight, but I haven’t been trying to. It’s not a huge amount, but enough that I’ve had to tighten my belt a notch. I haven't had a fever or anything like that. Is that helpful? I’m trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Weight loss and shortness of breath… right. Now, Ms. Sachar, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. No problem at all. Just let me know if you need me to do anything else.
DOCTOR: 79 kilograms. Alright. And your height is listed as 165 centimeters, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right, Doctor. 165 centimeters. It’s been a while since I've had a check-up, so I’m glad you’re confirming everything. I just want to make sure we get it all right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me... and another one... Good. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Deep breaths… And… that’s alright. Ooh, that’s a little tender there, on the left side. Not terribly painful, but… yeah, that’s a bit sensitive. Is that normal? I don't remember ever noticing that before.
DOCTOR: Tenderness on left quadrant palpation. Alright. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Left… and right… Both are present, but a little diminished. Ms. Sachar, I'm going to order some blood work. Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. And I’d like to get a chest X-ray. Just to rule things out. We need to see what's going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Blood work and a chest X-ray. That sounds… thorough. Is it something serious, Doctor? You seem a little concerned. I’m not trying to be difficult, I just… I’m a little worried now. I haven't been feeling well, and all this testing… it’s a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sachar, it's premature to be overly concerned. We're simply gathering information. The tiredness, weight loss, and diminished lung sounds… they warrant investigation. It could be a number of things. The blood work will give us a baseline, and the X-ray will help us visualize your lungs. I’ll have the lab order and X-ray request sent to the front desk. You can schedule the X-ray at your convenience. We will review the results when they come back, and then we can discuss a treatment plan, if necessary. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. And no other medical conditions. I had chickenpox as a child, but that’s it. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. That’s why this is so strange. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. It’s a little scary, but I feel better knowing you’re looking into it. I’ll go schedule the X-ray now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sachar. We will be in touch as soon as the results are available. And please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. .
PATIENT: .
