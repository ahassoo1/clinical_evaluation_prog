DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Osterholm. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. Over the past few months, I’ve noticed I’ve been getting weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re starting to droop a bit. It’s mostly noticeable at the end of the day, I think. It’s just… concerning.
DOCTOR: Hmm, weakness and drooping eyelids… Okay. Months, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Perhaps… six months, give or take? It started gradually, and I initially dismissed it as tiredness, you understand. I work quite a bit, managing facilities… it can be demanding. But it hasn’t improved, and if anything, it feels like it’s getting a little worse each week.
DOCTOR: Right, facilities management. Demanding work, I can imagine. And you’ve noticed it’s progressively worsening. Any other symptoms accompanying the weakness and eyelid drooping?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I've been a bit more tired than usual, definitely. And… now that you mention it, sometimes my vision seems a little blurry, but I wear glasses, so I just assumed it was related to that. It’s difficult to say, honestly. I haven't noticed anything else major, but those are the things that come to mind.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision... Okay. And you said you wear glasses?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’ve worn glasses since I was a teenager, short-sightedness, nothing too bad. I had my eyes checked last year, and the prescription hadn’t changed much. I just… I thought maybe they needed adjusting again, but it’s not a consistent blurriness, if that makes sense. Sometimes it's clearer than others.
DOCTOR: Right. Inconsistent blurriness... Do you have any difficulty with double vision at all?
PATIENT: Double vision? No, not that I've noticed, Doctor. Everything seems… single, if that's the right way to put it. It's just… not as sharp as it used to be, at times. Mostly when I'm tired, I suppose. I haven’t been driving much lately, so I can't say for certain if it would affect that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your speech, difficulty swallowing, or any muscle aches or pains?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. My speech is… well, I hope it’s normal! No one’s told me otherwise. And no trouble swallowing, or any aches or pains, not really. I do get a bit stiff from sitting at a desk all day, but that’s just… normal office life, I think. Nothing unusual beyond that. I haven’t been feeling sick, no fever or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, no difficulty swallowing… Any family history of neurological problems, muscle diseases, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think… My mother had some problems with arthritis later in life, but nothing neurological, as far as I know. My father… he passed away when I was young, heart condition, I believe. I don't recall any family history of muscle diseases, specifically. It’s… my family wasn’t very forthcoming with medical details, if I’m honest. I don't have much information beyond that, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. I rarely take any medication at all, thankfully. Perhaps a painkiller for a headache occasionally, but nothing regular. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I’m quite careful about what I put into my body, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Mr. Schaust, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. We'll check your reflexes, strength, and I’ll take a look at your eyes and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed as you see fit. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I just… I want to figure out what’s causing this. I’m starting to worry it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up on the examination table, please. Okay, looking straight ahead... good. And now, follow my penlight... left, right, up, down... good. Seems normal so far. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Relax your arms... Good, good. A little diminished, but not alarming. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that alright, Doctor? It feels… a little harder than it usually is to get a strong grip. I've noticed my hands feeling a bit weaker recently, but I assumed it was just from work.
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed that as well. A little weaker on both sides, but more pronounced on… …both sides, actually. Now, can you push your hands against mine?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It feels… harder than it used to. I work with my hands quite a bit, managing facilities, so I should be reasonably strong, but it feels like I'm exerting more effort than necessary. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you lift your arms against my resistance?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It’s… becoming rather difficult. My arms feel very tired, and it’s harder to hold them up than it should be. I’m not usually this weak. Is this… concerning? I’m starting to feel quite worried now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Based on what I’m seeing, and your symptoms… you’re exhibiting some muscle weakness, which is concerning. The drooping eyelids and fatigue are also significant. We need to run some tests to determine the cause. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. But more importantly, I want you to have an electromyography, or EMG, to assess the electrical activity of your muscles. It’s a relatively painless test, but it will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. I'll also order a referral to a neurologist. It's best to have a specialist evaluate this further.
PATIENT: A neurologist? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it something I should be very worried about? What could be causing this? And… how long will it take to get these tests done? I have a bit of a busy schedule, and I’m also… uninsured, so I’m concerned about the cost.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Schaust, I don’t want to alarm you unnecessarily. There are many possible causes for muscle weakness, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything catastrophic. It could be something relatively benign, like a vitamin deficiency, or it could be something more serious, like a neurological condition. That’s why we need to run these tests. As for the cost… I understand your concern. Being uninsured complicates things. I can write a letter explaining the medical necessity of these tests, which might help with financial assistance programs at the hospital. The EMG and blood work shouldn’t be too expensive, but the neurologist consultation… that will be more substantial. As for timing, the blood work can be done today. The EMG will likely require an appointment within the next week or two, depending on availability. I'll have my assistant schedule those for you. But it's important to get this addressed quickly, Mr. Schaust. Delaying could complicate things further.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I… I understand. Financial assistance programs… that would be very helpful. I appreciate you writing that letter. And I'll schedule the tests as soon as possible. A week or two… I suppose that's reasonable. What should I be looking out for in the meantime? Are there any symptoms that would warrant an immediate visit to the emergency room? I don’t want to be caught off guard. And… is there anything I should be avoiding? Any activities I should stop doing? I manage a lot of properties, and it involves physical work…
DOCTOR: Alright. In the meantime, if you experience any difficulty breathing, double vision, or significant slurred speech, go to the emergency room immediately. Any sudden worsening of your weakness, or if it starts to affect your ability to swallow… that’s also a cause for concern. As for activities… try to avoid strenuous physical exertion. Don’t push yourself. It’s better to err on the side of caution. Light activity is fine, but don’t lift heavy objects or engage in anything that requires significant muscle strain. And… honestly, Mr. Schaust, I’m not going to tell you to stop working entirely. It’s unrealistic. Just… be mindful of your limitations. And try not to Google your symptoms. It will only cause unnecessary anxiety. Let the neurologist do their evaluation and provide a proper diagnosis. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results, to discuss them and create a treatment plan. My assistant will get you the necessary paperwork and schedule everything. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I don't think so. Just… try not to Google my symptoms, right. I understand. Thank you for your time, and for ordering the tests. And for writing the letter about financial assistance. I appreciate it. I’ll… I’ll see your assistant then. .
