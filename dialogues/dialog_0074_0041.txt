DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start us off, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Reisig. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. It makes things… hard. Hard to do the things I used to. It’s in my legs mostly, but sometimes my arms feel it too. It’s been going on for a while now, maybe a year or so. I just thought it was getting old, but my wife, bless her heart, she said I should come see someone.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of you to come in, and it’s wise of your wife to encourage you to do so. Weakness that develops gradually over time is certainly something we should investigate. Could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… hard to explain. It’s not like I can’t walk, not yet anyway. But I get tired easier. And sometimes my legs feel… heavy, like they’re filled with water. And clumsy. I trip over things more often. Little things, you know? Like getting out of a chair. Or walking up the steps. It’s not pain, not really. Just… not working right. I used to be a strong man, worked hard my whole life. Athletic trainer, you see. Helping others. Now… well, it’s different.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds frustrating to experience that change, especially with your background as an athletic trainer. You're very observant to describe it as “not working right” – that’s helpful. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if this weakness is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. It… comes and goes, I think. Some days are better than others. Some days I feel almost normal, and I can get around alright. Other days… other days I really have to think about each step. And the heavy feeling? That seems to stick around more. It’s not like a sudden thing, though. It doesn’t just appear one day. It builds up slowly, and then maybe gets a little better, and then worse again. It’s… unpredictable, that’s the best way to put it. It doesn’t bother me too much when I’m resting. It’s when I use my legs that I really notice it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. So it's more pronounced with activity and fluctuates in severity. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my balance hasn’t been the best lately. I’ve stumbled a few times, nothing serious, but enough to make my wife worry. And sometimes… sometimes my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, just now and then. It comes and goes like the weakness. And… oh, I forget things more easily, I think. Little things, like where I put my glasses. Or the name of that actor… you know, the one in all those westerns. My wife says I repeat myself sometimes too. I don't always notice it myself, but she keeps track of things. I don't have any pain, though, not really. Just… these other things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Mr. Astores. Balance issues, occasional blurry vision, and some memory concerns… those are all important details. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had the usual things. High blood pressure, Doctor. Been taking medicine for that for years. And my knees, they bother me sometimes, old sports injuries. Nothing major, though. And… oh, a few years back, maybe five or six, I was in the hospital for a while. They said it was something with my nerves, something to do with the coating around them. I don't remember the name of it, and the doctors talked so fast… they gave me some strong medicine through an IV, and it seemed to help for a while. My wife would know more about that, she took all the notes. It's just… been a long time. She always said I should follow up with a specialist, but I never did. Seemed alright for a while, and then… well, here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, some knee issues, and a history of a nerve condition requiring IV treatment. That’s helpful to know. To clarify, do you remember where you were treated for that nerve condition?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was at the big hospital over in Honolulu. Queen’s, I think it was called. Yes, Queen’s Medical Center. I was there for about a week, maybe ten days. They ran a lot of tests. I remember the doctors being very concerned. They said it was something that could come back. And my wife, she was very worried about it. She kept asking the doctors what the long-term effects would be, but they didn't really say much. Just told me to follow up with a neurologist. But I felt better after the treatment, and I just… put it behind me. I should have listened to her, I know. It seems silly now.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Mr. Astores. It’s common to feel better and then delay follow-up. Knowing it was at Queen’s Medical Center is very helpful. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me see… I take a pill for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. One in the morning. And sometimes I take Tylenol for my knees when they bother me, but not every day. And… oh, I have some cream for my skin, a steroid cream, but I only use that when I have a rash. That’s about it, Doctor. Nothing fancy. My wife keeps track of all the pills, she’s very organized. I sometimes forget if I took them or not, so she makes sure I don’t miss any. She’s a good woman.
DOCTOR: That’s good your wife helps with that. Lisinopril for blood pressure, Tylenol as needed, and a steroid cream. Thank you for letting me know. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies. Well, I don't think I have any serious allergies. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I'm a little sensitive to pollen sometimes, gets my nose itchy during the blooming season, but that's about it. Nothing that requires a shot or anything. And… oh, I think I got a rash once from poison ivy when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. My wife might remember more about that. She's very careful about what I eat and what I put on my skin, just in case. She worries about everything. But that’s a good thing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. So, pollen sensitivity, but no known drug or food allergies. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me think... on my mother’s side, she had diabetes. And her mother, too. My father, he had heart problems. He died when he was pretty young, too young. And… oh, my sister, she had something with her nerves, something like what I had. But I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about it much. She lived on the mainland, you see. We didn't see each other very often. My wife knows more about our family history, she's been tracing our genealogy for years. She’s very interested in that sort of thing. She says it's important to know where you come from.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes and heart problems on your mother’s side, and a sister with a nerve condition. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean?
DOCTOR: Apologies, Mr. Astores. It’s just a way of asking about your lifestyle. Things like whether you smoke or drink alcohol, and what your typical level of activity is. It helps me get a fuller picture of your health. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh! I understand now. No, I’ve never smoked. Never had the urge. My wife wouldn’t allow it, even if I did! She’s very health-conscious, you see. And… well, I used to drink a little beer sometimes, with dinner. But I stopped a long time ago. Doctor told me it wasn’t good for my blood pressure. So I switched to juice. Pineapple juice, mostly. I like pineapple juice. And I used to be very active, very active. Athletic trainer, you see. Always on my feet, helping others. But lately… well, lately I haven’t been doing much. It’s hard, with the weakness. I mostly sit around now, watching television. It's not the same.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astores. That's very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. It will help me assess your strength, balance, and reflexes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m an old man, you know. Things don’t move quite as smoothly as they used to. But I’ll do my best. Just take it easy with me, alright? And… my wife is waiting outside, if you need to ask her anything. She knows me better than I know myself, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that, Mr. Astores, and I will certainly take it easy. I may ask your wife a few questions later, if that’s alright. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 148/82, and your pulse is 76. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and muscle strength. Please relax your arms and legs. Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished in your legs, and your muscle strength is slightly reduced, but not severely. Your gait is a bit unsteady, and I noticed a slight hesitancy as you walk. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand with your feet together and your eyes closed for a few seconds. Okay, you did sway a little during that test. It suggests some balance issues. Alright, that completes the basic physical exam. I’ve documented my findings. Your vital signs are within normal limits, although your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Your reflexes are diminished, your muscle strength is reduced, your gait is unsteady, and you have some balance issues.
PATIENT: That doesn't sound good, does it? What does it mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? I just want to be able to walk without falling. And… I don't want to be a burden to my wife. She does everything for me now. I just want to be able to help her, not the other way around. Is there something you can do?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Mr. Astores, and I appreciate you sharing your worries with me. It’s good that we’ve identified these issues. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam findings, there are several possibilities we need to investigate. Given your history of a nerve condition, the diminished reflexes and muscle weakness could indicate nerve damage. The balance issues and occasional blurry vision could also be related. However, other conditions could be contributing, such as vitamin deficiencies, inner ear problems, or even early signs of neuropathy. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, kidney function, and other potential causes. I also recommend an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to evaluate for any structural abnormalities or nerve compression. Finally, I think a referral to a neurologist would be beneficial for a more specialized evaluation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: MRI… neurologist… it sounds like a lot, Doctor. But… if it will help me find out what’s wrong, then yes, alright. I trust your judgment. But… will the MRI be uncomfortable? And… what does a neurologist do, exactly? Is it going to be expensive? My wife and I are on a fixed income, you see. We don’t want to get into a lot of debt.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Mr. Astores, and I’m happy to address them. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging test that uses magnetic fields to create detailed pictures of your brain and spinal cord. It’s generally very well-tolerated, but it does require you to lie still for about 30-45 minutes in a somewhat confined space. If you feel claustrophobic, we can discuss medication to help you relax. A neurologist is a specialist who focuses on disorders of the nervous system. They can perform more detailed neurological exams, interpret the MRI results, and recommend appropriate treatment options. Regarding the cost, I understand your concerns about your fixed income. I will have my staff check with your insurance provider to determine your coverage for the MRI and the neurologist referral. We can also discuss payment options and potential financial assistance programs if needed. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to make this process as affordable as possible. Would you like me to have my staff schedule the MRI and the neurology referral for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. And… please tell your staff to check with my insurance first. I don't want any surprises. And… if it's not too much trouble, could you also ask them about a wheelchair? Just in case. My wife has to help me walk sometimes, and I don’t want her to hurt her back. She's a small woman, you see. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I feel a little better knowing that you’re looking into this. And… please tell your staff to give my wife a call. She'll want to know what's going on. She's the one who keeps everything organized.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Astores. I’m happy to help in any way I can. I will have my staff contact your insurance provider, schedule the MRI and neurology referral, and inquire about the possibility of a temporary wheelchair rental. They will also contact your wife to discuss the details and answer any questions she may have. In the meantime, I will write you a prescription for a multivitamin to address any potential deficiencies while we await the blood test results. And, to ensure your safety, I recommend that you avoid driving until we have a clearer understanding of your condition. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your kindness and patience. It's a lot to take in, but I feel a little better knowing that you're on my side. Just… please tell my wife everything. She's the one who knows what's best for me. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll see you when the results come back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. I’m glad I could help. I will ensure your wife is fully informed, and we’ll work together to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and take care.
