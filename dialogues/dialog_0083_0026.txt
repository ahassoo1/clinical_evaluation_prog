DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Alanes, was it? Well, it’s this tiredness. Just…exhausted all the time. It's been going on for a bit now, and honestly, it’s quite bothersome. I don’t do tired. Used to be able to work a full day, no problem. Now… barely make it through the morning. And the young man at the lab said something about my…creatine? Something was high. I didn't quite catch it all, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Alanes is correct. Thank you for coming in to discuss this. It’s good you’re addressing it. Tiredness, or fatigue, can have many causes, so we’ll work through it together. And you mentioned the lab results – elevated creatinine. Yes, that’s something we definitely need to explore. To start, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just a little tiredness, Doctor. It's… draining. Like someone’s unplugged me. It comes on suddenly, usually by midday. I just… have no energy. It's not like I've been doing anything particularly strenuous. Certainly not like when I was diving, that was proper work. Now, I mostly just… keep the house tidy. It’s just… frustrating. I don’t understand why this is happening. And it's not like I'm getting any younger, I suppose. Though I feel older than I am, that’s for certain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds very debilitating, and it’s frustrating when something changes without a clear reason. “Draining” is a good way to describe it. To help me understand better, when did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. It wasn't sudden, not exactly. It sort of… crept up on me. Maybe… six months ago? Perhaps a little longer. It was subtle at first, just needing a bit more of a sit-down in the afternoons. But it's gotten steadily worse. Now, I'm practically useless by dinner time. My husband has been a saint, bless his heart, doing all the heavy lifting, literally and figuratively. He keeps saying I need to slow down, but I am slowing down! It’s just… happening on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradually worsening over the past six to eight months. And you've noticed it's impacting your daily activities. That's helpful to know. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes in how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my muscles ache a bit more than they used to. Not constantly, but especially after I’ve been… well, even just walking to the shops. And I’ve noticed I’m a bit more… clumsy, perhaps? Dropped a teacup just last week. Never used to do that. It's probably just old age, honestly. I haven’t been eating as well either, lost my appetite a bit. Though I can’t say it’s much of a loss, if you know what I mean. Food just doesn’t seem as appealing. And I get thirsty more easily, I suppose. But I drink plenty of water.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches, some clumsiness, decreased appetite, and increased thirst. These are all important things to note. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, probably thirty years ago now. And I’ve always had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, it goes up and down. The doctor puts me on pills sometimes, sometimes not. Nothing major, really. And arthritis in my hands, of course. What woman my age doesn't have arthritis? But that's just the usual aches and pains. Nothing that stops me from doing things... or used to stop me, anyway. I’m on Medicare, if that’s relevant. I don’t really go to the doctor much otherwise. Don’t see the point unless something’s really broken.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, history of fluctuating blood pressure, and arthritis in your hands. And you're currently covered by Medicare. Thank you for letting me know. Do you take any medications regularly at the moment?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, yes. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, when the doctor tells me to. It’s… amlodipine, I think? And sometimes I take paracetamol for the arthritis, if it’s really bothering me. But not every day. Mostly just when it flares up. And I take a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. Nothing else, really. I used to take something for my stomach, but I stopped that years ago. It didn’t seem to be doing much good.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine as needed for blood pressure, paracetamol for arthritis pain when needed, and a daily multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I might get a bit of a sniffle with pollen, but that’s just seasonal. Nothing serious, I assure you. I used to be stung by a jellyfish when I was diving, but that was just a painful experience, not an allergy. I don’t have any food allergies, or anything like that. No, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I'm a pretty sturdy woman, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. My mother lived to be quite old, but she had… well, she had a bit of everything, if you know what I mean. Arthritis, heart trouble… the usual old age ailments. My father was a strong man, but he had diabetes, I think. And my brother, he had high blood pressure, like me. But other than that… not that I can recall. We didn't really talk about health much in my family. More interested in getting on with things, you know? It's not something we dwelled on.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of arthritis, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Thank you. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I keep a tidy house, as I mentioned. My husband and I used to travel a lot when I was diving, but we don't do much of that anymore. Mostly just stay around here. I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I used to be very active, of course, when I was diving. Now… not so much. Mostly just pottering around the garden. I don't have any pets, and I don't really have any hobbies, if you can believe it. Just… keeping busy, I suppose. It's a quiet life, but it's a comfortable one.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet and comfortable life, no smoking or excessive alcohol, and a history of being very active. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a better understanding of what's going on. It won't be anything painful, just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and looking at your hands and feet. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. I don’t mind at all. I’m used to being poked and prodded, you know, from the diving. Though that was usually to check for… other things. This sounds much more civilized. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll just sit here quietly. Don't mind me. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. Though I doubt you'll find anything, honestly. I’m a pretty healthy woman, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 158 over 92. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. I see some arthritis in your hands, as you mentioned, with some swelling and a little bit of stiffness. And I notice a little bit of swelling in your feet. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Overall, Ms. Oitker, the physical exam is largely unremarkable, but your blood pressure is elevated, and I noticed some swelling in your hands and feet. These findings, combined with your fatigue, muscle aches, and increased thirst, are concerning. It's possible we're dealing with something more than just age-related changes.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Swelling, you say? I thought that was just the heat. It’s been rather warm lately. And my blood pressure… well, I knew that wasn’t quite right. The doctor always tells me to watch it. So, what does this mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I don't want to end up bedridden, that's for certain. I still have a bit of life left in me, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Oitker. It's good you're taking this seriously. The combination of symptoms and findings does warrant further investigation. It could be a number of things, but one possibility that comes to mind, given your fatigue, increased thirst, and elevated creatinine from the lab, is kidney dysfunction. The swelling in your feet could be related to that, and elevated blood pressure can also be both a cause and a result of kidney problems. However, it's too early to say definitively. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some additional blood tests, including a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function more thoroughly, and a urine analysis to check for protein and other abnormalities. We should also repeat the creatinine test to see if the initial result was a fluke. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Kidneys, you say? That doesn’t sound good at all. I’ve never had any trouble with my kidneys before. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then of course. Do whatever you need to do. I just want to feel better. More tests… alright. Whatever it takes. And will these tests tell me what’s causing all of this? I don’t want to just sit here waiting for things to get worse. And will they be painful? I don’t do well with needles, you know. Just a little prick, I hope. Though I suppose I should have known better, getting into diving. Always some sort of risk involved. Alright, go ahead. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Oitker. It’s completely normal to feel worried when facing uncertainty. The blood tests are quite routine, and the needle prick is usually minimal. It’s a quick process. These tests will give us a much clearer picture of how your kidneys are functioning and help us identify the underlying cause of your symptoms. It could be something simple, or it could be more complex. But either way, knowing what we're dealing with is the first step towards getting you feeling better. I’ll write the orders for the lab now. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. And once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – about 8 glasses of water a day – and avoiding strenuous activity. If you notice any sudden changes in your condition – like severe swelling, difficulty breathing, or decreased urination – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Eight glasses of water… alright, I can manage that. And no strenuous activity… that shouldn’t be a problem. I haven't been doing much of that lately anyway. Hmm… questions. I suppose… what if it is my kidneys? What happens then? Is it something… serious? Will I need… a machine? I’ve heard stories, you know, about people on dialysis. I certainly don’t want to end up like that. And will it hurt? I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, I suppose. It’s just… getting old isn’t easy. Everything starts to fall apart, you know? And… is there anything I can do now to help? Besides drinking water, of course. Any herbs, or… special foods? I’ve always heard good things about ginger, for inflammation. I don’t want to just sit here waiting for the tests to come back. I want to be proactive, you know? Do something.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Oitker. It’s good you’re asking these questions. Let's address them one by one. If the tests do indicate kidney problems, the next step would be to determine the cause and severity. Not all kidney problems require dialysis. Many can be managed with medication, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications. If dialysis is necessary, it's a complex procedure, but modern dialysis techniques are much more comfortable and effective than they used to be. And we would, of course, discuss all your options thoroughly before making any decisions. As for what you can do now, staying well-hydrated is excellent. Regarding herbs and special foods, while ginger can be helpful for inflammation, it's important to be cautious about self-treating, especially if your kidney function is impaired. Some herbs can interact with medications or even worsen kidney problems. I would advise against taking any new supplements or making significant dietary changes until we have the test results. For now, focusing on staying hydrated, getting adequate rest, and avoiding strenuous activity is the best course of action. We will have a clearer understanding of what's going on once the tests are back. I want to assure you, we’ll work through this together. Do you have any other questions, or would you like me to write you a note summarizing our discussion?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That’s… reassuring, I suppose. Working together… that sounds good. I don’t want to be alone in this. No, I don’t think I need a note, Doctor. I’ll just try to remember everything you said. Staying hydrated, resting… and avoiding ginger. Alright. Thank you, Doctor Alanes. You’ve been very patient with me. It’s not easy being an old woman, you know. Everything aches, and everything worries me. But I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I suppose I’ll just go home and have a glass of water now. And try not to worry too much. Though that’s easier said than done. Thank you again, Doctor. And I’ll wait for the lab to call. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Oitker. It was my pleasure. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’re here to support you. And you're right – staying hydrated and getting rest are a good start. Take care, Ms. Oitker. And I look forward to seeing you again soon.
