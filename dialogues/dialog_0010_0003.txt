DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, Doc. It’s this… shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a bit now, and it’s getting… annoying. Honestly, I don’t see what the big deal is, but my daughter insisted I come. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. Annoying is a perfectly valid way to describe it, Mr. Baide. And it’s good of your daughter to encourage you to get it checked out. Even if it isn’t a big deal, it’s always best to rule things out. So, this shaking… when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I have no idea. A while ago. Months, maybe? Time just… blurs. It’s not like it came on suddenly. It just… started. Probably when I stopped directing, to be frank. Sitting around doing nothing isn't good for a man. It's probably just old age, Doc. Don't need a fancy diagnosis for that.
DOCTOR: Months ago, gradually worsening… and you feel it’s possibly related to your retirement from directing?
PATIENT: Retirement? It wasn’t a choice, you know. They wanted younger blood, flashier ideas. Anyway, yes, maybe. Used to being in charge, making things happen. Now I just… sit. The shaking is worse when I'm trying to eat, mostly. Makes a mess, you know? And it's embarrassing. Not that I care much for social gatherings anymore. It's just... inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s most noticeable when you're eating, causing some difficulty and embarrassment. Is it just your hand that shakes, or do you notice it in other parts of your body as well?
PATIENT: Just my hand, mostly. Sometimes my arm feels a little… wobbly, but that could be anything. I’ve had a few aches and pains over the years, you know. It's part of getting old. I don't go making a fuss over every little thing. And look, I don't need you poking and prodding me, alright? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. I won’t spend time on unnecessary examinations. But just to get a clearer picture, would you mind if I quickly check your reflexes and coordination?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Coordination? What for? I told you, it's just a tremor! It's not like I'm falling apart. Look, I'm a busy man, even in retirement. I have… things to think about. If you can't help me without poking and prodding, I'll just go. My daughter will be furious, but frankly, I’m getting tired of this whole charade.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. And I respect your wishes. However, a quick neurological assessment – checking your reflexes and coordination – can help me rule out a number of possibilities, even if it is just a tremor. It’s a standard part of evaluating these types of symptoms, and it will only take a few minutes. It helps me ensure I’m not missing anything important. If you’re truly opposed to it, we can proceed without it, but I have to advise that it’s not ideal. Would you at least allow me to ask a few questions about your medical history first?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Questions, then. But make them quick. And don’t ask me about my childhood, alright? I barely remember yesterday, let alone sixty years ago. What do you want to know? But if it involves filling out forms, I'm walking out right now. I hate paperwork.
DOCTOR: No forms, I promise. Just a few questions about your general health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, I suppose. Years ago. The doctor put me on pills. Don’t remember what they were called. Stopped taking them after a while. Didn’t feel like I needed them. And… my wife had something. Heart trouble, I think. But that was a long time ago. She’s… gone now. It's all a blur, really. Don't remember much about the details. What else? Oh, my knees ache. Badly. But everyone's knees ache when they get old, don’t they?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in the past, stopped taking medication… and knee pain. I understand. And did you ever have any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That’s about it, I think. Oh, and my wife had a hip replacement. But that was her surgery, not mine. I mostly just waited around in the waiting room. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those things. It's all a bit of a blur, as I said. I'm not one for doctors and hospitals. Gives me the creeps.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal as a child, and your wife had a hip replacement. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides what you may have taken for blood pressure in the past?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins. Multivitamins, I think. My daughter keeps buying them for me. Says I need them. Honestly, I don't even bother taking them most of the time. They're just pills. Don't make much difference. And that's about it. No, I don't take any real medication. I prefer to handle things myself, if I can. Are we almost done here, Doc? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Almost. Just a few more quick questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never been one for allergies. Maybe a little sniffly when the pollen is bad, but that's just normal, isn't it? No, I don't think I have any real allergies. My wife was allergic to something, I think. Bees, maybe? But that was her problem, not mine. Honestly, Doc, are you sure you need all this information? It's just a tremor, I keep telling you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. No known allergies. And finally, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What do you want to know? My father smoked too many cigars. My mother worried too much. And my brother… well, he was a bit of a gambler. That's about it, really. No one in my family lived to be very old, if that's what you're asking. They all had… problems. Look, Doc, I'm not a historian. I barely remember what I had for breakfast. Can we just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me, and given your reluctance for a full examination, I'm going to proceed cautiously. It's possible this is simply an age-related tremor, or essential tremor. However, given the gradual onset, it would be prudent to rule out other potential causes. I recommend a neurology consult. They can perform more specialized tests to determine the exact cause of the shaking. Would you be open to that?
