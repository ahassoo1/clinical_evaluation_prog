DOCTOR: Right. Well, Noelani, let’s get to it. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s a bit awkward to talk about, actually. It’s… pain. Down there. In… well, you know. It started a few days ago, I think. Or maybe it was longer? It’s hard to say, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Down there,” is… not terribly helpful, I’m afraid. We need specifics. Is it a sharp pain?
PATIENT: Oh, my apologies, Doctor. It’s not… a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it feels heavy, like a weight. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. And… I don’t know if this is important, but it seems a little worse after I’ve been… working with the wood. All the bending and lifting, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Woodworking, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… make things. Furniture, mostly. Small tables, chairs… things like that. It's how I earn a living. Though lately… it’s been harder with this pain. It makes it difficult to concentrate, you see. And the lifting… I don’t want to stop, but… it’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, dull ache, heaviness, intermittent, exacerbated by lifting and bending… Let's try to narrow things down a bit. Does the pain radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate…? Oh dear. I’m not sure I understand. Does it… spread? Hmm… sometimes, I think I feel a bit of discomfort in my lower abdomen, but I’m not certain if that’s related. It’s hard to tell, really. Everything feels a little… jumbled these days. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Lower abdomen… Alright. And has anything like this happened before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question… I… think so? Maybe? It’s very foggy, Doctor. I’ve had aches and pains before, of course, being my age and with the work I do. But… a pain quite like this… No, I don’t recall. Or, if I do, it was a long time ago. I really can’t say for sure. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's move on. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… changes in…? Doctor, I… I’m not quite sure what you mean. I’m sorry. Is this about… needing to go to the bathroom? I… everything seems pretty normal, if you must know. Though I have been a little more tired lately, but that could be anything, couldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, "could be anything." Any vaginal discharge?
PATIENT: Oh! Doctor! I… I didn’t realize we’d be discussing such… personal matters. I… I am a single woman. It has been… quite some time. But, no, there is nothing like that happening. I assure you. This is about pain, Doctor, not… I just want to understand what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I’m simply gathering information, Noelani. It’s necessary. No need to get… agitated. Now, any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no fever, Doctor. And I haven’t been feeling cold, or… sweaty at night. I sleep quite well, actually, though I’ve been waking up feeling a bit… restless. Just… anxious, I suppose. About this pain. And… about what it might mean. I apologize if I’m being difficult. It’s just… a little unnerving, being asked all these questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. I need to palpate your abdomen and do a pelvic exam. It’s the only way to get a better idea of what's going on.
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? A… pelvic exam? Is that… absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, could we not try something else first? Perhaps some tests? I’m… I’m not very comfortable with that, if I’m honest. It all feels very… invasive.
DOCTOR: Look, Noelani, I understand your discomfort, but I need to assess you properly. A physical exam is standard procedure for this type of complaint. It’s the most direct way to rule out serious issues. We can discuss tests afterward, but I need to feel your abdomen, and a pelvic exam is… frankly, non-negotiable. If you're unwilling to allow a basic examination, I can't help you.
PATIENT: Oh… Non-negotiable…? Very well, Doctor. If it’s absolutely necessary… I suppose I have no choice. But… please be gentle? And… perhaps you could explain what you’re doing as you go? It would… help calm my nerves. I trust you’ll be discreet, of course.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as efficient as possible. Lie back on the exam table, please. I'll start by palpating your abdomen, checking for tenderness or masses. I’ll tell you what I’m doing as I go. Just relax, and let me know if anything is particularly uncomfortable. Now, can you point to where the pain is most pronounced?
PATIENT: Um… right here. It’s… hard to pinpoint exactly. Sometimes it feels more on this side… And sometimes… it radiates downwards. But mostly… it’s just a dull ache all over. Please… be gentle, Doctor. I’m really quite nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay. Light pressure here… and here… Any tenderness with this pressure?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. There. That’s… a little uncomfortable. Not… sharp, just… a dull ache. It feels… deep. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what about here?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, there too! A bit more… sensitive. It’s… not a pain, exactly, but… it feels… swollen? Is something… wrong, Doctor? It feels… different than before. I’m getting quite scared now.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's enough for now. We’ll need to order some blood work, and I'm going to order a pelvic ultrasound. I want to rule out a few things. There's a possibility of an ovarian cyst or… something more serious. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we’ll schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning. We'll discuss the results when they come in. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A… cyst? Something… serious? What does that… mean, Doctor? Will I… need surgery? Is it… cancer? I… I don’t understand. And… what if it’s something terrible? Please… tell me everything. What are we looking for?
DOCTOR: Look, Noelani, let’s not jump to conclusions. It could be nothing, or it could be something relatively minor. A cyst is a fluid-filled sac, often harmless. We need the ultrasound to see exactly what’s going on. The blood work will help rule out infection. Cancer is… a possibility, yes, but it’s far too early to say anything definitive. I'm ordering these tests to exclude possibilities, not confirm them. I’m not going to speculate on surgery until we have the results. Let’s focus on getting the tests done first. The nurse will explain the blood work process, and we'll schedule the ultrasound. I’ll review everything with you when the results are back. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. Tests… ultrasound… It’s just… a lot to take in. Will the… the ultrasound hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m… I’m very anxious, Doctor. And I don’t have anyone to… to help me through this.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound is non-invasive, just a probe on your abdomen. It shouldn’t be painful, perhaps a little uncomfortable. Results usually take 24-48 hours, but it depends on the lab. Look, I have other patients waiting, so I’m going to have the nurse come in and explain everything to you. She can schedule the ultrasound and answer any further questions. I’ll see you when the results are back. Don't worry unnecessarily. It’s probably nothing.
PATIENT: Oh… dear God. What have I done? .
