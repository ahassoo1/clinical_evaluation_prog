DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is to-da-roh-vich, yes? My head... back of head... hurts. Been hurtin' for... maybe three days now? Not all the time, but comes and goes. Like a... dull ache. Not so bad I can't work, but... bothersome. I work with the trains, you see. Lots of noise.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. To-da-roh-vich is correct, yes. A headache for three days, coming and going, dull ache… and you work with the trains, a noisy environment. Alright. Let's try to pinpoint this a bit more. When you say it comes and goes, how long does it usually last when it does come on?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. When it comes... maybe one hour? Sometimes two. Then goes away for a while. Maybe four, five hours, then comes back. Not every time I’m at work, though. Sometimes it hurts at home, when I'm... readin' or watchin' the television. It is not... a sharp pain. Just... there. Like someone is pressin' on the back of my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an hour or two at a time, with breaks of four or five hours, and it's not consistently tied to work. More of a pressing sensation at the back of the head, not sharp. And it happens when you’re relaxing at home as well. Do you notice anything that specifically triggers it?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm... Not sure. I drink my coffee in the mornin', like always. Eat my breakfast. Not much different lately. Maybe... when I bend over to tie my shoes. Sometimes feels a little worse then. But not always! I don't... I don't think so. It just... happens. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but who doesn't when you're old like me?
DOCTOR: Right. No specific trigger that you've noticed, regular coffee, no changes to your routine. And bending over sometimes makes it feel a little worse. Okay. And you mentioned feeling tired sometimes, is that a new thing, or just…part of getting older?
PATIENT: Just…older, Doctor. Always a little tired. I work hard, you see. Even at my age. But maybe a little more tired these last few weeks. Not much, though. I sleep okay. Not as deep as when I was younger, but... okay. My wife... she used to say I snored like a train. But she's gone now. It’s been five years.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Brum. Five years is a long time. And okay, sleep is... adequate, not deeply restful, but you’re managing. Let's move on to some other things. Do you have any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like... feelin' sick? No, Doctor. No fever. No blurry vision. No trouble talkin'. No numbness in my arms or legs. Just the head. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff when the head hurts, but not always. Not very bad. I can turn my head okay. I can walk okay. I can... do everything okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no vision changes, no weakness, no trouble speaking. Sometimes a little neck stiffness. That's good information. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this new?
PATIENT: Never had headaches like this before, Doctor. I get…little headaches sometimes, you know, from stress, or when I forget to drink enough water. But this is…different. More on the back of the head, like I said. Lasts longer. Feels…deeper. I don’t know how to explain it. I’ve never had to explain a headache before!
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new type of headache for you, different from the usual tension headaches. Deeper, longer lasting, concentrated at the back of the head. Let’s talk a little about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for it, every mornin’. Been takin’ it for…oh, maybe fifteen years now? Keeps it under control, mostly. And…my knees bother me sometimes, but that’s just from workin’ on the railroad all my life. No other problems. Never been in the hospital for anything serious. Still kickin', you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, managed with medication for fifteen years, and some knee pain. That's good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… No surgeries, Doctor. Never needed them. Broke my arm when I was a boy, fallin’ from a tree, but they just put it in a cast. That was a long time ago. No other surgeries. Never had nothin' taken out of me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I eat everything. Never had a problem with food. And the doctor gave me some pills for my blood pressure years ago, and I didn't have no reaction. No rashes, no trouble breathin'. I can take most things. My wife was the one with the allergies. Pollen, dust… everything. I was always fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications or supplements besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the one pill for the blood pressure. I take it every mornin’ with my coffee. That’s it. I don’t take nothin’ else. I try to eat healthy, you know? Fruits, vegetables… My wife used to make me eat a lot of vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’m just going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need. I trust you. I’m not afraid of a little exam. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, Mr. Brum. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your reflexes and strength are normal, and your coordination is good. I’m going to palpate your neck muscles. There’s some mild tenderness here on the right side, but no significant masses or swelling. It's consistent with some muscle strain. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a little. Not bad, but... there. Right there. It feels a little sore. Like I pulled a muscle or somethin'. Maybe from sleepin' in a bad position? I don’t know. I get stiff sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some tenderness to palpation in the right neck muscles. Given your history of a new headache concentrated at the back of your head, along with the neck tenderness, my initial impression is that this is likely a tension headache, possibly with some muscle strain in your neck. It’s common with stress and poor sleep posture. But given your age, and the new onset of this type of headache, I want to be cautious. I’m going to recommend a trial of over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, following the package instructions. And I’d like you to focus on good neck posture and gentle stretching exercises. However, if the headache worsens, doesn’t improve after a week, or is accompanied by any fever, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, I want you to come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…reasonable. Ibuprofen…I think my wife used to take that. Stretching…I can try. I am not very flexible anymore, but I can try. And yes, if it gets worse, I will come back. No fever, no blurry vision… I understand. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you lookin' at me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. I’m glad I could help. I’m going to write down these instructions for you, as well as a note to follow up if things don't improve. Also, since you're not currently insured, I can provide you with a list of local resources for affordable healthcare options, if you'd like. And is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. The note is good. And thank you for the list, that is very kind of you. I appreciate everything you have done. I just…wanted to make sure it wasn’t somethin' serious. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could reassure you. Take care of yourself, focus on those stretches, and don’t hesitate to come back if anything changes. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Goodbye. .
