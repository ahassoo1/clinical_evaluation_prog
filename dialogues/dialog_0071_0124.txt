DOCTOR: Good morning, Nykisha. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, for the past few months, my skin has been getting…darker. And I’ve been really tired, even when I get enough sleep, it seems. It's just...odd.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker skin... and fatigue. Hmm. A few months, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about three or four months now, I think. It started slowly, but it's definitely noticeable, especially on my arms and face. It’s not… patchy, exactly, just… generally darker than it used to be. I work outside sometimes, but I always try to wear sunscreen.
DOCTOR: Right, I see your chart indicates some outdoor work. And you mentioned trying to use sunscreen. That’s good. Now, has anything changed recently – new medications, different soaps or lotions, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I’ve been using the same things for years, I think. My usual lotion… and the same soap. Oh! Actually… about six months ago, my sister sent me this new face cream from Cambodia. It smelled really nice, kind of herbal. I stopped using it a couple of months ago, when I noticed my skin changing, but… I don’t know if that could be it? It wasn’t a brand I recognized, she just said it was good for… brightening the skin, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a face cream from Cambodia, used for about six months, stopped around the time you noticed the changes… that's helpful. Do you remember the name of the cream, or anything about the packaging?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is the frustrating part! No, I don’t. My sister just… sent it with a bunch of other things. The packaging was… gold, I think? And maybe some red flowers on it? It was a small jar. I wish I had kept the box, now. She gets things sent to her from family back home, and it's all in Khmer, so I couldn't read anything on it anyway. I just remember it smelled like lemongrass, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, gold packaging, red flowers, lemongrass scent... We'll make a note of that. Now, aside from the skin darkening and fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really. I haven’t been sick, no fever or anything like that. Maybe… a little more thirsty than usual? And I guess… just feeling generally run-down. It's hard to explain. Like I’m not getting good rest, even when I sleep eight hours. And my appetite hasn’t been great, but I just figured that was from being tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst, general run-down feeling, decreased appetite… Alright. Now, do you have any history of thyroid problems or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother had… something with her thyroid, I think. She was always tired, and gained a lot of weight. I think she took pills for it, but she passed away a long time ago, so I don't remember the details very well. And no, not that I know of, with diabetes. My dad was pretty healthy, as far as I know. He lived to be eighty-five.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of possible thyroid issues... Good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your thyroid gland. Then we can discuss some potential tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on with me. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 108/70. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let me gently feel your thyroid gland. Hmm... Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. No noticeable nodules. Skin feels normal to the touch. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, blood sugar, and a complete blood count. Also, since you mentioned the face cream, we’ll do a test for heavy metals. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very thorough, Doctor. Heavy metals… that’s smart, checking that face cream. Yes, please. I’m happy you're being so careful. When will I know the results? And will I need to fast before the blood tests?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m ordering those tests now. Yes, you will need to fast for eight hours before the blood draw, so nothing to eat or drink besides water. We’ll schedule you for first thing tomorrow morning. The results usually take about three to five business days to come back. We'll call you as soon as we have them, and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes – like fever, severe fatigue, or dizziness – please don't hesitate to call the office, or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfect. Fasting is no problem. And thank you for telling me to watch out for those symptoms. I appreciate you being so clear about everything. First thing tomorrow morning… okay. I think that’s everything for now, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so for now. We’ll get those tests done and see what they reveal. A little patience, and hopefully we can figure out what’s going on. Here’s a lab requisition form. The receptionist will schedule your appointment as you check out. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. Get some rest tonight, and try not to worry too much. It was nice meeting you, Nykisha.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor Galena. Thank you for your time and for explaining everything so well. I'll see you when the results are back.
