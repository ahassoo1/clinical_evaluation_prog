DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Bigger is the name. They told me to come... something about the work. Old mine, you know? Been a long time since I had to come to doctors. Not a fan, to be honest. They just want to make sure I ain't falling apart.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bigger. Doctor visits aren't always pleasant, but we'll try to make this as smooth as possible. When you say “something about the work,” and “old mine,” could you tell me a little more about what kind of work you did, and when you last worked at the mine?
PATIENT: Work? I was a machine man. Loading and moving, mostly. Big machines, underground. Dust everywhere. Did that... oh, goodness... must be thirty, forty years now? Stopped proper when they closed it down. Before that, I was still going in. Not a pretty place, that mine. Lots of young lads getting sick, back then. Not like now, I suppose. Everything's 'safe' now, they say.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bigger. That's helpful. Thirty or forty years ago… alright. And you said young lads were getting sick – do you recall what kinds of illnesses they were experiencing?
PATIENT: Illnesses… coughing, mostly. Bad coughing. And some… some shortness of breath. Couldn’t keep up. A few ended up real weak, needed help just to walk. Old man Hemlock, he had it real bad. They said it was his lungs. But nobody told us what it was, not really. Just “miner’s cough”, they said. Everything was quicker back then, you know? Didn't bother with all these questions. Just get back to work.
DOCTOR: I see. "Miner's cough"… unfortunately, that wasn't always a very specific term. It’s good you’re bringing this up now. Just to get a clearer picture, have you experienced any coughing or shortness of breath yourself, at any point?
PATIENT: Me? Nah. Not really. I always been a strong lad. Toughed it out. Maybe a little cough now and then, winter months, like anyone else. But nothing… nothing like old man Hemlock. I can still remember him struggling for air. I'm alright, Doctor. Don't you worry about me. It's the young ones you should be looking at. They didn’t have the strength we did.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that, Mr. Bigger, and it’s good you’ve been so strong. Still, even if you feel well now, it’s important to check everything. Just to be thorough, let's go through a quick list of questions, just to make sure we haven’t missed anything. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy? Hmph. What is energy? I'm eighty-six years old, Doctor! Of course my energy is low. Always a bit tired these days. Takes a bit longer to get going, that's all. Used to be able to work all day, now I need a sit-down every couple of hours. That's just getting old, isn't it? Not something a doctor can fix.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Mr. Bigger, some changes are just part of getting older, and that's perfectly normal. But it’s still good to know, as it can help us understand what's going on. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Maybe a little. The wife... bless her soul, she used to cook up a storm. But since she passed... I don't bother much with proper meals. Just a bit of toast, you know? Not like I need a big appetite anymore. Everything tastes the same anyway. It's just me now.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Bigger. It's understandable that your appetite has changed. And changes in appetite can sometimes be linked to other things, so it’s good we’re talking about it. Now, just moving on, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? A bit, maybe. Sometimes they get a bit puffy at the end of the day. But I put that down to the heat, you know? Summer's been a scorcher. Always gets a bit swollen when it's hot. Nothing to worry about. Old age, that's all it is. Everything sags a bit when you get old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Hmph. What kind of exam? Ain't got nothing wrong with me, Doctor. But... alright. Go on then. Get it over with. But don't poke around too much, eh? I'm a delicate flower, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. It will be a fairly routine exam – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and just a quick look at your overall health. Nothing too invasive, I promise. First, let's check your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Relax? Easier said than done, Doctor. But alright, alright. Do your worst. Just don't go squeezing too tight, eh? My veins ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathe normally. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Mr. Bigger – 148 over 82. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Deep breath? Like this? Feels like there's dust still in these lungs after all these years. Never really cleared it out, I suppose. Always a bit scratchy in the mornings. What do you hear? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: I do hear a little wheezing, Mr. Bigger, and your breath sounds are a bit diminished, as you noticed. It's not immediately alarming, but it does suggest some narrowing of the airways. We'll need to investigate further. Could you please sit forward a little while I listen to your heart?
PATIENT: Heart, eh? Always something with this old body. Used to be strong as an ox, now it's just… ticking away. Get it over with, Doctor. Faster than it used to be, I reckon. Notice it sometimes when I'm doing the garden. Gets a bit… fluttery. But it always settles down.
DOCTOR: I do hear a slightly irregular rhythm and a mild murmur, Mr. Bigger. This isn't necessarily cause for immediate concern, but it's something we should investigate further with an EKG and possibly an echocardiogram. These tests will give us a clearer picture of how your heart is functioning. Now, I'd like to take a quick look at your ankles to assess the swelling. Could you please point your toes?
PATIENT: Tests, eh? More tests. Always something with doctors, isn’t it? Never a quick answer. But alright, alright. Do what you need to do. Feels a bit stiff, to be honest. Always does in the mornings. See? A bit puffy. Not as bad as some days, but it's there. So, what’s the verdict, Doctor? Am I falling apart?
DOCTOR: There is a bit of swelling, as you pointed out, and it does seem to be pitting edema, which means it holds the impression for a short time. Now, Mr. Bigger, I wouldn’t say you’re falling apart, but there are a few things we need to investigate further. Given your history of working in the mine, your cough, the wheezing I heard in your lungs, and the findings today, I'm concerned about the possibility of some chronic lung condition, potentially related to dust exposure. The irregular heart rhythm and ankle swelling also warrant further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests: Chest X-ray: To look at your lungs. EKG : To check your heart rhythm. Echocardiogram: An ultrasound of your heart to assess its function. Blood tests: Including a complete blood count and kidney function tests. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests. Always something. I tell you, Doctor, I was healthier before I came in here! But… alright. If you think it's necessary. I ain't getting any younger. Do what you need to do. But I don't want to be stuck in that hospital for days, you hear? I got my garden to tend to. So, how do we go about these… tests? Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I need to know if I can still prune my roses next week. They're looking a bit unruly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bigger, and I assure you we’ll keep things as quick and comfortable as possible. None of these tests should be painful, and they shouldn't require a hospital stay. The Chest X-ray and EKG can be done right here in the clinic today – they’ll take about 30 minutes in total. The Echocardiogram will need to be done at the hospital, but it’s a non-invasive procedure and usually takes about an hour. We can schedule that for sometime next week, so it doesn’t interfere with your gardening. The blood tests can also be done here today. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and create a plan to address any issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Today and next week. Sounds like a lot of bother, but… if you think it's best. I suppose I gotta listen to the doctor, eh? But no funny business, you hear? I want a straight answer, no fancy medical jargon. Just tell me what's wrong, and what I can do about it. And make sure I can still prune my roses. They’re my pride and joy. Let’s get these tests done, then. The sooner it’s over, the better. Where do we start? Blood first, I reckon. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll start with the blood draw. I'll have the nurse come in and take a sample. It will only take a few minutes. She's very good and gentle. After that, we'll move on to the Chest X-ray. I promise to explain everything in plain language, Mr. Bigger, and we'll certainly discuss your ability to prune your roses once we have a better understanding of your condition. Let me call the nurse now. And thank you for being so patient and cooperative. It helps me to help you.
PATIENT: Hmph. Patience is a virtue, they say. Just get it done, Doctor. And tell that nurse to be quick about it. I got things to do. Roses don't prune themselves, you know. .
DOCTOR: "Nurse Davies, could you please come in and draw some blood from Mr. Bigger?
