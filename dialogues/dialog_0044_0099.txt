DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Asami. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. My general practitioner suggested I come see you regarding some… test results. An abnormal GI Endo Test, she called it. I must admit, I wasn’t entirely certain what that meant, but she seemed quite concerned. Perhaps you could explain it to me in simpler terms?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Minatra. It's perfectly understandable to be unsure about medical terms, that’s what I’m here for. A GI endoscopy, or simply endo test, involves using a thin, flexible tube with a camera to look inside your digestive tract – specifically, your esophagus, stomach, and the first part of your small intestine. Your general practitioner sent you to me because something unusual was seen during that test. Let me take a quick look at the report… Ah, yes. It indicates some inflammation and a few small polyps were identified. Now, polyps aren't necessarily cause for alarm – many are benign – but we need to investigate further to determine exactly what we’re dealing with. Before we dive into that, could you tell me a little bit about why your general practitioner ordered the endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. A camera… inside. That sounds… thorough. Well, for several months now, I’ve been experiencing rather persistent stomach discomfort. Not exactly pain, Doctor, but a constant, dull ache, mostly after I eat. And… occasional bloating. It wasn’t debilitating, so I initially dismissed it as simply… getting older, you understand? But it continued, and then I began experiencing some… a bit of difficulty swallowing from time to time. That prompted me to finally see my doctor, and she ordered a variety of tests, culminating in this endoscopy, I presume.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Minatra. Those symptoms – the discomfort after eating, bloating, and difficulty swallowing – are all reasonable reasons to investigate further. It sounds like your general practitioner was quite thorough in her approach. Now, regarding the difficulty swallowing – can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s not constant, thankfully. More… intermittent. Sometimes food feels like it catches in my throat, and I have to drink some water to get it to go down. Other times, it just feels… tighter, like the passage is a bit constricted. It happens with both solid foods and liquids, though I believe it’s more pronounced with solids. It hasn't worsened dramatically recently, but it is enough to be… unsettling, you understand? It’s not comfortable, and I do find myself choosing softer foods more often now, just to avoid the issue. I haven't noticed any weight loss, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely, Ms. Minatra. That sensation of food getting stuck and the preference for softer foods are important details. And the fact that it happens with both solids and liquids is also helpful information. No weight loss is good news. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was diagnosed with mild hypertension about fifteen years ago, but it has been well-managed with medication ever since. Aside from that… not much, thankfully. I’ve always been quite healthy, all things considered. I have no known allergies, and I haven't had any significant surgeries. I do take a daily multivitamin, and, as I mentioned, the medication for my blood pressure. Is there anything specific you are looking for? I’ve always prided myself on taking care of myself, although… I suppose these test results indicate I haven’t been perfectly successful.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Minatra. Fifteen years of well-managed hypertension is excellent! And taking a daily multivitamin is a good habit. It’s good to know you’re proactive about your health. Let's just cover a few more bases. Have there been any instances of cancer in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a… difficult question, Doctor. My mother passed away from complications related to a stroke when I was quite young, and my father… he suffered from a heart ailment. As for cancer… my aunt, on my father’s side, was diagnosed with breast cancer in her late sixties, but she recovered fully after treatment. Beyond that… I don’t recall any other significant cases within the immediate family. My family wasn't particularly forthcoming with medical details, I’m afraid. It was… not a topic we discussed openly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Minatra. It’s quite common for families to avoid those discussions. Knowing about your aunt’s breast cancer is helpful, thank you. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I live alone, as I’m a widow, but I am surrounded by a supportive community of friends. I remain relatively active, despite my age. I enjoy gardening, and I take a daily walk, weather permitting, of course. I’ve always enjoyed cooking, and I eat a fairly balanced diet, mostly fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. I used to enjoy dancing, but… it has become a bit difficult lately with my… discomfort. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s about it. I try to maintain a positive outlook on life, although… these recent events have been rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: That’s all very good information, Ms. Minatra. It sounds like you have a healthy lifestyle and a strong support system, which is wonderful. The fact that you've noticed the discomfort impacting your ability to enjoy activities like dancing is certainly something we need to address. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of the endoscopy, it sounds like we’re dealing with a few possibilities. The inflammation suggests some irritation in your esophagus and stomach. The polyps, while not necessarily dangerous, need to be investigated further. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a biopsy of the polyps to determine their exact nature. Second, a test to rule out Helicobacter pylori infection, a common bacteria that can cause inflammation in the stomach. And finally, a pH monitoring test to see if acid reflux is contributing to your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor, and quite sensible. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Yes, those tests sound perfectly alright with me. I trust your judgment, and I’m eager to get to the bottom of this. The Helicobacter pylori… is that contagious? I wouldn't want to… inadvertently pass anything on to my friends.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Minatra, and it’s good you asked. Helicobacter pylori is contagious, but usually spread through close contact, like sharing utensils or close proximity with someone who has an active infection. It’s not spread casually. If we do find you have the infection, it's easily treatable with antibiotics, and taking precautions like avoiding sharing personal items during treatment will be sufficient to prevent transmission. Now, let's get these tests ordered. I'll have the lab draw some blood, and then we'll schedule you for the pH monitoring test and a follow-up appointment to discuss the biopsy results. The lab work should be back in a few days, and the pH monitoring usually takes about 24 hours. Would you prefer I have my nurse schedule those appointments for you, or would you like to do it yourself?
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, Doctor. Thank you for clarifying. I think having your nurse schedule the appointments for me would be most convenient, if that’s alright. I tend to get… flustered when dealing with such things. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness, Doctor Asami. You’ve already put my mind at ease considerably.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. That's what I'm here for. And don't worry about feeling flustered - it's perfectly understandable. Nurse Ramirez, could you please come in for a moment?
