DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I need a letter, actually. A letter confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I’m hoping you can help. It’s for an airline, they need it before I can book a ticket.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fit-to-fly letter. Yes, I understand. And just to be clear, are you experiencing any current medical issues that prompted this request from the airline, or is this a routine check?
PATIENT: No, no current issues. It’s… well, my husband passed away last year, quite suddenly, on a flight. They just want confirmation that I’m… stable enough to travel, I guess. It's a standard thing, they said. It feels a bit invasive, but… I want to be able to go see my sister. It's a long flight.
DOCTOR: Oh, Kiante, I am so very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. And I understand completely why the airline would request this, given the circumstances. It’s perfectly reasonable of them, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. To give me a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… a shock. I’m generally healthy, I think. I eat reasonably well, try to get some exercise… I walk a lot. No major illnesses, no chronic conditions. I have Medicare, if that helps. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly since… well, since he passed, to be honest. I guess I just… avoided it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Kiante. It’s very common to avoid things after a loss. It takes time to adjust. Medicare is helpful information, thank you. Let’s do a quick review of your systems, just to be thorough. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, none of that. No chest pain, thankfully. Breathing is normal, and my heart feels… normal. I get a little anxious sometimes, of course, but that’s just… the situation. Nothing physical. I sleep okay, usually. Maybe a little restless, but I take some chamomile tea before bed. Does that sound alright? I sometimes worry I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Kiante. You’re doing perfectly fine. It’s good that you’re managing your anxiety with chamomile tea. That's a positive step. Okay. And what about digestive issues – any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: No problems there either. Everything's… regular. I haven't had any issues with my stomach. I do get a little tired sometimes, but I assumed that was just stress and not getting enough sleep. I try to drink plenty of water, though. I'm pretty good about that, I think. Is there anything else you need to know? I really just want this letter so I can see my sister.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s all very good to hear, Kiante. Just a couple more quick questions. Any dizziness or fainting spells?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even a little bit dizzy. I’ve always had good balance. And no fainting. I can stand for a long time, walk a long distance… no problems at all with that. I feel a little silly answering all these questions about things that aren't wrong, but I want to be helpful. I just want to be sure I can get this letter and finally go.
DOCTOR: No, not silly at all, Kiante. It's important to rule things out as well as rule things in. It helps me get a complete picture. Now, have you had any recent surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And no hospital visits. Not since I was a child, and that was just for… tonsils, I think. Nothing major. Everything’s been… pretty straightforward, health-wise. Honestly, I feel like I’m wasting your time with all these “no’s.” But I want you to be sure, you know? I want this letter to be accurate and complete. I don't want there to be any issues when I get to the airport.
DOCTOR: You are not wasting my time at all, Kiante. And I appreciate your thoroughness. Knowing what isn't going on is just as important. Let's just do a quick physical exam, just to confirm everything you’ve told me. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this sorted. Please, go ahead. It's good to know everything is okay. I'm ready when you are. Thank you for being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Within normal limits. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Finally, I’ll just take a quick look at your ears and throat. Ears and throat look clear. Everything appears to be normal, Kiante.
PATIENT: That's… really good to hear. Thank you, Doctor. I was worried there might be something wrong, you know? After… everything. So, does that mean you can write the letter? Is that possible? I’m so relieved everything checked out okay. Can you just say I’m fit to fly? That’s all I really need.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Kiante. Based on our conversation and the physical exam, I can certainly write a letter stating that you are medically fit to fly. I'll document everything we discussed today – your history, the exam findings, and that you are currently experiencing no contraindications to air travel. It may take a few minutes to finalize. While I'm doing that, do you have any allergies or medications you currently take that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And I don’t take any medications. Just the chamomile tea sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. Honestly, I haven't needed to see a doctor in years. It’s just… this whole airline thing. It just felt… safer to get a letter. But thank you for making it so easy, Doctor. I really appreciate it. You've put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Kiante. This letter states that, based on my examination today, you are medically fit to fly. It also documents the absence of any current medical conditions that would contraindicate air travel. Please review it to make sure everything is accurate. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Yes, it looks… perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor Bombara. You have no idea how much this means to me. I can finally see my sister. No, I don't think I have any other questions. You've been so kind and patient. Thank you again, for everything. I think that’s all. I really appreciate your time. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I’m glad I could help. And you have a wonderful visit with your sister. Enjoy your trip! Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. .
