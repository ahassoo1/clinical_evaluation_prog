DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Quite a pleasure indeed. Well, to put it plainly, I’ve been… experimenting, shall we say, with rather drastic dietary changes. I’m hoping you can lend a discerning eye to the matter. It seems my enthusiasm may have outstripped my common sense, and I’d like to ensure I haven’t done myself any lasting harm.
DOCTOR: Drastic dietary changes, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. I’ve always been rather fascinated by the… possibilities of human physiology, you see. And, well, I stumbled upon a rather… restrictive regimen online. It involved a great deal of… celery juice. And very little else, for a period of ten days. I felt it prudent to seek your professional opinion before continuing. It promised detoxification, you understand, and a startling level of vitality. Though, frankly, I felt rather weak by the end of it. A bit foolish, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Celery juice, for ten days… and little else. I see. And when did you conclude this… experiment?
PATIENT: Just yesterday, Doctor. The tenth day was the first of August, naturally. I’ve resumed a more… conventional diet since then, but I’m rather apprehensive about any lingering effects. I’ve always prided myself on my physical well-being, you see, and this feels… uncharacteristic. And rather silly, when I think about it. Though the internet presented it with such… conviction.
DOCTOR: The internet, yes. Often a source of…misinformation. Let’s begin with some specifics, Mr. Vantine. Can you describe any particular symptoms you’ve been experiencing since concluding this diet?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, initially, there was a good deal of… digestive unrest, shall we say. A rather unpleasant churning. That subsided with the reintroduction of solid food, thankfully. However, I’ve been feeling somewhat… fatigued. Not debilitating, mind you, but a persistent lack of energy. And my hands… they tremble slightly. Not constantly, but noticeably when I attempt precision work - which, as a special effects artist, is rather problematic. And I seem to be… colder than usual. A slight chill, even in warm rooms. Though that may be my imagination.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, tremors, and feeling colder than usual… These are all potentially relevant observations. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: My appetite, thankfully, has returned to normal now that I’m eating properly. Before, on the celery juice regime, it was… nonexistent. As for weight… I believe I lost some, naturally. Perhaps five or six pounds during those ten days. Though I wasn't meticulously tracking it. I tend not to dwell on such matters unless it becomes… unavoidable. I suppose a precise figure isn’t terribly important at this juncture. It’s the overall feeling of… depletion that concerns me most.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Never have been much for them, if I’m honest. I believe in letting the body heal itself, within reason, of course. And allergies… not that I’m aware of. I enjoy a good strawberry now and then, and I’ve never had a reaction. Though, I suppose one can develop an allergy at any age. But to my knowledge, I’m entirely free of them. A fairly unremarkable medical history, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, if you’ll permit me, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. Just to get a more comprehensive picture of your condition. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Perfectly agreeable, Doctor. I trust your expertise implicitly. Do let me know if there’s anything I can do to assist. I’m rather accustomed to being prodded and measured, you see, due to the nature of my work. Though usually it’s me doing the prodding and measuring, not the other way around. But I’m happy to cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit on the examination table, we’ll begin with your vital signs. And then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Very good. Lead on, Doctor. I am entirely at your disposal. Do forgive the slightly worn tweed. It's a comfortable working garment, you see, and one rarely encounters formal occasions these days.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 110 over 70, pulse is 68 and regular, respiration rate is 16, and your temperature is 97.8 Fahrenheit. Slightly low, but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but slightly diminished in the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. I also note some mild tremor in your hands, as you mentioned. Alright, Mr. Vantine. Based on this brief examination, and your reported history, it appears you’ve experienced some degree of electrolyte imbalance and dehydration as a result of this restrictive diet. The low temperature and diminished lung sounds could be related to this as well. We'll need to run some blood tests to confirm this and assess your kidney function.
PATIENT: That sounds… entirely plausible, Doctor. I did feel rather… depleted, as I mentioned. Electrolyte imbalance, you say? Is that… serious? And blood tests, of course. Whatever you deem necessary. I must confess, I was rather foolish to embark on such a regimen without proper medical supervision. A vanity project, perhaps. I was chasing some… illusory ideal of vitality. I take full responsibility. But thank you for your thorough assessment. It’s reassuring to have a professional opinion.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be drawn to such ideas, Mr. Vantine. And it’s commendable that you sought medical attention. It's certainly not vanity, just… poor judgment. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture. We’ll check your sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, and kidney function. I’m also going to order a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying issues. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and gradually reintroducing a balanced diet. Avoid any further restrictive regimens. Is there anyone who assists you with meals or monitors your well-being at home?
PATIENT: No one specifically, Doctor. I live alone since my divorce some years ago. I am quite capable of looking after myself, generally. A solitary existence, perhaps, but a comfortable one. I manage my own affairs and cook for myself. Though, I confess, my culinary skills are rather… basic. Perhaps I should enlist the assistance of a nutritionist once I’ve regained my equilibrium. To prevent a recurrence of this… folly. But I assure you, I am perfectly capable of following your instructions. Increased fluid intake and a balanced diet. Consider it done.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the lab draw the blood now, and we should have the results back within a day or two. Once we have those, we can discuss a more specific plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms—such as severe weakness, dizziness, or irregular heartbeat—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Perfectly. Severe weakness, dizziness, irregular heartbeat. I shall bear those symptoms in mind. And I understand the importance of prompt medical attention should they arise. A day or two for the results, you say? Very acceptable. I appreciate your thoroughness and clear instructions, Doctor. You’ve put my mind considerably at ease. Is there anything further you require from me at this juncture?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Vantine, that’s all for now. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood. Just a final thought – I also recommend discussing this episode with your primary care physician. They can provide ongoing monitoring and support. Do you know who your primary care physician is?
PATIENT: A thoughtful suggestion, Doctor. I appreciate your concern for my ongoing well-being. My primary care physician is Dr. Alistair Finch, at the City General Practice. Though, I must confess, I haven't seen him in some time. A rather perfunctory relationship, I'm afraid. But I shall endeavour to schedule an appointment once I have the results of these tests. To keep him abreast of the situation, as you suggest. Perhaps this whole episode will prompt a more… proactive approach to my healthcare. Thank you once more, Doctor Eaddy. Your expertise is most appreciated.
DOCTOR: Very good. I’m glad I could assist you, Mr. Vantine. The lab technician will be in shortly. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a pleasant day. And please, no more extreme diets. .
PATIENT: .
