DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… good to meet you too, I think. Um… well, my wife, she said I need some papers. Something about… time off? Or maybe… if I can’t work? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. She handles most of that stuff. Something about FMLA… or disability? Does that ring a bell?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does. It sounds like your wife is very proactive, which is wonderful. FMLA – Family and Medical Leave Act – and disability are both possibilities, depending on what’s going on. So, let’s start with figuring out why you might need time off or those papers. Can you tell me what’s been happening with your health?
PATIENT: Health… well, it’s… not what it used to be, that’s for sure. I work with the church, you see. Directors, religious activities and education… keeps me busy. But lately… everything feels a bit… slower. Hard to explain. I get tired very easily. And sometimes… my memory… it’s just… gone. I forget things. Important things. My wife says it’s been getting worse. I don't really feel sick, you know? Just… worn out. And forgetful. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds concerning, and it’s good you and your wife are paying attention to these changes. It's helpful that you're able to describe it like that - "slower," easily tired, and memory issues. It’s definitely worth investigating. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about the memory problems?
PATIENT: Well… it's not like I forget who people are, not usually. It's more… details. Like, I might start a sentence and completely lose my train of thought. Or I'll go into a room and forget why I went there. Little things like that. Yesterday, I was preparing for a meeting, a really important one with some folks from the diocese… and I couldn’t remember the date! My wife had to remind me. It's… it's like a fog sometimes. And it’s getting more frequent. That’s what worries me, and her, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. That’s very helpful. Losing track of things, forgetting dates… those are definitely changes we need to explore. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask you some more questions, if you don’t mind. This will help me understand what might be going on. We'll go through a bit of your medical history, and then I’ll do a physical exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. My wife always says I need to see a doctor more often. Medical history… I haven’t really had much, thankfully. But go ahead. Ask away. I’ll try my best to remember. It might take a moment sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We have plenty of time. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not that I recall. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. But nothing… serious. My wife might know better, she keeps all the records. I’ve had a few aches and pains over the years, getting old, you know, but nothing a good rest didn’t fix. No diabetes, no high blood pressure… I don't think so, anyway. Should I ask my wife? She's usually very organized.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. It's always good to double-check. And yes, if you're unsure, it’s always best to ask your wife. But for now, let’s assume you haven’t had any major medical diagnoses. How about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And… oh, yes! I had a small operation on my knee, years ago, after I hurt it playing volleyball. Nothing major, just a little cleanup work. That's it, I think. A long time ago. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. So, appendix removal as a child and a knee surgery. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. I try to stay away from medication as much as possible. I believe in letting nature take its course, you see. I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. No vitamins, no supplements… my wife tries to get me to take something for my joints, but I always forget. So, no. Nothing regular. Just the occasional aspirin.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No regular medications. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I’ve never had a really bad reaction to anything. I might get a little itchy sometimes when I'm bitten by a mosquito, but that’s about it. No food allergies, no allergies to medicine… as far as I know. My wife might know better, she’s very careful about those things. She always checks the ingredients when she cooks. But no, I don't believe I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, let's move on to family history. Are there any significant health conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a bit tricky. My mother… she lived a long life, but I don’t really remember her having any serious illnesses. My father… he passed away when I was young, heart problems, I think. My sister… she had diabetes, later in life. And… now that you mention it, my uncle, on my mother’s side… he had some memory issues when he got older. He… he wasn’t himself towards the end. But other than that… I’m not really sure. We didn’t talk about these things much when I was growing up. It wasn’t really… the custom.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. So, father with heart problems, sister with diabetes, and uncle with memory issues. That’s helpful information. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle before we move onto a physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife wouldn't allow it! I believe in taking care of my health, you see. And smoking… well, it’s just not a good habit. Always been against it. No, never smoked. Never will.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A small glass. Nothing excessive. My wife and I, we enjoy a nice meal together. And a glass of wine… it helps us relax. But I don’t drink every day. And I certainly don’t drink to excess. Maybe a couple of times a week. So, yes, I drink a little. But nothing to worry about, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. A glass of wine a couple of times a week. And finally, what do you do for work?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I work with the church, you see. I’m Directors, Religious Activities and Education. Keeps me very busy, organizing events, teaching classes, that sort of thing. It’s a very rewarding job, helping people, sharing my faith. But it can be stressful sometimes, keeping everything running smoothly. A lot of responsibility. I’ve been doing it for many years now. It’s my calling, I suppose. But lately… It’s getting harder to keep up. That’s why I’m here, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a very important and demanding role. And it’s perfectly reasonable to seek help when things become more challenging. Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, thank you for answering all my questions. That gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your memory and reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. I'm ready. I suppose. Just… don't make it too uncomfortable, alright? My wife will be expecting me back soon.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. It won’t take long. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay… 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear, breath sounds are equal bilaterally. Now, I’m going to do a basic neurological exam. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll check your reflexes. Can you follow my finger?
PATIENT: Yes… I can see your finger. Is this… is this to check my eyes? Sometimes my vision gets a bit blurry, especially when I’m tired. But it usually clears up on its own.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is partly to check your eyes and your eye movements. And you're right to mention the blurry vision; we'll note that. Okay, good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. First, do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: Um… let me see… is it… 2025? Yes, I think it’s 2025. August, right? August 2nd? It’s hard to keep track of the dates these days. My wife usually reminds me.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct. It is August 2nd, 2025. Good. Now, can you tell me your full name?
PATIENT: My… my full name? Um… Ronnald… Ronnald Limtiaco. Yes. Ronnald Limtiaco. It feels strange having to say it out loud like this. I usually just go by Ronnald. Is that what you needed?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words after me. Please try to remember them, as I'll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Are those the three words? I think I’ve got them. It’s… it’s just a bit difficult to hold onto things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, those are the three words. Good. Now, can you tell me the current president of the United States?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a difficult one. Let me see… is it… Biden? Yes, I think it’s Biden. Joe Biden. I try to keep up with current events, but it’s hard when I’m so busy with church matters. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock, showing the time as 10:10. I have a piece of paper and a pen here. Don't worry about making it perfect, just do your best. It’s just to help me assess your spatial awareness and cognitive function. Take your time.
PATIENT: There… I’m not very good at drawing. I’m afraid it’s a bit of a mess. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be. I hope that’s alright. It’s… it’s hard to get it exactly right.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That’s perfectly alright. It’s not about artistic skill, it's just information that helps me understand what’s going on. Now, let’s return to those three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, penny. Can you tell me those three words again?
PATIENT: Um… let me see… apple… I remember apple. And… table? No, that doesn’t sound right. And… I can’t remember the third word. I’m so sorry. It’s just… gone. I knew I would forget something. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be. It's terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for your patience. Based on the history you’ve provided and the results of this brief examination, you are experiencing some cognitive difficulties, specifically with memory and spatial awareness. The difficulty recalling the three words is particularly concerning. It’s important to investigate this further. I’m not going to give you a definitive diagnosis at this stage, as we need more information. However, these symptoms could be indicative of a number of things, including early signs of cognitive impairment, such as mild cognitive impairment or, less commonly, early dementia. There are also other possibilities, such as medication side effects or vitamin deficiencies, that we need to rule out. The first step is to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a more comprehensive cognitive assessment with a neurologist. Would you be comfortable with those steps?
PATIENT: Dementia? Oh dear. That… that sounds very serious. My mother… she had some memory problems towards the end, but I didn’t want to believe it was… that. Blood work and a neurologist… yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. I’m worried, of course. But I trust your judgment. I just want to be able to… remember things. And take care of my church. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all. And I understand your concerns. It’s important to remember that we’re just gathering information at this stage. Many things can cause memory problems, and not all of them are serious. The blood work and neurological assessment will help us determine the cause and develop an appropriate plan. I’m going to order the blood work now. It will take a few days to get the results. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders. They’ll schedule a more in-depth assessment. In the meantime, I recommend that your wife accompany you to the neurologist appointment, as she can provide valuable insight into your day-to-day functioning. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Blood work and a neurologist… yes. My wife will definitely come with me. She’s the organized one, you know. She’ll make sure everything gets done. I suppose… I suppose I just need to wait. And try not to worry too much. Is that possible? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and your patience. I really do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. Waiting can be difficult, but we’ll do everything we can to get you answers as quickly as possible. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’re here to support you. I’ll have the lab order and the neurology referral ready for you before you leave. In the meantime, I’m going to document everything we discussed today. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I suppose I should get going. My wife is probably wondering where I am. Thank you for seeing me today. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment, or sooner if you have any concerns. Take these with you, and don’t hesitate to call the office to schedule the appointments. Have a good day, Mr. Limtiaco. .
