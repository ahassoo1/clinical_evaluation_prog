DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Right, well, it’s been… a bit odd, lately. I’ve just been awfully thirsty, no matter how much I drink, and hungry too, constantly. It’s… disruptive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, yes. I understand. Constant thirst and hunger… How long has this been going on for, precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. It’s not been sudden, exactly. Maybe… three or four weeks now? It started gradually, and I just thought I was being… particularly active. But it’s not easing up, you see. It’s actually getting more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Three to four weeks… and increasing. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the thirst and hunger, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been going to the toilet more often. Both, if you don't mind me saying. And… I've felt a bit tired, generally. Nothing drastic, but… less energy than usual, I suppose. I’ve been attributing that to… well, everything, really. It’s been a busy stretch.
DOCTOR: Increased urination and fatigue… Busy stretch notwithstanding, those are certainly worth noting. And, to be thorough, have you experienced any blurry vision, unexplained weight loss, or any slow-healing sores?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not that I’ve noticed. Weight loss, perhaps a little, but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. And no, thankfully, no sores. I'm fairly careful with myself. I used to work in a warehouse, so scrapes and cuts were common, but nothing recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to get a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not. Never have been, really. Aside from the occasional pain reliever for a headache, and that’s very rare. I try to stay away from those if I can. Is that… a problem? I mean, not taking anything?
DOCTOR: No, no, not a problem at all. Simply gathering information. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I eat… fairly normally, I suppose. I enjoy a good steak, a bit of fish… nothing exotic. No reactions to anything, ever. I’ve never had to worry about that. Is this… going to take much longer? I have a delivery schedule to manage this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We’re nearly finished with the initial questioning, Mr. Erxleben. Just a quick physical examination will be necessary to help me determine the cause of your symptoms. It will be brief. Perhaps we can start with your blood pressure and pulse?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Blood pressure and pulse. Very well. Get it over with quickly, if you please. I appreciate that, Doctor. I truly do. I’ve just got a lot on my plate at the moment.
DOCTOR: If you’ll have a seat, then. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140 over 90. And your pulse is 88. Now, if you don't mind, could you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Very well. There. Is that alright? I haven't weighed myself in… quite a while, I admit. I used to be quite the athlete, you know. Rugby. But that was… some time ago.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms. And your height, if you could recall it… roughly. It’s for the BMI calculation.
PATIENT: Right, yes, my height. I believe I’m… around 1.7 metres. Maybe a little less, but I haven’t measured it recently. It's… a bit of a sensitive subject, to be honest. I’ve shrunk a bit, I suppose. But 1.7 metres should be close enough. Can we hurry this along, Doctor? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the symptoms you’ve described, and the results of this brief examination, it’s possible we’re dealing with early-stage type 2 diabetes. However, this is preliminary. We'll need to confirm with a blood glucose test and potentially an HbA1c.
PATIENT: Diabetes? Now hold on a moment. Are you certain? I feel… perfectly fine, aside from the thirst and hunger, of course. I’ve never had any trouble with my health. Is that test… unpleasant? And will it take long? I have deliveries to make, Doctor. This is… concerning, to say the least. Very concerning.
DOCTOR: Mr. Erxleben, I understand your concerns. It’s based on a combination of your symptoms - the excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue - and your elevated BMI. It doesn’t mean you definitively have diabetes, simply that it warrants investigation. The blood glucose test is a simple finger prick, minimally invasive. It will take less than five minutes to obtain the results. We'll perform that now. It's a necessary step, regardless of your busy schedule, to ensure accurate diagnosis. We also should check your kidney function and cholesterol. Would you like me to order a full lipid panel and comprehensive metabolic panel?
PATIENT: Fine. A finger prick… I suppose I can manage a finger prick. And… the other tests, if it's absolutely necessary. But please, be quick about it. The sooner this is over, the better. And… what if it is diabetes? What does that… entail? I've heard… unpleasant things. Honestly, I'd rather not dwell on it, if you don't mind. Just get on with the tests, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Very well. I've ordered the tests. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. It's best to know what we’re dealing with, Mr. Erxleben. In the meantime, I'd advise against sugary drinks and excessive carbohydrates. And frankly, given your BMI, some lifestyle modifications would be prudent. It's important to be realistic about your health, regardless of how busy you are.
PATIENT: Realistic… easy for you to say. Very well, Doctor. Just… let me know when this is all over. I have work to do. .
