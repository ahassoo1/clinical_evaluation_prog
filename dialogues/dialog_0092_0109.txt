DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not all the time, but… feels like a big weight there, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A headache at the back of your head for about three days. Can you describe the pain a little more for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not… sharp. Not like a stabbing pain. More… dull. Like… someone is squeezing. And sometimes… it goes all the way up my neck. It makes it hard to sleep, you know? I have to move my head just right.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, squeezing pain at the back of your head that radiates up into your neck, and it's affecting your sleep. That’s helpful. Has anything specific brought on the headache, or does it seem to come and go randomly?
PATIENT: Randomly, I think. I… I work with the trains, you know? Rail yard. Been doing it a long time. Lots of… moving around, lifting things. But… it didn’t start after lifting anything special. Just… started. Maybe the heat? It’s been very warm.
DOCTOR: I see. You work in the rail yard, lifting and moving around, and it started a few days ago without a specific injury. You also mentioned the heat. Let’s talk a bit more about that. Do you feel any stiffness in your neck along with the pain?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, Doctor, that’s it. Very stiff. Especially in the morning. I have to… really work it out to turn my head. Like… old rusty hinges, you know? My wife… she used to help me with it. But… she is gone now. But yes, very stiff. Makes the headache worse, I think.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Brum. It sounds like you're experiencing both headache and neck stiffness. And it seems worse in the mornings. Are you noticing any other symptoms accompanying the headache and neck stiffness?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe… a little tired. But I am old, you know? Ninety years old. Tired is normal. No… no blurry vision. No… no dizziness. Just… the head hurt and the neck stiff. And the tiredness. But that’s just… me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blurry vision or dizziness, just the headache, neck stiffness, and some general tiredness. That’s good to know. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I used to have… high blood pressure, the doctor said. A long time ago. But I took the pills for a while, and… he said it was okay. I don't take any pills now. And… no, nothing else. I’ve been pretty lucky, you know? Work hard, eat okay, sleep when I can. Nothing much ever… bothered me. Until this headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that was treated and is currently well-controlled, and otherwise you've been generally healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. Knock on wood! Just… a few bumps and bruises from the rail yard, you know? Nothing serious. My wife… she had her appendix out, once. But not me. Never.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And you mentioned you work in the rail yard. Are you currently working, or are you retired?
PATIENT: Still working, Doctor. Not full time, you know? Just… a few days a week. Help out where I can. Can’t just sit still, you know? Gotta keep busy. My son… he says I should stop. But… I like it. I know the trains. It's… good work.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to stay active. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know of anyone in your family who has had similar headaches or neck problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she used to get headaches. But… just regular headaches, you know? Nothing like this. And… my brother… he had trouble with his back. From working in the fields. But… no one with headaches like mine. I don’t think so. My wife’s family… I don’t know them very well. She didn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of headaches in your mother, but not similar to yours, and back problems in your brother. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I can eat anything. I can take any medicine. Never had a problem with that. My wife… she was allergic to bee stings. But not me. Never. Everything is okay with that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. And you’re not currently taking any medications. Now, before I do a quick physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your typical diet and how much water you drink in a day?
PATIENT: Well, I eat… regular food, you know? Rice and beans, chicken, sometimes fish. Not too much sugar. My wife… she made sure of that. I drink… water when I’m thirsty. Not a lot, maybe… two or three glasses a day? Sometimes more when it's hot. I drink coffee in the morning. That’s… important. Gotta have my coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, a regular diet with rice, beans, and chicken, and about two to three glasses of water a day, along with coffee in the morning. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… be gentle, okay? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll take a look at your neck and shoulders, and do a few simple neurological tests to check your reflexes and strength. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Sounds good. Go ahead. I'll try to be still. Just let me know if anything hurts, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72, regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your neck muscles. I notice some tenderness and tightness in your upper trapezius muscles on both sides, especially on the right. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s it, Doctor. Right there. A little bit tender. Not… sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a knot. And… it goes up into my shoulder sometimes. Like a big weight there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting the tenderness and tightness in your upper trapezius muscles, and that it radiates up into your shoulder. I notice some limited range of motion, especially when you look to the right. And there’s some discomfort when I ask you to turn your head. Now I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is good in all your extremities. Based on my examination, it appears you have muscle tension in your neck and shoulders, likely contributing to your headache. It could be a tension headache, potentially exacerbated by your work and the heat. The limited range of motion and tenderness suggest some muscle strain. I don’t suspect anything more serious at this point.
PATIENT: That… that makes sense, Doctor. The work… the trains… it’s hard work. And the heat, yes. It’s been very warm. So… what do I do? Is there anything I can take? Something for the pain?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. Fortunately, tension headaches are often manageable. I recommend trying over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, following the dosage instructions on the label. They can help reduce inflammation and pain. I also suggest applying a warm compress or taking a warm shower to relax your neck muscles. Gentle stretching exercises can also be helpful, but avoid anything that causes significant pain. I’m also going to recommend some lifestyle modifications. Try to maintain good posture, especially while working. Take frequent breaks to stretch and move around. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. And avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms. I'd like to start with these conservative measures and see if they provide relief. I'm going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, to help with the muscle spasms. It's a low dose and you should only take it as needed. However, please be aware it can cause drowsiness, so avoid driving or operating machinery while taking it. I want you to follow up with me in two weeks if your symptoms haven't improved, or if they worsen. If you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, numbness, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please seek medical attention immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Ibuprofen… warm compress… stretching… I can do that. And the… cyclobenzaprine. I’ll be careful with that, yes. No driving. Two weeks. Okay. I’ll come back in two weeks. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. I’m glad I could help. Here’s the prescription for the cyclobenzaprine. I’ll also print out some information on tension headaches and stretching exercises for you to take home. Just remember to stay hydrated, take breaks, and listen to your body. If anything changes or worsens, don't hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s everything. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your help. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. You have a good day as well, and please take care of yourself. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
