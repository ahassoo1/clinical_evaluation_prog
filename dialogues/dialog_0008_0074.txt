DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin' to you too, Doctor. Well, it's my blood pressure. Been runnin' a little high, the nurse told me at the pharmacy. Said I oughta get it checked proper. Don't like thinkin' about it too much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked. High blood pressure is very common, and we can definitely manage it. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me roughly how high the readings were when the nurse checked them, if you remember?
PATIENT: Land, I don't rightly remember the numbers. She wrote 'em down, I reckon. Just told me it was too high and I needed to see a doctor. My memory ain't what it used to be, you know. Ninety years does a number on ya.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Steines. We have the readings right here in your chart from the pharmacy. It looks like your average was around 150/90. Now, have you ever been told you have high blood pressure before, or is this the first time?
PATIENT: First time, Doctor. Never had any trouble with it 'fore. I feel alright, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but who ain't at my age? Been bakin' pies for the church social, though. Lots of standin' and workin'. Could be that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, are you currently taking any medications for anything at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Always been healthy as a horse, 'til now, I guess. Just a little somethin' for my arthritis in my hands, when it flares up real bad. But that's just a cream, you rub it on. Don't swallow nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you allergic to any medications, or have you had any bad reactions to medicines in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I recollect. I've taken a bit of everything over the years for colds and such, but never had no trouble. My mama always said I had a strong stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, Ms. Steines, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your pulse and take your blood pressure again, just to confirm the pharmacy's reading. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Go right ahead. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. I got a peach pie needin' to cool.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing sounds are clear, heart sounds are regular. Pulse is a little strong, as you might expect. Now, let's check that blood pressure. Alright, it’s 152/88 on this side. A little elevated, consistent with the pharmacy’s reading. I'm also going to listen to the arteries in your neck, just to check for any unusual sounds. Sounds are clear there as well.
PATIENT: Well, that don't sound too good, does it? Is that somethin' serious, Doctor? I'm not one for fussin' over every little thing, but I'd like to know what's goin' on.
DOCTOR: It's not an emergency right this moment, Ms. Steines, but it is something we need to address. High blood pressure, if left untreated, can increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney problems. However, it's very manageable with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. Given your age and that this is a new finding, I'd like to run a few simple blood tests to check your kidney function and rule out any other potential causes for your elevated pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? I don't much like needles. But... if it'll tell you what's goin' on, I reckon I can handle it. Just don't poke me too much, alright? And what kind of lifestyle changes are we talkin' about? I already mostly take it easy.
DOCTOR: We'll just need a small vial of blood, Ms. Steines, and the phlebotomist is very good. It will be quick. As for lifestyle changes, we're talking about things like reducing your salt intake, eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and getting some gentle exercise, even just a short walk each day if you're able. We can discuss all of this in more detail, and I'll have a nurse print out some helpful information for you. For now, let’s get those blood tests done. I’ll also want to do an EKG, just to check the electrical activity of your heart. That's quick and painless, too – just some stickers on your chest. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Stickers, alright. I can handle stickers. Salt... I do like a good salted tomato. And walkin'... I used to walk a lot, when my husband was still around. But these old knees ain't what they used to be. Still, I reckon I can try. Just gettin' older is the hardest part, Doctor. Everything starts achin'. But go ahead and do the tests. Let's see what they say. And then we can talk about tomatoes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood and get you set up for the EKG. It's good you're willing to try. We’ll take it one step at a time. After we have the results, we can discuss a plan that works for you, tomatoes included. Nurse Emily, could you please come in and assist Ms. Steines with the blood draw and EKG?
