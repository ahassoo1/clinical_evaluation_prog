DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I'm Dr. Soodeen. Welcome to the clinic. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. I have… pain. It’s been… troublesome. I want to get it sorted, if possible. I don’t have much time today, if you don’t mind a quick visit.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll do our best to be efficient. “Troublesome pain” is a bit broad, though. Could you tell me more about it?
PATIENT: It’s in my back. Lower back, mostly. It started… well, I believe it was around the middle of June. I was putting up fence, you see. My work. It aches constantly, but gets much worse when I bend or lift anything. Even twisting is bad. It feels like… a sharp pull, sometimes. Other times it’s just a dull, heavy ache. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, the pain began around mid-June, coinciding with fence work. Constant ache, exacerbated by bending, lifting, and twisting, with sharp, pulling sensations at times. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Right now… it’s not as bad as it gets. I'd say… a four. Maybe a five on a bad day when I've been working. It’s always there, though. A constant four. It doesn’t go away completely, even when I'm resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant four, peaking at five with activity. And it doesn’t fully subside with rest. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain at all?
PATIENT: Not really. Sitting sometimes helps a little, but even that gets uncomfortable after a while. Honestly, nothing seems to make it better for long. I tried some of those heating pads, but they didn't do much. Ibuprofen helps take the edge off, but I don’t want to be taking pills all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. Relying on medication long-term isn’t ideal. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No numbness, no tingling, and my legs feel… normal. I can walk fine. I can stand for a reasonable amount of time. It’s just the pain in my back. That’s the problem. I need to be able to work. That's my living.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And I understand your concern about being able to continue working. Let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis or any other back problems before?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't been to a doctor regularly in… a long time. I had a bad fall when I was younger, broke my arm, but nothing with my back. My husband… he always took care of things. After he passed… well, I haven’t really needed to go to the doctor much until now. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good information to have. Thank you for sharing that. And I’m sorry to hear about your husband. Now, are you currently taking any medications, aside from the ibuprofen you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen, when I need it. Maybe a couple of times a week, if I’ve had a hard day. Nothing else. I don’t like taking pills. I try to avoid them whenever possible. I’ve always been a healthy person, until this back started acting up.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed. No other medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of. I can eat anything. I haven't had any reactions to anything. I'm quite plain in my eating habits, actually. Mostly just simple food. Nothing fancy. I'm very… straightforward, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll check your range of motion, feel your back, and do a few simple neurological tests just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have fence to finish. But yes, go ahead. I want to know what’s causing this pain. I just… I don’t have a lot of time today.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll keep it concise. If you could just lie down on the examination table, that would be great. First, I'm going to gently palpate your lower back to check for tenderness or muscle spasms. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay… and does this feel tender here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right there. That's… that’s where it hurts the most. A little to the left of the spine. It’s a sharp pain, not just a dull ache. Be careful, please. It’s quite sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, noted. Tenderness to palpation left of the spine. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. Could you try bending forward and touching your toes?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. I can’t quite reach my toes. It pulls in my back. It feels like something is… locked up. I can go this far, but it’s very uncomfortable. It’s worse now, honestly. Just bending like that makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see. And now, could you try bending backwards, just as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: No. That’s… no. It hurts too much. It feels like it will go out. I can’t do that. It’s too painful. Honestly, Doctor, I don't think I can do much bending. It just makes things worse. I need to get back to work. This is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Reihner. We don’t want to exacerbate the pain. Let’s stop there for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam – tenderness to palpation left of the spine, limited range of motion, and the pain aggravated by bending – it sounds like you may have a muscle strain or a possible disc issue. However, to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… alright. If it will help find out what’s going on. But how long will that take? I need to know if I can go back to work, or if I need to… take time off. That’s my biggest concern. Time is money, Doctor. I’m a fence erector, not a patient. But yes, do the X-ray. Just… please be quick. And tell me what it shows as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. The X-ray itself will only take a few minutes. The radiologist will need time to interpret the results, but I’ll do my best to get them back to you as quickly as possible – I’m hoping within a few hours. We have a radiologist on site, which helps. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. We can also discuss a short course of muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory medication to help manage the pain while we wait for the results. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Muscle relaxants… I don’t know. I don’t like taking pills, you know. But… if it will help me get back to work faster, maybe. But just a short course, Doctor. And I need to know what the side effects are. I can't afford to be… out of it. And the anti-inflammatory… ibuprofen is enough, usually. But if you think it’s necessary… fine. Just… let’s get this X-ray done. And then tell me what it shows. I have fences to build.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We will proceed cautiously. I'll order the X-ray, and we can discuss the options for medication after we have the results. I will explain all potential side effects before we start anything. Could you please escort Ms. Reihner to the X-ray department?
PATIENT: Thank you. Let’s get this over with.
