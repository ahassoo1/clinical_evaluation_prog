DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seein’ me. It’s… well, it’s my waterin’ problem, I guess. I just… can’t get it all out when I go to the bathroom. It’s been happenin’ for a little while now, and it’s… botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re having some difficulty completely emptying your bladder when you urinate. And you said this has been going on for a little while?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. A little while. Maybe… a month or so? It comes and goes, but lately it’s been more often than not. It don’t hurt, not really. Just… feels like there’s always a little left in there. Makes me gotta go back again pretty soon after, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it’s been about a month, and it’s becoming more frequent. No pain, just a feeling of incomplete emptying, and you find yourself needing to return to the bathroom soon after you’ve already been. That's helpful to know. Let me just take a quick look at your records here… Okay, I see you’ve had a few routine check-ups with Dr. Olsen. Nothing major flagged here. Do you have any other symptoms along with this—any difficulty starting to urinate, or any pain or burning when you do go?
PATIENT: No pain or burnin’, no sir. Startin’ it ain’t a problem. Comes right away, usually. Just… don’t feel like it all comes out. Like somethin’s holdin’ it back. It’s… a strange feelin’. I ain’t had this problem before, not like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, no difficulty starting, just the sensation of incomplete emptying. And you’re right, that is a strange feeling. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about how often you’re urinating during the day, and how many times you might be getting up at night to go?
PATIENT: Well, durin’ the day… I’d say about every three, maybe four hours. Depends. If I’m drinkin’ a lot of water, more often. But at night… that’s where it’s botherin’ me. I’m gettin’ up… two, sometimes three times a night. Used to be I slept right through, now I gotta get up and go. Wakes me up. It’s… old man stuff, I reckon. But it’s wearin’ me down.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound like “old man stuff” to me, Mr. Hilber, it sounds like something we should definitely look into. Getting up two or three times a night is disruptive, and it’s good you’re not just accepting it. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself—color, smell, anything unusual like blood?
PATIENT: No sir, nothin’ like that. Color’s… well, the usual color. Smell’s normal, too, as far as I can tell. Ain’t seen no blood or anything like that. Just… the waterin’ problem. I drink plenty of water, try to stay hydrated. My wife used to make sure I drank enough, and I kinda stuck with it after she… well, after she passed. It's just this feelin' afterwards, like there's still somethin' left. It's a worry, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re staying hydrated, and I’m sorry to hear about your wife. It's completely understandable to be worried when something changes with your body. Okay. Just a couple more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Do you have any history of diabetes, or any prostate problems that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No diabetes, no sir. Doctor Olsen checked me for that regular. And no, I don’t know nothin’ about prostate problems. Never been told I had any. I work mostly with my hands, makin' shoes. Don’t do a whole lot of heavy liftin’. Just… steady work, you know? And plenty of water. I’m fine with you lookin’ at me, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just want to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No history of diabetes or prostate problems, and you do steady work. That’s all helpful information. Okay, Mr. Hilber. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’m just going to do a quick exam of your prostate. It’s a relatively quick and painless exam, but it can be a little uncomfortable. Just let me know if anything feels too uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. I reckon a little discomfort ain’t nothin’ compared to gettin’ this figured out. Just… let me know what you’re doin’, if you could. I ain’t real fond of surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, just feeling your abdomen… everything feels normal here. No tenderness, no masses. Now, I’m just going to do a quick digital rectal exam to check your prostate. I’ll be wearing a glove, and it will only take a moment. Just relax as much as you can. Okay... Prostate feels… slightly enlarged, but not significantly. It’s also smooth, no nodules or areas of tenderness that I can detect. Tone feels normal. There's some resistance, which could explain the feeling of incomplete emptying. Okay, all done. It’s important to remember these are just initial findings.
PATIENT: Alright. Slightly enlarged, you say? Resistance… that makes sense, I reckon. So that’s why I can’t get it all out. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? And… what do we do about it? I’m hopin’ it ain’t nothin’ that needs cuttin’ or somethin’. I ain’t the best with surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. An enlarged prostate, which we call benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, is very common as men get older. It’s not cancer, and it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need surgery. The enlargement can put pressure on your urethra, making it difficult to urinate completely. That resistance I felt likely explains your symptoms. We have several options we can explore. We could start with some lifestyle changes, like timed voiding—going to the bathroom on a schedule—and limiting fluids before bed. We can also consider medication to help relax the muscles in your prostate and make it easier to urinate. There are surgical options if those don’t work, but we’ll start with the least invasive treatments first. Before we decide on a plan, I’d like to order a urine analysis to rule out any infection, and a PSA blood test to check your prostate-specific antigen levels. That will give us a more complete picture and help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay… not cancer, that’s good. Timed voidin’ and less water at night… I can do that, I reckon. Medication… I ain’t real fond of takin’ pills if I can avoid it, but if it helps… A urine analysis and a blood test… yeah, that sounds sensible. Better to be sure, right? So, what do I gotta do for those tests? Do I gotta come back here, or can I get ‘em done somewhere else? And… how long does it take to get the results? I’m hopin’ it don’t take too long. I’d like to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, better to be sure. You can get both tests done right here at the clinic, Mr. Hilber. I’ll give you a lab slip for each one. The urine analysis just requires a sample, and the blood test is a simple draw. The results usually take about three to five business days to come back. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and decide on a treatment plan. In the meantime, you can start with the timed voiding and limiting fluids before bed. And if you notice any fever, chills, or significant pain, please call us immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Three to five days… that ain’t too bad. I can manage that. Timed voidin' and less water... I'll give it a try. No, I reckon that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for explainin' everything so clear. And for not makin’ a fuss about it. I appreciate that. It’s a worry, havin’ somethin’ like this happen, but you put my mind at ease a bit. I’ll see you when the results are back. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your next appointment. Take care now, and I'll see you soon.
