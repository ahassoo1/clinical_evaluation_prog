DOCTOR: Hello Odell, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. Yes, nice to meet you too, Doctor... Kamahele, right? I… I need to go somewhere. Far somewhere. For work. They said I need to... check things? Make sure I don’t get sick. That's it. I think. It's a long trip, lots of flying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a check-up before a long work trip… that makes sense. It’s good to be prepared. “Check things” – alright. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, if you don’t mind. When you say “check things,” are you thinking about any particular concerns?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. Not really. Just… don't want to get sick there. It’s… different. My wife, she… she got sick on a trip, once. A long time ago. Not a good place. So… just make sure I don’t get sick. Is that enough? I don’t… I don’t know what they check for, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Odell. It’s always best to be cautious, especially after someone you care about has had a difficult experience. We can do a general health assessment to make sure you're fit for travel. It sounds like you're concerned about infections or illnesses you might encounter in a different part of the world. To get started, let's go through some questions. Do you have any current symptoms – anything at all that’s bothering you right now?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Uh… no. Nothing. I feel… okay. Tired, maybe. Work is hard. Lots of lifting. But not sick sick. Just… normal tired. You know? Like after a long day. I don't have fever or… what do you call it… the cough? No. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, just normal tiredness from work, that’s good. No fever, no cough. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently – either gained or lost?
PATIENT: Weight? Hmm… I don't really check. I eat, I work. Maybe a little less now, I don't have… much appetite. My wife, she always cooked good food. I mostly eat… simple things now. Not much difference, I guess. I’m… small. Always been small.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant weight changes. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma?
PATIENT: Asthma? No. No asthma. My wife… she had problems with her heart, a long time ago. But me? No. Healthy. Always been healthy. Except… the wife, of course. Not healthy at the end. I don't... I don't like talking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. You don't need to share anything you're not comfortable with. Just knowing that you haven't had any prior medical diagnoses is helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I work with my hands, Doctor. Can’t have surgeries. Breaks them. No. Never been inside a hospital, except… for her. At the end.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That's good to know. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Family… my parents… they both… gone now. Long ago. I don't really… remember much about their health. Village people, you know? They worked hard, ate simple things. Got sick… and then… gone. No doctors. Just… gone. I don't think… they had fancy diseases.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you don’t have much information about their medical history. That's perfectly alright. Let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. My wife… she didn't like it. Alcohol… sometimes. A little. With dinner. Just… sometimes. To remember. Not much now. Drugs? No. Never. Village people, Doctor. We work. We don't… do those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so very occasional alcohol use, but no smoking or drugs. That’s helpful to know. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… no. I don’t think so. I eat everything. Rice, vegetables, meat… Never had a problem. I don’t take any medicines. Just… some pain pills, sometimes. When my back hurts from work. But no… allergies. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good overview, Odell. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? What… what will you do? I don't like… being touched. Especially not by strangers. Is it… necessary? I just need… the check. For the trip.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Odell. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The exam is quite brief – I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears and throat, and feel your abdomen. It's just to make sure everything is functioning as it should before your trip, and to rule out anything obvious that might cause problems. It is necessary to ensure your safety while traveling, especially with the potential for different environments and exposures. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. We can take it very slowly. Would you like me to start with your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… is that quick? Just… the cuff? I don’t like… tight things. My wife… she didn't like tight things either. But… okay. Quick, you said? Yes. Just quick. And explain… explain everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, just quick. I’m going to wrap this cuff around your arm. It will inflate briefly and squeeze, but only for a moment. It measures the pressure of your blood as it flows through your arteries. I’ll read the numbers, and then it will deflate automatically. Here we go… just relax your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is 118/72. That’s within a normal range. Good. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It doesn’t hurt at all, I’m just listening for any unusual sounds. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Sounds? What kind of sounds? Like… broken things? My wife… her heart made funny sounds at the end. I don't like… hearing those sounds. But… okay. Quickly. Just listen… and quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, just listening now. Deep breaths… that’s good. Your heart sounds are regular and normal. I don’t hear any unusual noises. Your lungs sound clear as well. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat with a light. This helps me check for any signs of infection. It’s very quick, I promise. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Infection? Like… catching something? From the air? My wife… she caught something on a trip, once. A bad cough. A fever. I don't like… getting sick. Quickly. Just… look. Quickly. And don't… don’t touch too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, just looking now. Your ears and throat look clear. No signs of infection. Everything looks good so far, Odell. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen, just to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. This doesn't hurt, I'm just feeling for anything unusual. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Abdomen? Like… poking? No poking! My wife… the doctors poked her a lot at the end. I don't like poking. Just… looking is okay. Feeling… no. No feeling. Quickly. Just say it’s okay, and I can go? I need to go. For the trip.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell, you're right. We can skip the abdominal exam. You’re in control here. Based on what we’ve done, and the information you’ve given me, everything sounds good. You don’t currently have any symptoms that would prevent you from traveling. I recommend you stay hydrated while traveling, and be mindful of food safety. If you experience any fever, cough, or other unusual symptoms during your trip, please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… make sure I can go. For the trip. And… thank you. For not poking. Is there… is there anything I need to take? Pills? A paper? Something?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Odell. And yes, you are clear to travel. I don’t think you need any pills at this time. However, I will give you a brief summary of our conversation to keep for your records, and a list of resources should you need medical care during your travels. It includes information about finding English-speaking doctors abroad, and what to do in case of an emergency. This also has some basic travel health tips, like staying hydrated and being careful with food and water. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Resources… okay. Thank you. No. I think… that's it. Just… the trip. I need to go. Thank you, Doctor Kamahele. For not poking.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Odell. You take care now, and have a safe trip. If anything comes up, don’t hesitate to seek help. And remember, you did a good job coming in for a check-up. Don’t worry too much. And enjoy your trip. .
