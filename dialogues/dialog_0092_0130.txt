DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s good to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest… it’s my family. Lots of… problems. My mother, she… she had bad heart, and my brother, he had… something with his mind. I just want to be sure I’m okay, you know? I don’t want the same thing to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It’s very thoughtful of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart problems and other concerns. It's good you're thinking about this. Let’s take a bit of time to go over everything. To start, could you tell me a little more about your mother’s heart condition?
PATIENT: Hmm… she always tired. Very tired. And her legs… they swell up. Big legs. Doctor told her it was… water. She had to take pills for the water. And then… then she just… stopped. One day she just couldn’t breathe, and that was it. I was maybe… ten years old? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schwer. That sounds very difficult for you as a child. And I appreciate you remembering as much detail as you do. It sounds like your mother likely had congestive heart failure. Now, you mentioned your brother. Could you tell me a little more about the “something with his mind”?
PATIENT: Oh… that was… hard too. He… he started to see things. Not real things. He would talk to people who weren't there. And he got… angry. Very angry, for no reason. He ended up… in a hospital. A special hospital. He… he wasn’t the same after that. I don’t really know what it was, the doctors didn't explain much to me. It was… scary.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. That sounds very distressing for you and your family. It sounds like your brother may have been experiencing symptoms of a mental health condition, possibly psychosis. It's unfortunate the doctors didn't provide a clearer explanation at the time. Let’s shift focus to you now. Have you ever experienced anything similar to what your mother or brother went through?
PATIENT: No. No, I haven’t. I get tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, right? And I… I worry. I worry a lot, but that’s just me. I’ve always been a worrier. Nothing like… seeing things, or getting angry. No, I’m… I think I’m okay. But that’s why I’m here, you know? To make sure.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Schwer. It’s good you’re not experiencing those symptoms, and it’s very wise to want to confirm that everything is alright. Let's do a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I eat everything. Always have. Never had a problem. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, the doctor gave it to me a few years ago. But that’s it. Just that one pill. I can’t remember what it’s called.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication. We can look that up in the system shortly. And have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a kid. Fell out of a tree. And I had my appendix out when I was young. That was… painful. But that was a long time ago. Nothing else, I don’t think. No serious… anything. Just the usual colds and flu.
DOCTOR: Alright, a broken arm and an appendectomy – thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoked. Never liked it. And I drink… sometimes. A little beer with dinner, maybe. Not much. And no… nothing else. I don’t like those things. I work hard, and I want to be clear-headed, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Schwer. That's good to hear. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: I sell things. Wholesale. To stores. I travel around… mostly nearby. It’s… okay. Long hours, sometimes. It’s a lot of driving, a lot of talking. Not very exciting, but it pays the bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, wholesale sales, some travel involved. That gives me a good sense of your lifestyle. Now, let's do a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just want to make sure everything is okay, like we said.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. Relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your history. Your heart sounds regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s quiet, so it may not be anything, but we should keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear and open. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I also noticed you seem a little thin. What would you say your usual weight has been?
PATIENT: Oh… the weight. Yes, I know. I used to be… bigger. But I lost a lot of weight last year. Just… didn’t have much appetite, I guess. And things were… stressful. I’m usually around 150, maybe 155. But now… I don’t know. Maybe 135? I haven’t weighed myself in a while.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schwer. That’s helpful information. Given your weight loss, slightly elevated blood pressure, and the murmur I heard, I’d like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, thyroid levels, and cholesterol. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know if I’m okay. If you need to poke me, poke me. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve ordered the blood work for you. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be expecting you. They'll need your insurance card and a photo ID. It will probably take about 15-20 minutes. After that, we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, not really. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I… I just hope everything is okay. I worry about ending up like my mother and brother. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It’s perfectly normal to worry, especially with your family history. We’re going to do everything we can to get a clear picture of your health and address any potential issues. Remember, knowledge is power, and being proactive is the best thing you can do. Once we have the blood work results, we'll discuss them thoroughly and develop a plan that’s right for you. Do you know where the lab is located?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I just got here.
DOCTOR: It’s right down that hallway, the second door on the left. The receptionist at the lab will help you with the paperwork. Feel free to ask them any questions you may have. They’ll let me know once you're finished, and we can go over the results together. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you listening to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns while you’re waiting. Take your time, and we’ll see you shortly.
