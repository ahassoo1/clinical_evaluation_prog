DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Be concise, if you would. My schedule is rather…full.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Mutnick. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve noticed I’ve been gaining weight, and I haven’t changed my eating habits or exercise routine. It’s… perplexing, and frankly, a little worrying. It’s been happening for about three months now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Perplexing, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that is precisely the word. I eat the same things, walk the same distance with my husband every evening… nothing different. And yet, the scale keeps going up. It's about ten pounds, I think, perhaps a little more. It’s just…unexpected.
DOCTOR: Ten pounds over three months… while maintaining your usual regimen. I see. And you are certain there have been no changes to your diet?
PATIENT: Quite certain, Doctor. Perhaps a small biscuit with tea more often than before, but nothing substantial. My husband and I generally have the same meals, and he has not gained any weight at all. It really is quite baffling. I keep thinking I'm misreading the scale, but I've checked it multiple times.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s not dwell on the scale. We need to establish a baseline. Now, tell me, Ms. Selbitschka, have you experienced any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. No, not really. I sleep alright, though perhaps not as deeply as before. And I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I attributed that to the summer heat. Oh! And my hands feel a bit cold sometimes, even when it’s warm. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: "A bit cold"?
PATIENT: Yes, just… colder than usual. Not painfully so, but noticeable. They feel chilled even when my husband and I are sitting in the sunroom, for instance. It’s not constant, but it happens several times a week, I’d say. It’s… difficult to explain. A sort of clammy coldness, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any…irregularities in your menstrual cycle, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Doctor Mutnick, if you don’t mind me saying, that feels… a rather personal question. I haven’t had a menstrual cycle in several years. I am past that stage of life, you see. I am…menopaused, if that is the correct term.
DOCTOR: Of course. My apologies. A simple oversight. Now, let's move on. Have you noticed any changes in your skin or hair recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing noticeable, Doctor. My hair is the same, perhaps a little thinner with age, as one would expect. And my skin… well, it's aging, naturally. A few more wrinkles, perhaps, but nothing dramatic. I haven’t noticed any rashes, dryness, or anything unusual like that. I use the same creams I always have. Is this all relevant, Doctor? I feel as though we are circling around the problem without getting anywhere.
DOCTOR: Ms. Selbitschka, with all due respect, medical history is rarely a direct line. Now, regarding your family…are there any instances of thyroid issues, diabetes, or unexplained weight gain in your immediate family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother… she had a goitre, I believe. A swelling in her neck. I was quite young at the time, so I don’t recall the details. She had surgery for it, many years ago. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, had what they called “sugar sickness,” I assume that was diabetes. No one else that I can recall experienced unexplained weight gain, though. Is a goitre related to this thyroid issue you are thinking of? I always meant to ask her about it, but…well, life gets in the way.
DOCTOR: Very well. It appears we have enough information, for now. I'm going to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I will need to listen to your heart and lungs and palpate your thyroid gland. And please, try to relax.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. I will do my best to relax. Though I confess, I am always a little anxious at the doctor’s office. It's nothing specific, just…a general unease.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds…regular, though a bit rapid. Lungs are clear. Thyroid…slightly enlarged, but no palpable nodules. Skin is cool to the touch. I am noting a slight edema in your lower extremities. Weight…confirmed at 83 kilograms. Now, I'm going to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. This will help us determine the underlying cause of your weight gain and other symptoms.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. Will I need to fast before the blood work? And where will I go to have it done? Is there anything specific I should avoid beforehand, like strenuous exercise? I always worry about doing something wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for twelve hours prior to the blood draw. No food or beverages, aside from water. And, yes, avoid strenuous exercise the day before. As for where... the lab is just down the hall, room 204. The receptionist will provide you with the necessary paperwork. Frankly, Ms. Selbitschka, it's rather basic procedure. We’ll review the results in approximately one week. Unless anything urgent arises, of course. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Twelve hours fasting, no strenuous exercise, lab room 204. I will make a note of that immediately. Thank you for your time and attention, Doctor Mutnick. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns, despite my… rambling. I hope we can find an answer soon. I'm growing increasingly worried about this unexplained weight gain. .
