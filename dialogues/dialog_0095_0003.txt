DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let's just get on with it. It’s this…shaking. In my hands, mostly. It’s been going on for a while now, and it’s getting…annoying. Honestly, it's probably nothing. My wife always said I worried too much. She’d know, she was a practical woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, I understand you want to be brief. We can certainly try to be efficient. This shaking in your hands... when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice it? That’s a…difficult question. A long time ago, I suppose. Years. Maybe…five, six years? It started small, just a little tremble when I was holding something. Now it’s…more noticeable. I can’t quite…pinpoint a date, if that’s what you’re asking. Things just…fade, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s common for things to be gradual. So, it's been present for about five or six years and has slowly worsened. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I’m trying to do something…precise. Like, uh…holding a fork. Or writing. Though I haven’t written anything proper in ages. Used to be a director, you see. Lots of pointing, lots of…gesturing. Didn’t bother me then. It's just now, when I want to be steady, that it bothers me. And it's embarrassing, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more noticeable with tasks requiring fine motor skills, and it’s been causing you some embarrassment. Does anything specific seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm. Well, stress, probably. Though what doesn’t cause stress these days? And…caffeine. I used to drink a lot of coffee, back in the old days. Though I’ve cut back. Not much point in shaking more, is there? Honestly, Doctor, I doubt it's anything serious. Old age, probably. Things just…wear out.
DOCTOR: Alright, stress and caffeine seem to be factors. And you suspect it’s simply related to aging. I appreciate your input. Do you have any other symptoms – any weakness, numbness, changes in your balance, or any difficulty with walking?
PATIENT: Walking? No, I walk just fine. A little slower than I used to, maybe. But who doesn't slow down? Weakness…no, I don’t think so. I can still manage. Numbness…sometimes my fingers feel a little…tingly. But that could just be the circulation. I sit a lot, you know? Bad for the blood flow. Look, are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I've got a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. Tingling in the fingers is good to know. It helps us build a picture. Now, just to cover some basics, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had…high blood pressure, years ago. They gave me a pill for it. Took it for a while, then stopped. Seemed to sort itself out. And arthritis, I suppose. A little in my knees. Nothing major. Honestly, Doctor, I haven't been to a doctor in…well, a very long time. I always thought fresh air and a strong constitution were the best medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure in the past and some arthritis. And you haven't been to a doctor regularly. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just…a little something for my knees, sometimes. Ibuprofen, I think. When they’re really bothering me. And…a multivitamin. My daughter makes me take it. She worries, just like her mother. But really, that’s it. I don’t believe in loading up on pills. It just complicates things.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for your knees and a multivitamin. Now, just one more quick set of questions – any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. My wife tried to get me to eat more fruits and vegetables, said I was too much of a meat-and-potatoes man. Never had a reaction, though. I’m a pretty sturdy fellow. Look, Doctor, are we done now? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Baide, I think I have a good starting point. Given your history and what you've described, this shaking could be a number of things. It could be essential tremor, which is common and often hereditary. It could also be related to your previous high blood pressure, or even just age-related changes. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your reflexes, coordination, and look for any other signs that might help us figure out what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. An exam? Really? Look, I told you, it's probably nothing. Just old age. But fine, get it over with. Quickly, though. I haven't got all day. I'm a busy man, even at my age. And don’t poke around too much, alright? I don't like being fussed over.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please extend your arms out in front of you, palms up. I'm seeing a tremor in both hands, more pronounced on this side . Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, and your coordination is generally good. Now, can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Ugh. Alright, alright. . There. Happy now? It’s…a little wobbly, standing up. But I manage. Always have. Just…take it easy, alright? I don’t want to fall and break anything. My daughter would never let me hear the end of it. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide, I understand your concerns. I'm just completing the exam to be thorough. Your stance is a little wider than usual, and your gait is slightly slower, but again, this could be related to age. Now, to be sure, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests. They can help rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the tremor. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Now you’re just trying to make money off me! Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. I told you, it's just old age. But…fine. Do your blood tests. Get it over with. But I expect a quick turnaround. I don’t want to be coming back here repeatedly. And no poking around too much, alright? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration. The blood tests are simply a precaution to rule out anything serious. We’ll order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. It shouldn't take more than a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend trying to reduce your caffeine intake further, if possible. And I’ll write a referral for a neurology consultation. A neurologist is a specialist in conditions affecting the nervous system and can provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Goodness gracious. Now you’re sending me to another doctor? This is getting out of hand. Look, Doctor, I’m an old man. I don’t want a lot of tests and consultations. I just want to know if I’m going to fall over and break my hip! But fine. Do whatever you think you need to do. But I expect a clear explanation of everything. And quickly, alright? I haven’t got all day. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I understand your concerns and will ensure you receive clear explanations. We'll proceed with the blood tests and neurology referral. The blood work will help rule out some common causes, and the neurologist can do more specialized testing if needed. I'll have the lab results sent to you directly, and the neurologist’s office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Here is a referral for Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
