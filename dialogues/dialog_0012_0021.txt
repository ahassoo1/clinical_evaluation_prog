DOCTOR: Hi Ricky, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, tell me – what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. This foot… …it’s been botherin’ me somethin’ awful. It's gotten real puffy, especially the ankle part. Been like this for…oh, maybe three, four days now?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. So, the swelling is mostly in your ankle, and it started about three or four days ago. Can you tell me a little more about what you were doing when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I don’t rightly remember doin' anything special. Just…normal stuff, you know? I work at the loan office, sittin' most of the day. I walked to the store on Tuesday, but that’s a pretty easy walk. Not like I twisted it or anything. It just…started feelin’ tight and then got bigger and bigger. I did stand a little longer than usual helpin’ Mrs. Abernathy with her application…she’s a bit slow with the forms. But that was Wednesday, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to have come on gradually, and maybe worsened a bit after being on your feet a little longer on Wednesday. Is it painful?
PATIENT: Yeah, it hurts. Not like a sharp pain, more of a… ache. And it's tender to the touch. If I press right here… see? It’s not terrible all the time, but when I walk on it, especially in the mornin', it’s real uncomfortable. And it feels kinda warm, too. Not fever warm, but… warmer than my other foot, for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s an ache, tender to the touch, and warmer than your other foot, especially worse in the morning. Have you noticed any redness or changes in the color of your skin around the ankle?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… … yeah, there’s a little bit. It's not bright red, more like… a dusky color. Kinda purplish, maybe? Hard to tell with my skin tone, you know. It's definitely not the same color as my other ankle. And it feels a little…smooth, if that makes sense. Not rough or bumpy.
DOCTOR: Okay, dusky color, and smooth skin. Have you had any injuries to this foot or ankle in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think real hard. Not that I recall. I sprained my wrist bad when I was younger, workin' at the cannery, but that was years and years ago. This foot… no, nothin’ I remember. I've always been pretty careful with my feet, you know? Gotta walk to work and all. No falls, no twists… just this puffiness outta nowhere.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a fuller picture, have you been experiencing any other symptoms like fever, chills, or any pain in other joints?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. Not a bit. And my other joints feel fine. Knees are okay, wrists are okay… everything else is workin’ as it should, thank goodness. I've been feelin' a little tired lately, but that's just from workin' long hours, I figure. Old age creepin' up, maybe!
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or other joint pain, just some general fatigue. I'd like to take a look at your foot and ankle now, if that’s alright with you. I’ll need you to lie back on the exam table. Can you tell me if you have any allergies to medications or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine, go ahead. Allergies… let me see… Nope, nothin’ I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’, thankfully. I take a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, but that’s all. And it doesn’t bother me none. No bee stings, no poison ivy… clean bill of health, allergy-wise!
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. I'm going to feel around a bit, and then I'll check how easily you can move your foot up and down and side to side. It might be a little uncomfortable, but let me know if anything is too painful. Okay… I’m noticing some swelling around the medial malleolus – that's the bony bump on the inside of your ankle. There is some tenderness to the touch here, as you mentioned. And when I move your foot, there’s a little bit of discomfort, particularly with dorsiflexion - pointing your toes up. I don’t feel any significant warmth beyond what you described, and I don’t see any open wounds or signs of infection. Your pulses feel normal.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds about right. The inside part is the worst part, definitely. And pointin' my toes up… yeah, that’s not too fun. I just thought I was gettin’ old and stiff, you know? So, what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? I gotta get back to work tomorrow, and I can't be off my feet for too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it’s likely you have a sprain or strain of the ligaments around your ankle. The swelling, tenderness, and limited range of motion are consistent with that. The dusky color could indicate some slight bruising developing. It doesn’t sound like a fracture, but to be certain, and to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to get an X-ray of your ankle. That’ll give us a clearer picture of the bones and rule out any hidden breaks. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… okay. That sounds… sensible. Better safe than sorry, right? I don’t like bein' poked and prodded, but if it'll tell you for sure what's goin' on, then yeah, let’s do it. Will it take long? I really gotta get back to work tomorrow. And… how much will it cost? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll get that ordered right away. It shouldn’t take too long – usually just a few minutes to get the images, and then a radiologist will read them, which usually takes about an hour or two. I understand your concern about the cost, and I know not having insurance can make things difficult. Let me check with the clinic about the cost of an X-ray for uninsured patients. I’ll also see if there are any financial assistance programs available. I can’t give you a precise number right now, but I’ll do my best to get you an estimate and explore any options to help with the cost. In the meantime, while we’re waiting for the X-ray results, I recommend resting your ankle as much as possible, applying ice for 20 minutes at a time several times a day, and keeping it elevated. That will help reduce the swelling and pain. We can discuss pain relief options once we have the X-ray results, as well. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Rest, ice, and elevate… yeah, I can do that. Mrs. Abernathy's son drives me to work, so I can put my feet up on the ride. And pain relief… well, I have some old ibuprofen at home, but I try not to take too much. Not good for the stomach, you know. Financial assistance… that would be a lifesaver, honestly. Thank you for lookin' into that. I really appreciate it. No, I think I understand everything you’ve said so far. Let’s get this X-ray done, and see what it shows. Where do we go?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'll have a technician come in and take you to the X-ray room. It's just down the hall. They’ll position your foot and take a few images. It doesn't hurt at all. Once they’re done, they'll send the images to the radiologist, and I’ll let you know the results as soon as they’re available. I’ll also speak with our billing department about financial assistance options while you’re getting the X-ray done. Just relax, and we’ll get this sorted out. Do you think you'll be able to stay here for about an hour or so to wait for the results?
PATIENT: Yeah, an hour should be fine. I brought a book with me, figured I’d have some waitin' to do. Hopefully it won’t be too long. It’s just… I hate bein’ off my feet. Gotta keep movin’, you know? But I appreciate you lookin’ after me, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease. Let me know when I need to go do the X-ray thing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. It’s good to be proactive, and staying busy is important. Okay, here's Sarah. She'll take you to the X-ray room now. It shouldn’t take long. I’ll be right here when you get back, and we’ll go over the results as soon as they're available. Sarah, can you please let me know when Ricky is finished with the X-ray?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you both. Nice to meet you, Sarah. Let’s get this over with then, shall we?
