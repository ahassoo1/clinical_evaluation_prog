DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m Dr. Paulino. Now, you’re ninety years old, which is… remarkable. But, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Pavlovic… yes, that’s right. It’s this cough, see? Been botherin’ me for… well, a long time now. A dry cough. Not much else, just… dry. Hard to say how long, exactly. Everything kinda blurs together after a while, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “A long time” is… not particularly helpful for a medical history, unfortunately. But we’ll try to clarify. So, a dry cough. Has it been getting worse recently, or has it been pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Consistent, I think. Maybe a little worse when the weather changes. Cold air seems to set it off. Not… not a bad cough, really. Just… persistent. Like a tickle in my throat that won't go away. I mostly just ignore it, to be honest. Always have. My wife used to tell me to get it checked, but… she’s gone now.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, even if it’s been something you’ve lived with for a long time, it's still worth investigating, Mr. Pavlovic. Ignoring things doesn’t make them disappear, unfortunately. Has the cough ever produced any phlegm, even a little?
PATIENT: Phlegm… hmm. I don’t think so. No, not that I recall. Just… dry. Sometimes it makes my chest a little tight, but no… no spitting anything up. It's a strange cough, really. I've had plenty of coughs in my life, but this one’s different. I worked with cars for so long, you know? Maybe somethin’ from the shop? I don’t rightly know.
DOCTOR: Working with cars… that could be a factor, yes. We’ll have to consider occupational exposures. Alright. Do you experience any shortness of breath, Mr. Pavlovic?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. Not unless I’m climbin’ a hill, maybe. I don’t do much climbin’ these days. Mostly just sit and watch the birds. No, I can walk around the house fine. Walk to the garden… Everything feels a little slower, of course. Ninety years will do that to ya. But no, no trouble breathin’ usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you experiencing any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I’ve noticed. I don’t usually check my temperature. Chills… sometimes I feel a little cold, but that’s just the old bones, I reckon. Night sweats… no, can’t say that’s happened. Weight loss… maybe a little? My wife always said I was too skinny, even with a good appetite. But I haven’t been weighin’ myself lately. Everything’s a bit of a blur, you see?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – heart problems, lung disease, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re askin’ things… I had somethin’ with my heart, a long time ago. Not bad enough to… to do much about. Just told me to take it easy. Dr. Henderson, that was. He’s… gone now too. I don’t remember the name of what it was, exactly. Just… somethin’ with the heart. And I think… maybe a touch of the sugar sickness when I was younger, but they said it went away. That was… a long time ago. It's all so long ago...
DOCTOR: Alright. “Something with the heart” and a possible history of diabetes. Not ideal, but we'll work with what we have. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That’s the only one I can recall. And… and my wife had me get a cataract removed from one eye a few years back. But that wasn't me havin’ surgery, was it? Just her. No, just the appendix. A long, long time ago. Small thing, really. Back when everything was simpler.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendix removed. And no other surgeries. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: No, not really. I used to take somethin’ for my blood pressure, but Dr. Henderson stopped it years ago. Said I didn't need it anymore. And… sometimes I take a little somethin' for my arthritis, when my joints are achin'. But that’s just over-the-counter stuff, you can get it at the drugstore. Nothing fancy. Mostly just try to get by without much medicine, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular prescription medications. Over-the-counter for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but my wife always said that was just a fondness for them, not an allergy. I used to eat everything. And… well, I don't recall ever havin’ a bad reaction to somethin'. I’ve always been pretty lucky, I suppose. A tough old bird. Though, come to think of it, my skin does get a little red when I’m out in the sun… but that’s just the sun, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Sensitivity to sunlight. Now, let's talk a little about your family history, if you don't mind. Were your parents or siblings afflicted with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're askin' about things I barely remember. My mother… she died young, from somethin' with her chest. A cough, maybe? It was a long time ago. My father… he lived a long life, but he had trouble with his legs when he got older. Couldn't walk so well. And I had a brother… he had trouble with his heart, like me. Died young too. Not a very healthy bunch, if I’m being honest. That's probably why I'm so… cautious about things now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mother – chest illness, possibly cough. Father – leg problems. Brother – heart trouble. Now, one final question about your background, Mr. Pavlovic. Have you ever smoked, or been exposed to significant amounts of dust or chemicals in your work or daily life?
PATIENT: Oh, now that I remember. Worked with cars for… well, for almost my whole life. Lots of dust, lots of fumes. Didn't wear a mask much back then, didn't think about it. And… I used to smoke a little, when I was younger. Not much, a few cigarettes a day. Quit a long time ago, though. Probably should have quit sooner. Everything seemed harmless back then, you know? You didn’t worry about these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Thank you for that information. It’s… a fairly complex history, as you might imagine. Now, I’m going to listen to your chest and take your blood pressure. Then, depending on what I hear, we may need to get a chest X-ray. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… try not to poke too hard, my ribs are a little creaky, you know? Everything’s gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Blood pressure is… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. And I do hear some… wheezing in your lower lungs, Mr. Pavlovic. Not alarming, but it's something we need to investigate further. I think an X-ray is a good idea. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on in your lungs. Would you be able to walk down the hall to radiology, or would you like me to arrange for someone to assist you?
PATIENT: Oh, wheezing, you say? That doesn't surprise me. Always had a bit of a tickle in my chest. I think I can walk down the hall. I'm a bit slow, but I can manage. No need to bother anyone. Just… tell me where to go, Doctor. And how long it will take, roughly. I don't like to be kept waitin' too long. Everything takes a little longer these days, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Radiology is just down the hall to your left. It’s the second door on the left. They’ll likely have you change into a gown. It shouldn't take more than fifteen to twenty minutes, including the wait. I'll have the nurse come get you when you're finished, and we can discuss the results. Try to take it easy, Mr. Pavlovic. And please, don’t hesitate to let the radiology staff know if you feel any discomfort. A little patience will be required, you understand. These things take time.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Patience. I understand. Fifteen to twenty minutes… I hope it doesn’t take much longer. My bones are gettin' tired.
