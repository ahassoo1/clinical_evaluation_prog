DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. I’m Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Good morning. Well, it’s… family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. Lots of… problems. Heart stuff, mostly. And cancer. It’s just… looming, you know? I want to make sure I’m not heading that way. Preventative, I guess. Though honestly, I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Which is… reassuring, but also doesn't really solve anything, does it?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very proactive of you to think about this now, especially with a family history of heart disease and cancer. Feeling fine is good, but it doesn’t necessarily mean there isn't something developing. We'll want to get a good picture of what specifically your mother and other relatives have experienced. Could you tell me a bit more about what kind of heart problems they had?
PATIENT: Right. Okay. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had, um… I think it was… congestive heart failure? Something like that. She was always tired, swelling in her legs. And my aunt, my mother’s sister… she had a stroke, a few years back. Not a massive one, thankfully, but still. She's… slower now. And then my uncle… he had bypass surgery, about ten years ago. A double bypass, I think. It was… a whole thing. I don't really know all the details, to be honest. My mother doesn’t like to talk about it. She finds it… upsetting. So, it's hard to get a clear picture. Does that… help? It’s mostly just a feeling of… inevitability, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Congestive heart failure, stroke, and a double bypass… that certainly paints a picture of a family predisposition to cardiovascular issues. It’s understandable your mother finds it difficult to discuss; it’s a lot to process. And what about cancer?
PATIENT: Right. Cancer… um. My great-aunt, on the same side, she had breast cancer. A long time ago, thankfully, and she… recovered, I think. She’s… very old now. And then my cousin… she had… leukemia, maybe? When she was a teenager. It was… bad. She… didn’t make it. That’s… the one that really worries me. Leukemia feels… random, you know? Like, it’s not something you can prevent with diet or exercise. It just… happens. The others, you can try to be healthy. But that… that feels like a lottery ticket. A bad one. I don’t want to sound… dramatic. It’s just… I keep thinking about it.
DOCTOR: You're not sounding dramatic at all, Blain. That’s a very understandable worry, especially with that family history. Leukemia can feel more unpredictable. It’s good you’re taking this seriously. Okay. To get a clearer picture, let’s talk about your health. Have you had any medical problems yourself?
PATIENT: Right. No, not really. I mean, the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, a few colds. But nothing major. I haven’t been hospitalized or anything. I had my appendix out when I was twelve, but that was… that was just an emergency. Aside from that… perfectly healthy. I try to eat well, I get some exercise when I can… though teaching keeps me pretty busy, so it’s not always easy. Blood pressure is good, cholesterol is… I had it checked a few years ago, it was fine. I’m not a big drinker, don’t smoke. So… I think I’m doing okay. Relatively speaking. It just… doesn’t feel enough, you know? Knowing I’m not currently sick isn’t really reassuring when everything in my family seems to be… falling apart.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No major medical issues, and you seem to be making healthy lifestyle choices. It’s excellent that you had your appendix removed promptly when needed, and that your blood pressure and cholesterol were good a few years ago. It’s very common to feel this way – wanting to do everything you can, even when you’re currently healthy, especially with a significant family history like yours. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Right. No, not that I know of. I haven't really had to take much medication in my life, thankfully. Maybe penicillin when I was a kid? But I don’t remember having a reaction. No food allergies, no hay fever, nothing like that. I'm pretty… boring, medically speaking. I wish I had something… concrete to worry about, instead of just… everything. It’s all so vague and looming, you know? Like a storm cloud. You can feel it coming, but you don’t know when it will hit, or how bad it will be.
DOCTOR: Well, “boring” isn’t necessarily a bad thing, Blain. It’s good you don’t have any known allergies. And I understand what you mean about the looming uncertainty. It’s unsettling. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and just have a general look around. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Right. Yes, that’s… fine. A physical exam sounds… logical, I suppose. Though I doubt you’ll find anything. I told you, I feel perfectly fine. But… alright. Let’s get it over with. I have a meeting later, so… the sooner we finish, the better. I just want to… rule things out, you know? Get some reassurance, if possible. Though I’m not holding my breath. It’s just… my family. It’s always something.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take things as quickly as we can. If you could just sit here, I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 120/80, good. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Pulses are regular and strong. Okay. Everything sounds and feels normal so far, which is good. Now, just to be thorough, I’d like to order some basic blood work. It will include a complete blood count, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels again, and a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Right. That… sounds reasonable. Blood work. More data. I suppose that's… a good thing. It’s just… the waiting. That’s the worst part, isn’t it? Waiting for the results, wondering what they’ll say. Still, if it rules things out… alright. Yes, let’s do the blood work. Though honestly, I’m expecting the worst. It's just... a family thing, I guess. My mother always says, "Something's always coming." And she's usually right. Do you… need a sample, or will I need to go somewhere else?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension. The waiting can be difficult, but we’ll get the results back as quickly as possible. We can draw the blood right here in the clinic. It’s a fairly quick process. I’ll also send you a link to our patient portal where you can view the results when they come back. If you’ll follow me, I’ll have the phlebotomist draw the sample. Once that’s done, we can discuss a plan based on the results. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Right. Patient portal. More technology. Fine. I suppose. No, I don’t think so. Just… get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can… forget about it. Or at least, try to. Is there anything… I should do before the blood draw? Fasting, or something? I haven't eaten breakfast yet, actually. I was planning to grab something after this. It just felt… wrong to eat, knowing I might be getting poked and prodded. It’s a silly habit, I know. But… alright. Lead the way. Just… don’t expect anything good. That’s all.
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t eaten, actually. For this particular blood work, we do ask that you fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand, so you’re perfectly prepared. It’s not a silly habit at all – it shows you’re taking things seriously. Let's go ahead and get you set up with the phlebotomist. She’ll take excellent care of you. And remember, even if something is flagged, it doesn't necessarily mean there’s something to worry about. We’ll discuss everything thoroughly when the results are in. .
