DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you also. Well, I want to find out... more about where I come from. My people, you know? I hear you can do tests now... with spit, maybe? To see who your ancestors were. That’s what I’m hoping for.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Scobie. You're interested in learning more about your ancestry through genetic testing. Yes, we do offer those services, though it's important to clarify what the testing can and cannot tell us. It primarily focuses on identifying ethnic origins based on your DNA, and can sometimes provide information on potential relatives. Before we proceed with ordering a test, could you tell me a little bit more about your background?
PATIENT: Well… I was born here, on Majuro. My mama, she was from a small island, far away. Arno, I think? But her mama… she came from even further. That’s what I want to know. My people, way back. I make things with wood, you see. Like canoes, small ones. It’s important to know what your ancestors did. Makes the work… stronger, maybe? I don’t know much about them though. Just stories. Old stories.
DOCTOR: That's very interesting, Mr. Scobie. It’s wonderful that you continue the tradition of canoe making, and I can certainly understand wanting to connect with your heritage to enrich that craft. So, to clarify, you were born on Majuro, your mother was from Arno, and her mother came from an island further still. Do you know the name of that island, or any specific stories about her ancestry that have been passed down?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t remember the name of the island. I was just a small boy. My mama, she didn't talk much about it. Sad stories, maybe? I don’t know. She mostly talked about fishing, and how to survive. Things like that. She did say… they were good sailors. Very good. Always knew the stars. That’s why I like making the canoes. It’s in my blood, I think. But I’d like to know… for sure. Is the test… hard? Do I have to give a lot of spit?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. Many families have stories that aren’t fully documented, and it's wonderful you’ve preserved what you know. The test itself is very simple. It involves collecting a saliva sample – a small amount, about the size of a teaspoon. There’s no discomfort involved, and we can provide clear instructions and assistance if needed. Before we order the test, I do want to briefly discuss what the results will and won't tell you. These tests can give you an estimated breakdown of your ethnic origins, but it’s important to remember that they are estimates, and don't provide a complete picture of your family history. It's also important to note that the results may not always align with family stories, and that these tests should be considered a starting point for further research, rather than a definitive answer. Would you like me to explain a bit more about the specific test we offer and what it analyzes?
PATIENT: That sounds… okay. Not too hard. I don’t need a lot of… details. Just where my people came from. That’s enough. I understand it’s not… perfect. Stories change. But it would be nice to know… something. What does the test look for, exactly? And how long does it take to get the answer? I’m not in a hurry, but… I’d like to know before I get too old to remember anything else!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. The test we use analyzes specific markers in your DNA – called SNPs – that are commonly found in different populations around the world. By comparing your SNPs to a database of genetic information, the test can estimate your ethnic origins. It doesn’t analyze your entire genome, just these specific markers. The results are typically broken down into percentages, representing the estimated proportion of your ancestry from various regions. For example, it might say you have 60% Polynesian ancestry, 30% Melanesian ancestry, and 10% Micronesian ancestry. It usually takes about 6-8 weeks to receive the results from the lab. We'll receive a report here in the clinic, and I can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings with you in detail. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Six to eight weeks… that’s okay. I got time. And percentages, you say? Like, how much of me is… what? That sounds… good. I like numbers. Easy to understand. Is it expensive? My Medicare… will it pay for it? I don't want to cause trouble.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Scobie. The cost of the test is $250. Unfortunately, Medicare typically does not cover genetic ancestry testing when it is not directly related to a medical condition. It’s considered an elective test. We do offer a payment plan if that would be helpful. Would you like me to provide you with more information on that, or perhaps a brochure outlining the cost and coverage details?
PATIENT: Two hundred and fifty… hmm. That’s a lot of fish. But… I really want to know. Maybe the payment plan… what does that mean? How much each month? I don’t want to get in over my head. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I make canoes. I don’t understand all this money stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Scobie. We can absolutely work with you. The payment plan allows you to pay in three monthly installments of $83.33. There’s no interest charged. So, a total of $250 over three months. We can also discuss other options if that doesn’t quite fit your budget. Perhaps we could explore some community resources that sometimes offer financial assistance for these types of tests. Would you like me to gather some information on those resources for you?
PATIENT: Three months… eighty-three dollars… that sounds… doable. That’s maybe one good fishing trip. Okay. Let’s do it. Let’s do the test. I want to know where I come from. Can we do it today? Do I have to fast or… anything? I had a good breakfast. Fish and rice, of course.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Scobie! I’m glad we could figure something out. No, you don’t need to fast or do anything special. The breakfast you had is perfectly fine. The kit is very simple to use. It comes with a small tube and a cap. You simply spit into the tube until it reaches the fill line – about two teaspoons worth – and then secure the cap. It's important not to eat, drink, or smoke for 30 minutes after providing the sample. We’ll label the kit with your information, and I’ll send it off to the lab today. Here's a brochure with detailed instructions. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No questions, Doctor. Just spit in a tube, don’t eat, and wait. Easy. Let’s do it. Thank you for helping me find out about my ancestors. It means a lot. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need a drink of water. All this talking makes a man thirsty!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. Please take your time. And you’re very welcome – I’m happy to help. I’ll let the nurse know to expect you back in 6-8 weeks to discuss the results. .
PATIENT: .
