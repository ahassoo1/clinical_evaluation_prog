DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… the swelling. After the cancer treatment, you see. It’s mostly in my… legs, I think. And sometimes my feet. It’s not painful, exactly, just… puffy. It’s been a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Puffy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, puffy. Like… when you wear shoes that are too tight, but all the time. Not as bad as that, but… similar. It's mostly worse at the end of the day. I try to put my feet up, but it doesn’t always help, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. And you mentioned this started a few weeks after your cancer treatment. What type of treatment did you have, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Oh… um… the… chemicals. They put it in my arm. Lots of visits. I don't remember the name of it, to be honest. It was a long time ago and… well, I don't have the best memory these days. They said it was to kill the bad cells.
DOCTOR: Okay. Chemotherapy, then. I see here in your record it was for breast cancer, completed approximately six months ago. Now, has anything changed with your diet recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's right, the breast cancer. Six months… feels like longer. And diet… not really. I eat the same things I always have. Mostly just… simple food. Soup, bread, sometimes a little chicken. I don’t eat a lot of salt, if that matters. I try not to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Just… what the doctor gave me for my blood pressure. A little white pill. I take it every morning. And… sometimes something for sleeping, but not every night. Just when I can't get to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's get a better look at this swelling. Would you mind if I examined your legs and feet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. I just… I hope it’s not anything serious. It’s just… annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: If you could sit here, please. I'm going to start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse – and then we'll take a look at your legs and feet. Blood pressure is… 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Hmm. There's definite pitting edema in both lower extremities, bilateral. More pronounced on the right. Skin is warm and intact, no visible sores or redness. Pulses are present, but slightly diminished bilaterally. Capillary refill is… a little slow, about three seconds.
PATIENT: Three seconds? Is that… bad? I don't know what any of that means, really. Edema… that’s the puffiness, right? What causes it?
DOCTOR: Yes, edema is the puffiness. It means there's fluid buildup in your tissues. A capillary refill of three seconds is… less than ideal, but not immediately alarming. It can indicate some circulatory issues. It’s likely a few things are contributing. The chemotherapy can sometimes cause this as a side effect, and your blood pressure isn't helping. It puts extra strain on your system. It's also not uncommon after surgery, to have some fluid retention. We'll need to rule out anything more serious, though.
PATIENT: Rule out? Like… what? I don't want any more tests if I can avoid it. Everything takes so long, you know? And… they’re not always very pleasant. What kind of things are you thinking about?
DOCTOR: Well, we need to consider the possibility of a blood clot, though that's less likely given the bilateral swelling. We also want to check your kidney function, as that can contribute to fluid retention. And sometimes, heart issues can cause this too. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidneys, and an EKG to look at your heart. And a D-dimer to rule out a clot. It's standard procedure, Ms. Queener. Best to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds like… a lot. An EKG? Is that… the one with the stickers? And the blood tests… they take so much blood these days. Is there… anything else we can do first? Maybe just… elevate my legs more? Or some kind of… medicine to get rid of the puffiness? Before all this… poking and prodding?
DOCTOR: Ms. Queener, I understand your reluctance, but we need to gather information. Just elevating your legs is unlikely to resolve this, especially given your history. As for medication, diuretics – water pills – can help, but they have side effects and can worsen other conditions. We can't just start prescribing things without knowing what’s causing the problem. I’m ordering these tests to ensure your safety. The lab will only take a small amount of blood, and the EKG is quick and painless. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the EKG. Once we have the results, we can discuss a proper treatment plan.
PATIENT: Okay… if you really think it’s necessary. I just… don’t like being poked and prodded, you know? And waiting… it’s always the waiting. All right. Go ahead. Just… please, be quick.
