DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just here for the results, if that’s alright with you? I’m kinda busy, so hoping it won’t take long.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you're here for your results, and I'll do my best to be efficient. Let me pull up your file… Okay, I see here you had some blood work and a urine sample taken on July 19th. Are you referring to those results specifically?
PATIENT: Yep, that's the stuff. July 19th, yeah. Is everything okay? You can just… tell me straight, I don’t need a lot of explaining, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, I appreciate your directness. Let’s go through this together. Your complete blood count was generally within normal limits, which is good. However, your urine analysis did show a slightly elevated level of protein. It’s not dramatically high, but it’s enough for us to investigate a little further. Do you have any known history of kidney problems, or has a doctor ever mentioned anything about protein in your urine before?
PATIENT: Nope, never. No kidney problems, and no one's ever said anything about protein. I mean, I go to the doctor when I have to, but usually it's just a check-up or something. This is new. What does it even mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Elevated protein in the urine, also known as proteinuria, can have several causes. It's often temporary – things like strenuous exercise, dehydration, or even a fever can cause a small increase. However, since it’s new and we don't have any immediate explanation, we need to rule out anything more serious. It could be an early sign of kidney disease, but it's also possible it's related to something else entirely, like high blood pressure. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to repeat the urine test to see if the protein level is consistent. We can also check your blood pressure and do a quick review of your medical history. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Look, I really don't have time for a lot of this. Is it something serious that needs immediate attention, or can we just… monitor it? Like, can I do another test in a month? I've got a lot going on right now. And honestly, I don’t have insurance, so every test is… a problem.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and cost, Kahrin, and I want to assure you I'm taking them seriously. It's good you brought up the insurance situation. We can discuss options for reducing costs where possible. To directly answer your question, it’s unlikely to be an immediate emergency, but ignoring it isn’t the best course of action. While it’s probably not something critical, unexplained protein in the urine can be an early indicator of kidney issues, and the sooner we address those, the better. Repeating the urine test now will give us a baseline to compare to and help determine if it was a one-time occurrence. It's a relatively simple test, and we can quickly assess your blood pressure. Before we proceed, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Medical history… hmm. I haven't had anything major, honestly. When I was a kid, I had all the usual stuff – chickenpox, strep throat… broke my arm once falling out of a tree. Nothing chronic. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, no heart problems. I had a really bad flu last winter, but that’s it. And I’ve never been pregnant. I'm pretty healthy, really. I work a lot, so I don’t have time to be sick. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. It sounds like you've been quite healthy overall, which is excellent. And knowing about the flu last winter is helpful. Just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills. I'll try to handle things myself if I get a headache or something. Just water and rest, usually. I’m pretty stubborn like that. So, can we just do the test now? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, I respect your preference to avoid medication. Let's go ahead and repeat the urine test. I'll give you a cup and instructions. Please bring it back to me when you’re finished, and I’ll send it to the lab. It should only take a few minutes. While you're doing that, I'll document everything we've discussed so far.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Where's the bathroom? And how long will the results take? I need to know if I need to block off more time.
DOCTOR: It's just down the hall, second door on the right. It's usually a pretty quick turnaround for urine tests - typically results are available within 24-48 hours. I'll have the receptionist give you a call as soon as they're back. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any other symptoms you've been experiencing, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing else. Just hoping it's nothing serious. Okay, I'll go do the test. Let me know when you hear something, alright? Thanks.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will. Take your time, and I’ll be here when you get back.
