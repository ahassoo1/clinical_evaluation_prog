DOCTOR: Good morning, San. My name is Dr. AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. You know, like Uber or taxis. I want to make sure I’m allowed to do that, legally. I don’t want any trouble with the law, and I’d like to get it over with quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, San, I understand. You’re looking for a medical examination to fulfill requirements for a commercial driver’s license, specifically for ride-sharing services like Uber or taxis. That's perfectly reasonable. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. Let me just pull up your chart here… Okay, I see you’re 70 years old, and your weight and height are listed as 139 pounds and 155 centimeters, respectively. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Everything you said is correct. Let me think… I had my gallbladder removed a long time ago, maybe twenty years now? And I have a little arthritis in my knees, but it doesn't bother me too much. I take a little something for it now and then, but mostly just try to stay moving. Oh, and I was divorced, a long time ago too. Does that matter? I have Medicare, if that’s what you need to know. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and some arthritis in your knees. We’ll definitely want to document that. And thank you for mentioning the divorce, San, but that doesn’t impact the medical requirements for driving. Medicare is good to know as well. To clarify about the arthritis – is it in both knees, or just one?
PATIENT: Both knees, Doctor. It’s worse in the left one, but they both ache sometimes, especially if it's cold or I've been on my feet a lot. It doesn’t stop me from walking, though. I still do a lot of gardening, even. I just take it slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, both knees affected, worse on the left, and manageable with activity modification. That’s helpful. And you mentioned you take something for it “now and then.” Can you tell me the name of the medication, or what it is, and how often you take it?
PATIENT: Let me see… It’s… naproxen. I think that's right. It's an over-the-counter pain reliever. I don’t take it every day, just when my knees are really bothering me. Maybe two or three times a week, sometimes less. It’s not a regular thing, I promise. I try not to rely on it too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen as needed, two or three times a week when your knees are bothering you. We'll note that. Do you have any other medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart trouble, or any vision or hearing issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. The doctor checks my blood pressure every year at my check-up, and it's always fine. I don’t have diabetes, and my heart is okay. My vision… well, it’s not great anymore, I need glasses to read, and for driving at night. But I get my eyes checked regularly, and the doctor says it's just normal aging. And my hearing is… a little bit worse than it used to be, but I can still hear fine in most situations. I don't think any of that would stop me from driving.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart trouble. Vision corrected with glasses, and some mild hearing loss. That’s all helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the naproxen?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if I’m feeling a bit tired, I’ll take a B-complex vitamin. But that’s it, really. Nothing else. I try to eat healthy, so I don't need a lot of extra stuff. I’m a pretty simple person. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin daily, and B-complex occasionally when feeling tired. Good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. Nothing else. I've been pretty lucky, really. I haven't had any accidents or broken bones or anything like that. I try to be careful. I used to work with logging equipment, though, so I had a few close calls. But nothing that required surgery!
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. That’s good. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I can eat anything, and I haven’t ever had a reaction to any medicine. I’ve always been pretty good that way. I think that’s everything? I really want to get this over with quickly, if you don’t mind. I have a gardening club meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s excellent. It sounds like you've given me a very thorough history, San. Thank you. So, to summarize, you’re here for a medical examination to fulfill requirements for a commercial driver’s license for ride-sharing. You have a history of gallbladder removal twenty years ago, some arthritis in both knees managed with naproxen as needed, corrected vision, mild hearing loss, and no known allergies. You take a daily multivitamin and occasional B-complex vitamins. Before we proceed with a physical exam, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve covered everything. Just… what kind of exam are we talking about? Will it take long? I really need to get to that meeting. I just want to make sure I can still drive, and I’m happy to do whatever I need to do to prove it. I just don’t want it to take all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, San. The exam will involve a standard physical, including checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your vision and reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. I'll also need to examine your musculoskeletal system, particularly your knees, and do a brief assessment of your gait and coordination. It’s fairly standard, and shouldn’t take more than about 20-30 minutes. I'll also need to review your eyesight, do you have your glasses with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I have my glasses right here. And that sounds… okay. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I really do need to get going. I hope I'm not bothering you with all my questions. I just want to be prepared. Are you sure this is enough to get the card? I don’t want to have to come back again.
DOCTOR: Not at all, San, your questions are very reasonable. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. And yes, this exam should be sufficient to meet the requirements for the commercial driver’s license. We’ll focus on ensuring you meet the vision, hearing, and musculoskeletal standards. I’ll document everything carefully. Okay, if you’d like to go ahead and get changed into a gown, and we can get started. I’ll step out so you can change. Just let me know when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Alright. I’ll be just a few minutes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being patient with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, San, are you ready to begin the examination?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Let’s get it over with. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That's within normal limits. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Good. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay, can you read the letters on this eye chart for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. Umm… okay. E… F… P… T… and… V? Is that right? It’s a little blurry, even with my glasses on. I can see the top line pretty clearly, but it gets harder after that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. You can read the top line. With your glasses, your vision is 20/40 in both eyes. That meets the minimum requirement, but it's something we'll want to document. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. No sensory deficits noted. Now, let’s check your musculoskeletal system. Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Ouch. That’s… a little stiff. It’s worse on this side. I can bend them, but it’s not very comfortable. And it makes a little popping sound. Is that bad? I haven’t had any problems walking, though, like I said. It just aches sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, there's some mild tenderness to palpation on the medial aspect of your left knee. No significant swelling noted. Range of motion is limited compared to your right knee. And yes, I heard a slight crepitus – that popping sound – which is common with arthritis. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels… a little awkward. I try not to put too much weight on my left knee. I don't want to make it worse. It's hard to explain. I can walk, but it's not as smooth as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed a slight antalgic gait – you’re favoring your left side to reduce weight-bearing. There’s no significant instability noted. Alright, San, that completes the physical exam. Everything else appears normal. I’ll document all of these findings in your chart. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve done a very thorough job. So… what does this mean? Will I get the card? I really need to know if I can still drive. And if there's anything I need to do… like see a specialist or something… please let me know. I just want to be sure I’m doing everything right. I don’t want any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, San. Based on the exam, you meet the minimum requirements for a commercial driver’s license. Your vision, while not perfect, is within acceptable limits with correction. Your neurological assessment is normal. And while you have some arthritis in your knees, it’s stable and doesn’t cause any significant limitations in your ability to safely operate a vehicle. I do recommend continuing with conservative management of your arthritis – that means staying active, maintaining a healthy weight, and continuing with over-the-counter pain relief as needed. It’s also important to listen to your body and avoid activities that exacerbate your symptoms. I will be completing a medical examination report for your commercial driver's license application. I will document everything we discussed today, including your arthritis, your vision, and your overall physical health. This report will indicate that you are medically fit to drive, with the recommendation to continue with conservative management of your arthritis. Do you have any questions about this report or the process for submitting it?
PATIENT: That sounds… good! Very good. So I can just keep driving? That’s all I wanted to know. And no, I don't think I have any questions about the report. Will you… send it to them directly? Or do I need to do that? I’m not very good with computers, you see. I’d appreciate it if you could handle it for me, if that’s possible. I just want to make sure it gets there safely. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been a great help.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, San. I understand. I will electronically submit the report directly to the licensing authority for you. You shouldn't need to do anything further. It may take a few days for them to process it. Here’s a copy of the report for your records. It outlines everything we discussed today. Based on my assessment, you are medically fit to continue driving. Just remember to continue with your conservative management of your arthritis. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor AX. You've really put my mind at ease. I appreciate your patience and kindness. And thank you for handling the report for me. I’m so relieved. I can get to my gardening club meeting now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your gardening club meeting! And please, don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and drive safely.
