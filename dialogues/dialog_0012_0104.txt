DOCTOR: Hi Tammie, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. Hello Doctor. It’s… my throat. It hurts. Very much. I don’t have time for… this, really. I work. A lot. Is this going to be quick?
DOCTOR: I understand you're busy, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. A sore throat can be really disruptive. “Very much” is helpful – can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More? Honestly, it just hurts. Like… swallowing glass. Not that I’ve swallowed glass. But… similar. And it’s been going on for… a while. Days, I think. Maybe longer. I lost track. It's not important. Is this something serious? Because I really can’t be sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, “swallowing glass” gives me a good idea of the level of pain. And it's been going on for days, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Days. Perhaps a week? I… I really don’t remember exactly. It’s hard to keep track when you are… occupied. Do I need tests? Because I have things to do. And I don’t have… that health plan. It was my husband’s.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week is helpful. We'll figure things out, don't worry about the health plan right now. We can discuss options for that later. Let’s start with a quick exam of your throat, and I’ll ask a few more questions. That will help me determine if we need any tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An exam… fine. Just… please be quick. And don’t make me open wide too much. It hurts to… move my mouth. Honestly, all of this is a waste of time. My husband would have just… dealt with it. He was very practical.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Just relax, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing as I go. First, I'm just going to take a look at your throat. Could you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? It’s… very uncomfortable. Are you sure you need me to open it wider? It feels like it’s going to break.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. It looks a bit red back there, and your tonsils are a little swollen. Do you have any white spots or pus on the back of your throat or on your tonsils?
PATIENT: White spots…? I… I don’t know. I haven’t looked. Honestly, Doctor, I have better things to do than examine the inside of my own throat. Is it bad? Will I die? Because I have… responsibilities. My job… it’s very important. It keeps things running.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not going to die. It doesn’t look that bad, but it definitely looks like an infection. It could be strep throat, or just a viral sore throat. To be sure, I'd like to do a quick strep test. It’s a simple swab, and we’ll have the results in a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A swab… another thing. Fine. But make it quick. And don't poke too hard. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite faint. I need to get back to work. Things will fall apart without me. Is there anything else? Tests, poking, prodding…? I really wish I hadn’t come.
DOCTOR: Just the strep test for now. It will only take a moment, and it will help us figure out the best way to get you feeling better so you can get back to work. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it's very quick. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, if you could just tilt your head back and open wide… Alright, all done. Now we just wait a few minutes for the results. While we wait, can you tell me if you’ve had a fever, any cough, or any body aches?
PATIENT: Fever…? I… I don't check my temperature. I don’t have time for… thermometers. A cough? Sometimes. It’s just dust, probably. From the factory. Body aches… yes, a little. Everything aches. I work very hard. It’s… a lot of lifting and… things. Honestly, Doctor, this is all very inconvenient. Is it going to be much longer? I have deadlines. Very important deadlines.
DOCTOR: Okay. The strep test is negative, which is good. That means it’s likely a viral sore throat. While viral sore throats can be very painful, they usually clear up on their own within a week or so. To help with the pain and discomfort, I recommend plenty of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. You can also try gargling with warm salt water. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No. I don't take… things. I don't have time for… pills. Warm salt water? That sounds… unpleasant. I suppose I can try. But honestly, Doctor, I doubt it will help. I need to work. I can't just… rest. Things will fall apart. Is there anything stronger you can give me? Something that will actually make it stop? I have a lot on my plate. Very important things.
DOCTOR: I understand you want to get back to work as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, there isn't a medication that will instantly cure a viral sore throat. Antibiotics won't help because it's a virus, not bacteria. I can prescribe a stronger pain reliever, but it's important to be aware of the potential side effects, and it won’t necessarily make the pain disappear completely. It’s really about managing the symptoms and letting your body recover. I’m concerned about you pushing yourself too hard while you’re sick. It could prolong your recovery and even lead to other health problems. I strongly recommend taking at least a few days off to rest and recover. I can write a note for your work explaining that you need to take some time off due to illness. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: A note… fine. Yes. A note. They won’t understand otherwise. They never understand. But… stronger pain relief too, please. I need to be… functional. Even if it’s… unpleasant. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t have time for weakness. I have responsibilities. Very important responsibilities. Just… get it over with. I need to get back to work. Soon. Very soon. Is that all? Are we finished?
DOCTOR: Alright, here is the prescription and the note for your work. Please take the medication as directed, and be sure to get plenty of rest and fluids. I understand you have a lot on your plate, but your health is important. Pushing yourself too hard while you’re sick could actually make things worse in the long run. I'm happy to see you again if your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if you develop any new symptoms, like a high fever or difficulty breathing. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I suppose. It’s been… a waste of time. But… fine. Thank you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have things to do. Very important things. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Tammie. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
