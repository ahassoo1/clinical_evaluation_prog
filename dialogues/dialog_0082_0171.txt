DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Lacreasha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hello. It's... the nails, I think. They look funny. Not good funny, just... different. I don't remember why they're different, just that they are. They always used to be… normal, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, your nails. They’ve changed… recently, you said?
PATIENT: Recently? Maybe. Time… it goes. I don't really keep track. It just… is. I just noticed them the other day when I was… doing something. What was I doing? Oh, never mind. They're just… ridged. And a little bit… yellowed. It's not a big deal, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Ridged and yellowed. Hmm. It could be a number of things, and it's good you're bringing it to my attention. Do you notice it on all of your nails, or just some of them?
PATIENT: Oh, all of them, I think. Yes, all. Definitely all. Though... maybe some are worse than others. I haven't really looked closely, to be honest. I just know they don’t look like they used to. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's take a closer look. Would you mind if I examined your hands and nails a bit more closely?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just don’t take too long, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just having a look... yes, I see the ridges, running the length of the nails. And some yellowing, as you mentioned. I don’t see any pitting or clubbing, which is good. Your nail beds look normal in terms of color and capillary refill. Hmm. It could be a fungal infection, though it doesn’t quite present that way. Sometimes this can be caused by… well, a number of things, including certain underlying medical conditions. Do you have any other symptoms, like brittle nails, changes in skin texture, fatigue, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Symptoms? I don't know. I just… feel old, I guess. Is that a symptom? And my skin... it's always been dry. Always. I put lotion on, but it doesn't really help. Weight… I haven't weighed myself in ages. I probably haven't lost any weight, I eat just fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry skin and just generally feeling…older. That's helpful to know. And the nail changes. Do you have any history of thyroid problems, or any conditions affecting your circulation?
PATIENT: Thyroid? No. Never heard of it. And circulation... I don’t get cold feet, if that’s what you mean. They feel normal. I used to wear high heels, but they hurt too much. Now I just wear… comfortable shoes. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: No, not much longer. Just a few more questions. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? No, I eat. I like food. Always have. Maybe… maybe I don't eat as much bread as I used to. It makes my stomach feel funny. But I eat plenty of… other things. Chicken, rice… sometimes a little bit of fruit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any recent illness, even a common cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I get little sniffles all the time. Old age, you know? Can’t remember the last time I didn’t have a little bit of a cold. Nothing serious. Just… a stuffy nose and a bit of a cough. Nothing that needed a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it sounds like the changes in your nails are likely related to a few different factors – age, perhaps some mild underlying health issues, and possibly just general dryness. I'd like to order a simple blood test to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any anemia. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood test? Oh, dear. I don't like needles. But... I guess if you have to. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And can I drive myself home afterwards? I don't want to have to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can definitely drive yourself home afterwards. It's just a standard blood draw; you'll be fine. We’ll send you to the lab right down the hall. It should only take about fifteen minutes. Then we'll get the results back in a few days and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to moisturize your hands regularly and avoiding harsh chemicals. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Fifteen minutes. I can manage that. And lotion… yes, I’ll put on more lotion. You know, my daughter always tells me to put on lotion. She's very good at that sort of thing. Is that… is that all?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all for today, Lacreasha. I'm going to have the nurse print out a lab requisition for you, and she’ll give you directions to the lab. If you experience any sudden pain, redness, or swelling around your nails, please contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, we’ll see you back in a few days to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. I don't think so. Just… try not to poke too much with the needle. And hurry up with the results, will you? Alright then. Thank you, doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lacreasha. We’ll do our best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
