DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm pleased to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you here today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this itchiness, you see. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, all over. Not terrible, but… persistent. It's just annoying, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Annoying is certainly a good way to put it when something is persistent. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this itchiness?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It doesn’t really seem to be worse at any particular time of day, and it’s not really connected to anything I eat, that I’ve noticed. It’s just… everywhere. Arms, legs, back… even my tummy sometimes. It's not like a rash, just… dry and itchy skin, I guess. I've been using lotion, but it doesn't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So it's generalized, not localized to one area, and doesn't seem to be triggered by food or time of day. And the lotion isn't providing much relief. Have you noticed any changes in your skin besides the itchiness?
PATIENT: Changes… well, now that you mention it, I think my skin is a bit rougher than it used to be. Not flaky, exactly, just… not as smooth. And maybe a little bit red in places, but it's hard to tell with my complexion, you know? I’m older, so things aren’t as… firm as they once were. I don't know if that's the itchiness or just… time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Cassimatis. Skin does change as we age. The roughness and redness you've described are certainly things we should investigate further. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – for example, diabetes, thyroid problems, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but they got it under control with medication years ago. And arthritis, of course, but that’s just the usual aches and pains for someone my age. Nothing major, really. No diabetes, no thyroid problems, I don't think so. I had a lot of tests done when I was younger, but I don't remember the specifics. I've been fairly healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see... I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe thirty years ago. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, tripping over my grandson’s toys! Other than that, nothing much. Mostly just doctor visits for checkups and the usual things.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a wrist fracture. Thank you. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let’s see. I take a little bit of ibuprofen sometimes for the arthritis, when it really flares up. And I take a multivitamin, just to be safe. That’s about it, really. Nothing regularly, unless the arthritis is bothering me. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Cassimatis. It's good to be mindful of the medications you take. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else, like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: No, not really. I used to think I was allergic to penicillin, but I took it once as an adult and I was fine. Maybe I was just scared of it as a child. I don’t have any trouble with food allergies, and I love my cat, so no animal allergies either! I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, a few questions about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – have any skin conditions, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mother had dry skin, always complaining about it, but I don’t think it was anything serious. Just part of getting old, she said. My brother had some sort of rash when he was a child, but it went away on its own, I think. Nothing major that I remember, honestly. We weren't a family that talked about illnesses much.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I’m retired now, so I mostly keep busy around the house. I like to garden when the weather is nice, and I enjoy reading. I used to be very active, but my arthritis makes it harder now. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol – just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I live alone, but my family visits often. It’s a quiet life, but I’m content.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cassimatis. That gives me a very good picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to start by looking at your skin all over your body. I’ll need you to undress down to your underwear, and I’ll provide you with a gown for privacy. Please let me know if you feel uncomfortable at any point. I'll start with your arms. Could you please extend your arms out to the sides?
PATIENT: Alright, that's fine. It's a little chilly in here, but I manage. Here you go, Doctor. Take your time. Just let me know if you need me to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some mild dryness and redness on your forearms and elbows. The skin feels slightly rough to the touch, but there are no visible rashes, blisters, or open sores. There's no significant tenderness when I press on the skin. Now, if you could turn around, please, so I can examine your back.
PATIENT: Alright, no problem. Go ahead, Doctor. It's a bit hard for me to see my own back, so I appreciate you taking a look. I hope it's not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: I’m seeing similar dryness and mild redness on your back as on your arms. No significant lesions or tenderness. A few small, flat, age spots, which are common. Now, if you could bend slightly forward at the waist, I’d like to examine your legs.
PATIENT: Alright, here I go. Be gentle, Doctor, my back isn't what it used to be. Is that okay? Do you need me to adjust my position?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's fine, Ms. Cassimatis. You're doing great. I'm noting the same dryness and mild redness on your legs as on your arms and back. No rashes or open sores. Your ankles don't appear to be swollen. Now, I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Then, we can discuss some possible causes for your itchiness and how to manage it. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready. I'm trusting you to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds clear on your heart and lungs. Your reflexes are a bit slower than expected, which is common for someone your age, but nothing concerning. Based on my examination and your history, the most likely cause for your itchiness is dry skin, or xerosis. It's very common, especially as we age, and can be exacerbated by the weather and certain medications. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a few blood tests. We’ll check your thyroid function, kidney function, and a complete blood count.
PATIENT: Oh, dry skin. That doesn’t sound so bad, I suppose. I have always had trouble keeping my skin moisturized. Blood tests, you say? That’s alright. I don’t mind getting poked a little, if it helps figure things out. What kind of information will those tests give us?
DOCTOR: The blood tests will help us rule out other potential causes for your itchiness. For example, an underactive thyroid can sometimes cause dry skin. Similarly, problems with your kidneys can also lead to skin changes. The complete blood count will check for any underlying infections or other blood disorders. In the meantime, I recommend using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day, especially after bathing. Avoid hot showers or baths, as they can dry out your skin even more. And try to wear loose-fitting clothing made of natural fibers, like cotton. Do you have any questions about the tests or the recommendations?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. So it’s just to be sure it’s not something else? That makes sense. Okay, fragrance-free moisturizer… I think I can manage that. I do like scented lotions, but I guess I can switch for a while. And I'll try to avoid the hot showers. My grandson likes them very hot! No, I don't think I have any questions right now, Doctor. Just... when will I get the results of the tests? And what happens if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I will call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the results and any necessary next steps. If something is wrong, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It simply means we need to investigate further and develop a treatment plan. For example, if your thyroid is underactive, we can prescribe medication to regulate your thyroid hormone levels. Or if your kidney function is impaired, we may need to adjust your diet or medications. I will explain everything to you in detail and answer any questions you have. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and you’ve put my mind at ease. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I’ll wait for your call about the tests, and I’ll start using the moisturizer. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before I call with your results. Here's the lab requisition form, and the nurse will assist you with scheduling the blood draw before you leave. Have a good day, and take care.
