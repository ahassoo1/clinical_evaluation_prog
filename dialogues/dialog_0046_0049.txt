DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Glowka, you say? Nice to meet you as well. Land sakes, what was I comin' in for again? Something about not hearin' so good, I think. It’s just… things don't sound as clear as they used to. It’s been gettin' worse lately, I reckon. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. Memory can be tricky sometimes. So, you've noticed a change in your hearing, and it’s been worsening recently. That’s a very common concern, and we can certainly look into it. Just to clarify, when did you first start noticing this change in your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice it… That's a tough one. Seems like it's been a slow thing, nothin' sudden. Maybe… six months ago? A year? Hard to say, really. I mostly notice it when folks aren't lookin' right at me when they talk. Or when there's a bit of a racket goin' on. Like at the diner, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual change over the past six to twelve months, and it's more noticeable when you’re not facing the speaker directly, or in noisy environments. That’s helpful. And has this hearing difficulty been affecting your daily life in any way?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… yes, a bit. I used to love listenin' to the radio, but I have to turn it up awful loud now, and even then it’s hard to make out the words sometimes. And talkin' on the phone… forget about it. I mostly just avoid it. My nephew, Billy, calls sometimes, bless his heart, but I just can't seem to hear him right. It's a little embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be very frustrating and isolating when hearing loss affects your ability to connect with others. It's good that you're addressing it, Mr. Schneer. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high. I think he put me on a pill for it, but I take so many pills, it’s hard to keep track. And my knees… oh, my knees! They bother me somethin' fierce, especially when the weather changes. Other than that… I'm pretty lucky, I suppose. I've lived a good long life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, and some knee pain. We'll definitely need to get a full list of your current medications to make sure everything is safe and appropriate. And just to clarify about the knee pain – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Worse in the cold and damp, like I said. And when I walk too much. Used to love a good walk, but now… not so much. It's a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it gets a bit sharp, but that doesn't happen too often. I just try to take it easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent knee pain, worse with cold weather and activity, described as a dull ache with occasional sharpness. Thank you for that detail. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little boy, way back when. And… oh, goodness. I broke my wrist once, fallin' off a bicycle. That was a long time ago, too. I don’t think I’ve been in the hospital for anything else. Just the usual doctor’s visits, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy in childhood and a broken wrist. No other surgeries or hospitalizations that you recall. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother, God rest her soul, she had trouble with her eyesight in her later years. And my father… he had a weak heart, I think. Died when I was still a young man. I don't really know much beyond that. We weren't much for talkin' about health, back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of vision problems in your mother and heart issues in your father. That’s helpful to know. And finally, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Now that's a good question. Let me think. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had any trouble with allergies, as far as I can recall. No hives, no trouble breathin’, nothin' like that. I eat just about anything put in front of me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer, that's very good to know. Thank you for providing me with all of this information. It sounds like we have a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then, I think it would be beneficial to perform a hearing test to get a more objective assessment of your hearing loss. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, dear. Whatever you think is best. My ears are botherin' me, so lookin' at 'em can't hurt. And a hearing test… well, I suppose that's the only way to know for sure what's goin' on. Go right ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Alright, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look in your ears... I'm seeing some wax buildup in both ear canals, which could be contributing to your hearing difficulty. The ear drums themselves appear intact, but it’s difficult to assess clearly with the wax present. I also notice some mild redness in both ear canals. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes quickly. Just relax your arms. Your reflexes are normal. We will proceed to the hearing test now. It will be conducted by our audiologist. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Wax, you say? Well, that makes sense. I never was one for cleanin’ my ears. Just seemed like a bad idea. And redness… hmm. Could be from the cold, I suppose. No, I don't think I have any questions right now, dear. Just get it over with, and let's see what's goin' on. I'm ready for the audiologist, then.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I’ve made a note for the audiologist to come in and see you as soon as possible. They’ll be able to conduct a more thorough hearing test and determine the extent of your hearing loss. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a gentle earwax removal solution. It’s available over-the-counter. Use it as directed, and avoid inserting anything into your ear canal. I also recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible. Once the audiologist has completed the test, we can discuss the results and determine the best course of action. That may include further testing, hearing aids, or other strategies to improve your hearing. Do you understand these instructions, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, I think so. Gentle earwax removal solution… check. No stickin' things in my ears… check. And avoid loud noises. I can do that. Old age already takes care of most of that, ha! So, the audiologist will be comin’ in soon, then? Good. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. It’s good to know what's goin' on, even if it ain’t good news.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I'm glad I could help. Yes, the audiologist should be with you shortly. They'll be able to provide a more detailed assessment. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to ask the nursing staff. I’ll leave you in their capable hands now. It was a pleasure meeting you today.
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor. You as well. .
