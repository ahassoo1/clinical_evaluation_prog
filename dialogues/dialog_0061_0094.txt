DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Airam! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. My husband... he make appointment. I think... for talk about... things. I not really sure. He say I need check up, but I feel okay. Mostly. Just… tired, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Sometimes it’s good to just get a general check-up, even if you're feeling mostly well. And it’s common to feel tired! Let me pull up your information here... Airam Fontanazza, age 33. Okay. Your husband made the appointment for you, that's helpful to know. Could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Tiredness… hmm. It’s just… always there. Not like, can’t-get-out-of-bed tired. Just… draggy. Like… old blanket. Heavy. I work, you know? Sheet metal. It’s hard work, but… I always work. So I thought it normal. Is that… a problem? Should it be a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, “always there” and like an “old blanket” – that gives me a good idea. And you work in sheet metal, which is physically demanding. It’s good you've been working consistently, but it absolutely can be a problem if that level of exertion is consistently leaving you feeling draggy. So, it’s not interfering with your daily life right now, but it’s something you’re noticing. Let's try to get a better picture of what might be going on. When did you first start noticing this tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That’s hard. Maybe… six months? No, more. A year, maybe? Everything just… feels like it takes more effort now. I don’t know. Time… goes fast, you know? I just… keep working. My husband, he say I push too hard. He worry. But what else I do?
DOCTOR: Okay, about a year then, gradually worsening. And it sounds like your husband is right to be concerned – pushing yourself when you're already feeling run down can definitely make things worse. It's good he's looking out for you. Let's do a quick review of some other things. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… sick symptoms? No. No cough, no fever. Maybe… a little headache sometimes? But I get those. From the sun, probably. I work outside a lot. And… sometimes I feel… warm. Like a flush. But it goes away. I don’t know if that’s a symptom. I just… get hot. I’m a little… round, too. Husband say I eat too much. He always say that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, no fever, occasional headaches – that’s good to know. The flushing and feeling warm is interesting, and we'll definitely keep that in mind. And you've mentioned some weight gain. Okay. Are these flushes happening at any particular time of day, or after doing anything specific?
PATIENT: Specific? No… not really. Sometimes when I’m cooking. Sometimes just… random. Not when I’m working, though. Too busy. And… sometimes at night. When I’m trying to sleep. That’s annoying. Makes me hot and… restless. I don't sleep good. Never have. Husband say I toss and turn.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the flushes seem to be happening somewhat randomly, but more noticeable when cooking or at night when trying to sleep, and they’re making it harder to sleep. And you've mentioned not sleeping well generally. Alright. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Not that I know of. I never really… go to doctor. Husband take me when I really sick. But mostly I just… take care of myself. He say my mother… had some problems. With… bones. But I don’t know what. He say it run in family. I don’t remember much. He talk about it sometimes. He worry about that too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known diagnoses for you personally. And a family history of bone problems on your mother’s side, which your husband has mentioned. We can try to get more details on that later, if possible. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I broke my arm when I was little. Fell from tree. But just… cast. No surgery. Hospital… maybe once? When I have baby. But just… for a few days. Normal, right? Everything normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, just a broken arm as a child and a normal delivery after having your baby. That’s good to know. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. No pills. Sometimes… I take something for headache. Ibuprofen? Is that right? When it really bad. But not every day. And… sometimes, my husband give me… tea. He say it good for… everything. Herbal tea. He buy it from… China town. But that's it. Nothing regular. I don’t like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for headaches, and herbal tea from Chinatown. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Husband say I eat too much, remember? Never had reaction to anything. Sometimes… skin get itchy. When I wash clothes with cheap soap. But that’s not allergy, right? Just… sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just sensitive skin. That's good. Alright, Airam, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general health. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Okay… I guess. But don’t take too long. I have work later. And… I don’t like cold things on my skin. Just… be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, normal breathing sounds. Your thyroid feels normal, no enlargement or tenderness. I see some flushing on your face and neck. No rashes or other concerning skin changes. Your hands and feet appear normal, no swelling. And you mentioned weight gain. I'm noting that as well. We'll want to discuss some healthy lifestyle changes. Okay, everything seems normal on initial examination, but the elevated blood pressure and flushing are things we’ll need to investigate further. Would you mind if I order some blood tests to rule out any underlying causes?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More poking? I don’t like needles. But… if you think it necessary. Husband always say I need check everything. He worry a lot. What kind of tests? Will they take a lot of blood? And… how long until I get results? I have work. I can’t be sick for long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is as gentle as possible. We’ll only take a small amount of blood—just enough for a few routine tests. I’m ordering a complete blood count to check your overall health, a thyroid stimulating hormone test to rule out thyroid problems, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. The lab should be able to get the results back within 3-5 business days. I’ll have the results sent to me, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they’re available. If anything looks concerning, we’ll let you know right away. In the meantime, I want to talk about your lifestyle. You mentioned your husband is concerned about your weight and tiredness. What does a typical day look like for you in terms of diet and exercise?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Husband always complain about that too. A typical day… I wake up early. Work. Sheet metal is hard work. All day. Then… I come home. Cook. Eat. Watch TV. Sometimes help husband with things. Not much exercise. Work is exercise. And… I like to eat. Husband make good food. He say I eat too much rice. And noodles. And… everything. I not a small woman. Never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, so physically demanding work all day, then relaxing in the evening. And a diet that includes a lot of rice and noodles. That's helpful to know. While your work is good exercise, adding some additional activity could be beneficial. Even a short walk after dinner can make a difference. And we may want to discuss making some small changes to your diet to focus on more fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. I’m not suggesting a drastic overhaul, but making a few adjustments can have a big impact on your energy levels and overall health. Before we finish up, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions… Hmm. Will the tests… hurt? And… how much will they cost? Husband pay the bills. I don’t want to cause him trouble. And… if the tests show something bad… what then? I don’t want to be sick. I need to work.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions. The blood draw itself shouldn’t hurt much—you might feel a quick pinch, but it’s usually over quickly. As for the cost, I’m not sure of the exact amount right now. Let me check with the billing department and have them contact your husband directly with the details. And if the tests do show something that needs further attention, we’ll discuss it together—all the options, and what we can do to address it. It's important to remember that many conditions are very manageable with the right treatment and lifestyle changes. We will figure out what’s going on and make a plan together. I want to reassure you, we are just gathering information at this point. For now, let's focus on getting those tests done. After we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any other concerns or questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… please tell husband about the cost. He worries about money. And… thank you. For not… yelling at me about the food. I have to go now. Work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Airam. And you're right, there's absolutely no need to worry about that. We’ll focus on making small, positive changes together. I’ll make sure the billing department reaches out to your husband with the cost information. It was lovely meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day at work.
