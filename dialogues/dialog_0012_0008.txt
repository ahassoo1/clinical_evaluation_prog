DOCTOR: Hi Leander, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, hello Doctor. It's… my ear. Feels blocked, you know? Full. It’s been… a bit of a bother. Honestly, I can’t really say how long. Things aren’t what they used to be, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand. It's common to lose track of time when something's been bothering you for a while. Okay, so your ear feels blocked and full. Is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the… right one, I think. Yes, definitely the right. Left one seems alright. Though… maybe I just haven’t noticed anything wrong with that one. It all feels a bit… muffled, to be honest. Not painful, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the right ear, feeling blocked and muffled. No pain, which is good. Have you noticed any discharge, like fluid coming from your ear?
PATIENT: Discharge? Hmm… I… I don't recall. I clean my ears regularly, though. With… those little cotton things. Is that… bad? I just try to keep things tidy, you know. It's been a while since I really looked though, honestly. My wife always took care of that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you use cotton swabs to clean your ears. We generally advise against using those too much, as they can sometimes push wax further in and cause a blockage. But let’s not worry about that right now. And you haven’t noticed any fluid or anything leaking from the ear, just the feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: No, no leaking. Definitely not. Just… full. Like when you go up high in an airplane, remember? That pressure? It's not exactly the same, but… similar. Except it doesn’t go away. And I haven’t been on an airplane in… goodness, decades. I really don't know when it started, Doctor. Everything is a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a feeling of fullness, similar to ear pressure when flying, but persistent. It's understandable things are a bit blurry with time. Have you noticed any hearing loss with that ear?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… now that you mention it… maybe? People do seem to… mumble a lot lately. Or maybe they always mumbled and I just didn't notice. It’s hard to say, really. My wife… she always spoke very clearly. I don't really know if my hearing's worse, or if everyone else is just… quieter. It's possible. I suppose it's possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possible hearing loss, or difficulty understanding people. We'll definitely look into that. Have you had any ringing in your ears, or any dizziness or balance problems?
PATIENT: Ringing… no, not ringing. Balance… hmm. I’m a bit clumsy, I always have been. But I just put that down to getting older, you know? I haven’t fallen or anything. Just… a bit unsteady sometimes. Nothing new. But it’s not really… dizziness, more like… off-balance. Is that… the same thing? I don’t understand all the medical terms, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. "Off-balance" is a good way to describe it, and it's helpful to know. Okay, so no ringing, just a feeling of being off-balance occasionally. Have you had any recent colds, flu, or sinus infections?
PATIENT: Colds… I think I had something a few months back. A bit of a sniffle, a cough… nothing serious. My neighbor, Old Man Hemlock, had a terrible one, but I mostly just stayed inside and drank tea. I don’t remember a fever or anything, just… tired. And a bit achy. It didn’t last long. Honestly, they all blur together these days, Doctor. It's all just… a bit of a haze.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild cold a few months ago, with a sniffle, cough, and fatigue, but no fever. Now, I’d like to take a quick look in your ear. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Please do. Just… be gentle, alright? Things are a bit… sensitive these days. Not painful, just… delicate. I haven’t had anyone poke around in there in a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Leander. I'm just going to take a quick look. It may feel a little cool. Okay, I see some cerumen—that’s earwax—in your ear canal. It looks a bit impacted, meaning it's built up quite a bit. I also see some slight redness of the ear canal and the eardrum doesn't look quite as clear as it should. It’s difficult to see everything clearly with the wax buildup, though. I don’t see any obvious signs of infection at this point, but the redness is something we should address. I'm also going to quickly check your left ear just for comparison. It looks much clearer on that side.
PATIENT: Redness? Oh dear. That doesn't sound good. Is it… serious? Wax, I understand, I've always tried to keep things clean. But redness… is that something I should worry about? I really just want this fullness to go away, Doctor. It’s… distracting. I just want to be able to hear properly again. And… not feel so blocked. Is there anything… bad happening?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking these questions, Leander. The redness could indicate some mild inflammation, but it's not necessarily serious at this point. It’s often caused by irritation from the wax buildup itself, or sometimes from trying to clean the ear too thoroughly. The most likely cause of your symptoms right now is the impacted cerumen blocking your ear canal. That can cause fullness, muffled hearing, and sometimes a feeling of being off-balance. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick hearing test, just to see how your hearing is affected. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A hearing test… yes, alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I suppose I should just… follow your advice. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. Just… tell me what I need to do. And… how long will it take? I haven't got all day, you know. Though, time doesn't really matter much these days… .
DOCTOR: Okay, Leander. It will just be a quick test, about 10-15 minutes. You’ll be in a soundproof booth and listen for beeps at different volumes. It's simple, and you don’t need any special preparation. Let’s get you set up with the audiologist, Sarah. She’ll take care of the hearing test, and then we'll discuss the results and come up with a plan to get that fullness cleared up. Just follow me, and I’ll introduce you to Sarah.
