DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s really bothering me, especially at night. I just can’t seem to get comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itchy skin, worse at night. Can you tell me a little more about this itch?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not like a rash, you know? There's nothing on my skin, it just… feels like it's crawling sometimes. And it’s all over, really. My arms, my legs, even my back. It’s hard to describe. It’s not painful, just… really annoying and keeps me up.
DOCTOR: No visible rash, all-over itch, worse at night, not painful. And you said it feels like crawling sometimes?
PATIENT: Yes, crawling! That’s a good way to put it. Not always, but sometimes. It's just… a really uncomfortable sensation. It's been going on for maybe a month now, I think? Time gets away from me, you know, being retired. But definitely over a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, over a month. And has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I’ve been eating the same things, doing the same things. I did switch laundry detergents a few weeks ago… a new brand was on sale. Maybe that? I don’t know. It’s a sensitive skin one, supposedly. But it could be anything, I guess. I really don't keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: Alright, a new laundry detergent, possibly. We’ll make a note of that. Now, besides the itch, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. No fever, no tiredness… nothing like that. Just the itch. It doesn’t seem to be getting worse worse, it just… is. You know? Constant, annoying itch. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant itch can be very disruptive. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I don't think so, not that I know of. I used to be allergic to penicillin, a long time ago, but I haven’t had that in decades. As far as food goes, no. I eat pretty much everything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. Though, I try to avoid shellfish, just because I don't really like it. But that’s not an allergy, just a preference.
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin allergy in the past, but no current allergies. And you're not currently taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: No, no medications. I try to stay away from those as much as possible, if I can. Just a little arthritis in my hands, sometimes, but nothing I take pills for. I use a cream sometimes, but that's it. A generic one, from the drugstore.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, just an occasional arthritis cream. And do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… the doctor did say something about my cholesterol being a little high a few years back, but I haven’t been to a doctor regularly since my divorce. He told me to watch my diet. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. My mother had high blood pressure, but I haven’t had any problems with that myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated cholesterol in the past, family history of high blood pressure. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll just take a look at your skin, check your pulse and listen to your heart and lungs. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start by looking at your skin. I'm not seeing any rash, redness, or obvious skin lesions. Your skin appears generally normal in color and texture. No signs of excoriation. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear bilaterally. Okay, everything sounds and looks normal so far. Now, to get a better idea of what might be causing this itch, I’d like to order some basic blood work. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, liver function, and kidney function.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… thorough. Blood work, huh? Alright, if you think it’s necessary. Is it a lot? I don’t really like needles, if I'm being honest. And where will I go to get it done?
DOCTOR: I understand, needles aren’t fun for anyone. It’s just a standard blood draw, a few vials. We’ll send you to the lab right across the street; they’re very good. It shouldn’t take long. The results usually come back in a few days. While we’re waiting for those results, I recommend trying an over-the-counter antihistamine at night to see if that helps with the itch. Something like diphenhydramine or loratadine. And try to avoid the new laundry detergent for now. Here's the lab order. And I'll give you a written summary of our conversation and the recommendations. We can discuss the results when they come back and decide on the next steps.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Antihistamine… I think I’ve tried that before, years ago. I'll see if I have any in the house. And I'll definitely stop using that detergent. Across the street, you said? That's convenient. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at this. It’s just been so bothersome. I really hope we can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I understand how frustrating chronic itch can be. We'll do our best to find the cause and get you some relief. If the itch gets significantly worse, or you develop any other symptoms like fever or rash, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Otherwise, we'll see you back here once the lab results are available. Have a good day.
