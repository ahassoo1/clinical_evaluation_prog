DOCTOR: Right, yes. Mr. Trendler, is it?
PATIENT: Trendler, that’s right. Kern Trendler. Look, I ain’t got all day, you know. Got things to do. What you need to know?
DOCTOR: Well, that’s…efficient. Alright. Just tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s…it’s my body. Lookin’… not good. Too much… sag, you understand? Always been a strong man, workin’ with steel all my life. Pile driver, that’s hard work. But things… shifted. Not happy with how things look. Need fixin’.
DOCTOR: “Sagging,” you say. And this is…recent?
PATIENT: Recent? Not overnight, mind you. Been happenin’ for… oh, maybe five, six years now. Slowly. But it's gettin' worse, that's the problem. Can’t hide it under my shirt anymore. Used to be, I could fill it out, you know? Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Five or six years of…cosmetic concerns?
PATIENT: Cosmetic? You call it cosmetic! This is about respect, young lady. A man gotta look like somethin’. I’m a hard worker. People need to see that. Not this… droopy mess. I ain't askin' for beauty, just… presentable.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We’ll document “concern regarding body image.” Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… well, I get tired quicker. Used to be, I could work all day and still have energy. Now? Need a nap after lunch sometimes. And… my hands ache. Steel work ain't easy, so maybe it's just that. Don't know. But the sag is the main thing.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and hand aches. Okay. And any weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Not intentionally. Haven’t been eatin’ less, that’s for sure. Appetite’s still good. If anything, I’ve probably put on a little, but it ain't where it should be. It’s all gone to… well, you see it. Not muscle, that's for certain. More like… fluff.
DOCTOR: Right. Fluff. Okay. Let’s take some basic measurements. And I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to rule things out. Can you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Scale? What for? You think I’m fat? I told you, it’s sag, not fat! Look, I’m a practical man. Measurements won’t fix the problem, will they? I just want to know what can be done.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, the measurements are standard procedure. It helps me get a complete picture of your…condition. And no, I am not implying anything. It’s simply data. Please, just step on the scale. We can discuss “solutions” after I have some information. I need to rule out any underlying medical issues before considering purely cosmetic interventions.
PATIENT: Interventions? You makin’ this complicated. Look, I ain’t a doctor, alright? I work with steel. Just tell me if you can tighten things up. That's all I care about. But fine, fine! If you must have a number...
DOCTOR: 122 pounds. That's... quite low for your height, Mr. Trendler. Especially if you’re still eating normally. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Now you’re askin’ about… that? Really? Look, I ain't here to discuss my toilet routine. I came about lookin’ weak and droopy! What’s that got to do with anything? This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, unexplained weight loss and fatigue can be signs of serious conditions. It's my job to investigate those possibilities before discussing cosmetic procedures. I understand you’re concerned about your appearance, but we need to rule out anything medically significant. Now, please, tell me about your bowel habits. Have they changed at all in the past few months?
PATIENT: Fine, fine! What do you want to know?! They’re… regular, mostly. But… maybe a bit looser than usual, yeah. And sometimes… dark. Darker than they used to be. Happy now? This is ridiculous. I'm tellin' you, it's just age and hard work.
DOCTOR: Dark stools… Okay. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a stool analysis. Just to be thorough. We also need to check your electrolytes. And frankly, Mr. Trendler, I’m concerned about possible malnutrition. I'm going to refer you to a gastroenterologist. We need to rule out any internal bleeding.
PATIENT: Bleeding?! Now you're tellin' me I'm bleedin'? I feel perfectly alright, aside from lookin' a bit… deflated. Gastroenterologist? Sounds expensive. Look, I'm not payin' for all this fancy testin' if all I need is a little… tightenin' up. This is gettin' out of hand. I want a second opinion. And I want it now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. However, I am obligated to investigate all possibilities. Your symptoms—weight loss, fatigue, dark stools—are concerning. I'm documenting “patient refusal of recommended diagnostic testing.” I will provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist, but I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment. I'm not going to waste any more time discussing "tightening up" until we've addressed the underlying medical issues. Is there anything else, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: Finished! Finally. Yes, that's it. Just… the referral. And look, if it’s gonna cost a fortune, I’m not botherin’. I came for one thing, and you’re tellin' me I might be… fallin’ apart inside? This is a disaster. Just give me the paper.
DOCTOR: Here. Dr. Anya Sharma. I suggest you call her office immediately. And Mr. Trendler… please take this seriously. Next patient. .
PATIENT: .
