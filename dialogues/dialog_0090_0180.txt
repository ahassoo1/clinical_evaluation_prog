DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day, okay? I'm… tired. Really tired. And I've been… eating things. Weird things. Dirt, mostly. I don't want to, but I just… do. It’s embarrassing, honestly. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Tired, and… consuming dirt. That is unusual. Let's try to get a bit more detail, shall we?
PATIENT: Detail? What kind of detail? It's dirt, Doctor. Brown, sometimes a little rocky, sometimes… softer. I don't analyze it! I just… feel like I need it. It started, oh… a while ago. Months, I guess. I don’t keep track of these things. Why is this important? Is it something serious? Because I really don't have time for serious.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, Ms. Cantoran, which is why we need to understand what’s going on. The urge to eat non-food items – we call that pica – can be a sign of a nutritional deficiency, or something else entirely. Now, when you say you “feel like you need it”, can you describe that feeling?
PATIENT: Ugh, “nutritional deficiency”? Look, I eat regular food! Not fancy, but I eat. Beans, tortillas… sometimes chicken if I can afford it. It’s not like I’m starving. This… feeling… it’s hard to explain. Like… something is missing. A hollowness. And the dirt… it just feels… right. I know it’s stupid. I just… want it to stop. Is it gonna make me sick? Because I have work. I can't afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So you're eating dirt despite consuming what you consider a normal diet. And you feel a… hollowness, a craving. We’ll need to investigate possible deficiencies, certainly. But often, these cravings can be linked to stress. Are you experiencing a lot of stress lately, Ms. Cantoran?
PATIENT: Stress? What woman isn't stressed? Life is stressful! Work is stressful. Money is stressful. Everything is stressful! I lost my husband, didn't I? Three years ago. You think that’s not stressful? Honestly, Doctor, are you even listening? This is about the dirt, not my life story. I just want to know if it’s dangerous. Will I get worms or something?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cantoran, I am listening. And you are correct, we should focus on the dirt. Worms are a possibility, yes, and there are other infections we need to rule out. It could also indicate an iron deficiency, or other imbalances. Let's start with a physical exam and some bloodwork. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings lately?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? Oh, great. Just what I needed. Look, I don't do… poking and prodding. And no, just dirt. Maybe a little clay sometimes, if I can find it. It's all the same, really. Earthy stuff. Honestly, why are you asking so many questions? Is this going to take long? I have a deadline. A very important deadline. This is about the dirt, remember? Not my whole life!
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, bloodwork is essential to determine if there's a medical cause for this behavior. It's a simple procedure, and it will help us understand what's going on and if you need any treatment. Without it, we're just guessing. I understand you have a deadline, but your health is more important. Now, let's start with a basic physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Can we start with that?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick. And don't poke too hard. My stomach... it's sensitive. I haven't been sleeping well, if that matters. And honestly, Doctor, I really think you're making a big deal out of nothing. It’s dirt. People eat weirder things. Just get it over with. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Heart rate is slightly elevated, but that could be anxiety. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if anything feels particularly tender. And is it generally tender or just specific spots?
