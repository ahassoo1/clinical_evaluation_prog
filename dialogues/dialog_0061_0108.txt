DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Brad. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Though, honestly, I’m not usually one for all the pleasantries. Just… bleeding. From down there. Been happening for a bit now, and it’s… concerning. Not something a man wants to talk about, you know? But here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, I understand. It’s definitely not something most men readily discuss, and it takes courage to come in. We'll get to the bottom of this, and I'll do my best to make you comfortable. When you say "a bit now," could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Roughly? Hmm. Let me think. It started… around June, maybe? Early June. It wasn't much at first, just a little spot here and there when I… well, you know. But it's gotten worse since. More frequent, heavier. And darker. It's not…normal. Though, frankly, what is normal these days? I haven’t been feeling right either, kinda weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting around early June, with increasing frequency and amount, and it's darker than before. And you’ve also been feeling weak. That’s helpful to know. To get a clearer picture, can you describe the bleeding a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want to know, exactly? It’s… blood. Red blood. Sometimes it's just a few drops after… using the restroom. Other times, it’s more. Like… when you cut yourself shaving. Though, not that much, usually. And it's not always with… everything. Sometimes it just happens randomly, if that makes sense. It's just… unpredictable, and it's worrying me. Look, I'm a simple man, I don’t need a whole lot of fancy details. Just tell me what's wrong, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, I understand your frustration, and I'll do my best to be straightforward. So, it varies from a few drops after urination to more substantial amounts, sometimes happening spontaneously. That’s good information. To help me narrow down the possibilities, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not exactly pain. It’s… discomfort. Like a little ache, sometimes. More like… pressure, really. Especially when I’m trying to… go. And it’s not burning, no. Just a little… unsettled feeling. It’s hard to explain. It's not like a sharp pain, if that makes any difference. Honestly, I thought it was just something I was eating. Old age, you know? Everything starts to fall apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so discomfort and pressure during urination, not sharp pain, and you were initially thinking it might be related to diet or age. That’s good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements recently?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? What are you getting at now, Doctor? I came in here for bleeding, not to talk about… that. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I’m a grown man, I don't need to explain every little thing that comes out of me. Is this going to lead somewhere or are you just fishing for information? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, I apologize if I'm making you uncomfortable. I ask about bowel movements because sometimes changes can be related to what's going on. It's just part of a thorough check-up. We can skip this question if you're truly uncomfortable, but it could help me understand what's happening. Before we do that, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Not really. Night sweats… well, I live in a hot climate, Doctor. I sweat at night. It’s summer! Look, I’m a healthy man. I eat right, I get enough sleep… mostly. This whole thing is probably just a fluke. A temporary thing. Can we just… run some tests or something? I’d rather know what’s going on instead of sitting here answering personal questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, I understand your frustration, and we can certainly move towards getting some tests done. Before we do that, just a few more quick questions, and then we'll get to the physical exam and ordering some labs. Have you experienced any weight loss recently, even unintentional?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe. My clothes have been feeling a little looser lately, but I figured that was just… well, getting older. Things shift, you know? I haven't been actively trying to lose weight, if that's what you're asking. Just… noticed things weren't fitting quite the same. It’s probably nothing. Just the heat, I tell ya. Everything feels different in this weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some unintentional weight loss, along with the other symptoms. And to finish up the history, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or have you had multiple sexual partners?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute! Now you're just getting ridiculous. What does my personal life have to do with bleeding? I came in here because of a medical issue, not to be interrogated about… that. This is completely inappropriate. I think I’m done. I’ll just… figure it out myself. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, please, sit down. I apologize if my questions felt invasive, but I need to gather as much information as possible to understand what's going on and provide you with the best care. I understand your discomfort, and I won’t push you to answer anything you're not comfortable with. However, these questions are important because certain infections can cause symptoms like bleeding, and it's my responsibility to consider all possibilities. But let's stop there. We can focus on getting a physical exam done and then order some lab work. Would that be alright with you?
