DOCTOR: Good morning, Elijiah. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seein’ me. It’s… well, it’s kinda embarrassing, to be honest. I’m havin’ a real hard time gettin’ up outta chairs. Like, it just… doesn’t wanna happen sometimes. It’s been goin’ on for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright, no need to be embarrassed at all. Many things can cause that. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, somethin’ like that. Maybe a little longer, now that I think about it. It started kinda slow, just feelin’ a bit stiff, but it's gotten worse. Especially after a long shift at the rig.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset, worsening over weeks, and more noticeable after work. You mentioned “the rig” – what kind of work do you do there, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Not at all. I’m a roustabout, mostly. You know, general labor. Liftin’, movin’ stuff, helpin’ out where needed. It’s pretty physical work, lots of bendin' and twistin'. We’re out in the oil and gas fields, so it ain't always pretty or easy.
DOCTOR: Right, I see. That definitely gives me a better idea. And when you say “doesn’t wanna happen,” could you describe exactly how it feels when you try to get up?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not pain, exactly. More like… resistance. Like somethin’ is stuck. I gotta really force it, kinda use my arms to push myself up. Sometimes my legs feel kinda weak, too, like they ain't gonna hold me. And then, once I am up, it takes a second to feel steady.
DOCTOR: Okay, resistance, needing to use your arms to push, and a feeling of weakness and unsteadiness afterwards. Does this happen every time you get up, or are there times it's easier?
PATIENT: It happens pretty much every time, but it’s worse after I’ve been sittin’ for a while. Like, if I get up and walk around for a few minutes, then sit back down, it’s much harder than the first time. And like I said, after a shift at work, forget about it. I almost need someone to pull me outta the chair sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the difficulty getting up, have you noticed any pain in your back, hips, or legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, my lower back has been kinda achy. Not all the time, but mostly in the evenin' after work. And sometimes, just a dull ache in my hips. I kinda figured it was just from the work, to be honest. I didn’t really think it was worth sayin' somethin' about.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back and hip aches, especially after work. It's good you're tellin' me everything, even if it doesn't seem important. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical problems that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. Had a broken arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. Other than that, nothin'. I don’t really go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. And uh… well, my wife passed away a couple years ago. That’s kinda been… hard.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. That must be incredibly difficult. Thank you for sharing that with me. And it's good to know you've generally been healthy. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Like I said, pretty lucky when it comes to that kinda stuff. Mostly just bumps and bruises from work, honestly. And a couple of bad sunburns over the years.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, I grew up in Mexico, with a big family. Lots of brothers and sisters. Most of ‘em still live down there. I haven’t seen ‘em in a while, though. It’s expensive to travel, and work keeps me pretty busy. I don’t really know much about their health stuff, to be honest. We don’t talk about that much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, don’t take nothin’ regularly. And no allergies that I know of. I’ve taken some ibuprofen for headaches now and then, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just wanna figure out what’s goin’ on, so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your reflexes and strength in your legs and arms. Finally, I’m going to have you stand up and sit down a few times so I can observe how you’re movin'. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Sounds good. Just let me know if somethin' feels wrong, alright? I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now another one… and out… Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. This might feel a bit strange, but shouldn't be painful.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Go ahead. It feels kinda weird already, just thinkin' about it. But I'll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are present and equal on both sides. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that good? I don't wanna break your hand, Doc.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, you’re not breaking anything! Both sides feel equal and strong. Now, I’m going to have you stand up and sit down a few times. Just do it at your own pace, and let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Okay… that was… not easy. Felt kinda stuck, like I said. It’s harder goin’ down than standin’ up, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed that. You have some difficulty initiating the movement, and it seems more challenging to sit down. There's a slight hesitation and a bit of a struggle. I'm also feeling some tenderness in your lower back when I press on it gently. Does this hurt?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s kinda sore. Not like a sharp pain, just… achy. Especially right there. It feels like a knot or somethin’. Has been like that for a while, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some muscle tension and tenderness there. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have a muscle strain in your lower back. The difficulty getting up and sitting down is likely related to that, and the bending and twisting at work probably aggravated it. It's good that you don't have any numbness or weakness in your legs, which would suggest something more serious. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some X-rays of your lower back. That will help us see if there's anything else going on, like a fracture or arthritis.
PATIENT: X-rays, huh? Never had those before. Sounds… serious. Is it somethin’ bad, Doctor? I really need to be able to work. I don’t have insurance, so…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Elijiah. X-rays are just a precaution to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something serious. Most likely, it’s just a muscle strain, and the X-rays will simply confirm that. As for the cost… let’s talk about that. I can write you a referral to a local imaging center that offers a discounted rate for uninsured patients. We can also explore other options to help make it more affordable. I don’t want you worrying about financial concerns preventing you from getting the care you need. In the meantime, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and applying ice to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Also, try to avoid any heavy lifting or bending for now. We will figure out a plan to get you back to work as soon as possible. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… better. Discounted rate helps a lot, honestly. Ice and ibuprofen… I can do that. No heavy liftin’ is gonna be tough, but I’ll try. So… just to be clear, you think it’s probably just a muscle? Not somethin’ broken or… worse? That’s good. When can I get the X-rays done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, based on the exam and your history, a muscle strain is the most likely explanation. That's why I'm recommending the X-rays – to rule out any other possibilities, but I don't suspect anything serious. The imaging center I'll refer you to usually has same-day appointments. I'll fax the referral over right now. They'll call you to schedule a time that works for you. As for the results, they usually come back within 24-48 hours. Once I have them, I'll give you a call to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, focus on rest, ice, and pain relief. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thanks, Doctor. You’ve been a big help. I really appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly, and workin' with me on the cost. I’ll call the imaging center tomorrow and get somethin’ scheduled.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Elijiah. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, rest and ice are your friends right now. I’ll be in touch as soon as the X-ray results are back. Have a good day, and take care of yourself. .
