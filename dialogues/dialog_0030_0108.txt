DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, no offense, but you’re kinda short, aren’t ya? Anyway, it’s my stomach. Been bleedin’. Not a pretty sight, lemme tell ya. Happened a couple times now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Gentz. And please, don't worry about my height. We're here to focus on your health. I understand you've been experiencing bleeding from your stomach, and it's happened a couple of times now. Could you describe what this bleeding looks like?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't like a cut, alright? It's...dark. Real dark. Like, almost black. Comes up when I, uh, you know... go to the bathroom. And it smells…bad. Worse than usual, anyway. Not just a little bit of red, Doc. This is… substantial. I tried to ignore it, but it keeps comin’ back. Been happenin’ for about a week now, maybe a little longer. Honestly, I shoulda come sooner, but… things been hectic.
DOCTOR: I see. Dark, almost black stool, and a noticeable odor, occurring for about a week or more. And you mentioned it’s been substantial. That’s important information, Mr. Gentz. When you say “substantial,” could you give me an estimate of how much blood you’re seeing?
PATIENT: Look, I ain't weighin' it on a scale, alright? It's...enough to make the water turn red. More than just a few drops, let’s put it that way. Like, a good amount. Enough that I gotta flush twice. And it doesn't just disappear, ya know? Stains the bowl. I’m not one to exaggerate, Doc, but it’s… concerning. Especially with… well, nevermind. It’s a lot. More than it should be, that's for sure. And it's makin' me feel weak. Real weak.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. Dark stool, significant enough to change the water in the bowl and stain it, and you're experiencing weakness. That certainly warrants investigation. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this bleeding?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Been kinda dizzy. Not all the time, but when I stand up too fast, everything spins. And I've been tired. Real tired. Like, sleepin’ all day tired. And… my stomach’s been hurtin’. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like somethin's just…off. Also, I haven’t been hungry. Not at all. Food just… doesn't appeal. Used to love my Yemeni food, but now… I can barely look at it. It’s just all… bleh. And I get winded easy now. Climbing the stairs? Forget about it. I used to bounce up 'em, now I gotta stop halfway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dizziness upon standing, fatigue, a dull ache in your stomach, loss of appetite, and shortness of breath with exertion. These are all important things to know, Mr. Gentz. Now, have you taken anything for this stomach pain, either over-the-counter or prescribed by another doctor?
PATIENT: Nah. I don’t go to doctors. Never have, really. Too much fuss. Besides, what are they gonna do, anyway? Give me a pill? I’ll just suffer through it. My wife… she used to make me go, but… well, she’s gone now. And I just haven't bothered since. I tried some antacids once, years ago, but they didn’t do nothin’. Just gave me the runs. So, no. No pills, no nothin’. Just tryin' to tough it out, like always. I figure it'll pass. It always has before, eventually. But this time… this time it ain’t goin’ away.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. It sounds like you’ve been managing on your own for quite some time, and I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It's admirable that you try to tough things out, but given what you've described – the dark stool, weakness, dizziness, and persistent symptoms – I am concerned enough to want to do some further investigation. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd like to do a physical exam, and I’ll also need to order some blood work. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I really don’t like this. All this poking and prodding… and blood work? Honestly. But… I gotta admit, I am feelin’ weaker. And I don't wanna… well, you know. Fine. Do your exam. But no funny business, alright? And keep it quick. I got things to do. Just tell me what's wrong and what I gotta do to fix it. No lectures, ya hear? I’m a busy man.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I'll do my best to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. No lectures, I promise. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll feel your abdomen. I'll also check for any signs of dehydration. I'm noticing your heart rate is a little elevated, and your abdomen is slightly tender to the touch, particularly in the lower regions. No noticeable distension or guarding at this time. Now, I will check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 92, your respiratory rate is 18, and your temperature is 98.6. I also see you have some pallor. Given your history and the exam findings, I am concerned about potential blood loss. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your red blood cell levels and kidney and liver function. We’ll also need to check a stool sample for blood. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Do whatever you gotta do. Just... don't keep me waitin' around forever for these results. And tell me what all this means, ya hear? No medical jargon. Plain English. I ain’t a doctor. What kinda blood levels are we talkin' about? Is it serious? Am I gonna need a transfusion or somethin'? Just lay it all out for me, Doc. I need to know. And don’t try to sugarcoat it. I can handle the truth. Probably. Just get on with it. I got things to do, remember?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gentz, and I promise to explain everything in plain English. We’ll check your red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, which tell us how much oxygen your blood can carry. A low level can cause the weakness and dizziness you’re experiencing. The CMP checks your kidney and liver function, and the stool sample confirms the presence of blood in your digestive tract. These tests will help us determine the cause of the bleeding and the best course of treatment. It's possible you may need a transfusion if the blood loss is significant, but we won't know until we get the results back. I’ll send the lab orders now, and the results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity and try to stay hydrated. If you experience any severe dizziness, weakness, or see any bright red blood in your stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: 24 to 48 hours? That's a long time to be waitin' around, Doc. But alright. I guess I don't have much of a choice. And yeah, I got a question. How much is all this gonna cost? I ain't got insurance, ya know. My wife… well, she handled all that stuff. I'm probably gonna be stuck with a huge bill. Just give me a ballpark figure, alright? I need to know if I can even afford this. Don't tell me it’s gonna be cheap. I'm a practical man, Doc. And I need to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Gentz. I understand your worry about the cost, especially without insurance. Let me check the pricing for the CBC, CMP, and stool analysis. The CBC is approximately $150, the CMP is around $200, and the stool analysis is $100. So, the total cost for these tests will be roughly $450. I know that’s a significant amount. Our clinic does offer a payment plan option, and we also have a financial assistance program for patients who qualify. I can connect you with our billing department to discuss these options. They can also explore any potential discounts or resources available to you. Would you like me to do that now?
