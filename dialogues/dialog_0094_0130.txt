DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. It's a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my family. Lots of bad sickness, you see. My mother… and her mother before her… lots of heart trouble. I just… want to make sure I’m okay. I don't want the same thing to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It’s very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart trouble. We can definitely do some things to assess your risk and make sure you're as healthy as can be. To start, could you tell me a little more about the heart trouble in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she had it bad. Always tired, always short of breath. Then one day… she just couldn't breathe anymore. Hospital, you know? It was quick. Her mother… same thing, almost. Not so quick, but… same trouble. They didn't have good doctors back then, I think. Not like now.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your mother and grandmother, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like a difficult experience for your family. It’s good you’re thinking about this now. When you say “heart trouble,” do you know specifically what diagnoses they received, if any?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I was just a boy when my grandmother got sick. And by the time my mother got sick… things were… confusing. The doctors talked, but I didn't understand. Something about… the heart getting big? And… not pumping right? I don’t know. They just said “heart failure,” I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heart failure” is a good starting point. It can mean a lot of different things, and it's helpful to know that it doesn't always mean the heart has stopped working. It just means it’s not pumping as efficiently as it should. Now, turning to you, Mr. Schwer, have you experienced any symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in your legs or ankles, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get tired sometimes, but… I’m 73! That’s just getting old, right? No chest pain. My ankles… maybe a little puffy at the end of the day, but I thought that was from standing too long at work. I sell things, you see. Lots of walking and talking.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Schwer. It’s important to differentiate between normal age-related changes and potential warning signs. The puffiness in your ankles could be related to your work, as you mentioned. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… maybe? The doctor at the old clinic… he gave me some pills a few years back. White ones. Said it was for my pressure. I stopped taking them after a while. Didn't feel much different. Cholesterol… no, I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with sugar, either. I like sweets, but… nothing bad happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It’s not uncommon for people to stop taking medications if they don't feel an immediate difference, but it’s important to continue treatment as prescribed if a doctor recommends it. We can discuss that further if you’d like. Do you recall the name of the medication for your blood pressure, or perhaps the dose?
PATIENT: No, I don’t remember the name. Little white pills, that’s all I know. The bottle was blue, I think. I threw it away a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, I just didn't feel like I needed it. I felt fine. Still do, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It can be frustrating to take medication when you're not feeling unwell. We will be able to determine if you need to be on medication. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother… she didn’t like it. Said it was bad for your heart. And she was right about most things, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Schwer. That's a very positive thing for your health. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: Just a little beer sometimes. With dinner. Maybe two or three beers a week. Nothing fancy. Just to relax, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, that I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulses. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schwer. Okay, your heart rhythm is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not alarming at this point, but it’s something we’ll want to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90. Your pulses are good and strong. I don't notice any significant swelling in your ankles right now, but we can recheck them later if needed. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Now, to get a better understanding of your heart health, I'd like to order a few tests. These include an EKG, a blood test to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… okay. Sounds… complicated. But if you think it’s best, Doctor, then yes. Do whatever you need to do. I just want to be sure I’m okay. An echo… what does that do exactly?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Mr. Schwer. An echocardiogram, or echo for short, is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart. It allows us to see the size and shape of your heart, how well your heart chambers and valves are working, and how strong your heart muscle is pumping. It doesn’t hurt at all. A technician will apply a gel to your chest and then move a probe around to get the images. The EKG will record the electrical activity of your heart, and the blood tests will give us information about your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. These tests will help us determine if there's any underlying heart condition that needs to be addressed. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we can schedule the EKG and echo for you. Do you have any preferences for when you'd like those done?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… less scary than I thought. No preferences, really. Just… sooner rather than later, if possible. I don’t like waiting around. And… will these tests be expensive? My Medicare… does it cover everything?
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Schwer. I agree, it's best to get things done as soon as possible to put your mind at ease. I'll have the nurse schedule those appointments for you right away. Regarding your Medicare coverage, yes, Medicare typically covers EKGs, blood tests, and echocardiograms when they are medically necessary. However, there may be some copays or deductibles depending on your specific plan. The billing department will verify your coverage and let you know the estimated costs before the tests are performed. They can also answer any questions you have about your financial responsibility. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home if you have a home blood pressure monitor. And please let me know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or swelling in your legs. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad I could help. We'll get these tests scheduled, and we’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule your appointments. Have a good day, Mr. Schwer.
