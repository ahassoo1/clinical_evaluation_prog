DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have a lot of time. It's this tiredness. Just…always tired. And…and I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but…I crave it. It's stupid, I know. Just…get on with it, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand you’re feeling very tired, and you’ve been having cravings for dirt. That’s…unusual, but we can definitely look into this. Let's start with the tiredness. When did this start?
PATIENT: When did it start? Honestly…a while. A long while. Maybe…last year? Or the year before? Everything kinda blurs together these days. It just…got worse and worse, you know? I used to be able to push through. Now? Forget it. I just want to sit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been progressively worsening for at least a year, possibly longer. And it's significantly impacting your ability to function. Do you notice it's worse at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Worse times? Not really. It's just…always there. Like a weight. Mornings are bad 'cause I have to get up. Afternoons are bad 'cause I'm already tired. Evenings…well, I'm already a mess by then. It doesn't really get better at any point, if that makes sense. Look, is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand you're anxious about time, Ms. Cantoran. We'll try to be efficient. So, it's constant fatigue, no real relief throughout the day. Besides the tiredness and the craving for dirt – which we definitely need to discuss – have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…what kinda symptoms? I get headaches sometimes. And my stomach…it's been off. Not sick, exactly. Just…not right. Everything tastes kinda…metallic. Oh, and I'm always cold. Even when it's hot. Is that a symptom? I don't even know anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, stomach upset, metallic taste in your mouth, and feeling cold even when you're warm. Those are all things we should investigate. Let's talk about the dirt craving for a moment. How often are you consuming dirt?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't make me say it. It's embarrassing. Not every day, okay? Maybe…a few times a week? It's like…I just need it. I find it in the garden, mostly. The red clay. It…it feels good going down, if I'm being honest. Don't judge me.
DOCTOR: I’m not judging you, Ms. Cantoran. It’s important to be honest so we can figure out what’s going on. Craving non-food items like dirt is called pica. It can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency. Do you take any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? No. I don't bother with that stuff. Waste of money. My husband…he used to try and get me to take something, but…he's gone now. Look, are you gonna poke and prod me? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Cantoran. We may need to do some blood work, yes, but we can discuss that in a moment. First, let's get a quick overview of your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Thyroid? No. Never had anything like that. High blood pressure…maybe? The doctor told me something once, a long time ago, but I don't remember. I mostly just stay out of doctor's offices. They never really do anything anyway. Look, can we just skip this part? It's all a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, we can move on, but it's helpful to have that information. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries…hmm. When I was a kid, I had my tonsils out. That's it. And…I broke my arm once, but that was ages ago. Hospitalized…not really. Just…the usual colds and flu. Nothing major. Honestly, I'm a pretty healthy person. Aside from…all this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? What do you need to know about them? My sister lives out of state. We don't talk much. My parents are…gone. Long gone. Is this important? I'm not seeing how my family history is gonna help me stop craving dirt.
DOCTOR: It can sometimes give us clues, Ms. Cantoran, but we can skip it for now. Let's talk about your daily habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Do I look like the type? No. Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. And don't even ask about…other things. It's rude.
DOCTOR: Okay. No smoking, minimal alcohol. Now, let's talk about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but that's it. Look, I'm starting to get a headache. Is this gonna be over soon? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran, I understand your frustration. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some potential causes and a plan. It will just be listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and taking your blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. And be quick about it. I don't like being poked and prodded. I really don't.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me...and again. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and your breathing sounds slightly diminished. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Is it tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Ugh, it feels…weird. Like a dull ache. Mostly on the left side. Not sharp, just…uncomfortable. Look, can I sit up now? This is making me dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some tenderness in your left upper quadrant. Your blood pressure is a little high as well – 140/90. I’m also noting some pallor. Given your fatigue, dirt craving, stomach upset, metallic taste, feeling cold, and now this tenderness and pallor, I’m concerned about a few possibilities, including iron deficiency anemia, but we need some blood work to be sure. Would you be willing to have some tests done?
PATIENT: Iron...what? Look, I told you, I don't do tests. My husband always said doctors just wanna run tests and make money. I don't like needles, and I don't wanna sit around all day waiting for results. Is there…anything else I can do? Like…eat more…I don't know…spinach?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Cantoran. Spinach is a good start, but it likely won't be enough to address this, especially with the craving for dirt, which suggests a more significant deficiency. I strongly recommend a complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. These tests will help us rule out serious conditions and determine the best course of treatment. We can also check your vitamin D levels. I can write you a referral to a lab nearby. It would be a quick draw, and the results will be back in a few days. Are you able to schedule that?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Fine, fine, fine. Just…send me to a good lab. One that doesn't poke too hard. And make it quick. I really need to get back to…things. Can I just get the referral and go?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's the requisition for the lab. It's located at 123 Main Street. They are open until 5 PM today. I'm also going to give you a handout explaining the tests and what they measure. I recommend scheduling the appointment as soon as possible. While we wait for the results, try to increase your intake of iron-rich foods like lean meats, beans, and leafy greens. I’ll also want you to discontinue eating dirt. It may be difficult, but it could be contributing to your symptoms. If you experience any worsening symptoms – severe fatigue, dizziness, or any new symptoms – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…thank you. I guess. I'll go do the tests. And I'll try to…stop eating dirt. But no promises. .
