DOCTOR: Alright then, Zelina. So, you're eighteen, yes?
PATIENT: Yeah, eighteen. Look, I don't have a lot of time for this, so… can we just get to it? It’s my breath, okay? It smells bad.
DOCTOR: “Get to it,” is it?
PATIENT: Seriously. I work on the highway, it’s not exactly a glamorous job. People don't exactly care about fresh breath when you’re directing traffic around potholes. But it’s… getting worse. And it's embarrassing when I have to talk to anyone, even the dispatch lady.
DOCTOR: Right, well, "smells bad" is rather vague, dear. Is it… consistently bad?
PATIENT: Yes! All the time! Well, maybe not right when I wake up, but as soon as I've had something to eat, or drink… it starts. It’s just… unpleasant. Look, do you need me to list everything I ate yesterday? Because I really don’t want to.
DOCTOR: No, no, listing everything is hardly necessary. Though a reasonable diet is important, of course. Let's try to narrow this down. Is it a consistent type of bad smell?
PATIENT: Ugh, how am I supposed to know what kind of bad smell it is? It just… smells bad. Like, a bad mouth smell. Is there a scale for this? Like, one to ten, how offensive is it? Because it’s probably an eight. And it's not getting better. I tried gum. It doesn't help.
DOCTOR: Gum, you say. Interesting. Let’s see… you’re eighteen, no insurance. Alright. Tell me, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? A fever? No. I just… smell bad. Look, I don’t get sick much, I work outside, fresh air and all that. I don’t sit around hugging sick people. It's my breath, can we just… figure out how to fix it? I don't have time for a full medical history.
DOCTOR: “Fix it” is a bit optimistic, dear. We have to understand it before we can fix it. Has anyone ever commented on this before?
PATIENT: Look, I told you. The dispatch lady. She doesn’t say anything, but she always offers me mints. Always. And before… my husband. He… he used to say things. Not nice things. Honestly? I don’t really care what he thinks anymore. He was… a difficult man. Does that help? Can we just get some mouthwash or something? Strong stuff?
DOCTOR: Your husband… I see. And you’ve tried gum, and now you’re asking for “strong stuff.” That suggests you’ve been dealing with this for a while. Alright. Let's do a quick examination, just to rule out anything obvious. Open wide.
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry up. Seriously, I have a schedule. And don’t judge. It’s not like I want bad breath. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Tongue looks… normal. No obvious signs of infection, no significant swelling. Your gums seem… healthy enough. Throat looks clear too. It’s not immediately apparent what's causing this. A persistent bad breath, despite good oral hygiene… could be a number of things. Sinus issues, even post-nasal drip… digestive problems. Have you been experiencing any heartburn or acid reflux?
PATIENT: Look, I work on the highway. I eat when I can, where I can. Sometimes that's a gas station burrito, okay? And yeah, sometimes I get a little heartburn. It’s not a big deal. I take Tums. Is that what this is about? A gas station burrito? Can’t you just give me something for bad breath? Maybe a really strong rinse?
DOCTOR: "Something for bad breath" isn’t a diagnosis, dear. And while a gas station burrito isn't ideal, it’s unlikely to be the sole cause of a persistent problem. Given your symptoms… and the fact that you don’t have regular medical care… I think we should run some tests. Just to rule things out. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel… and I’m going to order a sinus x-ray. It’s better to be thorough. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests? Seriously? I have work. And I don’t have insurance, remember? How much is this going to cost? And what good are tests going to do? It’s my breath. Just smells bad. Can’t you just give me something for it? I’ll pay cash. A really good mouthwash. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand your frustration, but this isn't about finding a quick fix. We need to determine the cause of this, or it could be a sign of something more serious. As for the cost… I’ll have the billing department contact you with a price estimate. And no, a “really good mouthwash” isn’t going to solve the problem if there's an underlying medical issue. I’m going to order the tests, and I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. If you refuse, I have to document that. It's my professional responsibility. Do you agree to schedule the tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. Send me to the lab or whatever. I have work, you know? And don’t expect me to be happy about this. I’m doing this just to get you off my back. But don’t be surprised if I don’t come back for the results. Just… tell me where to go. And hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the requisition. The lab is two blocks down, on Elm Street. They take walk-ins. I'll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, to discuss the results. Please call ahead to confirm their hours. And… try to improve your diet, dear. It does make a difference. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
PATIENT: Whatever. A waste of time. Two weeks... ridiculous. .
