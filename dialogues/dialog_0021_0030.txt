DOCTOR: Alright, Kerriann, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thanks. Well, it’s… a little embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It’s not… normal for me. It’s just different, and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Different how, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It’s… stronger, I guess. And not necessarily bad stronger, just… more noticeable. It used to be pretty faint, even after a full day of work, you know? I lay floors all day, so I do sweat. But this is different than just regular sweat smell. It’s… almost musky? I don’t really know how to describe it. It started maybe a month or so ago, and it’s been getting… more consistent. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Musky, okay. And you said it’s been about a month?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer. It was subtle at first, so I didn’t really pay much attention. But then my daughter – she’s very direct, bless her heart – mentioned it when she came to visit. That’s when I really started to notice it myself, and worry about it. I use the same deodorant I always have, and I shower every day. It just doesn’t seem right.
DOCTOR: Right. And the deodorant… is it working as well as it used to?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… honestly, I don’t know. It feels like I’m applying it more often. And even then, it doesn't seem to last as long. Before, I could put it on in the morning and be fine all day. Now, I feel like I need to reapply it mid-afternoon, sometimes even twice. It’s… frustrating, really. I've never had this problem before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat pretty much the same things I always have. I try to eat healthy – lots of vegetables, lean protein. I do enjoy injera with wot sometimes, of course, you can’t take that away from me! But no big changes. I haven’t lost or gained any weight, and I'm still drinking plenty of water. I do take a multivitamin, just a basic one, but I’ve been taking that for years.
DOCTOR: Any new medications or supplements started around the time you noticed this change?
PATIENT: No, nothing new. Just the multivitamin, like I said. I had a prescription for some pain medication after I twisted my ankle a couple of years ago, but that was a long time ago, and I haven’t needed anything since. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I haven’t even had a cold, really, in ages. So, it’s definitely not from anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about ten years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication. I see my regular doctor twice a year for check-ups, and he’s always happy with my numbers. I had a hysterectomy when I was 35, and that’s about it, really. No major illnesses, no surgeries besides that. My mom had diabetes, but I haven't been diagnosed with it, and I get my blood sugar checked regularly. Oh, and I had the flu shot last fall, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay. And family history… anything relevant that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mom had diabetes, like I said. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had heart problems. Beyond that… not really. My dad was pretty healthy all his life, lived to be 88. My siblings are all healthy too, as far as I know. No one on either side of the family had any… unusual smells or anything like that. It’s just a weird thing, honestly. I’m starting to wonder if I’m just imagining it. But my daughter… she doesn’t usually bring things up if they’re not important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Kerriann. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at your skin. It's just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It’s just… unsettling, you know? Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look at your skin. Skin looks generally good. I do notice a little bit of increased pigmentation in your armpits, but it's not significant. It could be related to friction or deodorant use.
PATIENT: Okay. That’s good to know, I guess. The pigmentation… I hadn’t noticed that before. I do use deodorant, like I said, and I do a lot of physical work, so friction is probably a factor. What do you think it could be? Is it something serious? I’m probably worrying too much.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're proactive, Kerriann. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but the change in body odor, coupled with the slight skin pigmentation, warrants a little further investigation. There are a few possibilities. Sometimes, hormonal changes can cause alterations in body odor, even after a hysterectomy, as hormones are still produced in other parts of the body. Also, certain medications, though you aren’t taking any new ones, can sometimes have this effect. There’s also a rare condition called bromhidrosis, which is excessive or abnormal body odor, often caused by bacteria breaking down sweat. But the pigmentation you have isn't typical for that. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a few blood tests. We’ll check your hormone levels, thyroid function, and a complete blood count just to rule out any underlying issues. We can also check your blood sugar again, just to be thorough. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I appreciate you taking it seriously, even if it is probably nothing. Blood tests are fine. Anything to get peace of mind. So, hormone levels, thyroid, blood count, and sugar… Got it. Will I need to fast for any of them? And when can I expect the results? I have to work, you know, and I'd like to schedule things around it.
DOCTOR: You will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw for the sugar test. The others don’t require fasting. I'll give you a lab requisition form with detailed instructions. The lab is just down the hall, and you can go whenever it’s convenient for you. The results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I'll give you a call to discuss them. If anything concerning shows up, I'll call sooner, of course. In the meantime, you could try switching to an antiperspirant instead of a deodorant. Antiperspirants actually reduce sweating, which might help. Also, make sure you're thoroughly drying your underarms after showering. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Antiperspirant… I guess I can try that. I've always just used deodorant, so I never thought about it. Thank you, Dr. Havird. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not dismissing it as just me being silly. It’s good to know what we’re looking for. When I get the results, should I call the office, or will you call me directly?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I’ll call you directly with the results. That way, we can discuss them in detail. And you’re not being silly at all. It’s always better to investigate changes in your body, just to be safe. Here's the lab requisition form and a handout on bromhidrosis, just for your information. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before then. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Dr. Havird. You too. I’ll let you get back to your day. .
