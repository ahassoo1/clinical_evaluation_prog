DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Bartok. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good day to you, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Yes, well, I’m here for… a thing. A check-up, I think? For… sports. My… son, I believe, signed me up for something. I don’t recall exactly what it is. Something with running, maybe? It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, old age does have a way of doing that! No worries at all, Mr. Bartok. A sports physical, okay. That’s perfectly fine. Just to be sure I have everything straight, is this a new sport, or have you been participating in something already?
PATIENT: Participating? Hmm… I used to play a little… dominoes. Does that count? No, no real sports. Not since… well, a long time ago. This is… new. Very new. My boy, he's full of ideas, always getting me involved in things. Good kid, though. A little… enthusiastic, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Dominoes definitely counts as a skill! And it sounds like your son is very thoughtful. Alright, so this is a completely new activity for you. To get a better idea of what we need to check, do you happen to know what kind of running it involves?
PATIENT: Running… well, it’s got to do with a… team. And a ball, I think. Round, brown… maybe? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t pay much attention to the details. He just said it was good exercise, good for the heart. I told him I get enough exercise just… living, but he insisted. Something about tryouts? Is that right? I'm not very good with remembering those kinds of things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Bartok. Don’t worry about the details. It sounds like it might be football, but we can confirm. Let's just do a quick check-up to make sure you're physically up for it. It’s good you’re getting encouraged to exercise though! First, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. Well, I’m still here, aren’t I? That’s something, I suppose. I get a little… winded sometimes, climbing the stairs. And my knees… they aren't what they used to be. I have Medicare, if that helps. It covers… things. Mostly just visits like this, I think. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a while. A very long while.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is helpful, and that's good to know. It sounds like you've been doing pretty well, all things considered. A little shortness of breath and some knee discomfort – that’s good information. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood… something? No, I don't think so. The doctors always used a lot of big words. They’d tell me things, and I’d just nod and smile. Diabetes… isn't that something with sugar? I do like a little sweet treat now and then, but nothing… excessive. I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but that cleared up on its own. Mostly, I just get… tired. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, diabetes is related to sugar. And tiredness is very common, especially as we get older. Alright, so no major medical diagnoses that you recall, just some occasional tiredness and knee discomfort. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. There was something… a long, long time ago. When I was a boy, I think. A tonsil thing, maybe? Or an appendix? Honestly, Doctor, it's all very fuzzy. It was before my wife… well, a very long time ago. Nothing recently, definitely. I don’t remember ever being under the knife as an adult. It’s all a bit of a… blur, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It sounds like you had a tonsil or appendix removed when you were younger, but nothing recent. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me see. Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. When they really bother me. It's… a cream, I think. Rub it on. And… oh, a little something for my stomach. When it acts up. Mostly, though, I just try to eat sensible. Not much in the way of pills, thankfully. My boy keeps telling me to take vitamins, but I forget. Honestly, Doctor, I can barely remember what I had for breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a cream for your knees and something for your stomach when needed. No regular pills, just those as needed. And vitamins occasionally. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I recall. I eat most things. Maybe a little… sensitive to the cold, sometimes. Makes me cough. But not a real allergy, you understand. My wife… she was the one with the allergies. Pollen, dust… everything! I always used to tease her about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, just a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Did your parents or siblings have any serious medical conditions, like heart disease or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a difficult one. My parents… they’re both gone now, a long, long time ago. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. Always complaining about it. My father… he worked very hard, in the fields. Didn't really talk much about his health. I had a brother, but we lost touch years ago. Haven't seen him since… well, it was a very long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, I don't remember much about their health.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had a weak heart, and your father worked very hard. That’s helpful. Now, one last quick question about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she used to smoke a little, before we got married. But I always hated it. Drink… I might have a little wine with dinner now and then. Just a glass. For my health, you know? Keeps the heart going. And drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a respectable man, Doctor. Never touched those things. Never will.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Bartok. Just a little wine with dinner. Alright, I think I have a pretty good understanding of your overall health now. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. A physical… good idea. Best to be sure, you know. Though, I warn you, I’m not very flexible these days. I suppose you’ll want me to… lie down? Or stand? Whatever you need, Doctor. Just take it easy on the old bones.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Bartok. We’ll take it slow. Let’s start with your height and weight, then we’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. You can just step on the scale when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Right then. Height and weight, you say? It feels like a long time since I’ve been weighed. Hopefully it's not too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re 5’8” and 124 pounds. That’s good. Now, if you’ll just step over here, I’ll check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Five foot eight… and 124, you say? That sounds about right. I’ve always been a smaller man. Blood pressure… I always get nervous when they check that. Is it bad if it’s high? My boy keeps telling me to relax, but it’s hard.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel a little nervous, Mr. Bartok. We’ll take it slow. Just try to relax your arm. Your blood pressure is 138/88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. It could be due to nerves, or it could be something we need to monitor. Let's listen to your heart and lungs now. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly.
PATIENT: A little wheezing, perhaps? I’ve had a bit of a cough lately, as I mentioned. Old age, you know. Always something creaking or rattling. Is it bad? My lungs, I mean. I used to work with… things. A long time ago. Dust, maybe.
DOCTOR: I do hear a little wheezing, yes. And you’re right, it could be related to the cough and possibly some past exposure to dust. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Let’s check your reflexes now.
PATIENT: Reflexes… oh dear. I always worry about those. Are they supposed to be… strong? I haven’t been very active lately, as you can imagine. Mostly just sitting and… remembering things. Or trying to remember things. Just be gentle, Doctor. Please. My old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: I will be very gentle, Mr. Bartok. Just relax your leg. Hmm, your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Nothing to worry about at this point. Now, let’s just quickly check your ears and throat.
PATIENT: Oh my. Those things always make me jump. My ears… they haven’t bothered me much lately. A little ringing sometimes, perhaps. But nothing serious. Just be quick, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, your ears look clear, though there is a little wax buildup. Your throat looks a little red, but nothing significant. Now, one last thing – let's just check your pulses in your feet.
PATIENT: Oh, my feet are a bit sensitive, Doctor. Always have been. Are they strong? Are they supposed to be strong? I used to walk a lot, years ago. Before… well, before things changed.
DOCTOR: Your pulses are a little weak, but present. That's not uncommon with age or decreased activity. Alright, Mr. Bartok, I think I have enough information for now. Let me summarize what I’ve found. You're a smaller man, weight 124 pounds, slightly elevated blood pressure, a little wheezing in your lungs, diminished reflexes, and weak pulses in your feet. You also report some knee discomfort, tiredness, and occasional coughing. Overall, you're in fairly good health for your age, but we have a few things we should monitor. Does that sound about right?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds about right. A little wheezing, the knees… the tiredness. It’s all a bit of a blur, you know? But you've made it sound… manageable. So, I can still… try out for this team? Is that possible? Even with the wheezing and the weak pulses?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Bartok. It's possible, but it depends on the intensity of the activity. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the wheezing, I wouldn't recommend jumping into a strenuous program right away. We want to avoid putting too much stress on your heart and lungs. I recommend starting with a very gentle exercise program, focusing on low-impact activities like walking. And before you participate in any tryouts, I'd like you to get an EKG to check your heart function, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An EKG… and a chest X-ray… yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help, then yes, I will do it. But will it take long? I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know. And will it be expensive? My Medicare… it doesn't cover everything, I think.
DOCTOR: The EKG is quick and painless - just some stickers placed on your chest. The chest X-ray is also very quick – you’ll just stand in front of a machine. As for cost, Medicare should cover most of it, but there may be a small co-pay depending on your plan. I can have my staff check your coverage details for you and give you an estimate before you schedule the tests. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a low-dose daily vitamin D supplement. It can help with overall health and bone strength. And I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible. We can provide you with a blood pressure cuff and instructions. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Vitamin D… and monitor my blood pressure… yes, that sounds… manageable. My boy will be pleased. He’s always telling me to take vitamins and watch my health. You've been very helpful, Doctor. Very thorough. I suppose I should schedule these tests then? And maybe get a blood pressure cuff?
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be a great next step, Mr. Bartok. My staff at the front desk can schedule the EKG and chest X-ray for you, and they can also set you up with a blood pressure cuff. They’ll also check your insurance coverage and let you know about any potential costs. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man like me. Just… one small thing. Will these tests… will they tell me if I’m too old for this team? Is that possible? That's what I'm really worried about.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid concern, Mr. Bartok. The tests aren’t about determining if you’re “too old,” they’re about making sure it’s safe for you to participate. They’ll help us identify any potential risks and make sure you’re healthy enough for the level of activity. Age is just a number. What’s more important is your overall health and willingness to take things slow and listen to your body. We’ll use the test results to guide our decisions and make sure you can participate safely and enjoyably. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that makes sense. Safe and enjoyable. That's all I want. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll go talk to your staff now and schedule these tests. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bartok. It was my pleasure. And remember, listen to your body, take things slow, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: .
