DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been havin’. Right at the back of me head, you know? Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come, it’s a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head that comes and goes. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, really. Feels like… pressure, almost. And it usually starts in the evenin’, after I’ve been on me feet all day. I’m a manicurist, you see, and pedicurist. Lots of bendin’ and reachin’. I reckon that might have somethin’ to do with it. Sometimes it goes all the way up the back of me neck, too. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache, pressure-like, starting in the evening after work, and radiating up your neck. That’s helpful. How long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think now. It started… oh, maybe about three months ago? At first it was just now and then, I didn’t pay it much mind. Thought it was just tiredness, you know? But it’s been happenin’ more often lately, and lastin’ longer each time. I’d say, for the past month or so it’s been a pretty regular thing. Almost every day, if I’ve had a busy day at the shop.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three months total, but more consistent and frequent over the last month. And it seems to be related to your work. Do you notice anything specifically that makes it worse or better besides being on your feet all day?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, actually. If I’m really stressed, it’s definitely worse. If a customer is bein’ difficult, or somethin’ goes wrong with the equipment… that’ll bring on a headache quick. And… warm weather seems to make it worse too. Not the heat itself, but when it’s humid, definitely. Gettin’ a good night’s sleep helps, though. If I can manage that is! My wife, bless her, she tries to keep the house cool.
DOCTOR: Okay, so stress and humidity seem to be triggers, and rest helps. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really, no. No dizziness, no nausea, no blurry vision. Sometimes, when the headache is really bad, me neck feels a little stiff, but that usually goes away when the headache does. No fever or anything like that. Just… the headache. And the stiffness sometimes. I’ve been takin’ some over-the-counter pain relievers, the regular kind you get at the pharmacy, and they help a little, but not completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, nausea, vision changes, or fever. Just the headache and occasional neck stiffness that improves with the headache. Over-the-counter pain relievers provide some relief, but not complete. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had high blood pressure years ago, when I was younger, but the doctor put me on some medication and it’s been under control ever since. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in… well, a long time, to be honest. I generally feel pretty good, aside from this headache. My wife keeps tellin’ me I need to get checked up more often, bless her heart. I try to eat healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables, and I don’t smoke or drink much alcohol.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that's currently controlled with medication. Otherwise, you generally feel healthy and maintain a good lifestyle. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Everything’s been natural, as they say. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years, nothin’ serious. And I’ve had all me vaccinations, up to date on them, I think. My wife keeps track of all that, she’s very organized. I don’t recall ever bein’ in the hospital overnight either, not for anything major, at least.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother, she had headaches a lot, always complainin’ about them, but she never really went to the doctor much either. And my father, he had arthritis in his hands, which made it hard for him to work. My sister, she’s got diabetes, but other than that, nothin’ major that I can think of. Both parents are gone now, bless their souls. I haven’t seen my sister in years, we don’t keep in touch much. It’s a shame, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of headaches in your mother, arthritis in your father, and diabetes in your sister. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had any bad reactions to anythin’. I can eat whatever, take most medications without a problem. Sometimes I get a little itchy after a mosquito bite, but that's about it. My wife always asks me that question when I take new medication, and I always tell her the same thing. No allergies. Nothing special. I'm pretty simple, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a neurological exam to check your reflexes and sensation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine with me, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go right ahead. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable, alright? I ain’t as young as I used to be!
DOCTOR: Of course, I will. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Okay, your reflexes are normal, strength is good in all your limbs, and sensation is intact. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88, but it could be from being in the clinic, or stress. I’m also palpating the muscles in the back of your neck. They are a little tight, but no obvious tenderness. I don’t notice any signs of neurological deficits.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. Me neck is always tight, especially after a long day at the shop. Bendin’ and reachin’ all day, you know? I try to stretch it out, but it doesn’t always help. So, what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? I’m a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Well, based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly with some muscle strain in your neck. The fact that they're related to stress and your work as a manicurist, and are relieved by rest, is consistent with that. The elevated blood pressure is something we'll need to monitor, but isn’t necessarily directly related to the headaches at this moment. However, it’s always best to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work just to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. And I think it would be helpful to get a baseline EKG, just to check your heart health, given the slightly elevated blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it puts me mind at ease, I’m happy to get some tests done. Blood work and an EKG… alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Will I need to fast for the blood work? And how long will it take to get the results? I got appointments with customers, you know. Try to schedule around them if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood work. So, no food or drinks after midnight tonight. We can schedule the blood work for first thing tomorrow morning, and the EKG can be done right here in the clinic after that. It shouldn’t take too long - about 15 minutes for the EKG, and we’ll send the blood work off to the lab, which usually takes a few days to get the results. We can call you as soon as they come back. In the meantime, I recommend trying some over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and focusing on stress management techniques – things like deep breathing exercises, or maybe some gentle stretching. And make sure you're staying hydrated. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds alright. Fastin’ overnight, blood work in the mornin’, EKG after that… I can manage that. And the pain relievers and stretchin’… I’ll try me best. Stress management… that's the hard part! Customers can be real demanding, you know? But I’ll give it a shot. I suppose that's everything then, Doctor? Just wait for the call with the results? Anything I should be lookin' out for in the meantime? Any symptoms that should prompt me to call you sooner?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Just wait for the call with the results. However, please call us immediately if you experience any of the following: a sudden, severe headache that's different from your usual headaches; fever; stiff neck; vision changes; weakness or numbness in your arms or legs; difficulty speaking; or any confusion. Those could be signs of something more serious and we want to rule those out quickly. I'll also send you home with a handout on tension headaches and stress management techniques. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen and explain things so clearly. I feel a little better knowin’ what’s goin’ on, and what to look out for. I appreciate your help. And thank you for the handout, that’s very thoughtful. I guess I’ll be on me way then. I got customers waitin’ on me!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. I'm glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. It’s good to know you’re taking things in stride. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you tomorrow morning. .
