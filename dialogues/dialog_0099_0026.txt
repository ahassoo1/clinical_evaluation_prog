DOCTOR: Right. Ardelle Oitker, 81. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… this tiredness. It comes and goes, you see. Really knocks me about when it does come. Makes it hard to… well, to do anything, really. I don’t know why it happens. It's not like I’ve been overdoing it. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, you say. Comes and goes. Well, that’s… helpful. Vague symptoms are the worst. When it comes on, how long does it typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Days, sometimes. A few days at a time. Maybe a week, once. It’s hard to say, honestly. Time… it just slips away, you know? And my husband, bless his heart, he doesn't notice these things unless I practically shout them at him. He thinks I'm just getting old.
DOCTOR: Right. A week at a time. And does anything seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. Well, trying to do too much, of course. But I don’t do too much! Honestly, I mostly just… putter. A bit of gardening, maybe. Though I haven’t been able to do much of that lately with this fatigue. It’s just… always there, bubbling under the surface, waiting to take hold. It’s probably nothing, really. Just old age creeping up on me.
DOCTOR: "Probably nothing." That's what everyone says. Still, we need to rule things out. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this tiredness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… well, my muscles feel a bit… achy sometimes. Not all the time, you understand. Just… a dull ache. Like I’ve been working hard, but I haven’t! And I’ve been a bit more clumsy, I suppose. Dropped a teacup just last week, smashed it to smithereens. A perfectly good teacup! My daughter keeps telling me I should be more careful. Honestly, she treats me like a child.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness and muscle aches… and when did these start, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It all sort of… blended together, you see? The aches probably started around the same time as the tiredness. A few months ago, I'd say. Maybe four or five months? It's hard to pinpoint. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. Don’t expect a perfectly accurate timeline. I'm not senile, but… things slip.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite’s been… normal, I think. Not much different. Though I don’t eat as much as I used to. Who does, at my age? And my weight… well, I haven't been weighing myself, dear. I leave that to my daughter. She’s always fussing about my diet. She means well, I suppose. But honestly, it's a bit much.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Your weight is listed as 108 pounds. Any recent unintentional weight loss, then?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, now that you mention it… perhaps a little? I haven't been paying attention, honestly. Clothes feel a bit looser, maybe. But I haven’t been actively trying to lose weight, if that's what you’re getting at. I eat my dinner, you know. A nice portion of fish, usually. I'm not starving myself, if that's what you're implying!
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A little bit of stiffness in my joints sometimes, but nothing I’d complain about. It's just… age, you know? The aches and pains of getting older. It's to be expected. I don't expect to be leaping around like a young girl at my age. It's not realistic.
DOCTOR: Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. A long time ago. And… high blood pressure, I think. Or maybe it was my husband who had high blood pressure. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. I take a pill for something… a small white one. My daughter handles all the refills, you see. I just take them as she gives them to me.
DOCTOR: Right. A small white pill. Do you know what that pill is for?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, not really. She just tells me to take it with my breakfast. Something about keeping things… regular, I think? Or maybe it was for my heart. Honestly, I stopped asking questions a long time ago. It just makes things easier, you know? I trust my daughter. She’s a very sensible girl. She’s a nurse, you see. Knows all these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I haven't had any… reactions, have I? No rashes, no trouble breathing. I’m pretty sturdy, actually. Never been one for complaining. I had a bit of a sniffle last winter, but everyone gets sniffles in the winter, don't they?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… my mother lived to a good age, I think. Ninety-something, maybe? Though she was a bit… eccentric, if I’m honest. My father… well, he died young, a heart attack. A very sudden thing. But that was a long time ago. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see. It’s not something I dwell on.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not me. Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. And smoking? Absolutely not. Terrible habit, you know. My husband used to smoke a bit, years ago, but he gave it up. Good for him, really. Healthy lifestyle, that’s what it is. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, based on what you’ve told me – and frankly, it’s rather difficult to get a straight answer – it sounds like you’re experiencing generalized fatigue. However, without more concrete information about your medications, past medical history, and a thorough physical exam, it’s impossible to say definitively what’s causing this. We’ll need to do a basic blood workup to rule out things like anemia, thyroid issues, and vitamin deficiencies. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs and check your reflexes. Then we can revisit this. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work, is it? Well, I don't like needles, you know. But… if you think it’s necessary. And… you mean you can’t just tell me what’s wrong? It’s just tiredness, dear. Shouldn’t you know that already? It's not like it's a complicated illness.
DOCTOR: It's not about knowing, it’s about ruling things out. Fatigue can be a symptom of a multitude of conditions, some quite serious. Responsible medicine requires investigation. Now, if you'll please roll up your sleeve… and I do understand you don't like needles, but it will be quick. We'll start with a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But I’m warning you, if I faint, it’s on your head. Honestly, all this fuss for a bit of tiredness. It’s probably just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get this over with. .
