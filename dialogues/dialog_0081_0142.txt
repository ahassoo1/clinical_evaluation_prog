DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doc. Right, well… headaches, mostly. They come on pretty strong, and I get really sweaty when they do. And my heart feels like it’s, uh… racing. It’s been happening on and off for a while now, I think. Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy," you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, sorry. It’s… hard to remember exactly when they started, or how often they were at first. Just… come and go, you know? It feels like it’s been a few months, maybe? Longer? I got divorced not too long ago, and things have been a bit… chaotic, if that makes sense. It's probably that. I don't really keep track of dates much these days.
DOCTOR: Right. A significant life change can certainly contribute to… various symptoms. Let’s try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Sure, yeah, that makes sense. Uh… okay, specifics. When they happen, it’s like… a really bad pressure in my head. Usually starts at the front, then kind of spreads all over. And then the sweating, and my heart just… thumps. It doesn’t… last long, usually. Maybe an hour or so? Then it just… fades. I usually just lie down until it's over.
DOCTOR: And you said "usually". How often would you say this is happening currently?
PATIENT: Uh… hmm. Let me think. It was pretty bad a couple of weeks ago, maybe three or four times in a week? Then it calmed down for a bit. This past week, maybe… twice? It’s really irregular. Honestly, I wish I was better at keeping track. It doesn't seem to happen after anything specific, just… randomly.
DOCTOR: "Randomly" is not particularly helpful for diagnosis, Mr. Lawther. Are there any triggers you’ve accidentally noticed?
PATIENT: Yeah, I get that. Triggers… Hmm. Now that you mention it, I think… maybe if I haven't eaten in a while? Like, if I skip lunch or something. But even then, it doesn’t always happen. And sometimes it happens even after I’ve eaten. It’s really confusing, to be honest. I don't drink much, and I don’t smoke. I do work in a factory, though. Lots of noise, a bit of dust… I don't know if that counts.
DOCTOR: Dust and noise exposure could be relevant. Let’s move on to some more routine questions. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I haven’t really been to a doctor in… a long time. Years, probably. I mean, I get the usual colds and stuff, but nothing major. My back aches sometimes from work, but that’s just… work. And I get headaches… obviously. Nothing else I can think of, to be honest. I’m pretty healthy, usually. Or, I was before all this headache stuff started.
DOCTOR: "Pretty healthy" despite avoiding medical care for years?
PATIENT: Yeah, I know, it sounds bad, doesn't it? I just… never really needed to go, you know? I’m a big guy, generally don’t get sick. But, I guess that doesn't mean much now, does it? I just try to push through stuff. I should probably have gone sooner, I know. I apologize for that. It's just... never felt like a big deal until recently.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed. Any family history of migraines, stroke, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Uh… hmm. That’s a tough one. I don’t really talk to my family much anymore since the divorce. My mum… she got headaches sometimes, but nothing like this. I don’t think anyone else did, but I honestly can’t say for sure. I didn’t really pay much attention to that sort of thing when I was younger. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s… unfortunate you’re unable to provide a more thorough family history. Are you currently taking any medications, over-the-counter or prescribed?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I tried some painkillers a couple of times for the headaches, like paracetamol, but they didn’t really do anything. So, I just… deal with it. I’ve never been prescribed anything, either. Never needed to, until now, I suppose. I also don’t take any vitamins or supplements.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, allergies?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I mean, I get hay fever sometimes in the summer, but it's just a bit of sneezing and a runny nose. Nothing serious. I've never had any bad reactions to anything. I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything like that either. Just the usual summer sniffles, really.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's perform a brief physical examination. I'll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I’ll need to assess your neurological function. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I'm happy to do whatever tests you need. Just let me know if anything hurts. I’m a big guy, but I’m not exactly made of iron, you know? Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. First, let’s take your blood pressure. 150 over 92. Slightly elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Now, follow my finger with your eyes… look left, look right, look up, look down. Eye movements are normal. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. There we go. Is that okay? I'm trying to squeeze as hard as I can without… breaking anything. Hopefully, I’m not too strong for you, Doc. Everything feels… normal, at least to me. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Grip strength is normal. Now, can you close your eyes?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Closed. Everything's dark. Should I tell you if I feel anything?
DOCTOR: Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch your arm?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can feel that. It’s… kinda tickly. Right there, yeah. It's a bit cold, too. Is that what you were expecting?
DOCTOR: And this side?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can feel that one too. Feels the same. Tickly and cold. Everything seems normal on this side as well. Is everything alright, Doc? You're being very thorough, which is… good.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything appears neurologically intact, but your blood pressure is elevated, and the headaches require further investigation. I'm concerned about the possibility of a secondary headache – meaning a headache caused by another underlying issue. Given your history of avoiding medical care, we need to be cautious. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your head to rule out any serious pathology. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Uh… a CT scan? That sounds… serious. Blood tests are fine, I guess. But a scan? What are we looking for, exactly? And what if something is wrong? I understand you want to be careful, but… what are the possibilities? And how much is all this going to cost? I don't have insurance, you see. I’m a bit worried now, Doc.
DOCTOR: The CT scan will allow us to visualize your brain and rule out any structural abnormalities, such as a tumor, aneurysm, or bleed. Given your history, it is important to rule these possibilities out. The blood tests will help assess your overall health and identify any underlying medical conditions. As for cost… that's a difficult question. Without insurance, the CT scan will be expensive, likely several hundred dollars. The blood tests will be less costly, perhaps a hundred or so. I understand your concern. I can provide you with a referral to a financial counselor who may be able to assist you with payment options. We can also discuss less expensive alternatives, although they may not be as comprehensive. However, I strongly recommend proceeding with the CT scan given your symptoms and lack of prior medical history. Would you like me to provide you with the referral information?
PATIENT: Several hundred dollars… That's… a lot. I don't know if I can afford that right now, to be honest. A financial counselor… Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Maybe they can work out a payment plan or something. Is there anything else we could do instead of the scan? Like, could we try medication first? Or… I don't know. I'm really worried about the cost, Doc. I didn’t expect it to be this expensive.
DOCTOR: Medication might mask the symptoms, but it won’t address the underlying cause, and that’s precisely what concerns me. We could try a trial of a triptan, a medication commonly used for migraines, but if your headaches are not migraine-related, it will be ineffective. Furthermore, delaying a proper diagnosis could have serious consequences. I understand your financial concerns, but I strongly advise against foregoing the CT scan. I’m willing to provide you with a referral to the financial counselor and explore all available options, but I need you to understand that I am recommending this test for your own well-being. It’s a necessary precaution, given your situation. I can also give you a list of local charities that may offer financial assistance for medical procedures. Do you consent to the referral and exploring those options?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Yes. Yes, to the referral. And… yes, to exploring the charities. I don’t want anything to happen… I just wish it wasn’t so expensive. Please… just do whatever you think is best, Doc. I’ll try to figure out the money side of things. Can we… can we just get it over with as quickly as possible? I’m really starting to feel sick just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will prepare the referral and provide you with the necessary information. I'll also have the lab requisitions ready for the blood tests. I suggest you schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. The longer we delay, the more anxious you will become, and the harder it will be to address any potential underlying issues. I’ll need your date of birth and insurance information, though I understand you mentioned not having coverage. We’ll proceed as a self-pay patient.
PATIENT: August 14th, 1993. No insurance. Just… no insurance. And… please, don’t make me feel bad about that, Doc. It’s been a rough couple of years. I'm doing my best, okay? Just… can we hurry this up a bit? I'm starting to feel really stressed now.
DOCTOR: Very well. I have entered your information. Here is the referral to the financial counselor and the lab requisition for the blood tests. The radiology department is located three blocks north of the clinic. You will need to schedule the CT scan directly with them. Here is their contact information. I will also provide you with a printed summary of our discussion, including the list of charities. I recommend scheduling the CT scan as soon as possible, preferably within the next week. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. Not right now. Just… thank you, Doc. For… everything. And for trying to help. I just… need to process all this. I'll try to get the scan scheduled as soon as I can. I guess… that's all for today, then? Can I… just go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you may leave. Please follow up with me as soon as you have scheduled the CT scan, and notify me of the results. I will be documenting this encounter in your chart. .
