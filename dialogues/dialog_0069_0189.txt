DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. Rowbottom, Arbie Rowbottom. And it’s about time someone got around to seeing me. It’s… well, it’s embarrassing, really. Something in my stool. Blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to make a sensible man concerned. And I am a sensible man. Used to fly planes, you know. Demanded precision. Still do, in my own way.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It's good you came in to get it checked out, and it's certainly not something to be embarrassed about. We want to figure out what's going on. And flying planes definitely requires precision – I can appreciate that. So, you’ve noticed blood in your stool. Can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want me to do, paint you a picture? It’s…red. Obviously. Not bright red, like you just cut yourself, more…darker. Like old pennies, maybe? And it's not every time, you understand. Just…sometimes. And it’s not a gushing mess. More like…streaks. Streaks on the paper, after. Honestly, it's probably nothing, but my daughter insisted. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker red, like old pennies, streaks on the paper, and not every time. That's helpful, thank you. And it’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in – it’s always good to have someone looking out for you. Now, has this been happening for a long time, or is this a recent change?
PATIENT: Recent. Very recent. Maybe…a week? Ten days? It’s hard to say exactly, I don’t spend that much time examining my…leavings, if you’ll pardon the bluntness. But definitely not something that’s been going on for months. And I haven’t changed anything in my diet. Same biscuits, same tea, same everything. It’s not like I started eating beets or something, you know?
DOCTOR: No, that’s good to know – no changes in diet. And only for the past week or ten days. Alright. And have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits besides the blood?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What exactly are you getting at? Look, I’m an old man. Things change. But… let me think. It's not harder, not exactly. Just… a bit looser, maybe? Not watery, mind you, but not as…solid as it usually is. And I’ve been going… more frequently, I suppose. A couple extra trips to the little boys’ room is all. Is that what you mean by “habits”? Honestly, this is all a bit undignified.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I meant by habits, Mr. Rowbottom, and you're describing it perfectly. A bit looser and more frequent – thank you for sharing that. It’s not undignified at all to talk about these things; it helps me understand what's going on. Now, have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or discomfort alongside these changes?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? Well, my stomach creaks a bit, but that's just old age, I assure you. No pain, not exactly. A bit of rumbling, maybe. And a slight feeling of… fullness, after I’ve… finished. But nothing I’d call pain. Certainly nothing that would send me running to the emergency room. I’ve endured worse in the cockpit, believe me. Turbulence, you know. That's real discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant pain, just some rumbling and fullness. Good to know. And I appreciate you sharing your experiences – it gives me a better picture. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical history? Hmph. Not much to tell, really. Used to be a bit of high blood pressure, years ago. Took some pills for it, doctor said it was under control. Haven’t bothered with them for…oh, must be twenty years now. Feel fine, mostly. And I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. Nothing else. Always been a strong constitution, myself. Never much for doctors, frankly. Prefer to fix things myself, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure treated in the past, appendix removed as a boy. And you haven’t been seeing a doctor regularly since?
PATIENT: Regularly? Heavens, no. Last time I saw a proper doctor, before you, was…well, I can’t rightly recall. A checkup, maybe, before a long haul flight. That was…decades ago. I self-manage, you see. Keep active, eat sensible, stay out of trouble. That’s always been my approach. And it’s served me well, I might add. Though my daughter would disagree, of course. She fusses over everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it's good you’ve been taking care of yourself all these years. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Not much to report there, truthfully. My father… worked in a lumber mill. Strong man, but died young. Heart trouble, I think. My mother lived to a good age, but she was always a bit frail. She had…well, she had her troubles. Didn't talk about them much. And I had a sister, but she passed away years ago. Cancer, I believe. Dreadful business, cancer. So, not exactly a family history of…digestive issues, if that's what you're getting at. More heart and…general unwellness.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with heart trouble, mother with general unwellness, and sister who passed away from cancer. Thank you for sharing that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, like aspirin or ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not a one. I don’t hold with all those pills. Give me a cup of strong tea and a good biscuit, and I'm right as rain. Aspirin? Ibuprofen? Heavens no. I avoid them like the plague. Too many side effects, if you ask me. And I've got no patience for all that fuss. Just… tea and biscuits. That's my remedy. And it’s served me well for eighty-eight years, I might add.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications currently. And any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Not that I’ve ever noticed. I’ve eaten everything under the sun, traveled to all corners of the earth. A bit of a stuffy nose during pollen season, maybe, but that's just life. Certainly nothing serious. No hives, no swelling, no breathing difficulties. I’m a fairly robust constitution, you see. Don't react to much. I suspect my body's just too stubborn to give in.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Well, Mr. Rowbottom, I think it would be helpful if I conducted a quick physical exam. Just to listen to your abdomen, check your pulse, and do a few other basic things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. A physical exam, is it? Well, I suppose it can’t hurt. Though I doubt you’ll find anything. I’ve kept myself in decent shape, despite my age. But alright. Do what you need to do. Just… try not to poke too much. And be gentle, if you please. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’m listening to your abdomen now. I hear some normal bowel sounds. They’re a bit…active, but not overly concerning. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No tenderness, no. Just… a bit of a creak. That's just my age, I assure you. I've got a few aches and pains here and there, but nothing that would send me running to the hospital. You’re poking around a bit, aren’t you? It feels…odd. But no pain. And it's not like I’ve got a stone or anything. I know my own body, you see. And it’s just…old.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No acute tenderness. I’m just trying to assess the situation, Mr. Rowbottom. Any discomfort here on either side?
PATIENT: A bit of a rumble. Like a distant train, perhaps? It's my stomach, you understand. It's been a bit unsettled lately, as I mentioned. And...no, not really discomfort. More like…awareness. I can feel you poking around, of course. It’s not exactly pleasant, but it’s not painful. Honestly, I think you're making more of this than there is to it. A bit of loose stool, a bit of rumbling… it's just old age, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m checking your pulse now… Your pulse is a bit rapid, but not alarmingly so. And I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but again, not drastically high. So, to summarize, Mr. Rowbottom, your abdomen sounds active, but there’s no acute tenderness. Your pulse is slightly elevated and your blood pressure is a little high. Given your symptoms and medical history, I’m concerned about a few possibilities.
PATIENT: Possibilities? What possibilities? Look, I told you, it's just old age. A bit of a rumbling stomach, a bit of loose stool...it's nothing serious. What are you going to do, put me on a diet of gruel? Honestly, I've lived a long and full life. I don't need worrying about every little ache and pain.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Rowbottom. And you're right to be skeptical. I’m not suggesting you need a diet of gruel. However, given the blood in your stool, even a small amount, we need to rule out a few things. It could be something simple like hemorrhoids or a minor anal fissure, but it could also be a sign of something more serious, like diverticulitis or, less likely, a polyp. To be on the safe side, I would like to order a few tests. A complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, and a stool test to look for blood and any other abnormalities. And, because of your age and the presence of blood, I recommend a colonoscopy to rule out any polyps or other issues in the colon. What do you think?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Heavens to Betsy. You want to…look up there? Absolutely not. I’ve lived eighty-eight years without anyone sticking a camera up my…well, you know. No, absolutely not. I’m not putting myself through that. It sounds dreadful. And for what? A bit of loose stool? You're trying to scare an old man, that's what you're doing. No. No tests. No colonoscopy. I’ll just…stick to the tea and biscuits. And if it gets worse, I’ll… well, I’ll deal with it. But I’m not subjecting myself to any medical procedures. It’s unnecessary. Completely unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Rowbottom, and I respect your wishes. A colonoscopy can be unpleasant, and it’s certainly not something anyone looks forward to. However, given your age and the presence of blood in your stool, it’s the best way to rule out anything serious. If you’re absolutely opposed to a colonoscopy, we can discuss alternative options, but they won’t be as thorough. We could do a fecal immunochemical test test, which looks for hidden blood in your stool. It’s less invasive, but it doesn't provide as much information as a colonoscopy. And if the FIT test is positive, we would still recommend a colonoscopy. Ultimately, the decision is yours, Mr. Rowbottom. But I strongly advise you to consider the potential risks of not getting it checked out. I'm concerned that we could miss something important. What are your thoughts on the FIT test?
PATIENT: A…FIT test? Sounds less…invasive, I suppose. Not sticking a camera up there, that's a good start. But what does it involve? Another… sample, I presume? Honestly, I'm getting tired of talking about all this. Alright. Fine. I’ll… reluctantly agree to this FIT test. But no cameras. Absolutely no cameras. And if it comes back negative, that’s it. We drop the whole thing. I’m not going through any more procedures. Do I have to come back here with… another sample? And how long does this take? Honestly, this is all a bit of a bother.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Rowbottom, a FIT test involves a stool sample, which you can collect at home. We’ll provide you with a kit and instructions. It’s a fairly simple process. You simply collect a small sample of stool on a specific card and send it to the lab. It doesn’t require a visit to the hospital or any special preparation. The lab will contact you with the results, usually within a week or so. If it’s negative, we’ll discuss it and likely won’t need to do any further testing, as you requested. If it’s positive, it means there’s blood in your stool, and we would then recommend a colonoscopy to investigate the source. Here are the instructions. Do you have any questions about the process?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Alright. Looks… straightforward enough, I suppose. “Collect sample in clean container.” Right. I can manage that. And send it to the lab. A week, you say? Alright. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… try not to bother me until you hear something. And if it's negative, that's the end of it. No further poking and prodding. Alright then. I suppose I'll be on my way. And thank you… I think. For… not sticking a camera up there.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I promise we’ll respect your wishes. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or experience any changes in your condition. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. And thank you for coming in and letting me assess your situation. I hope you have a good day. .
