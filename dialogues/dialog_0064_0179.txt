DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. Well, it’s… the words. They are… not coming so easy these days. It’s difficult to… find them. I know it sounds strange.
DOCTOR: Not strange at all, Sherrell. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first started noticing this difficulty with finding the right words?
PATIENT: Hmm. When… it was… some months ago now, I think. Not sudden, you understand. Slowly… creeping in. I… do not recall exactly when, but it is bothering me more lately. Perhaps… six months? Or was it… longer? It’s difficult to say, truthfully. My wife… she would remember.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Sherrell. It can be hard to pinpoint these things. Six months is helpful, though. And it's good your wife has noticed it too. Has this difficulty with words affected anything specific in your daily life?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, it has. Conversations, mostly. I… hesitate. I stop mid-sentence. I have trouble explaining things to people. At work… it is… complicated. I write reports, you see. Compensation, benefits… job analysis. And sometimes… the correct phrasing escapes me. It makes it… slow. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it's impacting both your speech and your written work. Is it consistent, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm… not… always the same. Some days… better than others. Some days… it is like a fog. The words are… there, in my head, but I cannot… reach them. Other days… it is… a little clearer. It does not seem to… follow a pattern, you see. It is… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this difficulty finding words?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. I… sometimes feel a little tired, but… I am an older man, Doctor. Perhaps that is just age. I do not… think so, though. No… headaches. No… trouble with my vision. My memory… is not what it used to be, but I assume that is to be expected. Nothing… obvious, you see. Just… the words. It is mostly just… the words.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No weakness. No numbness. I… walk normally. I can… do everything I need to do. I… lift things at work, not heavy, but… enough. My hands… they are sometimes a little stiff in the morning, but… I believe that is the arthritis. I have had it for some time. It does not… interfere with anything. Just a little… discomfort. But no… no weakness or numbness.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of, besides the arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm. Arthritis, yes, in my hands. And… I had my blood pressure checked regularly for some time. It was… sometimes a little high, but… the doctor said it was nothing to worry too much about. I had a… a small operation, years ago. On my knee. But it was… very successful. I do not have any… problems with it now. My wife… she would remember the details. I am… sorry. My memory is… not the best. I do not… want to forget anything important. I do not believe there is anything else… significant. Just the arthritis and the blood pressure. And the knee operation, long ago.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherrell. It's helpful to know what you do remember. And don’t worry about details – we can always check your records. So, no other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. Nothing that… stands out. I have always been… relatively healthy, you see. I did have the… influenza, last winter. But… everyone has that, do they not? And… a bad cold, in the spring. But nothing serious. I do not believe there is… anything else. My wife… she would know for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Sherrell?
PATIENT: Medications… Just… for the arthritis. A small, white pill. I take it every morning. It helps with the… stiffness. I do not remember the name of it, truthfully. My wife… she manages most of that. And… sometimes, if I have a headache, I take… paracetamol. But that is… only when I need it. Nothing… regular.
DOCTOR: Okay. We can look up your medications in the system. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. As far as I know. I have eaten… everything. I have… never had a reaction to anything. I… I do not believe I have any allergies. My wife… she would remember if I did. I do not care for shellfish, but… that is a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, Sherrell, before we proceed, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. It will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I… trust your judgment. I am happy to… cooperate. I want to understand what is happening, you see. Will it be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't be uncomfortable at all, Sherrell. Just a routine check – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a few simple tests. I'll explain everything as I go along. If you’d like, you can sit up there, and we'll get started. First, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Okay, just relax your arm for me… Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, regular rhythm. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Everything sounds clear, but I will listen again in a few different spots.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. It is… a little warm in here, is it not? I try to relax, but… I am always a little nervous at the doctor's office. It is… good of you to listen so carefully.
DOCTOR: It is a little warm in here, you're right. I'll see if I can adjust the temperature. And it's perfectly normal to be a little nervous. Okay, lungs sound clear on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs for me. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Now, I’m going to do a brief neurological exam, just to check your coordination and balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. It is… a little difficult, but I am trying. My eyes… they are not what they used to be. Am I… doing it correctly?
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Sherrell. It's a little difficult for many people, and it's perfectly normal. Just do your best. Now, if you feel comfortable, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I can stand. It is… a little difficult to balance, Doctor. I feel… unsteady. I do not want to fall.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Sherrell. Just lean on me. It's perfectly normal to feel a little unsteady when you close your eyes. Don't worry, I’ve got you. Okay, you’re exhibiting mild unsteadiness, which could be related to age, or a number of other factors. Now, let's talk about these findings. I also noted a slight tremor in your hands when you were completing some tasks. Have you noticed this yourself?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. A tremor… in my hands? Now that you mention it… yes, I believe I have noticed a little shaking sometimes. It is… not very noticeable, but… it is there. Especially when I am… nervous. Or… when I am tired. Is it… something to worry about?
DOCTOR: It's good you’ve noticed it. The mild tremor, along with the unsteadiness and difficulty with word finding, raises some concerns, Sherrell. It could be a number of things. Given your symptoms, it's important to rule out a few possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying infections. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what might be going on. This will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. It could be something relatively benign, but it's best to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood work? Is it… serious, Doctor? What are you… looking for? I do not… like the sound of an MRI. I do not do well with… enclosed spaces.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherrell. It's natural to feel anxious when we talk about tests like these. An MRI is a very safe procedure, and it gives us a lot of valuable information. We’re not necessarily looking for anything serious, but we want to rule out potential causes of your symptoms, like a stroke, a small tumor, or any other changes in the brain. As for the enclosed space, many people feel a bit claustrophobic, and that's perfectly understandable. They often offer medication to help with anxiety, and there are even open MRIs available, which are less enclosed. We can discuss those options. The blood work is very simple – just a quick sample from your arm. It will help us rule out vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: An open MRI… That… sounds better. Much better. And the blood work… yes, that is… manageable. When would I… have these tests done? And how long will it take to… get the results? I do not want to… wait too long. It is… unsettling, not knowing what is going on.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Sherrell. We'll schedule the open MRI as soon as possible – I'll have my assistant contact you tomorrow to arrange a convenient time. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. The blood work can be done at the lab next door today, if you’re able. The results for the blood work will typically be available within 24-48 hours. The MRI results will take a little longer, usually 2-3 business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. I’ll contact you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any stressful situations and getting plenty of rest. If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms – like weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, or severe headache – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds alright. Plenty of rest… and avoid stress. That is… easier said than done. But I will… try. Thank you, Doctor. I… appreciate you taking the time to… listen to me. And for… explaining everything so clearly. It… puts my mind at ease… a little. I believe that is… all I have to ask, for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. That’s what I’m here for. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. My assistant will be in touch tomorrow to schedule those tests. Take care of yourself, and remember to get plenty of rest. We'll get to the bottom of this, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, Sherrell.
