DOCTOR: Hi Maribeth, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Amussen, it’s good to meet you as well. I’m here because… oh dear, it’s rather embarrassing. When I lie flat, it feels like I can’t… get enough air. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to worry me. I prefer to sit up, or sleep propped up with pillows. Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Maribeth. That sounds concerning. So, it’s specifically when you’re lying flat that you experience shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Yes, specifically. Sitting up, or even reclining a bit, is fine. But flat… no. It feels like something is pressing on my chest, though I don't feel any pain, just… difficulty. It’s a rather unpleasant sensation. And it keeps me awake some nights, I have to admit.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how many pillows are you usually using to prop yourself up at night?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… usually two, sometimes three if it’s a bad night. Big, fluffy ones. It has to be quite a bit of elevation, or it doesn’t help. I don't remember exactly when it started needing so many pillows, but it's definitely more than I used to need. Perhaps a month or so ago? It all blends together, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my ankles do swell up a bit by the end of the day, now that you mention it. Not terribly, but I’ve noticed it. And I feel… tired more easily than I used to. I chalked it up to getting older, but perhaps it’s connected? I haven't had a cough or anything like that. Just the breathing and the swelling and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like heart problems, lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was married for a very long time, and my late husband… he had high blood pressure. I helped him manage it for years, so I know a little about it. But I haven't been diagnosed with anything, not officially. I had a bit of arthritis in my hands, the doctor gave me some cream for that, but that’s it. Oh, and I take a water pill sometimes, for fluid retention. My regular doctor prescribed it, but I don’t take it every day, just when I'm really swollen.
DOCTOR: Okay, and do you recall the name of that water pill?
PATIENT: Oh dear, names are so difficult. Let me see… it was a small, white pill. I believe the doctor said it was… Furosemide? Yes, I think that’s it. Furosemide. I only take it when my ankles are particularly bad, maybe once or twice a week. And just a small dose, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Furosemide. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. And thankfully, I’ve never had to be hospitalized. I’ve always been a fairly healthy person, until recently, of course. Just the occasional cold, nothing serious. I always tried to take care of myself, eat well, get some exercise… though lately, with the breathing, it's been harder to stay active.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother lived to be 95, a very strong woman. She had a bit of arthritis, like me, but otherwise, she was quite healthy. My father… he passed away when I was young, a heart condition, I believe. And my brother… he had some trouble with his weight, but I don't recall any other major health problems in the family. We weren’t a particularly sickly bunch, if that makes sense. I always thought I’d inherit my mother’s good health, but… well.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And just to round things out, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue… I’m very fortunate in that regard. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite foolish being here complaining about this breathing. It just feels… odd, and I'd rather get it checked out than worry about it.
DOCTOR: You're not foolish at all, Maribeth. It’s good you're getting it checked out. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also take your blood pressure and check your legs for swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on. And perhaps get back to sleeping a little more comfortably.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. Lungs sound a bit diminished at the bases, especially on the right side. I do hear some crackles there as well. And yes, I do feel some swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. It's mild to moderate, but present. Blood pressure is 150/90. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing heart failure. The shortness of breath when lying flat, the swelling in your ankles, the fatigue… these are all common symptoms. The crackles in your lungs suggest there’s some fluid build-up. However, we need to do some tests to confirm this. I'd like to order an EKG, a chest x-ray, and some blood work, including a BNP level, which helps assess heart function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Heart failure? That sounds… serious. I confess, Doctor, I wasn’t expecting that. But if that’s what it sounds like, then I suppose we should find out for sure. An EKG, a chest x-ray, blood work… yes, please, do whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment. I do hope it’s not too serious. What exactly do those tests do? I suppose I should have paid more attention in health class.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions, Maribeth. It can sound scary, but we're just gathering information right now. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, records the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us see if there’s any irregular heartbeat or damage to the heart muscle. A chest x-ray will show us the size and shape of your heart and lungs, and if there’s any fluid build-up in your lungs. And the blood work, especially the BNP level, is a marker released by your heart when it's under stress. We’ll get those tests ordered right away. The nurse will come in to draw your blood and schedule the x-ray. In the meantime, I’m going to adjust your Furosemide dosage slightly to help with the fluid retention. We’ll start with 20 milligrams once daily and see how that goes. And I want you to monitor your weight daily. If you notice a sudden weight gain, especially more than 2 pounds in a day, let us know right away.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That explains things a bit better. Furosemide dosage… I can certainly do that. And I will monitor my weight, absolutely. Two pounds… noted. It’s just… a lot to take in. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse, then? I hope these tests aren’t too uncomfortable.
