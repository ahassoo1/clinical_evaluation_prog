DOCTOR: Hi Deloris, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, lovely office you have here. It’s…something about a letter, I think? For a pet. My…ex-husband, he needed something. Honestly, I don’t really remember the details. He just asked me to come get it. It’s probably for that…dog. A big fluffy thing. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here a request from your ex-husband for a health certificate for Winston, your dog. It seems he needs it for travel, possibly?
PATIENT: Travel, yes! That sounds right. He’s always going…somewhere. Honestly, I barely see Winston anymore. He took him when…well, it doesn’t matter. Is this a complicated letter? Because I really don't have a lot of time today. I have a hair appointment later, and you know those book up fast.
DOCTOR: No, it's not complicated at all. It just requires a quick check-up to make sure Winston is healthy enough to travel. I’ll need to check his vaccination records and do a brief physical exam. Do you happen to have Winston’s records with you?
PATIENT: Oh, records… Honestly, no. He would have those. He's very organized, my ex. Always was. I doubt I’ve even seen Winston’s records. Would it be okay if you just…called him? He’s probably got them saved on his phone or something. It’s…Harold. Harold Finch. Though, honestly, don't expect a quick answer. He can be…difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, we can try calling Harold. It might be faster to have you contact him directly, though, if possible. Sometimes information gets lost in translation over the phone. But we can certainly try. In the meantime, perhaps you could tell me a little bit about Winston?
PATIENT: Oh, Winston… He's a…Goldendoodle, I think? Very fluffy. Sheds everywhere. He's…big. A big, fluffy shedder. He likes to bark. A lot. Honestly, I wasn't a dog person, but Harold insisted. He said it would be "good for the family." Well, he enjoyed the family. I mostly just stepped around him. What do you need to know about him? Is it something important?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know he's a Goldendoodle – that gives me a better idea of potential breed-specific concerns. Knowing he barks a lot is good too – sometimes excessive barking can indicate stress or underlying medical issues, though it's often just personality. We’ll do a quick exam to check his overall health - listen to his heart and lungs, check his teeth and gums, and feel his joints. Do you know if Winston has had any health problems in the past – any allergies, skin issues, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Now that you mention it, Harold always said he had sensitive skin. Kept buying special shampoo and everything. Red patches sometimes, I think. And he’d scratch a lot. A lot of scratching. Though, honestly, he probably just liked the attention. Harold was always fussing over him. And… oh! He had a funny thing with his ears. They’d get…gunky sometimes. Harold would clean them with cotton balls. It was… a whole production. Honestly, I tried to avoid it as much as possible. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. Sensitive skin, red patches, excessive scratching, and gunky ears – that points towards potential allergies or a skin infection. We’ll definitely take a look at his skin and ears during the exam. To get a better picture, has he been on any medications recently?
PATIENT: Medications… oh dear. You're asking me to remember things Harold would deal with. Let me think. I vaguely recall… something for fleas? A topical thing, I think. He put it on his back. And maybe…an allergy pill? A little blue one? Honestly, I really wasn't involved in his vet care. Harold handled all of that. He’s…very particular about Winston’s health. He probably has a whole file on the poor dog. Can’t you just call him? This is… stressful, trying to recall all this.
DOCTOR: I understand it's stressful. We can definitely call Harold, and I’ll document that you’re unsure of the specific medications. It’s perfectly alright that you’re not involved in his direct care. Just knowing he’s had flea and allergy medication is helpful. Okay, let’s proceed with a quick physical exam. If you don’t mind, could you please step over here and I’ll start with listening to his heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Fine. But if I start to sneeze, it’s your fault. Harold says Winston carries a lot of allergens. Honestly, it’s a miracle I haven’t come down with something already. Just…try to be quick, okay? I have a very important appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart and lungs sound clear. No wheezing or unusual sounds. Now, I’ll just take a look at your throat and ears… No signs of any immediate infection or inflammation. Everything looks normal so far. Do you have any pain or tenderness anywhere?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. Don’t poke me. I don't like being touched. Honestly, I just want this letter and to get to my appointment. Is this taking much longer? I think my stylist is going to kill me if I'm late. He's very good.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not taking much longer at all. Just a few more quick checks. I just want to rule out anything obvious. I’ll quickly palpate your lymph nodes and then we’ll be finished. Your lymph nodes feel normal. No swelling or tenderness. Okay, that’s everything. Now, about the health certificate for Winston…do you know where Harold usually takes him for veterinary care?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Yes! Harold takes him to… Dr. Peterson, I think? On Elm Street? The one with the… cats. He’s obsessed with cats. Honestly, it’s a little strange. He spends more time talking about their cats than about Winston. And he always makes me wait in the waiting room, even though I'm the one bringing Winston. It's… humiliating. Can you just call them and get the certificate? I don’t want to have to deal with this anymore. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly reasonable. I’ll call Dr. Peterson’s office now and see if we can get a copy of Winston’s records and arrange for the health certificate. “Good morning, this is Dr. Rosanova’s office. I’m calling regarding a patient, Winston, and his owner, Deloris Wrye. We’re assisting with a travel health certificate…” Okay, good news. Dr. Peterson’s office is able to fax over Winston's records. They're sending them now and can email a copy of the health certificate once it’s been completed. They estimate about an hour. So, it’ll be about an hour before we have everything finalized. I apologize for the delay. Would you like to wait here, or would you prefer I call you when it’s ready?
PATIENT: An hour?! Absolutely not. Call me. I have… things to do. Very important things. And please, don’t bother me unless it’s absolutely necessary. Honestly, this has been… a whole ordeal. What’s your number? Just…don’t call me with questions about Winston. I don't know anything about that dog. .
DOCTOR: Alright, you have my number. I’ll call you as soon as the records and certificate are ready. Thank you for your patience, Deloris. Have a good day, and enjoy your appointment.
