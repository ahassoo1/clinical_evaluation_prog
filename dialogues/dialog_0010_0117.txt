DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah. Just… a cough. Been coughin’ up stuff. Not good stuff, you know? Little bit of… red in it. Been happenin’ a while now. I smoke, if that matters. Don't remember exactly how long now, though. Long time, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough with some blood-tinged mucus. And you mentioned you smoke. Thank you for being upfront about that, Mr. Reyno; it does matter. Can you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: More… uh. It’s mostly in the mornings. When I first wake up. Gets better as the day goes on, usually. Not always, though. Sometimes it… lingers. It’s a dry cough mostly, but then… then it gets that stuff. I… honestly don't remember if it started with the blood, or if the blood came later. It's kinda all blurry, you know? My head ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Reyno. It’s perfectly alright if details are a bit hazy. We can work through it. So, it's primarily a morning cough that sometimes persists throughout the day, and you’ve noticed blood-tinged mucus at times. Is there anything that seems to trigger the cough – like exercise, cold air, or lying down?
PATIENT: Trigger… hmm. Cold air, maybe? When I go outside in the winter, it gets worse for sure. Exercise… not really. I don’t do much of that these days. Lying down… no, not really. It’s just… there when I wake up. And sometimes… other times, too. I really wish I could remember when it started. It’s just… been a while. It’s botherin’ me more lately, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so cold air seems to be a trigger. And it's been worsening recently. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I get… tired. Real tired. But I’m always tired, you know? Old age, I guess. Uh… sometimes a little short of breath. Not bad, though. Just… when I walk up the stairs, maybe. I get… kinda wheezy sometimes? Like a whistling sound when I breathe. That happen? I… I don’t even know if that’s right. It feels like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, some shortness of breath with exertion like walking stairs, and a whistling sound when you breathe—what we call wheezing. Have you had a fever, chills, or any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I know of. Chills… sometimes I get cold, but that's just the house, you know? Old house, drafty. Weight loss… uh. I haven't been weighin’ myself. I… I don't know if I've lost weight. I eat okay, I guess. Not like I used to, but… enough. Honestly, doc, I'm just tryin' to get this cough fixed. It’s gettin' on my nerves.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Reyno. We'll do our best to figure it out. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, COPD, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Uh… pneumonia, maybe? A long time ago. When I was a kid, I think. But that was… a long time ago. Everything was a long time ago, doc. Asthma… no, I don't think so. COPD… what’s that? Bronchitis… maybe? The doctor gave me somethin’ for it once, but I don't remember. I been to a lot of doctors, over the years. They all kinda blur together.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible history of pneumonia as a child, and some vague recollections of bronchitis treatment. And you mentioned a lot of doctors over the years. Do you happen to know who your primary care physician was most recently?
PATIENT: Primary… uh. No, I don’t. I just go to whoever’s available, you know? The clinic down the road, usually. Don’t really have a regular doctor. Just go when somethin’ hurts. I… I don’t really like goin’ to the doctor, honestly. It never helps much.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Mr. Reyno. Let’s talk about your smoking history. You mentioned you smoke. Approximately how many packs a day do you smoke, and for how many years have you been smoking?
PATIENT: Ugh. Packs a day… used to be two. Now… maybe a pack and a half. For how long… oh, lord. Since I was… eighteen? Maybe younger. A long time. A long time. I… I don’t even want to think about it. It was a bad habit. Still is, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately a pack and a half a day for many years, starting around age eighteen. That’s valuable information, thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not that I know of. I take somethin’ for my blood pressure, but I haven’t had any problems with that. The doctor gave me somethin’ for allergies once, but I don’t remember what it was. Honestly, doc, I’m a bit confused now. All these questions…
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m overwhelming you, Mr. Reyno. We're just trying to get a complete picture. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Just… get it over with, please. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m listening to your breathing now. I do hear some wheezing, as you mentioned, especially when you exhale. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92, and your pulse is 88 and regular. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. Your oxygen saturation is 93%, which is a little low. Your lymph nodes feel normal. Based on what you’ve told me and this quick exam, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate further. Given your smoking history, the cough, the wheezing, and the low oxygen saturation, it’s important to rule out COPD, bronchitis, and pneumonia, as well as consider other potential causes. Do you have any questions about what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: COPD… what is that? And pneumonia… I thought I already had that. Look, doc, I just want somethin’ to stop this cough. All these big words… I don’t understand any of it. Can’t you just give me somethin' for the cough? A shot or somethin'?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Reyno. COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It's a lung condition that makes it hard to breathe, often caused by smoking. It's not the same as pneumonia, though it can sometimes happen with pneumonia. You may have had pneumonia once, but we need to check if you have it now. I can’t simply give you something for the cough without knowing the cause of the cough. Giving medication without a proper diagnosis could potentially be harmful, or simply won’t work. We need to do some tests to figure out what’s going on. I would like to order a chest X-ray and a blood test to check for infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests. Okay, fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I got stuff to do, remember? And… can I at least get somethin' temporary for the cough? Just to hold me over 'til the tests come back? It's really botherin’ me, doc.
DOCTOR: I understand. While we wait for the results, I can prescribe you a cough suppressant to help manage the symptoms, but it won't address the underlying cause. It’s a temporary measure, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Good. That's… that's somethin’, at least. So, what do I need to do about these tests? Where do I go? And how long will it take?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll send an order to the radiology department here at the clinic for the chest X-ray. You can go to the radiology suite right down the hall; the receptionist will be expecting you. They'll need your insurance information. As for the blood test, the lab is just across from radiology. I'll give you a lab slip. It should take about an hour or so for both tests, depending on how busy they are. The results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours, and my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions about that process?
PATIENT: Okay. Radiology… lab… nurse… 24 to 48 hours. Alright. I think… I think I got it. Insurance card’s in my wallet, I think. Look, doc, thank you. I appreciate you… tryin’, at least.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Reyno. I’m glad I could help, even a little. Here are the orders for the X-ray and bloodwork. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. I wish you well, and hope you feel better soon. And remember, try to take it easy.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you.
