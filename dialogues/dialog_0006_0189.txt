DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, it’s about my… well, my business. Been seeing some red in the bowl, if you catch my drift. Not a pretty sight, I tell you. And I don’t appreciate having to come to a doctor for this. Used to handle things myself, back in my day.
DOCTOR: Right, alright. Blood in the stool… I understand. It’s good you came in, even if it's not ideal. It is important to figure out what’s causing that. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, a few days now. Maybe four? Five? Honestly, I don’t keep a calendar for… that. It started suddenly, which is what bothered me. I usually… things are usually pretty regular, you see? Never had trouble before. Though, things do change when you get to be my age, don't they? Not that I’m complaining… much.
DOCTOR: Yes, things certainly can change as we get older. Sudden changes are something we need to look into. And you said just a few days?
PATIENT: Yes, a few days. And it's not a lot of blood, mind you. Just… streaks. Like someone swished a bit of red paint around. Not enough to… well, you understand. But enough to make a fella uneasy. I’ve eaten plenty of beets, though. Could be that, couldn’t it? I had some pickled beets with dinner the night before it started.
DOCTOR: Beets can definitely cause that, yes. It’s good you’re thinking about those things. Still, we should rule out other causes. Have you noticed any pain with… passing stool?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A bit of… straining, maybe. But I’ve always had to strain a bit. Old man problems, you know? Everything’s… slowing down. Not a sharp pain, or anything alarming like that. Just… effort. And a little discomfort afterwards, but that could be from pushing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits other than the blood?
PATIENT: Habits? Well, let me think... It's been a bit… looser, perhaps? Not full-blown diarrhea, mind you. Just… not as solid as it used to be. And I've been going a little more often, maybe once or twice extra a day. Though, like I said, things change. Hard to keep track of everything when you're my age. I drink my prune juice, so that probably has something to do with it, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Prune juice can definitely contribute to that. Okay. And what about any abdominal pain, bloating, or nausea?
PATIENT: Bloating… hmm. A little bit of gas, maybe? But who doesn't have gas? I wouldn’t call it bloating. And nausea? No, not a bit. I haven’t been sick to my stomach. I have a good appetite, still. Always have. Can't abide a man with no appetite. Now, abdominal pain… a little bit of a rumble sometimes, but nothing serious. Just the usual old man noises, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Humph. Well, I had my prostate checked a few years back. They said it was… enlarged. Common thing, apparently. Other than that… nothing major. I've been a pretty healthy fella, all my life. Worked hard, stayed active. Didn’t spend much time sitting around. Don’t hold with all these fancy doctor visits unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, enlarged prostate. And no other major diagnoses. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had my appendix taken out when I was a boy. Back in ‘38, I believe it was. Simple operation. And… oh, I had a hernia repaired, years ago. While I was flying. A bit of a nuisance, but they fixed it right up. Other than that, no. I've been lucky, I suppose. Didn't need much fixing.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix and hernia repair. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not a fan of pills, if I can help it. A bit of aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. I believe in letting my body do its own healing. All these medicines just muck things up, in my opinion. I had a friend, took a bunch of pills, ended up worse than before. No thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had an allergy in my life. I can eat anything. Well, almost anything. Don't much care for oysters, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. Strong constitution, I tell you. Never had much trouble with sickness or allergies. A good, strong Haida bloodline, that's what it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don’t mind. Just checking your abdomen and a quick rectal exam, to rule things out. It’s pretty standard procedure in this situation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. A rectal exam? Now you’re talking. Look, I’ve lived a long life, and I’m not one for poking and prodding. I’ve got my dignity, you know. And I came here because of a little bit of red paint in the bowl, not because I need a… thorough inspection. I suppose if you insist… but I’m not happy about it. And make it quick. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s not the most comfortable exam, but it’s important for ruling out more serious causes of the bleeding, like polyps or… other issues. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let's just listen to your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Sigh. Fine. But don’t go poking around too much. And try not to make a mess. This table doesn't look very clean. Get on with it, then. The sooner this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Breathing sounds are clear. No unusual noises in the abdomen… a bit of normal bowel activity. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I’m just going to need you to bend over slightly…
PATIENT: Grumbling under his breath Bending over… at my age… ridiculous. Hmph. Just get it over with, doctor. I haven't got all day, you know. And be careful! I don’t want any surprises. shifts uncomfortably on the table A little red paint, that's all it was… shouldn't need all this fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright. I didn't feel any obvious masses or tenderness. There was some… mild hemorrhoidal swelling, but nothing concerning. There was a small amount of blood on the glove, consistent with what you described. Based on the exam, it’s possible it’s just hemorrhoids causing the bleeding, especially with the mild swelling. However, given your age and the fact that it's a new symptom, I want to be cautious.
PATIENT: Hemorrhoids? Hmph. That's what I thought. Old man problems. But you still want to poke around? Doctor's always want to do something. Well, go on then. What's this going to cost me? And don't tell me it's "for my own good."
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Your records indicate no previous colonoscopies or significant gastrointestinal issues. Given your age and the new onset of bleeding, I recommend a fecal occult blood test, to check for hidden blood in your stool. That's a simple test you can do at home. And, ideally, a colonoscopy would be the best way to rule out anything more serious, like polyps or cancer. I understand you’re not keen on further testing, but it's a standard procedure for someone your age presenting with this symptom. The FOBT is a good starting point. The colonoscopy... we can discuss that further if the FOBT comes back positive. As for cost, since you're uninsured, the FOBT should be relatively inexpensive. The colonoscopy would be more substantial, but we can look into options for financial assistance at the hospital. I'm not trying to alarm you, Mr. Rowbottom, just being thorough. Would you be willing to do the fecal occult blood test?
PATIENT: Sighs heavily. A test, of course. Always a test. I knew it. Hmph. Fine. A little test I can do at home... that's acceptable. Less poking and prodding. But if it comes back positive, I’m not promising anything about a colonoscopy. I’ve lived a long life, doctor. I don’t need any unnecessary procedures. Financial assistance… what a mess. Just get me the test, then. And don't bother with all the scare tactics. I understand the risks. I’m not a fool.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the instructions for the FOBT. It’s a fairly simple process – you collect a small sample of your stool three times over a few days. The kit includes everything you need, and the lab will contact you with the results. I’ll also write you a note for a slight dietary adjustment – avoiding red meat and certain medications for a few days before the test. And I'll include my contact information, should you have any questions. If the results come back positive, we can discuss the colonoscopy again. I understand your concerns, and we can explore all your options. For now, let’s start with this test and see what it reveals. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get me out of here. This has been a waste of time. Takes the instructions with a dismissive wave Red meat… more restrictions. Muttering under his breath Fine. I'll do the test. Now if you'll excuse me, I’ve got things to do. Slowly begins to get off the examination table, looking annoyed. Don’t expect a call if it’s just a little blood. I've got better things to worry about than poking around in… well, you know. Starts shuffling towards the door.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand. Take your time. And please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns.
