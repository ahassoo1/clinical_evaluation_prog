DOCTOR: Alright. Soila McConnon, 90 years old. Yes. Well, let’s get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello, dear. It’s… it’s my tummy. It feels big, you know? And I don’t want much food these days. Not like I used to. Everything feels… heavy. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A little bit at a time, I think.
DOCTOR: “Big,” you say. And not much appetite. “Heavy.” Right. Vague symptoms, unfortunately. It’s difficult to pinpoint anything without specifics. Can you describe the “big” feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specifics… that's hard. It’s just… full. Like I ate a lot, but I didn't. And hard, maybe? Not painful, not really. Just… there. It’s uncomfortable when I lie down, sometimes. I used to be a sociologist, you know. We talked about people, not… tummies. It’s all so different now. I don’t understand all these questions.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, people are… less predictable than organs, I suppose. “Full” and “hard,” not painful. And it bothers you when lying down. Alright. And has this affected your… bowel movements at all?
PATIENT: Oh… bowel movements? That’s a… private question, isn’t it? Um… not so much. Maybe a little less, but… I’ve always been regular, if you know what I mean. Old lady problems, I guess. Everything slows down when you get old. I used to study families, you know. Such interesting creatures, people are. Not like this… feeling. Is this bad? I'm getting worried now.
DOCTOR: “Old lady problems.” Yes. Look, at your age, things do slow down. It’s… normal. But we still need to rule things out. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh dear… no, I haven’t been weighing myself. I used to… when my husband was alive, we had a scale. But he's gone now, a long time ago. I think… maybe I’ve lost a little? My clothes feel… looser. But I don’t pay much attention anymore. It's just me, you see. I eat what I can when I feel like it. Not much, though. Everything tastes a little… bland now. Do you think it’s just old age?
DOCTOR: Alright. No scale, clothes are looser, appetite is down, and food tastes bland. And you’re uninsured. Right. Let's do a quick exam, then. Just to be thorough. Lie back on the table, please. I’ll listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Oh dear. Alright. If you think it’s best. It’s just… I don’t like being poked and prodded. But you’re the doctor, I suppose. I used to interview people all day, you know. They let me do the poking and prodded with questions! Be gentle, dear. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out… Okay. A little tenderness in the lower abdomen, but nothing alarming. Your abdomen is… distended, as you mentioned. Soft, but definitely enlarged. Bowel sounds are present, though a bit diminished. No masses that I can feel. Nothing immediately concerning, but we should probably run a basic blood test, just to check for anemia and rule out anything obvious.
PATIENT: Blood test? Oh dear… I don't like needles. I always faint, you know. Always have. My husband used to hold my hand… Anemia? What’s that? Is that… serious? I just want to feel normal again. I used to be so strong, you know. A busy sociologist, traveling and talking to people all day. Now I just… sit. And my tummy hurts sometimes. Will the blood test tell you what’s wrong?
DOCTOR: “Anemia” means low red blood cells. It can cause fatigue, weakness... which you’re already experiencing. The blood test will help us determine if that’s a factor. And yes, it might tell us something. Look, a little prick is better than letting this go. We'll get it over with quickly. And frankly, at your age, a lot of these symptoms overlap with… well, simply getting older. But we have to rule things out. I’ll write you a lab order. Just go to the lab downstairs. They're used to… anxious patients. And no, it won’t be a definitive answer, but it's a starting point.
PATIENT: Oh… downstairs, you say? That sounds… far. And anxious patients… that’s me, I suppose. I just… I worry. About everything. My husband always said I was a worrier. Will it hurt a lot? And what if it’s something bad? I don't want to be a bother, you know. I just want to feel like myself again. Perhaps… perhaps it is just old age. I used to study families, you know. Such fragile things, people are. And getting older… it's a fragile thing too. Do you think I should bring someone with me downstairs?
DOCTOR: Look, it's just a blood test. A small prick. It won’t hurt “a lot.” And yes, it’s probably just old age. But we’ve done the minimum to be certain. Bringing someone with you is… a good idea, if it makes you feel more comfortable. But it’s really quite simple. Lab downstairs, tell them Dr. Dechene sent you. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I suppose not. Thank you, dear. You’ve been… very thorough. Although… a little rushed. Downstairs… right. I’ll try not to be a bother. It’s just… I get so flustered, you know? Always have. Well… thank you again. Perhaps… perhaps it really is just old age. I used to study families. .
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Get the test done. And try not to worry. .
