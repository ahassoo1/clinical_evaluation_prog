DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… it’s my water. I keep getting… trouble with it. It hurts when I… go. It’s happened a few times now. I don’t… I don’t really remember exactly how many times. It’s just… unpleasant. I’d like it to stop, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene, I understand. You're experiencing pain when you urinate, and it's happened more than once. We definitely want to figure out what's causing that and get it stopped for you. To help me understand a little better, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Describe it… Well, it burns, mostly. A sharp burn, low down. And sometimes… sometimes I feel like I can’t… empty everything. It’s not a bad pain all the time, but it’s… worrying. I don’t remember it being this bad before, but my memory… isn’t what it used to be. Is that alright? I'm trying to be helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Claudene. You’re being very helpful. A burning sensation is important information. And feeling like you’re not completely emptying your bladder is also something we need to investigate. Now, has there been any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear… I… I don’t think so. Not that I recall. It’s… it’s been a while since I really looked, if you understand. I try not to… focus on it too much. It’s just… unpleasant, the whole thing. I really don’t know. Is that… a bad sign if there was? I get so confused with all of this.
DOCTOR: It's okay to not be sure, Claudene, and it's perfectly understandable that you wouldn't necessarily check for blood. It's good that you're letting me know what you recall. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… Hmm. Let me think. I felt a bit warm last week, maybe? But I thought it was just the weather. It’s been awfully hot. And my back… well, my back always aches a little. I’m an older woman, you know. Everything aches! I don’t know if that’s… different than usual. It's hard to say, really. I'm sorry I'm not more… precise.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Claudene. It’s perfectly normal to have aches and pains, and it's helpful to know what feels typical for you. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical… history. That’s… a long time ago. I had… something with my blood pressure, I think. Years and years ago. The doctor put me on pills for a while, but I stopped taking them. I didn’t feel well on them. And… I think I had a touch of arthritis in my hands. Nothing serious. Really, I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Or, I was healthy. Before this… water trouble. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Claudene. It's helpful to know about the blood pressure medication and the arthritis. We’ll need to get a more complete picture, but that's a good start. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Or, not that I remember. I used to get stung by bees when I was a little girl, but that didn’t… well, that didn’t kill me. I don’t think that counts. I really don’t believe in allergies, to be honest. It’s all… modern nonsense, if you ask me. But, no, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not anymore. I used to take something for my… well, for my nerves. Years ago. But the doctor said it wasn't helping, so I stopped. And I don’t really believe in taking pills, if I can avoid it. I prefer a cup of chamomile tea. Does that count? No, I don’t take any medications regularly. Just the tea. Is that alright? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Claudene. Chamomile tea is perfectly fine! It's good to know you’re not on any regular medications. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know of anyone in your family who has had problems with their kidneys or bladder, or any similar issues?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. That’s… a very long time ago. My mother… she had a weak stomach. Always complaining about it. And my grandmother… she had something with her… waterworks, I think. But I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago. No one ever talked about it much. I don’t think anyone had anything serious with their kidneys. Just… little things. I'm afraid I can't be much help with that. Honestly, I've a terrible memory for family things. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Claudene. It’s completely understandable. You’ve given me what you recall, and that’s helpful. And finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Smoking? Never! My husband used to smoke, but I made him stop. It’s a terrible habit. And alcohol… well, I used to have a glass of sherry with dinner, years ago. But I don’t drink anymore. It doesn’t agree with me. I prefer a nice cup of tea. I live a very quiet life, mostly. Just me and my cat. Is that alright? I hope I'm not taking up too much of your time. It’s just… this water trouble is very worrying. .
DOCTOR: No, you're not taking up too much of my time at all, Claudene. I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. It paints a good picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
