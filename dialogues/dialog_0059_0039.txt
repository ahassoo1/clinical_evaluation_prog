DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. My regular doctor – old Doc Hemmings, lovely man – he just told me my cholesterol was a bit high at my check-up. Said I ought to come see someone… a specialist, he called it. Something about numbers being too high, and I need to… well, I guess figure out what to do about it. He didn’t explain much beyond that, bless his heart. He’s getting on in years, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Dr. Hemmings is a fine physician. It’s good you’re following up on this. High cholesterol is something we want to address. “Numbers being too high” can mean a few different things, so let’s get a clearer picture. First, do you happen to recall what those numbers were, if Dr. Hemmings shared them with you?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. He did write it down on a little slip of paper… Here it is… yes. Okay, let’s see… total cholesterol was 240, I think. And… LDL was 160? And HDL was… 40. Those are the ones he underlined. Honestly, it just looked like a bunch of numbers to me. I never was good with remembering things like that. But I made sure to bring the paper!
DOCTOR: Excellent, thank you for bringing that in. Those numbers do give us a good starting point. A total cholesterol of 240 is above the optimal range, and an LDL of 160 is also elevated. Your HDL is a bit on the lower side as well. To give me a better understanding of your overall health, and what might be contributing to these numbers, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Never had any serious illnesses, knock on wood. Had the usual childhood things – measles, mumps, chickenpox… but that was a long time ago! I had my appendix out when I was about twenty, but that was the biggest thing until… oh, about ten years ago, my blood pressure got a little high. Doc Hemmings put me on a little pill for it, and it’s been fine ever since. Besides that… just the aches and pains of getting old, I suppose! I used to be quite the carpenter, you know, but my hands aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that you’ve been generally healthy. Having your appendix removed and managing your blood pressure are important pieces of the puzzle. And it sounds like you’ve stayed active with carpentry for many years, which is wonderful. Just to clarify, are you currently taking any medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, good question! I completely forgot. I take something for my joints, too. Arthritis, you know. It’s called… let me think… Celebrex. Just one a day, keeps the stiffness at bay. And sometimes, if my arthritis is really acting up, Doc Hemmings lets me take an extra Tylenol. But that's it, I promise. Nothing fancy. Mostly just trying to keep moving, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, thank you. Celebrex and occasional Tylenol – good. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a tricky one. My mother, she lived to be 92, and she was as healthy as a horse right up until the end. But my father… he had a heart attack when he was in his fifties. Pretty sudden, as I recall. And my sister… she had high blood pressure, like me. She had to take pills for it, too. But other than that… I don’t really know much about heart trouble on either side of the family. We weren’t really a family to talk about medical things, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for families not to discuss these things openly. Knowing about your father’s heart attack and your sister’s high blood pressure is important, though. It suggests there might be a genetic predisposition to cardiovascular issues. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I’m retired now, so I don’t have a lot of stress in my life. I used to work as a supervisor for protective services, mostly making sure things were running smoothly. It was a good job, but it could be demanding at times. Nowadays, I mostly take it easy. I enjoy gardening, reading… and I like to watch the baseball games on TV. I try to stay active, but my knees don't always cooperate. As for diet… I try to eat healthy, but I have a bit of a sweet tooth. My wife, God rest her soul, she used to bake the best apple pie you ever tasted. I still miss that pie.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve had a fulfilling life, Mr. Bohnett. And it’s good that you’re staying engaged with hobbies. It’s very common to enjoy a treat now and then, and it’s understandable to miss your wife’s apple pie. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Doc Hemmings always asked, and I always told him no. I’ve taken a few different things over the years for aches and pains, and never had any trouble. I haven’t had any reactions, not ever. I can’t think of a single thing I’m allergic to, actually. But I’m always careful to tell the pharmacist if a new medicine looks different. You can never be too cautious, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, and it’s very wise to be cautious. Alright, Mr. Bohnett, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam now, if you’re comfortable with that. This will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your abdomen. It will give me a better sense of your overall health and help me determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve been to doctors enough times to know what to expect. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally, please. Okay. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Finally, I’ll just palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Alright, Mr. Bohnett, thank you for your patience. Those findings are all within reasonable limits, considering your blood pressure reading. Now, based on everything we’ve discussed, along with your cholesterol numbers, I believe we should start with some lifestyle modifications and possibly consider medication if those aren't enough. Would you like to discuss those options?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Lifestyle modifications… I suppose I figured that might be part of it. What sort of things are you thinking? I’m willing to try, of course. I just… well, at my age, it’s harder to change habits. But I’ll do my best. What about medication? What are the options there? And what are the… side effects, if you don't mind me asking? I always worry about those.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Bohnett, and a common concern. It’s never too late to make positive changes, and we’ll take it one step at a time. Regarding lifestyle modifications, the most important things are diet and exercise. Specifically, reducing saturated and trans fats in your diet – things like red meat, processed foods, and fried foods – and increasing your intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Even a small reduction in saturated fat can make a difference. As for exercise, aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days of the week is ideal. That could be walking, gardening, or anything that gets your heart rate up a bit. Now, regarding medication, the most commonly prescribed medications for high cholesterol are statins. They work by blocking an enzyme in the liver that produces cholesterol. They’re very effective at lowering LDL cholesterol and reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke. However, like all medications, statins can have side effects. The most common side effect is muscle pain or weakness, but this is relatively rare. Other less common side effects include liver problems and an increased risk of diabetes. It's important to remember that the benefits of statins generally outweigh the risks, especially for someone with your cholesterol numbers and family history. We can start with lifestyle modifications for three months, and then recheck your cholesterol levels. If those aren’t sufficient, we can discuss starting a statin. What are your thoughts on that approach?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Three months of trying to eat better and move around more. I can do that. It won’t be easy, mind you, but I can certainly try. And then we’ll see where we stand. You mentioned walking… my knees aren’t what they used to be. Do you think swimming would be a good option? It’s easier on the joints, and I used to enjoy it quite a bit. And as for the diet… is there anything you can recommend? A website or a book, perhaps? I wouldn't know where to start, honestly. I’m used to my wife’s cooking, and she didn’t really follow recipes. It was all just… instinct.
DOCTOR: Swimming is an excellent option, Mr. Bohnett! It’s very low-impact and a great way to get exercise without putting stress on your knees. Absolutely, do that. As for diet, I recommend the American Heart Association website – heart.org – they have a wealth of information on heart-healthy eating. They also have some simple recipes that you might find helpful. Another good resource is the Dietary Guidelines for Americans – dietaryguidelines.gov – it’s a bit more technical, but it provides a good overview of healthy eating principles. I can also provide you with a handout that summarizes some key recommendations for a heart-healthy diet. It includes a list of foods to eat more of, foods to limit, and foods to avoid. This handout also includes information on portion control, which is important. It’s not just what you eat, but how much you eat. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Bohnett?
PATIENT: That's very helpful, Doctor, thank you. The websites and the handout… that’s exactly what I needed. I think I can manage with that. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not rushing me. It makes a big difference. So, three months of trying to eat better and move more, and then we’ll check those numbers again? And if they’re still too high, we’ll talk about the medication? Is that correct? I just want to make sure I understand everything.
DOCTOR: That is absolutely correct, Mr. Bohnett. Three months of focusing on diet and exercise, and then we’ll recheck your cholesterol levels. If those aren’t sufficient, we can discuss starting a statin. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. I want you to know that I'm happy to answer any questions that come up during those three months. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or need any guidance. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for three months from today. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. A follow-up appointment in three months… I’ll mark it on my calendar right away. Thank you again for everything. You’ve put my mind at ease. I feel much better knowing I have a plan. I’ll do my best to follow your advice. I think that’s all for today. Unless… is there anything you need from me before I leave? Any forms I need to fill out, or anything like that? I want to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything.
DOCTOR: No, you haven’t forgotten anything at all, Mr. Bohnett. Everything is in order. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking such an active role in your health. Just remember to focus on making small, sustainable changes. Don’t try to overhaul your entire lifestyle overnight. Start with one or two things, and then gradually add more as you get comfortable. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you again in three months. If you have any questions before then, please don’t hesitate to call. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Bohnett. Have a wonderful day.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor Chagaris. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I will, thank you. And I will be sure to call if I have any questions. Have a good day to you as well. .
