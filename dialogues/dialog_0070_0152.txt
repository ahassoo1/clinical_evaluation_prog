DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a bit high. That’s why I’m here. Hyper… something, I believe the lady on the phone said. I don’t really understand all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Hyperlipidemia, Ms. Geho – that’s the high cholesterol. It’s quite common, and we can certainly discuss it. It's good you came in to have it checked out. To get a better understanding of the situation, could you tell me a little bit more about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, hyper…lipidemia. Good to know what it is called! Well, I think I’m pretty healthy, actually. I try to be. I walk most days, about a mile or so. I eat… mostly good food. Not a lot of sweets, though I do like a cookie now and then. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Is that helpful? Should I tell you about my family?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Geho. It sounds like you're taking good care of yourself. Walking a mile a day is excellent, and a balanced diet is key. And yes, please do tell me about your family history. Knowing if anyone in your family has had high cholesterol, heart disease, or other related conditions can give us a better picture of your risk. Did your parents or siblings have any health issues like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. She was on medicine for it, for a long time. And my father, he… well, he had a heart attack when he was in his sixties. It was sudden. Not a good thing. My brother, he’s pretty healthy, as far as I know. He doesn’t talk much about his health. I think he eats a lot of fast food, to be honest. Does that matter? Should I have asked him if he’s been checked? I feel bad now, maybe I should call him.
DOCTOR: That’s important information, Ms. Geho. A family history of high blood pressure and heart attack does increase your risk, so it’s good you mentioned that. It’s completely understandable you’re thinking about your brother now. While it’s good to encourage family members to be proactive about their health, don’t feel guilty. You are doing the right thing by focusing on your own well-being. Now, let’s talk a little more about you. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, no diabetes. I had my thyroid checked a few years ago, because I was feeling tired all the time, but the doctor said it was fine. Just getting older, he said. I do have… well, my knees bother me sometimes. Just a little bit of arthritis, the doctor said. Nothing serious. I can still walk, like I said. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said my levels were low. Is that… relevant? I'm trying to remember everything I've been told over the years! It all blends together.
DOCTOR: That's all very relevant, Ms. Geho, don’t worry about remembering everything perfectly. We can look through your records as well. Arthritis and the vitamin D supplement are good to know. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully! Never had a reaction to anything. Not to penicillin, not to bee stings, nothing. My mother was allergic to cats, but I love cats! I don't have any now, though. Too much responsibility, I think. So, no allergies at all. Is that… good? It feels like I should have something wrong, with my cholesterol being high. Does that make sense? I always feel like I should be more… complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s good you don’t have any allergies, Ms. Geho. And it’s perfectly normal to feel like there should be more going on, especially when you receive unexpected news. But having high cholesterol doesn't necessarily mean there's something seriously wrong. Often, it's a combination of genetics, diet, and lifestyle factors. Now, let's talk about any medications you’re currently taking, even over-the-counter ones, and how often you take them. You mentioned the vitamin D – how much are you taking each day?
PATIENT: Oh, right, the vitamin D! I take… let me see… 2000 IU every day. It’s a little blue pill. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. Just 200 milligrams, usually. Not very often, maybe once or twice a month. That’s it, really. Just the vitamin D and the occasional ibuprofen. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Makes me feel… sluggish. Do you think I need to worry about the ibuprofen and my cholesterol?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Geho. 2000 IU of vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen use. Ibuprofen, like other NSAIDs, can sometimes have a minor impact on cholesterol levels, but with your infrequent use, it’s unlikely to be a significant factor. Now, to get a clearer picture of your situation, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. I always get a little nervous when doctors listen to my heart, though. I always worry they’ll hear something wrong. But, yes, go ahead. Blood pressure is probably high, I drink coffee you know. And my knees are probably swollen. But go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Geho. It's common to feel a little anxious during a physical exam. We'll take things slowly and I'll explain everything as we go. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. As you mentioned, that could be from the coffee, or just a bit of nervousness. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your knees do have some tenderness and mild swelling, consistent with arthritis. Overall, your examination is within normal limits, with the exception of the elevated blood pressure and knee tenderness. Do you have any questions about what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: Oh, 142… is that bad? I usually feel fine. And my knees… well, they ache sometimes, but I can still walk. So, everything else is okay? That’s good. So, it’s just the cholesterol and the blood pressure? And my knees, of course. But, mainly the cholesterol? What do we do about it? Do I need pills? I really don’t want pills. Is there anything else I can do? More walking? Different food? I'm willing to try anything, as long as it doesn't involve too many pills.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Ms. Geho. A blood pressure of 142/88 is slightly elevated, and we'll want to monitor that. As for your cholesterol, I’ve reviewed your lab results, and your total cholesterol is 245 mg/dL, with an LDL cholesterol of 160 mg/dL. These levels are higher than we’d like. The good news is that there are many things we can try before considering medication. Lifestyle modifications are often very effective. These include a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. I’m going to recommend the following: Diet: Reduce your intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium. Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats. Exercise: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Weight Management: If you are overweight, losing even a small amount of weight can make a difference. I’d also like to repeat your cholesterol levels in three months to see how you respond to these changes. If your levels haven't improved sufficiently, we can then discuss medication options. Does that sound like a reasonable plan to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Less saturated fats… I can do that. More walking, I’m already doing. And I could probably lose a few pounds, I suppose. I do like my cookies, though. But I can cut back. I promise. Three months… that gives me time to try. So, no pills right away? Just the diet and the walking? And losing a few pounds? Okay. That I can do. Do you have… like, a list of foods I should avoid? Or maybe a website I can look at? I’m not very good at knowing which foods are good and which ones are bad. And what about the blood pressure? Should I be checking that at home?
DOCTOR: Excellent! That’s a great attitude, Ms. Geho. You’ve already identified key areas for improvement. Yes, absolutely. I’ll print out a handout with a list of foods to prioritize and limit, as well as some resources for heart-healthy eating. There are also some excellent websites, such as the American Heart Association ) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ). Regarding your blood pressure, I do recommend checking it at home a couple of times a week. It will give us a better understanding of your typical blood pressure levels. I’ll provide you with instructions on how to check your blood pressure correctly. We'll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment in three months. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. That’s a lot of information, but it doesn’t seem too… scary. Diet, walking, checking my blood pressure. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. And you didn't even mention pills right away! That's very reassuring. I appreciate that. I think I’ll go home now and make a grocery list. Maybe I’ll start walking a little further today. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Geho. I'm glad I could help. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you in three months. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
