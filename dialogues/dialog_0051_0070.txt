DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Glazewski, you say? Hmm. Yes. New here. Just... the usual, I think. Old man things. Not remembering where I put my brushes, mostly. Medicare sent a letter. Said I should come. A check-up, maybe? I don't really know. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare does encourage regular check-ups, which is a good thing. And it's perfectly normal to feel a little unsure about things. "Old man things," as you put it, can be many different things, and it's best to get a good look at what’s going on. The memory concerns you mentioned are certainly something we should explore. Just to clarify, when you say "not remembering where you put your brushes," is this a recent change, or has this been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: Ongoing. Always been a bit… scattered. But worse lately, maybe? It's hard to say. I work with makeup, you see? Very important brushes. Expensive ones. If I can’t find them, it’s… a problem. Not a big problem. Just… annoying. I used to just… know where everything was. Now I have to look. All the time. And sometimes… sometimes I forget why I went into a room. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, this has been a gradual change, rather than something sudden. And it’s impacting your work, with the brushes, and you're noticing some difficulty with recalling why you went to a room. That's helpful information. It's good you're noticing these changes. Forgetfulness can happen to anyone, but it’s important to rule out any underlying causes. Let’s talk a little bit more about this. When you say “worse lately,” can you give me an example of a specific instance where you noticed a significant memory lapse?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific... let me think. Just last week, I was making up… Svetlana, that was her name. For a photo shoot. Very important shoot. I had everything laid out. All my best colours. And I… I forgot what look she wanted. Completely blank. She had to remind me. Very embarrassing. She’s a professional model, you know? Doesn’t like to wait. And then… then I couldn't remember where I put the red lipstick. The expensive red lipstick.
DOCTOR: Okay, forgetting the look for Svetlana and misplacing the lipstick… those are specific examples, and helpful. It sounds like it caused you some stress, which is understandable. Now, aside from the memory issues, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me see… I get tired easier, maybe. Used to be, I could work all day, no problem. Now I need a nap in the afternoon. Old age, I suppose. And my hands… they shake a little sometimes. Not all the time, just when I’m… concentrating. Like when I’m applying eyeliner. Very precise work, eyeliner. Can’t have shaky hands for that.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and hand tremors… those are important things to mention. And the tremors seem to be related to concentration, which is a good observation. Do you notice the tremors when you're not concentrating on something precise, like when you're just holding a cup of tea, for example?
PATIENT: Hmm. Good question. Let me think… No, not the tea. Never the tea. I drink a lot of tea, you know. Keeps me going. But… when I’m threading brows? Yes. Definitely when I’m threading brows. Very delicate work, threading. You have to be steady. It’s… annoying. Makes the clients nervous. They think I’m going to poke their eye out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the tremors are specifically related to fine motor tasks requiring concentration. That’s helpful. Now, let’s briefly touch on your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… hmm. Not really. I had a bad back, once. Years ago. From lifting heavy lights, for a theatre show. But it’s better now. Old man things, you see? Always something creaking and groaning. And… I think I had the flu, a few years back. Nothing serious. I don't go to the doctor much. Never liked them, to be honest. Always poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of back pain and a bout of the flu. I understand your reluctance to visit the doctor, but sometimes a check-up is a good idea, just to make sure everything is as it should be. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Never. Too much risk. I work with faces, you see? Don't want anyone messing with this. Not worth it. My mother always said, “Leave well enough alone.” She was a very practical woman. Used to make the best pierogi, you’ve ever tasted. But no surgeries. Never.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. That’s good to know. And your mother sounds like a wonderful woman. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… just a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me, years ago. Small white pill. Can’t remember the name. And… sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re acting up. But that’s just when they’re really bothering me. And… I take vitamin D, in the winter. Everyone says you need vitamin D in the winter.
DOCTOR: Alright, medication for blood pressure, something for your knees as needed, and vitamin D in the winter. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I just ask the pharmacist. She’s very helpful. Young woman, with glasses. Always knows what I need. I don’t bother with names. Too many names. I can’t remember the names of my clients half the time, let alone pills!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, we can try to get that information from the pharmacy later. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. I eat everything. Love everything. Especially pierogi. My mother's were the best. But no allergies. I'm a strong man, you see? Don't get sick easily. Except for the flu, once. But that was years ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you seem quite resilient. Now, just a few questions about your family history… Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother lived to be very old. Almost ninety. Strong woman. She just… wore out, eventually. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. But he drank a lot of vodka. Probably that. And… my sister, she had something with her nerves. Always complaining about tingling in her hands. But she was a drama queen, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of longevity in your mother, heart problems in your father, and nerve issues in your sister. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. Disgusting habit. Makes your face wrinkle. I work with faces, you see? Can’t have wrinkles. And… I used to drink a little vodka, when I was younger. But not anymore. Bad for the nerves. My sister always said that. So, no. No smoking, no drinking. Just tea. Lots and lots of tea.
DOCTOR: That’s very good. Healthy habits are important. Now, before we move onto a physical examination, is there anything else you think I should know, anything at all that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Hmm… relevant? Let me think. Oh! I get… confused sometimes. Lost in thought. Especially when I’m working on a complicated look. Like… smoky eyes. Very difficult. I get so focused, I forget where I am. And… sometimes I repeat myself. Like I’m doing now. I’m sorry. It’s just… old age.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. It’s helpful to know that you experience moments of confusion, especially when concentrating, and that you sometimes repeat yourself. These are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. We’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright. As long as it’s quick. I have Svetlana later. Very important shoot. Doesn’t like to wait. And… no poking, please. I don’t like poking. But… do what you have to do. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. And I promise, no unnecessary poking. Just a routine check. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Please take a deep breath for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, breath sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Please sit on the edge of the table, and I'll ask you to perform a few simple tasks. Can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… a bit wobbly, isn’t it? There. I think. It’s harder than it looks. Old age, you see? Everything’s harder.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal for things to be a little more challenging with age. You did very well. Now, if you’re comfortable, could you please walk a straight line for me, heel to toe, for a few steps?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… not going well. I used to be so steady. It’s… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Easy now. That’s alright. Just sit back down, please. It’s good you let me know you felt unsteady. We’ll take things slowly. Now, I’m going to check your eyes. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There. I’m following it. It’s… a bit blurry, but I’m following it. Old age, you see? Everything’s blurry. Even the young models.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your eye movements are a little slow, but tracking. Thank you, Mr. Szmyd. That’s all for the physical examination. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the examination – the slightly elevated blood pressure, the moments of confusion, the difficulty with balance, the slow eye movements, and the tremors when concentrating – I think it's important to investigate this further. There are several possibilities, and we need to rule things out. Would you be willing to order some blood tests and a brain scan?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a… scan? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. And expensive. Svetlana will be furious if I cancel the shoot. But… if it’s important… I suppose. What are we looking for, exactly? Is it something bad? I don’t like hospitals. They smell funny.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is bad, it just means we need to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The blood tests will help us check for any underlying medical conditions, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. The brain scan – it’s a non-invasive procedure, an MRI, – will help us rule out any structural problems in the brain. It’s a precaution, really. We're looking to rule out things like early signs of dementia, stroke, or a neurological condition. But again, it's important not to jump to conclusions. I'll write the orders for the tests now. The clinic will schedule them for you, and I'll call you as soon as the results are back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. As long as it's quick. And no poking, please. Just… no poking. And call me, you said? As soon as you know something? Svetlana… she’s very demanding. I need to know. And… what if it is something bad? What then?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand your worries. I will personally call you with the results as soon as they are available. And I assure you, we’ll discuss everything thoroughly. If it is something that requires further treatment, we will develop a plan together. There are many options available, and we’ll find the best course of action for you. We have excellent neurologists at the hospital, and I can refer you if necessary. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done. I'll also prescribe a medication for your blood pressure to help manage it in the meantime. It’s a low dose, and hopefully, it will minimize any symptoms. Do you have any questions about the medication or the tests before we finish?
PATIENT: Medication… another pill? Oh dear. I forget what I’m taking already. And the tests… how long will they take? I have Svetlana, you see. Very important shoot. And… will they make me tired? I get tired easily, as it is. And… what if I can't remember what the doctor tells me? I'm always forgetting things.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question. The tests should take about an hour or two in total. They may make you feel a little tired afterwards, but it shouldn’t be anything significant. And don’t worry about forgetting things. That’s why I’ll have the nurse go over the medication instructions with you, and I’ll provide you with a written summary of everything we discussed today. Also, if you're concerned about memory issues, we can arrange for a neuropsychological evaluation to assess your cognitive function. It’s a detailed assessment, but it can help us understand what’s going on and develop strategies to manage any cognitive decline. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and starting the blood pressure medication. I'll give you a referral for the neurologist, just in case. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Just… get it over with. Tests, pills, neurologists… it’s all a bit much. And… if I cancel the shoot, Svetlana will be furious. Very, very furious. But… I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Just… no poking, please. And remind me again about the pills? What color are they? And when do I take them? I get confused easily, you see. Old age, you know. It’s terrible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The pills are small, white, and you’ll take one every morning with breakfast. I’ve written detailed instructions here, including potential side effects. And I’ve highlighted the nurse’s number – please don’t hesitate to call her if you have any questions or concerns. The tests are scheduled for next Tuesday at 9 am at the imaging center across the street. I’ve included the address and phone number here as well. I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd, and I want to assure you that we’re here to support you every step of the way. Don’t worry about Svetlana for now – let’s focus on taking care of your health. And please, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, don’t hesitate to call me. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… no poking. And… thank you, Doctor. I suppose. It’s all a bit much, but… thank you. I just hope Svetlana doesn’t fire me. She’s very demanding. Very, very demanding.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. Don't worry about Svetlana right now. We'll take things one step at a time. And please, remember, your health is the most important thing. The nurse will escort you out and answer any remaining questions you may have. Take care, and I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available.
