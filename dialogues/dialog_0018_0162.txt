DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't really have time for pleasantries. Just…bloating, okay? It's been happening for a while now. Feels like I’m gonna pop, sometimes. Honestly, it’s annoying. Can we just figure out what’s wrong and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I understand your time is valuable, and we will get straight to the point. Bloating can certainly be disruptive. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Ugh, “a bit more?” What do you mean? It's my stomach, it gets big. Like, puffy. It happens after I eat, usually. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Sometimes it’s just…there. I don't know, I'm not a doctor. Is that enough detail for you? I really don't remember specifics. It just is. Look, I work hard, I don’t have time to catalogue every bean I eat.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Kristofik. You’re right, you shouldn’t need to be a medical historian to get help. “Just is” is a good starting point. To help me narrow down the possibilities, let's try a broader approach. When did you first notice this bloating starting?
PATIENT: Honestly? I couldn’t tell ya. Months ago, probably. Maybe even longer. Things kinda blur together, you know? My wife…she handled all that stuff, remembering dates and…well, everything. It’s been a while since…since then. Look, is this important? Will knowing exactly when it started actually fix the problem? I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: I understand this is difficult, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize for asking potentially painful questions. Knowing when it started can help, but it’s certainly not the most crucial piece of information. We can proceed without a precise date. Since it’s been ongoing for months, can you describe what it feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Feels like…pressure, mostly. Like I ate too much, even when I haven't. And gassy. Lots of gas. It’s embarrassing, honestly. Not something a man likes to talk about. It’s not painful, exactly. Just…uncomfortable. A full, heavy feeling. Like a balloon about to burst. Is that good enough? I’m not exactly good at describing feelings.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Kristofik. “Pressure, gas, full, heavy” – that gives me a good start. And you are absolutely right to be comfortable describing how you feel, that’s what I’m here for. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the bloating and gas?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think…Sometimes I feel tired, I guess. But I work a physical job, so that’s not really surprising. And…no, I don’t think so. Not really. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but I just figured that was the food. Honestly, I mostly just want this stomach thing to go away. It's annoying and makes me sluggish. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: We are absolutely getting somewhere, Mr. Kristofik. Fatigue and occasional heartburn are good things to note. Now, let's talk about your diet a bit, even though you mentioned not remembering specifics. Do you notice any particular foods seem to worsen the bloating, even if you can’t pinpoint them consistently?
PATIENT: Look, I eat normal food. I’m not one of those fussy eaters. Burgers, steak, sometimes pasta. I try to get some vegetables in there, but...it's not a priority, okay? I don’t sit around analyzing every bite. If I had to guess? Maybe…dairy? I don't know. It feels worse after milk, sometimes. But honestly, I could be imagining things. It happens randomly. It's not like I can point to something and say, "Aha! That's the culprit!" It's a waste of time, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. It can feel like a waste of time trying to pinpoint the cause. Still, even a vague association is useful. Alright. Do you have any allergies that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any allergies. Skin rashes, trouble breathing, none of that. I'm a pretty tough guy, honestly. My wife always said I was built like a tank. Though, that was before…well, never mind. Look, I doubt I’m allergic to anything. Just wanna fix the bloating, alright? Is there a test you can just do? Some pill you can prescribe? I don't have time for a whole investigation.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Mr. Kristofik. While I wish there were a single test or pill, unfortunately, bloating can have several causes, and a proper assessment is important. Before we proceed with any tests, let's quickly go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history. Okay. Let me think. Nothing major. I had a bad back once, from lifting stuff at work, but that healed. And…the doctor said my cholesterol was a little high, a few years back. But that was just something he mentioned during a checkup. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of that stuff. My wife handled all the doctor appointments. She was good at remembering things. Look, I’m pretty healthy for my age. Work hard, don’t complain. That's about it. Is this important? It’s all a blur.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Kristofik, even if it’s a blur. Back issues and slightly elevated cholesterol are good to know. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…nope. Never had surgery. I'm a pretty practical guy. Avoid the hospital if I can. Always said surgery was a last resort. My wife used to worry about me, always wanted me to get checkups and…look, never mind. I’m fine. Never had surgery. Is that what you wanted to know? Can we please get to the part where you tell me what’s wrong and how to fix it? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I want to know, Mr. Kristofik. And I understand your desire to get to the bottom of this quickly. Now, about your family history - are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history…look, my family is…complicated. A lot of people, scattered all over. I don’t really keep in touch with most of them. I know my mother had some kind of…stomach trouble, when she was older. But I don't know what it was. She never really talked about it. And my father…he just worked hard and died of a heart attack. That’s about it. Honestly, I don’t think there’s much of a family medical history to speak of. Is this helping? I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting my time. Can we just order some tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize for the lengthy questions. It's helpful to have a general sense, even if it's vague. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Look, I'm a working man. I need a beer after a long day, alright? Maybe a couple. And I smoke…sometimes. When I'm stressed. It's not like I'm chain-smoking a pack a day. And I definitely don't do drugs. Never been my thing. Is that what you wanted to know? Can we please move on? I'm starting to get a headache, and I think this bloating is actually getting worse just from talking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Kristofik. I assure you, we are getting closer to understanding what might be going on. Alright. I'm going to ask one more question, and then we can move to a physical examination, if you are agreeable. Do you take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, more questions. Fine. I take…nothing, usually. Except sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back, when it flares up. And I used to take something for my cholesterol, a few years back, but the doctor took me off it. That’s it. Really. Nothing else. Look, I’m a pretty simple guy. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Can we finally get to the exam? I'm starting to feel lightheaded. I just want this bloating to go away.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik, thank you for your patience. No further questions for now. If you are agreeable, I'd like to perform a physical exam. This will involve listening to your abdomen, gently pressing on it to check for tenderness, and feeling your abdomen. It’s fairly straightforward and will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. The sooner you figure out what's wrong, the sooner I can get out of here. Don't poke too hard, though. I got things to do, and I don't have time to be lying around in pain. Just…hurry up, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem…slightly hyperactive, but not dramatically so. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain. I'm starting in the lower right side… Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Nope. Doesn’t hurt… much. Just feels…full. Like a balloon, like I said before. It’s just uncomfortable, not painful. Don’t poke too hard, alright? It’s starting to feel worse just from you touching it. And hurry up, please. I’m starting to get anxious. This is a waste of time, I just know it.
DOCTOR: Okay, and how about here… in your upper abdomen?
PATIENT: Ugh. A little…sensitive here. Like a dull ache. Not sharp, just…uncomfortable. It feels like…pressure, like something’s pushing. Are you sure you know what you're doing? This is making it worse, I swear. And honestly, it's kinda embarrassing, having you poke around in my stomach. Just get it over with, alright? This is not how I want to spend my day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lower left side?
PATIENT: Ugh, same thing. Pressure, discomfort. Like…gas, maybe? It's hard to explain. It's just...full. Like I ate too much, even when I haven't. Look, is this going to lead to anything? Or are you just poking around aimlessly? I got things to do, you know? This is wasting my time and making me feel worse. Can we just skip to the part where you tell me what's wrong and give me a pill? Please?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Thank you for your patience. The exam reveals some abdominal tenderness, particularly in the upper abdomen, and a sense of fullness. I don’t detect any masses or significant abnormalities. Based on your history and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of functional dyspepsia, which is essentially chronic indigestion. It can cause bloating, fullness, discomfort, and sometimes nausea. It's very common, and often related to how the stomach and intestines work together. However, to rule out other potential causes, I would like to order a few blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a test for Celiac disease. I would also like to order a stool test to rule out any infection. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests…of course. More waiting. More time wasted. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Blood tests, stool tests, whatever you need to do. I just want this to be over. Can you at least tell me what the pill is gonna be? Something for the bloating? Something to make it stop? And hurry up, alright? I got things to do. This is ridiculous. Just get me the pill.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. I wish there were a simple, immediate solution, but it’s important to investigate the cause of your symptoms before prescribing medication. There are several medications that can help with bloating, such as simethicone or antispasmodics, but they are often more effective when used in conjunction with lifestyle modifications. For now, I'm going to write you a prescription for simethicone, which is an over-the-counter medication that can help relieve gas and bloating. I would also recommend trying a low-FODMAP diet, which can help reduce gas production. I will also have the lab draw the blood tests and arrange for the stool test. The results should be available in approximately three to five business days. I will call you as soon as they are available to discuss them and create a more tailored treatment plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, or blood in your stool, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just…get the tests done. And call me when they’re ready. Don’t waste my time. This has been a waste of time, honestly. Just…get it over with. And make sure the pill works. I don't have time for this. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I understand. My staff will assist you with scheduling the lab tests and provide you with the necessary instructions. Thank you for coming in today, despite your discomfort. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day. .
