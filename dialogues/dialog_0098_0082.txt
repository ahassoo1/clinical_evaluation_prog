DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning. I think… travel? My wife… she would have done all the planning. I just… go where she said. Now she… not here. So, I need… shots? For going places? I don’t… remember where. It was… important to her.
DOCTOR: Okay, travel vaccinations. That’s perfectly reasonable. It sounds like you’re getting ready for a trip, or were planning one with your wife. You said she’s not here now… that must be difficult. Let’s try to sort this out. Do you have any idea where you were planning to travel?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Somewhere… hot? Lots of… colors? She liked colors. And… old things. Like… stones. Big stones. We talked about it… a little. Before… everything. I just… followed her. She knew what was best. I don't remember the name of the place. It's… annoying. I should remember.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re feeling a bit unsure right now, Odell. It sounds like your wife did a lot of the planning, and it’s perfectly normal to be a little lost without her. Don’t worry about remembering everything; we’ll figure this out together. Let's try this. Did she mention anything specific about needing vaccinations?
PATIENT: Vaccinations… she said… yellow fever? Maybe? Something about… a card? She made me get a card. A little yellow card. And… mosquitoes. She was very worried about mosquitoes. Said they carry… bad things. She bought lots of spray. Smelly spray. I think it was for… everywhere we were going. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Odell, thank you. Yellow fever vaccine… that suggests we're likely talking about travel to South America or Africa. And the mosquito precautions are definitely important. Do you happen to have that yellow card with you today?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think so… yes! Here. It’s… all her writing. I can’t read it very well. She had… fancy handwriting.
DOCTOR: Okay, this is excellent. It looks like you were planning a trip to Brazil, Odell. And you’ve already had the Yellow Fever vaccination, which is good. Now, are you still planning to go to Brazil?
PATIENT: Brazil? Oh… yes! I think so. I mean… she wanted to. And… I don’t want to waste the money. She saved for a long time. But… I'm not sure I should go alone. It was… her dream. I don't know if I can… enjoy it without her. But… the tickets are booked, I think. And the hotel… somewhere in Rio, she said.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely natural to feel conflicted about traveling without her. We can certainly talk about that later, if you'd like. For now, let’s focus on making sure you’re medically prepared for the trip. Besides the Yellow Fever vaccination, depending on where in Brazil you’re planning to go, we might want to consider some other vaccinations or preventative medications. Do you know which areas of Brazil you and your wife were planning to visit?
PATIENT: She… liked the jungle. Lots of trees and… animals. Manaus, she said. That's where the big river is? And… Rio. For the beaches. She wanted to see… the statue. The big one on the hill. She had a list. A very long list. I didn't pay much attention. She did everything. I just… carried the bags. I’m sorry. I’m not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely being helpful, Odell. Don't apologize. It sounds like your wife was a very organized traveler, and it's perfectly understandable that you weren't involved in all the details. Okay, Manaus is on the Amazon River, and Rio de Janeiro is famous for its beaches and the Christ the Redeemer statue. Given those locations, we should discuss vaccinations for Hepatitis A and Typhoid, and also talk about malaria prevention. Now, do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don't think so. I haven’t taken much medicine… ever. A little for headaches, sometimes. But nothing… serious. She always kept the medicine. She knew what I could and couldn’t take. I just… trusted her. Is that okay? I hope I don’t need much. I don’t like taking pills.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Odell. No known allergies is excellent. And we can certainly discuss options that minimize the number of pills you need to take. Before we talk about specific medications, let’s quickly review your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No… nothing. I'm… healthy. Always been healthy. She always said so. She made me eat lots of vegetables. And… walk. We walked everywhere. Even when it was raining. She said it was good for me. She… took good care of me. I miss her.
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. It sounds like she was a wonderful person, and you were very lucky to have her. Okay, no pre-existing medical conditions is good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No… no surgeries. Just… a few stitches when I was a little boy. I fell out of a tree. But that was a long time ago. Nothing important. She bandaged it up. She was very good at fixing things. Everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s helpful to know. Now, finally, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: No… nothing. She kept all the medicine. And… the vitamins. She said they were important. I don't even know what I need. She did everything. I just… followed her. I’m sorry. I keep saying the same thing. It’s just… hard. Without her.
DOCTOR: You’re not repeating yourself, Odell. It’s perfectly natural to feel lost and overwhelmed right now, and it’s okay to lean on others for support. It's clear your wife was very involved in your health care, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling a little unsure without her. Okay, so no current medications, no allergies, no surgeries, no pre-existing conditions. That’s excellent. Now, let's do a quick physical exam just to make sure everything looks good before we discuss vaccinations and preventative medications for your trip to Brazil. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes… that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. She would have… wanted that. I just… want to be safe. For her. And… for myself.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up here for me. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is good. Pulse is good as well. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Reflexes are normal and neurological function appears intact. Eyes and ears look clear. Everything appears to be normal, Odell. Physically, you seem to be in good health. Now, let’s discuss what vaccinations and preventative medications you might need for your trip to Brazil. We’ll focus on the areas you and your wife were planning to visit - Manaus and Rio de Janeiro. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds good. Thank you. I’m glad… everything is okay. She would have wanted me to be careful. Manaus and Rio… yes. That’s where we were going. What… what do I need? And… are they safe? I read something about… yellow fever. Is that bad? And… mosquitoes? She was very worried about mosquitoes.
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you're feeling a little more relieved. And you are right to be concerned about Yellow Fever and mosquitoes. They are both potential risks in Brazil, but we can definitely take steps to protect you. You’ve already had the Yellow Fever vaccine, which is excellent. That protects you for life. However, depending on the specific areas of Manaus and Rio you plan to visit, we might also recommend vaccinations for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. These are given as a series of shots. As for mosquitoes, we'll discuss ways to minimize your exposure. That includes using insect repellent with DEET, wearing long sleeves and pants, especially at dawn and dusk, and sleeping under a mosquito net. We can also talk about a preventative medication called Malarone, which helps protect you from malaria. Malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes and can be a serious illness. Does that all make sense so far?
PATIENT: Hepatitis A? Typhoid? More shots? And… Malarone? That’s a… pill? Lots of pills? She didn't say anything about… all this. Just the yellow fever. And… the spray. Is it… very dangerous? Brazil? I thought it was supposed to be beautiful. She showed me pictures. Beaches and… statues. I don't want to get sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Odell. It sounds like your wife did a lot of the preparation, and it’s overwhelming to suddenly have to think about all of this. Let me reassure you, Brazil is a beautiful country, and with the right precautions, you can have a wonderful and safe trip. Hepatitis A and Typhoid are bacterial infections you can get from contaminated food and water. They can cause unpleasant symptoms, but they are preventable with vaccinations. Malarone is a pill, yes. But it’s just one pill a day, and it significantly reduces your risk of getting malaria. We can discuss whether it’s the right option for you, based on your itinerary and personal preferences. To help me determine the best course of action, could you tell me a little more about where you and your wife were planning to stay in Manaus and Rio?
PATIENT: She… booked hotels. Nice hotels, I think. In Rio, near the beach. Copacabana, she said. And… in Manaus, somewhere near the river. A jungle lodge, maybe? She liked… nature. I don’t remember the names. She had everything written down. In her… notebook. I haven’t… looked at it. It’s… too hard. She planned everything. I just… followed. She said the hotels were safe. And… clean. She always checked. She worried about everything. Is it… is it okay if I just… don’t go? Maybe I should just stay here.
DOCTOR: Odell, it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and questioning whether to go. It’s okay to feel unsure, and it’s perfectly acceptable to reconsider your plans. Before you make any decisions, let’s focus on getting you the information you need to feel comfortable, whether that means going or staying. Knowing you stayed in nice hotels near Copacabana in Rio and a jungle lodge near the river in Manaus is helpful. Those areas generally have a lower risk of certain illnesses, but we still need to take precautions. Given that you stayed in established hotels, we can likely reduce the need for some preventative measures. We’ll still recommend the Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations, and we can discuss whether Malarone is appropriate, depending on your comfort level. Would you like me to go over the potential side effects of these vaccinations and medications, so you can make an informed decision?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Side effects? What… what could happen? She never talked about… side effects. Just… get the shot. And… use the spray. I just… want to be safe. For her. And… for myself. Is it… is it painful? The shots? She always said… everything would be okay. But… she’s not here.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. It's important to know what to expect. The side effects from these vaccinations are usually mild. With Hepatitis A and Typhoid, you might experience some soreness at the injection site, a mild fever, or some fatigue. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Malarone is generally well-tolerated, but some people experience nausea, headache, or difficulty sleeping. We can discuss ways to minimize these side effects, such as taking the medication with food. The shots themselves… they can be a little uncomfortable, yes. It’s a quick pinch, but it shouldn’t be excruciating. I’ll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. It's completely natural to feel anxious, especially with your wife not being here. Please know that you’re not alone in this, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Would you like me to start by explaining the Hepatitis A vaccination in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… Hepatitis A. Yes. Please. What… what does it do? And… how many shots? She always said… three shots. Is that right? And… how long do they last? I just… want to be prepared. For everything. For her.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Odell. Hepatitis A is a viral infection that affects the liver. It’s usually spread through contaminated food or water, or close contact with someone who is infected. The symptoms can include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice – a yellowing of the skin and eyes. The good news is that there’s a very effective vaccine to prevent it. You’re right, it’s typically given in two shots, spaced six months apart. The first shot provides protection for about six months, and the second shot provides long-term protection – usually for several years, possibly even for life. Given you’ve already had the first shot three months ago, you’ll just need one booster shot to complete the series. Would you like me to explain Typhoid next, or would you prefer to discuss the booster shot schedule in more detail?
PATIENT: Booster… schedule. Yes. That sounds… good. How long do I have to wait? After the shot? Can I… can I still travel? She booked the tickets… next month. I don’t want to… waste the money. She saved for a long time. But… I don’t want to get sick. On the plane. Or… in Brazil.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Odell. You're right to think about that. The Hepatitis A vaccine is generally very safe, and you shouldn't experience any serious side effects that would prevent you from traveling. However, it takes about two weeks for your body to develop full immunity after the booster shot. So, to be on the safe side, I recommend waiting at least two weeks after the booster shot before traveling. That will give your body enough time to build up protection. As for traveling on the plane, the risk of getting infected is very low. The virus isn’t easily spread through the air, and the airplane cabins are typically well-ventilated. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes. That’s… okay. I can wait. The tickets… are next month. So, I have time. But… what about the other one? Malarone? Is that… really necessary? She didn’t say anything about… pills. Just the spray. And the shots. I don’t like taking pills. They make me… feel sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about taking pills, Odell. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about potential side effects, especially if you haven't taken medication before. Malarone is a preventative medication for malaria, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. The risk of malaria varies depending on the specific areas you're visiting in Brazil. In Rio de Janeiro, the risk is relatively low, especially if you stay in established hotels and take precautions against mosquito bites. However, in Manaus, where you'll be staying near the river, the risk is higher. Whether or not to take Malarone is ultimately your decision. We can discuss the risks and benefits in more detail, and you can decide what’s best for you. If you're concerned about taking pills, we can also explore alternative ways to minimize your risk of malaria, such as using insect repellent with a high concentration of DEET, wearing long sleeves and pants, and sleeping under a mosquito net. Would you like to discuss those options?
PATIENT: Insect… repellent? DEET? Mosquito… net? She said… everything would be okay. She always knew what to do. I just… followed her. I don’t want to… make a mistake. Without her. Maybe… maybe I should just stay here. It’s safer. She wouldn’t want me to… get sick. She… she worried so much.
DOCTOR: Odell, it's perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed and unsure right now. It sounds like your wife was a very capable planner, and it's natural to feel lost without her guidance. You're not alone in this, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's take a deep breath. It's okay to reconsider your plans. If you're feeling anxious about traveling, it's perfectly acceptable to stay here. Your health and well-being are the most important things. If you do decide to stay, that's perfectly fine. We can discuss how to cancel your tickets and hotel reservations, and I can provide you with any necessary medical documentation. If you do decide to go, we can work together to create a plan that minimizes your risk of getting sick and makes you feel more comfortable. We can discuss the benefits of insect repellent, mosquito nets, and other preventative measures, and we can explore alternative options if you're concerned about taking pills. The choice is yours, Odell. And whatever you decide, I'll be here to support you. Would you like me to take a moment to just sit with you while you think about it?
PATIENT: Just… sit with me? Yes. Please. She… she would have known what to do. She always did. I miss her so much.
