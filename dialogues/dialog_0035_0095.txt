DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s rather straightforward. I woke up this morning and… well, I can’t hear on this side. <points to left ear> And my face… it feels a bit droopy. It's quite inconvenient, really. I haven’t got all day for this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Droopy face and hearing loss on one side… that is concerning, and we’ll want to get this checked out quickly. Just to be clear, did this happen suddenly, while you were sleeping, or did it come on gradually?
PATIENT: Suddenly. Absolutely suddenly. I went to bed perfectly fine, and then… nothing. Just… couldn’t hear. I didn’t bump my head or anything. It wasn't a slow thing, if that’s what you're asking. Honestly, I don’t understand why you need to know every little detail. It just happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, sudden onset is important. And no injury… Alright. Let’s get some more information. Have you noticed any other symptoms – dizziness, trouble with balance, any pain in your ear or face, or difficulty speaking?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Balance is fine, thank you. No pain, thankfully. And my speech is perfectly clear, I assure you. <slightly raises chin> It's the hearing that's the problem, Doctor. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we going to spend the whole morning cataloging things that aren't happening?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No dizziness, no pain, speech is good. I just need to rule out some things. Any weakness on one side of your face or body?
PATIENT: Weakness? Look, I already told you my face feels droopy. Isn’t that enough weakness? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I don't need a comprehensive physical exam for a bit of deafness. My limbs are working perfectly well, thank you very much. Do you actually need me to demonstrate that I can move my arms and legs? <taps foot impatiently>
DOCTOR: Okay, Stephane. I understand your frustration. However, this combination of sudden hearing loss and facial drooping can indicate a serious issue – potentially something called Bell’s palsy, but we need to rule out other possibilities, including a stroke. So, I do need to do a brief neurological exam. It won’t take long, I promise. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: A stroke? Really? You immediately jump to stroke? I'm 59, not ancient! And honestly, Bell's… whatever that is… sounds frightfully inconvenient. Fine. <rolls eyes> I will stare at your finger. But if this takes much longer, I'm leaving. <fixes a stern expression, follows finger with eyes> Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? It's clearly not my finest work, seeing as I can barely move the left side of my face, but I assure you, I am perfectly capable of smiling when circumstances allow. Now, are we finished cataloging my facial deficiencies?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the weakness. Now, can you stick your tongue out?
PATIENT: There. Honestly, this feels rather undignified. Are you quite finished poking and prodding? I had a very busy morning planned, you know. It’s not as if I have nothing better to do than be examined.
DOCTOR: Alright. And one last quick thing. I’m going to listen to your ears with this otoscope, just to rule out any obvious infection. Then, I'll check your reflexes. It won't take long. <begins otoscopic exam, noting findings>
PATIENT: Very well. But I’m warning you, if you try to sell me some miracle ear drops or schedule a battery of tests, I’m walking out right now. I've had enough of this. Just… get on with it. I have a luncheon appointment. And don't expect me to pay for all this poking and prodding. I am not insured, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Stephane. I see no sign of infection in either ear, and your reflexes are intact. Based on what I’m seeing—sudden hearing loss, facial drooping, no other neurological deficits—Bell’s palsy is the most likely diagnosis at this point. However, to be absolutely certain, and rule out other serious causes like stroke or a tumor, I want to get an MRI of your brain. And I will refer you to an audiologist for a hearing test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI? Absolutely not. I have a very busy life, and spending hours in one of those… contraptions is out of the question. And an audiologist? More appointments! This is preposterous. I came in here for a bit of deafness, not a full-body workup! Look, Doctor, I appreciate your thoroughness, but I'm simply not going to put my life on hold for this. Perhaps it will just… go away on its own. I think I’ll just try some rest. I don't see the point in all this fuss and bother. <starts to rise from the chair> Thank you for your time. <turns to leave>
DOCTOR: Stephane, I understand your reluctance, but Bell’s palsy, while often resolving on its own, can sometimes cause permanent hearing loss or facial weakness. An MRI would give us peace of mind and allow us to rule out more serious conditions. The audiologist can assess the extent of your hearing loss and recommend appropriate management. I strongly recommend you reconsider. I can provide you with a list of facilities that offer financial assistance for these tests. However, if you absolutely refuse both tests, I will document your refusal in your chart. I can prescribe you a short course of prednisone, which may help reduce inflammation and improve your chances of recovery. But without further investigation, we cannot be certain of the cause or the best course of action. Please consider this carefully. I am concerned about you, and I want to ensure you receive the best possible care. <offers a business card> Here's my card. Please call if you change your mind. .
PATIENT: Prednisone, you say? Very well. A short course. That’s… acceptable. I’m not fond of medication, but if it might speed things along… Fine. But that is all. No MRIs, no audiologists, no poking, no prodding. Just the prednisone. And I expect a full explanation of the side effects before I take a single pill. Don’t think I haven’t read about those things on the internet. <turns and exits quickly, without another word> .
