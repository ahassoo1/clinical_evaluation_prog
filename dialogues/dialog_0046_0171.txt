DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hello. It's my nails, I think. They just… look funny. Not good funny. I don't really know what's wrong with 'em, just figured someone should look. It's been a bit, maybe a couple weeks now? I don't keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’ve noticed changes in your nails over the past couple of weeks. Can you describe what “not good funny” looks like?
PATIENT: Well, they're… discolored. Like, not your normal pink. More… yellowish, kinda. And thick. Not like, really thick, but… not normal. And one of 'em feels kinda loose. Like it could… come off, I guess. I don't know. It's just… icky. It's not a pretty sight, that's for sure. You ever see a nail like this before?
DOCTOR: Yes, I have. It’s good you came in to have it checked out. Discoloration and thickening are definitely things we want to investigate. And the looseness is also important. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if this is happening on all of your nails, or just a few?
PATIENT: Just a few. Two on this hand… …and one on the other. The others seem okay. I don’t paint ‘em or anything, so I’m not sure what could be causing it. I mostly just do… stuff. Around the house. Not much fancy. Does that make sense? I don't usually pay attention to my hands, really.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Thut. It's helpful to know it's localized to a few nails and that you don’t use nail polish. Since you mentioned you mostly do things around the house, have you noticed any recent injuries to those nails—even minor ones?
PATIENT: Injuries? Hmm… not that I remember. I do a lot of gardening, maybe I bumped 'em on a rock or somethin’? I don’t recall anything bad, but I do a lot. And I don't always notice things right away, if you know what I mean. I mostly just ignore things 'til they get real bad, I guess. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily a problem, Ms. Thut, but it’s good to be proactive and get things checked out, especially if you’re noticing changes. Gardening could certainly be a contributing factor. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your hands and nails. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. Just don't take too long, okay? I got things to do. But, go ahead. I guess lookin' at 'em won’t hurt. Are you gonna poke 'em? I don't like bein' poked.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Thut. I’m just going to take a look. I won't poke too much, I promise. I see some yellowing and thickening, as you mentioned, particularly on the second nail of your right hand. The texture is a bit rough. There’s also some separation of the nail plate from the nail bed—that’s the looseness you described. It appears to be more pronounced on that nail as well. I don’t see any signs of infection right now, which is good. Your nail beds have normal capillary refill, and I don’t notice any significant pitting or other changes. Based on what I'm seeing, it looks like you may have a fungal infection of the nails, also known as onychomycosis. It's quite common, especially with gardening. However, to confirm this, we'll need to send a small sample of the nail clippings to the lab for a microscopic examination. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Fungal? Like… dirt fungus? That sounds awful. I told you I been in the garden. So you gotta… cut off a piece of my nail? That doesn't sound good either. Can't you just… tell by lookin' at it? I really don’t wanna lose a nail. Is it gonna hurt? I got a doctor’s appointment next week and I don't want it lookin' awful. What if it spreads to the other nails?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut. It's perfectly reasonable to be worried about that. No, it's not simply "dirt fungus," though gardening can certainly increase your exposure. It’s a specific type of fungus that thrives in warm, moist environments. And no, we can’t definitively diagnose it just by looking at it. It looks like onychomycosis, but other conditions can cause similar symptoms. The lab test will confirm if a fungus is present and identify the type, which helps us choose the right treatment. As for cutting your nail, it's just a small clipping from the affected area – not the whole nail. It may cause a little discomfort, similar to trimming your fingernails, but it shouldn’t be painful. We'll use sterile tools, of course. The risk of spreading is certainly a concern, which is why prompt treatment is important. If it is a fungal infection, treatment can help prevent it from spreading to other nails and potentially to your skin. Would you like me to explain the treatment options if the lab results confirm the diagnosis?
PATIENT: Treatment… I really don't wanna have to do anything. Are you sure it's not just… dry nails or somethin'? I use hand lotion sometimes, but not always. And I'm not real good at rememberin' to do things like that. Maybe if I just put more lotion on 'em… What kinda treatment are we talkin’ about anyway? Pills? Creams? ‘Cause I don't like takin' pills. And I don't wanna have to go back here a million times. I got other things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Thut. It's completely valid to want to avoid treatment if possible. While dry nails can sometimes mimic the appearance of onychomycosis, the thickening and separation of the nail plate you’re experiencing are more indicative of a fungal infection. There are a few treatment options, depending on the severity of the infection and your overall health. Topical Antifungal Medications: These are creams or nail lacquers that you apply directly to the affected nails. They require consistent use over several months, and can be effective for mild to moderate infections. Oral Antifungal Medications: These are pills that you take for several months. They are more effective for more severe infections, but they do have potential side effects and require monitoring with blood tests. Laser Treatment: This is a newer option that uses a laser to kill the fungus. It's not widely available and can be expensive. The best option for you would depend on the lab results and a discussion of your preferences and medical history. We would certainly start with the least invasive option first. If it is a fungal infection, ignoring it could lead to further thickening, discoloration, and even pain. It can also make it difficult to walk or wear shoes comfortably. Would you like me to explain the potential side effects of the oral medications in more detail?
PATIENT: Ugh, pills… Okay, okay. Tell me about the creams. Are they smelly? I don't wanna smell like… dirt. And do they take a long time to work? I'm not good with long things. And what if they don't even work? Then I just wasted all that time puttin' smelly cream on my nails for nothin'. And is this covered by Medicare? I don’t want a big bill. My budget's tight. Tell me everything. All of it. Before I agree to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut, let’s go through everything, and I'll do my best to answer all your questions. Topical antifungal medications usually come in the form of a nail lacquer or a cream. They are applied to the affected nails once a day or once a week, depending on the specific medication. Regarding smell, some medications do have a slight odor, but it’s generally not very strong and usually dissipates quickly. It’s not a lingering, unpleasant smell. As for how long they take to work, that’s the tricky part. It takes a long time. Nails grow very slowly, and it takes months for the medication to reach the entire affected nail. You typically need to use the medication for at least 6-12 months, even after the nail appears healthy, to ensure the fungus is completely eradicated. It’s a long commitment. The success rate varies, but topical medications are generally effective in about 50-80% of mild to moderate cases. If the infection is severe, or if you have other medical conditions, the success rate may be lower. Now, about Medicare coverage... Medicare Part B typically covers the cost of prescription antifungal medications when prescribed by a doctor for a medical condition. However, there may be copays or deductibles that you’ll be responsible for. We can check with your insurance provider to get a more accurate estimate of your out-of-pocket costs. We also have a financial counselor who can help you explore options if you're concerned about the cost. Before we proceed, I’d like to send a sample to the lab to confirm the diagnosis. That will cost approximately \$75, which may or may not be covered by Medicare. If it’s not a fungal infection, we can explore other causes and treatment options. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: \$75… Okay, fine. Send it to the lab. But if it's not fungus, I'm not payin' for nothin'. And if it is fungus, I want a list of all the side effects of those pills. Every single one. And the price of the cream. Everything. In writin'. I don't wanna be surprised. I'm already feelin' overwhelmed. And don’t expect me to come back here a million times. I got a life, you know? Just get it over with. And try to be quick about it. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Thut. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to make this process as smooth and straightforward as possible. I’ll collect a small sample from the affected nails now. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. I'll provide you with a written list of all potential side effects of the oral medications, the estimated cost of the topical cream, and the lab’s contact information once the results are available. I will also include a copy of your lab results. I'll also make a note in your chart regarding your preference for avoiding frequent visits. We can discuss follow-up options and explore telehealth if appropriate. Okay, we're all done. I'll send this to the lab, and they should have the results back within a week. You’ll receive a call from the lab to let you know when they’re available, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
