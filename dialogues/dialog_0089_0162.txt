DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Bloating, like you said. Honestly, I don't really have time for this. It's just...my stomach feels puffed up, okay? Been happening on and off. It's annoying, that's all. Is that enough information? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're busy. “Annoying” is good enough to start, but to help me figure out what’s causing the bloating, I’ll need a little more detail. When did this start happening?
PATIENT: Ugh, when did it start? Honestly, I don’t keep track of that stuff. Sometime…after my wife passed, I guess. Everything kinda blurred together after that. A few months, maybe? Look, is this going to be a long thing? Because I really don't remember specific dates. It just started happening, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months after your wife passed… I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Kristofik. That’s a significant life event, and it's completely understandable that things might feel blurred. We can definitely work with “a few months.” Is the bloating constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Definitely comes and goes. Some days I feel…normal, I guess. Other days I look like I swallowed a beach ball. It's mostly after I eat, I think. But not everything I eat. It's…random. Honestly, I’m not a scientist. I just know it’s uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Right, “random” is helpful. And it's good you've noticed it's often after eating. Does it matter what you eat?
PATIENT: Look, I eat normal stuff. Burgers, fries...sometimes Somali food when I feel like it. I don't keep a food diary or anything. It's not like I'm avoiding anything specific. It just happens. I really don't see how what I eat is gonna tell you anything. It's just...bloating.
DOCTOR: Okay. No food diary is fine. Let’s try a different approach. Besides the bloating, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…what kind of symptoms? I get tired, okay? Everyone gets tired. I work a hard job. Pile driving isn’t exactly a walk in the park. Is that what you mean? I don't know…pain? Sometimes my stomach gurgles. Does gurgling count as a symptom? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and stomach gurgling are good to know. Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood in my stool?! Seriously? Look, I came in here for bloating, not…that. No, no blood. No vomiting. No diarrhea, usually. I get a little…backed up sometimes, if I’m being honest. But that's just…old age and hard work, alright? This is getting too personal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood, occasional constipation. That's helpful. Now, just to get a full picture, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? I… I don’t weigh myself. Never have. I’m probably lighter, honestly. Haven't been eating much lately. But that’s just…stuff. Grief, okay? It takes away your appetite. Look, can we just…skip the questions? Are you gonna give me something for the bloating or what?
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand you’re frustrated, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize if the questions feel intrusive. We're just trying to rule things out. Since you mentioned grief and loss of appetite, and the constipation, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. Honestly, I doubt you'll find anything. It's just bloating. Don't poke too hard, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses. There’s some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, and I hear some active bowel sounds – that’s the gurgling you mentioned. No rebound tenderness. I don't hear any bruits. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it could be a number of things. It could be related to stress and changes in your diet or routine after your wife’s passing. Or it could be something like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or even a mild case of constipation contributing to the bloating. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. Never really taken much. Maybe some ibuprofen for aches and pains. But I don't take anything regularly. Look, can we just get a pill or something? I really don’t want to think about all this IBS stuff. It sounds…serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known medication allergies. Given your symptoms, and wanting something quick, I can recommend a stool softener and a simethicone, which helps with gas. I’m also going to order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count just to rule out any other underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever tests. Just…don't make me come back too often. And the stool softener and gas stuff…where do I get it? Can I get it here? I don't have time to run all over town.
DOCTOR: Yes, we have both here at the clinic. I'll send the orders to the pharmacy, and they can fill them for you while you're here. The results of the blood tests should be back in a couple of days. If anything concerning shows up, we’ll call you immediately. Otherwise, you can schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss how you're feeling. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Two weeks. Fine. As long as it's not a long appointment. Just…get it over with. Honestly, I got things to do. So, I just wait at the pharmacy now?
DOCTOR: Yes, just head to the pharmacy counter, and they’ll have your medication ready shortly. They’ll also be able to answer any questions you have about dosage and side effects. Here's the lab order. Please let me know if you have any concerns. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Kristofik. And again, I’m very sorry for your loss.
