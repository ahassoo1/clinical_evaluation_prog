DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It's... fine. Honestly, it's a bit silly, but my daughter, she says I should come get a card. A “Get Well” card, she called it. Even though I’m not sick sick. Just… a little down, I suppose. She thinks having a card from a real doctor will cheer me up. Young people these days… always with their ideas.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to come in. While it might seem unusual to seek a consultation for simply feeling “down,” your feelings are important, and we are happy to explore them. It’s good she’s looking out for you. Could you tell me a little more about what you mean by “down”?
PATIENT: Down... well, everything just feels a bit… grey, you know? Not bad, exactly. Just… lacking colour. My husband, bless his heart, he doesn’t understand it at all. He says I’ve always been a bit dramatic. And honestly, things are fine. We have a roof over our heads, food on the table... I should be happy. That’s what’s so frustrating about it! It’s not like I have a reason to be upset. It just is.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing a disconnect between how you feel and what you think you should be feeling, given your circumstances. That can be very frustrating, and it's perfectly valid to seek support for that. It’s not about having a specific “reason” to feel a certain way. To help me understand a little better, has this feeling been gradual, or did something specific trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Gradual, I think. It wasn't like a switch flipped. More like... the colour slowly faded, bit by bit. Maybe started a few months ago? Around the time my sister moved away, I suppose. She always had a knack for cheering me up, that one. But she’s in Australia now, and it’s not like I can just hop on a plane to visit. It’s just... things are changing, I guess. And I don't adapt well to changes. Never have.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Significant life changes, even positive ones, can be unsettling. And it sounds like your sister’s move was a particularly important loss of support for you. It’s perfectly natural to grieve that. Could you tell me a little about how this feeling of “grey” is impacting your day-to-day life?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not big things, you know? I still do my housework, I cook for my husband… I just… don’t enjoy it as much. Everything feels…effortful. Like I'm wading through mud. And I used to love my garden. Spent hours out there, tending to my flowers. Now… I look at it and I just… don’t feel like it. It feels silly to complain, really. I should be grateful for what I have, not moping about a few flowers. But it’s exhausting, this… nothingness.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Janeth. Those are significant changes in your enjoyment of things you previously loved. That loss of pleasure is important to address, and it's not something you should feel guilty about. The exhaustion you describe is also a common symptom. Now, let's talk a bit more generally. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Well... my sleep’s been a bit… patchy. Not that I can’t sleep, exactly. Just… restless. I wake up a lot during the night. And I don't feel particularly tired during the day, but I'm never rested, you know? As for my appetite… it’s okay. I still eat, but nothing really tastes as good as it used to. Everything’s a bit… bland. It’s like the colour’s faded from everything, not just my flowers.
DOCTOR: I see. Patchy sleep and a diminished enjoyment of food are both things we often see with changes in mood. Have you experienced any difficulty concentrating or remembering things lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! That's been terrible. My husband keeps teasing me about forgetting where I put my glasses... which is very funny, I assure you. But it’s not just small things, either. I struggle to follow the news on TV, and I keep losing my train of thought mid-sentence. It’s embarrassing, really. I used to have such a sharp mind, you know? My daughter used to say I could remember everything. Now… it's all a bit hazy. It’s like my brain is full of cotton wool.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re experiencing a number of changes that are impacting your daily life. While it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, based on what you’ve told me—the persistent low mood, loss of interest in activities you enjoy, patchy sleep, changes in appetite, and difficulties with concentration and memory—it’s important to explore the possibility of depression. Now, I want to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not really. I had a bad bout of the flu a few years ago, but that’s it. And my arthritis, of course. It’s just old age, really. It flares up from time to time, mostly in my hands and knees. Nothing major. I manage it with some cream and a bit of gentle exercise. My husband always says I worry too much about my health. He thinks I imagine things. Honestly, I probably do. It's probably just a phase. This whole thing, I mean.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. And while it's good you're managing your arthritis, it's important to rule out any underlying medical causes for how you're feeling. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a surgical type, me. Always preferred a bit of herbal tea and a good rest to anything more drastic. My mother always said that natural remedies are the best. She had a garden full of them. And she lived to be ninety-five, so she must have been onto something, right? Though, truthfully, she was a bit… eccentric. Always talking to her plants. Still, never needed a hospital. Just the usual sniffles and coughs, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And it's wonderful your mother lived such a long life. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that's a tricky one. My mother’s side was… well, a bit scattered. She didn’t talk about them much. She had a few siblings, but I never met them. My father’s side was a bit more stable, I suppose. He had a brother, but he died young, in the war. And… there was a cousin, somewhere, but I haven’t seen her in decades. Honestly, I don’t think anyone in my family ever suffered from anything… like this. Not feeling… grey. Just normal aches and pains, old age things, you know? It's probably just me. I always was a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Janeth. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Are you currently working, or retired?
PATIENT: Retired. Oh, goodness, yes. Been retired for… let me think… almost fifteen years now. Used to work in a factory, assembling… things. Small parts, mostly. It was… repetitive, but it kept me busy. And I had a good group of friends there. But most of them have retired now too, and we don’t see each other as much anymore. It's hard to keep in touch. Everyone goes their own way.
DOCTOR: That’s very common. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you enjoy currently?
PATIENT: Well... I used to love gardening, as I mentioned. And I used to enjoy reading, but I find it hard to concentrate these days. I watch a bit of television, mostly the news. But it's all so… depressing. And I do a bit of knitting, from time to time. Mostly scarves and blankets for my grandchildren. But it doesn't feel the same anymore. It’s just… everything feels a bit…flat. Like I'm going through the motions, but without any real joy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, and do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No medications, thankfully. Just a bit of cream for my arthritis, as I said. And no allergies. Never had one in my life. Always been a very healthy person, otherwise. It's just… this feeling. This… grey feeling. It’s just so… unusual. It’s not like I'm ill. It’s just… a bit of sadness, I suppose. Maybe it will just go away on its own. Like a passing cloud. That's what my husband says, anyway. He thinks I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Janeth. It’s very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you are experiencing a number of symptoms that are concerning for depression. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any underlying medical causes for how you’re feeling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A physical exam? Well... I suppose so. I don’t particularly like doctors, you know? Always poking and prodding. But if you think it’s necessary… alright. Go ahead. Just be gentle, please. And try not to take too long. I have a bit of knitting I'd like to get back to. Though, truthfully, I don’t think I have much energy for it anymore. Still, one must try, right?
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and we won’t take long. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Though, truthfully, I haven’t been breathing very well these days. All this… worry. It takes the air right out of you, you know? My husband keeps telling me to relax, but it's not that simple. It's hard to breathe when everything feels so… heavy.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety. Next, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your ears are clear, and your throat looks healthy. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Alright. Though, truthfully, my reflexes aren’t what they used to be. I'm always dropping things these days. My husband keeps teasing me about it, but it’s not very funny, you know? It’s just… embarrassing. It feels like my body is… slowing down. Everything feels a bit… sluggish. Old age, I suppose. It catches up with you eventually.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a bit diminished, as you said, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, I’m just going to feel your thyroid gland to check for any swelling. Your thyroid feels normal. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Everything seems physically healthy. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with depression. While a physical exam didn’t reveal any obvious medical causes, it’s important to rule out any underlying issues. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding. Honestly, I don’t like doctors at all. But… if you think it’s necessary. Alright. Do what you have to do. Just try to be quick, please. And try not to take too much blood. I don’t want to faint. My husband would never forgive me. It’s just… all this worry. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. The blood draw shouldn’t take long, and we’ll have you sit or lie down if you feel lightheaded. While we wait for the results of the blood tests, I would like to talk to you about some treatment options. One option is medication, which can help regulate your mood. Another option is therapy, which can help you learn coping mechanisms and address the underlying causes of your depression. We can also discuss lifestyle changes, such as exercise and diet, which can also improve your mood. What are your thoughts on these options?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Medication? No, no, absolutely not. I don't like taking pills. Never have. Always preferred a bit of herbal tea and a good rest to anything drastic. And therapy? Talking about my feelings? No, no, that sounds awful. I'm a very private person. I don’t like to burden others with my problems. Honestly, I think I just need a bit of time to myself. A bit of peace and quiet. That's all. Maybe it will just go away on its own. That's what my husband says, anyway. He thinks I worry too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly valid to be hesitant about medication and therapy. We can certainly start with a “wait and see” approach, and see if your symptoms improve with time and self-care. However, if your symptoms persist or worsen, it’s important to consider other options. Prolonged depression can have a significant impact on your health and well-being. In the meantime, I would like to recommend some resources that can provide support and information. There are support groups for people experiencing depression, and there are also online resources that can provide helpful coping strategies. Would you be interested in learning more about these resources?
PATIENT: Support groups… hmm. That sounds… intimidating. Being around a group of strangers, talking about… everything. No, no, I don’t think so. And online resources? I’m not very good with computers. My daughter tries to teach me, but I just get confused. Honestly, I think I just need to… distract myself. Maybe do a bit of knitting. Or watch some television. Something to take my mind off things. I just want to feel… normal again. That’s all. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. And it's perfectly alright to prefer to cope in your own way, at your own pace. We will respect your decisions. I will order the blood tests as discussed, and we can review the results in a week. If your symptoms haven't improved, or if they worsen, please don't hesitate to call the office. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a handout with some information on managing stress and improving mood. It includes some simple exercises and relaxation techniques you can try. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Hmm. Relaxation techniques… well, I suppose it’s worth a try. But honestly, I don’t think anything can help. It’s just… this feeling. It’s so pervasive. It’s like a dark cloud hanging over everything. But thank you, Doctor. For listening to me, anyway. It’s nice to have someone… acknowledge it. Even if you can’t fix it. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… thank you. And please… be gentle with the blood draw. I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as gentle as possible. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns or questions after the blood draw. I'm happy to help in any way I can. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Thank you for coming in today, Janeth. Take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
