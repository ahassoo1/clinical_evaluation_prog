DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… want to know more about where my people come from. My family, that is. I hear you can do a test… a DNA test? To see who we are, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. You're interested in genetic ancestry testing. That’s certainly something we can discuss. It can provide information about your ancestral origins, though it's important to understand what it can and can't tell us. First, just to clarify – are you experiencing any specific health concerns right now, or is this purely for genealogical interest?
PATIENT: No health problems, Doctor. Just… curiosity. Always been curious. My grandfather, he tell stories… about islands, other islands. But stories get lost, you know? I want to see it, if that make sense. Not for sickness, just… who I am.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s wonderful you’re interested in your heritage. So, this is primarily about tracing your family’s roots. Okay. Genetic ancestry tests look at specific markers in your DNA and compare them to databases of populations around the world. It can give you an estimate of your ethnic origins. It’s important to know though, that these tests aren’t perfect. The databases aren't complete, and results are estimates. Also, results can sometimes be a bit… broad. Before we proceed, do you have any family medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Family… not much I know for sure, Doctor. Grandfather, he not write things down. He talk… about strong people, good fishermen. Some… trouble with sickness on the islands, long time ago. But not… what you call… details. Like heart trouble, or… things like that. Mostly just… hard life, you know? Hard work, sun, sea. I think everyone smoked too much when they were young. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A history of a "hard life" and potential smoking can be relevant, even without specifics. We'll note that. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever had any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Lucky so far, I think. Little coughs, little aches… old man stuff. Never been in hospital. Never had… cutting, or anything like that. I try to eat good fish, walk a little. That’s all. I got Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Medicare is good to know. That's excellent that you've been generally healthy. Alright. Now, let's talk about the DNA test itself. There are several companies that offer these tests. They usually involve a saliva sample that you can collect at home and mail in. The results typically take a few weeks to come back. Would you like me to provide you with information on some reputable companies?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be good. Reputable… that’s important. Don’t want to send my spit to just anyone. How much… cost? Is it very expensive? I don’t have much money, you understand. Just… fishing money.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We want to make sure you’re comfortable with everything. The cost varies depending on the company and the level of detail you want. Some of the more basic tests, offering a broad overview of your ethnic origins, can be around $99 to $199. More comprehensive tests, which can provide information about specific regions and potential relatives, can be more expensive—upwards of $250 or $300. I have a brochure here with information on a few companies we recommend, including 23andMe and AncestryDNA. They both have good reputations for privacy and accuracy. They also sometimes have sales. Would you like me to go through some of the pros and cons of each with you?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Pros and… what you call… bad things? I don’t know much about computers, or… DNA. Just want to know where my family come from. Tell me the simple things. Which one is best for a… old fisherman, who just wants to know his roots? Not for… fancy things, just simple. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let’s keep it simple. Both 23andMe and AncestryDNA are good options. 23andMe often provides a slightly more detailed breakdown of ethnic origins, and they also offer health reports, though you said you’re not interested in those right now. AncestryDNA has a larger database, which can be helpful if you’re interested in finding potential relatives. For a simple overview of your roots, I'd probably recommend AncestryDNA. The larger database means you might have a slightly better chance of finding connections to other people from the Marshall Islands. It costs around $99 for the basic test. However, both companies have privacy concerns, so be sure to read their terms and conditions carefully. They may share your data with research institutions, although you can opt out. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Privacy… that’s bad, you mean? They take my spit, then… tell other people? I don’t like that. I just want to know my family, not… everyone else. Maybe I don’t want the test then. Is there… any other way? Like… talking to people? Or… old books? I heard stories about old books, with names and places. Would that be better? I don’t want to give my spit to strangers.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be cautious. Privacy is a very important concern, and you’re perfectly justified in being hesitant. You’re correct; these companies do collect your data, and while they have policies in place to protect it, there's always a risk. Honestly, for someone primarily interested in their family history, and concerned about privacy, talking to people and researching old records is often the best approach. DNA tests can be a good starting point, but they’re not always necessary, and they do come with risks. Old books, historical societies, and family interviews can be incredibly valuable. Are there any elders in your community who might have knowledge of family history?
PATIENT: There used to be… Old Man Taro, he knew everything. But he passed away last year. Sad. His son… maybe he knows some things. Lives on the other side of the island. I haven't talked to him in a long time. He was always busy with… boats, I think. Maybe I will go see him. It's a long walk, but… better than giving my spit to strangers. Thank you, Doctor. You helped me think. I don't need the test. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. That sounds like a wonderful idea. Connecting with your community and speaking with family members is often the most rewarding way to learn about your roots. If you do decide you want to explore the DNA testing option at a later date, feel free to come back and we can discuss it further. But it sounds like you have a good plan. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. Just wanted to know about the spit. Thank you for your time. You have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope you have a wonderful day as well, and I wish you all the best in your search for your family history.
