DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Please have a seat. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s my stomach, really. I’ve been having… a lot of trouble with it lately. It’s been, like, really loose. For a while now, I think. It's hard to say exactly how long, honestly. Everything just feels… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Loose” stools and feeling generally “off” – that’s a good starting point. When you say “for a while now,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, that's a good question. See, my memory isn’t the greatest… I want to say maybe a few weeks? Possibly longer? It feels like it’s been getting worse gradually, though. Before it was just… inconvenient, now it’s… well, it’s a bit worrying, to be honest. I keep having to run to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention, and it's perfectly alright if you're not certain on the exact timeline. “Gradually getting worse” is helpful information. Besides the frequency and looseness of your stools, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been really tired, actually. More tired than usual, and I always thought I was pretty energetic. And… sometimes my stomach cramps up, really badly. Not every time, but often enough that I notice it. And… I've lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t really… weighed myself recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, stomach cramps, and some unintentional weight loss. Those are all things we should investigate. When you say “tiredness,” is this fatigue that doesn’t improve with rest, or is it more of a general lack of energy throughout the day?
PATIENT: It’s… both, I think. Like, I can sleep a full night, and still wake up feeling exhausted. And then throughout the day, even if I haven’t done much, I just feel completely drained. It’s not like I’m unable to do things, but everything feels… harder. It takes a lot more effort than it used to. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fatigue that isn’t relieved by sleep is definitely something we want to explore further. Now, regarding the cramps, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Okay, good. They’re… like, really sharp, twisting pains. Mostly in my lower stomach, you know? Sometimes it feels like it’s all over, but it starts there. And they come and go. It’s not constant, thankfully. But when they hit, they really knock me for six. They can last anywhere from a few minutes to… maybe half an hour? It varies.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp, twisting pains in the lower abdomen, lasting minutes to half an hour. Good information. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain or the loose stools worse, or anything that seems to make them better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. I think… certain foods definitely make it worse. Spicy things, for sure. And dairy. Dairy really doesn't agree with me at the moment. As for better… honestly, not much. Resting sometimes helps a little, but it's not a guarantee. And staying hydrated, I guess? But I’ve been trying to do that anyway. It's hard to pinpoint anything specific that reliably makes it better.
DOCTOR: Okay, spicy foods and dairy seem to exacerbate the symptoms. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I think so? My doctor a while back, before we moved, mentioned something about… I want to say… something with my intestines? Or maybe my stomach lining? It was a long time ago, and like I said, my memory isn’t great. They put me on some medication for it, but I stopped taking it a few years ago. I think it was something to do with how I was absorbing things, but honestly, the details are really fuzzy. And I was also told something about celiac disease, but I don't recall ever being diagnosed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, even with the fuzziness. It sounds like there may have been some investigation into possible intestinal or digestive issues in the past, and a mention of celiac disease. We'll need to clarify that. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you were taking, or roughly when you were on it?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is the frustrating part. I really wish I could remember more! I… vaguely recall the pills being small and white? And I think… I was taking them for about a year? Maybe a bit longer. As for the name... I'm trying so hard to think, but it's just a blank. I honestly don't remember the doctor's name either, unfortunately. We just moved around a lot then, and I never really followed up with the same doctor for long. It was years ago, and I feel awful for not being able to remember.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jase. Don’t worry about it. It's very common to forget details like that, especially when it was some time ago. We can work with what we have. Let's shift gears a bit. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I stopped taking everything when I stopped seeing that doctor, and I haven't really started anything new since. Just… nothing. I try to eat as healthy as possible, but no supplements or vitamins.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I mean, I don't love shellfish, but that's more of a taste thing, not an allergy! I've always been pretty good with food and medications, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mum has high blood pressure, I think? And my dad… he had some trouble with his stomach when he was younger, but I don't know what it was. I think my grandmother on my mum’s side had something with her bowels, maybe? But again, I'm really hazy on the details. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it much. My family isn’t really the type to discuss health issues, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for families to not openly discuss health concerns. So, a history of high blood pressure in your mother, and possible stomach/bowel issues in your grandmother. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. I don't smoke, I rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine once or twice a year at a special occasion, and I definitely don’t do any recreational drugs. I try to live a pretty healthy lifestyle, as much as possible, given everything that's been going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, can you tell me a bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Okay, um… I try to eat fairly healthy. Lots of vegetables, lean protein, that kind of thing. I try to avoid processed foods as much as possible. But lately… with my stomach being so upset, it's been hard to eat much at all. I've been sticking to pretty bland foods – toast, rice, plain chicken. And I've definitely been avoiding anything spicy or dairy, as we talked about. I drink a lot of water, too, to stay hydrated. But honestly, it’s been a struggle. I’ve lost my appetite quite a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, a generally healthy diet, currently limited to bland foods due to your symptoms and loss of appetite. Thank you for sharing that, Jase. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam if that’s alright with you. We’ll start by listening to your abdomen and then palpate it to see if we can identify any areas of tenderness. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever I need to do to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm listening to your abdomen now. Your bowel sounds are… slightly diminished, but present. That’s not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it’s something we’ll keep an eye on. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain. …Okay, there’s some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. It doesn’t seem to be sharp or severe, but it is present. Alright, that’s all for the abdominal exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I'm concerned about possible inflammation or irritation in your digestive system. Given your history and symptoms, we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a stool sample to check for infection or parasites, and a celiac disease screening. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get it sorted. A stool sample… is that going to be awkward? But yes, please, go ahead with all those tests. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel a little awkward about the stool sample, but it's a very important test. The lab will provide you with specific instructions and all the necessary supplies. It's a simple procedure, and we’ll do everything we can to make it as comfortable as possible. We'll also get the lab requisitions sorted for the blood tests. You can go to [Local Lab Name] – they are open [Lab Hours] and you don't need an appointment. In the meantime, continue to avoid spicy foods and dairy, stay hydrated, and try to eat small, frequent meals of bland foods. Once we have the lab results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. Thank you, Doctor. [Local Lab Name], you said? And no appointment needed? That's good. I’ll try to get that done as soon as possible. Small, bland meals… I can do that. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and trying to figure this out. I was starting to get really worried.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I understand your concern, and we'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Yes, [Local Lab Name], and no appointment is needed. I'm also going to send a referral to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s a specialist in digestive health, and it’s always good to have a specialist involved, even if it turns out to be something straightforward. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed today, as well as the lab requisitions and the referral information. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh, a specialist! That's good, that makes me feel better. Dr. Anya Sharma, I'll remember that name. No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I know it's a lot to take in, but I feel a bit more… hopeful now. Thank you again, Doctor Solero.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Remember to follow the dietary recommendations and schedule the lab tests as soon as possible. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Take care, and I hope you start feeling better soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Goodbye.
