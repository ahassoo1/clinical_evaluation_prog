DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Doctor Pehrson, is it? A pleasure. Well, to be perfectly frank, it's about a rather… ill-advised dietary experiment I’ve been undertaking. It seemed sensible at the time, reading about it, you understand, but in practice… it hasn't been entirely successful. I believe my daughter suggested I come and have a professional opinion. It involves a great deal of cabbage, you see.
DOCTOR: Cabbage, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, quite a lot of cabbage. And very little else, for a period. I'm not entirely certain why I thought it was a good idea. One reads so much these days, you know? All sorts of promises. Weight loss, vitality… It sounded rather appealing, really. Though I must admit, the… aroma became rather pervasive. My housekeeper was less than thrilled.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long have you been on this… cabbage diet?
PATIENT: Let me see… I began on the 15th of July, so approximately eighteen days as of today. I kept a meticulous log, actually. Dates, weights, even a rather detailed account of the… social ramifications of the diet. Difficult to attend events, you see, with such… distinct olfactory properties. It's all rather thoroughly documented, if you’d care to see it. I'm quite proud of the calligraphy, actually.
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s alright. Eighteen days. And what exactly is bothering you now?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s a confluence of issues, really. Initially, it was merely a… certain discomfort. A feeling of being… rather full, if you follow. But now… well, I've found myself experiencing a rather unsettling degree of… internal rumbling. And a lack of energy, naturally. I attempted a rather brisk walk yesterday and found myself quite winded. And, if I may be candid, the, shall we say, output has become… unpredictable. It’s a rather delicate matter to discuss, I realise, but I felt it pertinent to mention it.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable… right. Any fever, nausea, vomiting?
PATIENT: No fever, thankfully. And I haven’t been sick, no. Just… unsettled. And rather… gassy, if I may use the vernacular. It's not a pleasant condition, Doctor. I've always prided myself on my composure, you see. To be… audibly expressing discomfort is… distressing. It's rather impacted my bridge game, actually. One simply can't concentrate when one is preoccupied with… internal noises. My partner was quite cross.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just take a listen to your abdomen, alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. Though I must confess, I’m rather sensitive. I’ve always had a delicate constitution, you see. And, if I may preemptively apologise, there may be… sounds. It’s a direct consequence of the cabbage, I assure you. I should have known better, really. One reads about these things, but experiencing them firsthand is… quite another matter. Is there anything specific I should be doing – or not doing – during this… examination?
DOCTOR: Just lie back and relax. Try not to tense up. And… try to be quiet. I need to hear things, remember?
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. Perfectly quiet. Though I can’t make any promises regarding… spontaneous occurrences. The cabbage, you understand. It has a life of its own, it seems. I shall endeavor to remain as still and silent as humanly possible. Proceed at your leisure.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm hearing… a lot. Bowel sounds are definitely active. Some… gurgling. And you're a little tender here, on the left side. Have you had any constipation?
PATIENT: Constipation? Not precisely. It’s more… expedited. A rather… frequent and forceful evacuation, shall we say. The speed is… remarkable. Perhaps too remarkable. It's rather disrupted my routine, to be frank. I usually enjoy a leisurely morning with the Times, but I've found myself… closely monitoring my proximity to the facilities. It's not conducive to intellectual pursuits, Doctor. And it’s rather embarrassing, if I may be candid. One doesn’t relish explaining such matters to one’s friends. They’d think I’d gone quite mad, embarking on a cabbage-based regime.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sounds like… a classic case of cabbage overload. It's causing gas, bloating, and… a bit of digestive distress. Not dangerous, but certainly unpleasant. We need to get you off this diet, and gradually reintroduce other foods.
PATIENT: That is… profoundly reassuring, Doctor. I suspected as much, though I confess I was beginning to fear the worst. A “cabbage overload,” you say? A rather undignified affliction, wouldn’t you agree? And yes, please, do enlighten me as to how one “gradually reintroduces” other foods. I’ve been subsisting on little else for eighteen days, and the prospect of returning to a… normal diet is somewhat daunting. Perhaps a small portion of toast to begin with? And certainly nothing cruciferous. One must learn from one’s mistakes, you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah, toast is fine. Start small. And… avoid the cabbage. Obviously. Broth, rice, bananas… the BRAT diet. And drink plenty of water. It'll take a few days to get things back to normal. Here. This has some more detailed instructions. Don’t push it. And if it gets worse – severe pain, fever, vomiting – go to the ER. Understand?
PATIENT: Very good. Toast, broth, rice, bananas. And avoidance of all things cruciferous. I shall endeavor to adhere to this regimen with the utmost diligence, Doctor. The ER… a rather sobering thought. I sincerely hope it won’t come to that. Thank you, Doctor Pehrson. You have alleviated a considerable amount of anxiety. I shall take these instructions home and… commence Operation Recovery forthwith. Perhaps a cup of weak tea to begin? And a very small piece of toast, naturally.
DOCTOR: Right. Get some rest. And… try not to eat so much cabbage in the future.
