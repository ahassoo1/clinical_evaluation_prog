DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, to put it simply, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and… strangely hungry too. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s just not letting up. I find myself constantly reaching for water, and then feeling peckish shortly after eating. It's a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm, I understand. Thirsty and hungry, for a few weeks… unsettling is a good word for it. Alright. Now, can you tell me a bit more about this thirst?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… not like a dry mouth sort of thirst, if that makes sense? It’s more of a constant feeling of needing to replenish fluids, no matter how much I drink. I've tried increasing my water intake, as you might expect, but it doesn't seem to make a significant difference. I could drink a litre and feel… momentarily better, but then it's back within an hour or so. It’s rather bothersome, especially during the warmer weather we’ve been having.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm… a constant need, even with increased intake. And it doesn't truly satisfy it. Alright. And you mentioned hunger as well?
PATIENT: Yes, quite. It's… not a normal hunger, either. It feels like I’ve just eaten a large meal, but then within a short period, maybe an hour or two, I'm feeling the need to eat again. It’s not a craving for anything specific, just… an emptiness, a need to fill myself up. It's rather frustrating, and I’ve found myself snacking more than usual, which isn’t terribly healthy, I suppose. I'm not sure if the thirst and hunger are related, but they started around the same time.
DOCTOR: That is helpful to know – starting around the same time. Okay. Now, has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Not that I’m aware of, not really. Work’s been the same, fairly routine shipping and receiving. My divorce was finalized about six months ago now, so that’s settled, thankfully. I’ve been trying to get more exercise, just walks in the evenings, but nothing strenuous. Oh… I did start taking a new vitamin supplement a couple of months back, a general multivitamin. I can’t recall the brand name offhand, but it was recommended by a friend. I suppose that could be something?
DOCTOR: A new multivitamin… yes, that’s good to know. We’ll definitely look into that. And just to clarify, when you say 'routine' at work, does that involve a lot of physical exertion, or is it mostly sedentary?
PATIENT: Mostly sedentary, Doctor. A good portion of my day is spent at a desk, processing paperwork, entering data into the computer. There's some walking involved – going between the warehouse and the office, loading paperwork, that sort of thing – but nothing particularly strenuous. It’s not a physically demanding job, by any stretch of the imagination. I’m glad you asked, as I realize I wasn’t very descriptive earlier.
DOCTOR: That's alright, take your time. Okay, sedentary work… Now, have you noticed any changes in how often you're urinating?
PATIENT: That’s… actually, yes, now that you mention it. I have been going to the bathroom more frequently, particularly at night. It’s not excruciating, or anything, just… more trips than usual. I've put it down to drinking more water, to be honest, but perhaps it's connected to everything else. I wouldn’t say it’s a flood, just… a more constant need to go. It's been interrupting my sleep a little, which isn’t ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urination, even at night… alright. Now, have you experienced any unexplained weight loss or weight gain recently?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. My weight has been fairly stable, give or take a pound or two, which is normal fluctuation, I suppose. I haven't been actively trying to lose or gain weight. If anything, I might have gained a little bit, from the extra snacking, but it’s nothing significant. I weighed myself a couple of weeks ago, and it was roughly the same as always. Around 93 kilograms, if you need a precise number.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms… yes, that aligns with the previous records. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No, my vision seems fine, Doctor. I wear glasses, as you can see, but my prescription hasn’t changed recently. I had my eyes checked last year, and everything was normal. No blurring, no spots, no double vision… nothing like that. It’s been stable for quite some time, thankfully. I wouldn’t say I’m particularly observant, but I think I’d notice if my vision was deteriorating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, that sort of thing – but nothing serious. I haven’t had any major illnesses or hospitalizations as an adult. I’ve seen a doctor regularly for check-ups, and everything has always been within normal limits. My father had high blood pressure, if that’s relevant, but I haven’t experienced any symptoms myself. I suppose genetics could play a role, but I wouldn’t worry myself over it unduly.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven't required any surgical interventions, thankfully. I had my tonsils removed as a child, but that was a very routine procedure. Otherwise, I’ve managed to avoid the operating room, which I’m rather grateful for. I don’t particularly care for hospitals, to be honest. It’s probably silly, but the smell always makes me feel uneasy.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: No, not currently. Aside from that multivitamin I mentioned earlier, I don't take any prescription medications. I don't have any allergies that require an EpiPen or anything like that. I’m not a fan of taking pills, to be honest, and I avoid them whenever possible. I prefer to manage any minor ailments with rest and hydration, if I can. I've always been rather cautious about putting things into my body that aren't absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have, never will. I’ve always been a non-smoker. My parents were both smokers, unfortunately, and I saw the effects firsthand, so I’ve never been inclined to pick up the habit myself. It’s a dreadful thing, really, and I avoid being around it whenever possible. I wouldn't dream of putting something like that into my lungs. I suppose it’s a bit of a strong stance, but I feel quite strongly about it.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much alcohol do you typically drink in a week?
PATIENT: Very little, Doctor. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps one or two times a week, but I wouldn’t say I drink regularly. It's more of a social thing, to be honest. I don't rely on alcohol to relax or unwind, and I certainly don't drink to excess. I wouldn’t consider myself a drinker, by any stretch of the imagination. A quiet evening with a good book is far more appealing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Christen. That’s very helpful. Now, based on what you've told me – the excessive thirst and hunger, frequent urination, and the lack of any significant past medical history – a few things come to mind. We need to rule some things out. I’d like to start with a blood sugar test, to check for diabetes. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And a urine analysis, to check for infection or other abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. If those tests can help determine the cause of this… discomfort, then I’m more than happy to proceed. It’s a relief to have a plan of action, to be honest. I’m quite trusting in your expertise. Just let me know what I need to do, and I'll cooperate fully. I'd like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible, if that’s alright. It’s just… unsettling, as I said before.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. We’ll get you taken care of. Nurse, could you please draw blood for a blood sugar test, a basic metabolic panel, and collect a urine sample from Christen?
PATIENT: .
