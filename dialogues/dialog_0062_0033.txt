DOCTOR: Hi Ms. Julie, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather obvious, isn’t it? The note clearly states… sudden loss of vision and hearing. Honestly, I haven’t got all day to rehash everything. I’m a very busy woman.
DOCTOR: You’re right, of course. My apologies. The note does mention the sudden vision and hearing loss. I just like to hear it directly from the patient, to get a fuller picture. Can you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it all feels like a blur. Perhaps… a week ago? Or was it ten days? It came on so suddenly, I really couldn't say with any precision. It was just… gone. Not gradually fading, but simply… absent. Really quite unsettling for someone in my profession, you understand. One needs one’s senses.
DOCTOR: I can only imagine how frightening that must have been, especially given your profession. So, about a week to ten days ago… was there anything that happened right before it started?
PATIENT: Anything happened? Doctor, are you implying I’ve done something to cause this? I assure you, my life is exceedingly ordered and predictable. There was no… trauma, no illness, no unusual activity whatsoever. Just… a perfectly normal day, followed by this unfortunate… deficiency. It’s probably some ridiculous virus, honestly. The things one picks up.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I just ask because sometimes a specific event can give us clues. It's good to know you weren't feeling unwell or experiencing any injury beforehand. Okay. And has this been constant since it started?
PATIENT: Constant? Yes, quite. It hasn't magically reappeared, if that's what you're asking. I haven't woken up one morning with restored vision and hearing, no. It's… uniformly absent. Really, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this? I have a rather important charity gala to attend next week, and I need to know if I’ll be able to… participate.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Ms. Julie. It’s important to gather all the details, even if it seems…constant. Just to clarify, is it complete loss, or is there any…flickering, any sense of light or sound at all?
PATIENT: Doctor, I said loss. Complete. As in, nothing. Black. Silent. Do you need me to spell it out? I am a surgeon, not a simpleton. I understand the concept of ‘complete’ quite well, thank you. Honestly, the questions… it's rather insulting.
DOCTOR: You’re right, of course. My apologies for the repetitive questioning. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the vision and hearing loss?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Well, I have been feeling… rather fatigued lately. But frankly, Doctor, who isn’t? It's a stressful world. And perhaps a little…off balance. But again, easily dismissed. Probably just dehydration. I do try to keep up with my social engagements, you know. It's exhausting. Is this relevant? Honestly, I’m starting to feel rather unwell now, simply from all these questions. Perhaps a sedative would be in order. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. Fatigue and feeling off balance are relevant. It's good you mentioned them. While it could be dehydration, those symptoms, combined with the sudden vision and hearing loss, are concerning and we need to investigate further. I’m going to take a look at your medical history, just to see if anything stands out. Then, I’d like to do a quick neurological exam, if you’re willing, just to assess your reflexes and balance. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
