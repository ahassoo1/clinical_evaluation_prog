DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, well, I've been having this ringing in my ears. It's been going on for a little while now and it's starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: I see. Ringing in the ears, you say. That can certainly be disruptive. To help me understand what might be causing it, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. It's...hard to explain. It's not like a constant thing, you know? It comes and goes. Sometimes it's a high-pitched whine, other times it's more of a buzzing. It's mostly in my left ear, but sometimes I hear it in both. And it's worse when it's quiet. Like, at night when I'm trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying. It sounds like it's intermittent and varies in pitch, and is more noticeable in quiet environments, predominantly in your left ear, though it can occur bilaterally. When did this ringing start, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm...that's a good question. I think it started maybe...three or four months ago? It was really faint at first, I almost didn't notice it. I just thought it was the fan or something. But it's definitely gotten louder over time. It's been worse the last couple of weeks, to be honest. I'm a waiter, so I'm around a lot of noise all the time. Maybe that's got something to do with it?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Jaylyne. Three to four months ago, initially faint, progressively worsening, and more noticeable in the last couple of weeks. And you work as a waiter, placing you in a potentially noisy environment. It’s quite possible that noise exposure is a contributing factor. Before we explore that further, have you experienced any hearing loss, dizziness, or a feeling of fullness in your ears alongside the ringing?
PATIENT: No, not really. My hearing seems okay, I haven't noticed any trouble hearing people, thankfully. No dizziness or anything like that either. And my ears don't feel full or blocked, just...the ringing. It's just annoying, you know? It makes it hard to concentrate sometimes. Especially when I'm trying to take orders.
DOCTOR: I understand. No hearing loss, dizziness, or aural fullness. Just the bothersome ringing, and difficulty concentrating, particularly during work. Let’s move on to some general health questions. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. Otherwise, I've always been pretty healthy. Oh, I got divorced last year, but that's not a medical thing, right? I mean, it was stressful, but…I'm managing. I have private insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Jaylyne. Tonsillectomy in childhood, otherwise generally healthy, and a recent divorce, which you rightly point out is not a medical condition, but I appreciate your honesty about the stress. And yes, your private insurance is noted. Do you have any family history of hearing loss, ear problems, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Um...that's a tough one. My dad's side of the family, they're mostly in Fiji, so I don't really know much about their health. I know my grandfather was pretty deaf when he got old, but I don't know if that was just age or something else. My mum's side, they're all pretty healthy as far as I know. No one I can think of with ear problems or anything neurological. Sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jaylyne. Family history is often difficult to ascertain. Knowing your grandfather experienced hearing loss with age is useful information, nonetheless. Now, regarding your current medications and any allergies you may have, are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: No, I'm not taking anything regularly. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, but that’s it. And I don't have any allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty simple, really. I just want this ringing to stop. It’s driving me crazy!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jaylyne. No regular medications, no known allergies. Now, before we proceed with an examination, could you describe your typical daily routine and any recreational activities or habits you have?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. So, I wake up, get ready for work. I'm a waiter at a pretty busy restaurant downtown, so I'm on my feet for most of the day, lots of noise, lots of people. I usually get home pretty late, so I just eat, watch a little TV, and go to bed. I don't really have a lot of time for hobbies or anything. I used to play a bit of rugby, but…not anymore. I don't drink a lot, maybe a beer or two on the weekend. And I definitely don't smoke. Just…work, mostly. It’s pretty boring, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for providing that information, Jaylyne. A demanding work schedule with significant noise exposure, and limited time for recreational activities. No smoking, moderate alcohol consumption. Alright, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your ears, nose, and throat. We’ll also check your neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on with this ringing. Let’s get it over with, if that’s okay. I have another shift later tonight, so the quicker the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jaylyne. I understand your concern and time constraints. Please have a seat and recline back. I’m going to start by looking into your ears with an otoscope. Okay, your ear canals appear clear, and your tympanic membranes – that’s your eardrums – look normal. No signs of infection or fluid buildup. Your neurological function appears normal as well. No signs of any nerve damage or other issues. Now, I’m going to perform a Weber and Rinne test to assess your hearing. This involves placing a tuning fork on your head and near your ears. It doesn't hurt, but please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. The Weber test is normal. The Rinne test...appears normal as well. However, these tests are fairly subjective, and subtle differences can be difficult to detect.
PATIENT: Okay, good. Glad everything looks okay. So, what does that mean? Is it still a problem if the tests are normal? I thought those tests were supposed to tell you something...is it just in my head, then? Because my ex-wife used to say…nevermind. I just want it to stop, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jaylyne, and I appreciate you sharing your concerns. It’s common to feel disheartened when initial tests don’t reveal a clear cause. The normal findings on the otoscopic exam, Weber, and Rinne tests don't necessarily rule out a problem. These tests primarily assess for conductive hearing loss – issues with sound transmission through the outer and middle ear. What you’re describing – ringing in the ears, without accompanying hearing loss – often points to sensorineural hearing loss, or more specifically, tinnitus. Tinnitus is the perception of sound when no external sound is present. It’s a very common condition and can be caused by a variety of factors, including noise exposure – which, given your work environment, is a strong possibility – stress, certain medications, and even age-related changes. In many cases, the exact cause is never identified. It's not simply “in your head” in the sense of being imagined. It’s a real phenomenon caused by changes in the auditory system. While frustrating, it's often manageable. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay…so it's not something seriously wrong with my brain or anything? Just…my ears? And the noise from work could be the cause? That makes sense, actually. It did start getting worse when things got busier at the restaurant. So what can we do about it? Are there any pills or something? I really can't afford to lose my job over this. I need to know if I have to quit, or…I don’t know. This is stressful, even more so than the divorce, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Jaylyne. It's completely reasonable to be concerned about your job, and I want to reassure you that we'll explore all possible options. No, this doesn’t suggest anything seriously wrong with your brain. It's most likely related to your auditory system – specifically, your inner ear and the nerves that transmit sound to your brain. Regarding treatment, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all “cure” for tinnitus. However, there are several management strategies we can consider. Pills are rarely the answer, and there aren't medications specifically designed to eliminate tinnitus. However, if the tinnitus is causing significant anxiety or sleep disturbance, we might consider a short course of medication to help manage those symptoms. More commonly, we focus on strategies to help you cope with the sound and reduce its impact on your daily life. These include: Sound therapy: Using background noise – like white noise or nature sounds – to mask the tinnitus and make it less noticeable. Tinnitus Retraining Therapy : A more structured approach involving counseling and sound therapy to habituate to the sound. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy : Helps you develop coping strategies to manage the emotional distress associated with tinnitus. Hearing protection: Crucially, protecting your ears from further noise exposure at work. I can provide you with recommendations for appropriate earplugs or earmuffs. Given your occupation, I strongly recommend investing in high-quality hearing protection. We can discuss the best options for you. We can also explore a referral to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation and to discuss TRT or CBT. Would you be interested in learning more about those options?
PATIENT: Okay, that...that sounds better than quitting my job, at least. Hearing protection makes sense. I already tried earplugs once, but they made it hard to hear the customers, so it was even more stressful. Maybe better ones would help? And I guess I could try the sound therapy thing. Do they have apps for that? The therapy…I don’t know. I’m not really one for talking about my feelings. I just want the noise to stop, you know? But if it's the only way…I guess I could look into it. What about the apps? And the earplugs? Let’s start with that, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitancy about therapy, Jaylyne, and we can certainly start with the more practical approaches. Yes, there are several excellent apps available for sound therapy. Some popular options include: ReSound Tinnitus Relief: Offers customizable soundscapes and guided exercises. White Noise Lite: Provides a variety of ambient sounds to mask tinnitus. Tinnitus HQ: Features soundscapes, relaxation techniques, and educational resources. I can send you links to these apps after our consultation. Regarding earplugs, you're right to point out that standard foam earplugs can sometimes make it difficult to hear conversations. However, there are specialized earplugs designed for musicians and individuals working in noisy environments that filter sound more effectively, reducing noise without completely blocking it out. These are often called musician's earplugs or high-fidelity earplugs. I recommend visiting an audiologist to have custom-fitted earplugs made. They can assess your hearing levels and create earplugs that provide optimal protection while maintaining sound clarity. If that’s not feasible right away, I can recommend a few brands of high-fidelity earplugs that are readily available online or at music stores. For now, I’m going to document our discussion and write a referral for you to see an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation and custom-fitted hearing protection. I'll also provide you with links to the tinnitus apps. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been a lot of help. Just...getting me to think about it, you know? I was starting to panic. Hopefully, the earplugs will do the trick. And I'll look at those apps when I get home. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. It’s a good first step to proactively address the tinnitus. I’ll have the referral and app links sent to you electronically. If you don't receive them within a few hours, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Please don't hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if your symptoms worsen or if you have any further questions. Take care, and I hope you find some relief soon.
