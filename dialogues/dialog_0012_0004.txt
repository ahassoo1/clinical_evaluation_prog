DOCTOR: Hi Teah, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Yoshino, good to meet you too. It's nice to be here. Well, it's just a check-up, really. Routine immunizations, you know? My husband always says I put those off too long.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear – preventative care is really important, and your husband sounds like a smart man! Just to get a good overview, have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yeah, I have been, actually. No complaints, knock on wood. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, you know? Nothing that keeps me from work. I'm a building inspector, so I'm pretty active.
DOCTOR: That's great to hear you're staying active! Building inspector, that sounds physically demanding. When you say “usual aches and pains,” could you tell me a little more about where you're feeling those, and how often they bother you?
PATIENT: Well, mostly in my lower back. From bending and crawling around looking at foundations and stuff. It’s not constant, more like at the end of the day, or after a particularly rough site visit. A warm bath usually fixes it, though. And I try to stretch. Not as much as I should, maybe. It’s just…life gets busy, you know?
DOCTOR: I totally understand – life does get busy! Stretching is a good habit to try and stick with, even if it's just for a few minutes each day. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs, or any numbness or tingling in your feet or hands?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No radiating pain, numbness, or tingling. Just the aches, like a dull soreness. Everything feels pretty normal, all things considered. I worry sometimes, because my grandpa, he had a bad back when he was older, but I don't think it's that bad. Yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. It's always good to be mindful of family history, and it’s smart of you to think about that. To get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Nothing major, really. I had chickenpox as a kid, and the usual childhood things, but nothing serious. I broke my arm once, when I was maybe ten. And… oh! I had my gallbladder out about fifteen years ago. Other than that, pretty healthy. I don't really take any medications regularly, just ibuprofen for headaches if I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, no chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Nope, none of that. Never been diagnosed with any of those. Blood pressure is usually pretty good at the dentist, as far as I know. And I try to eat reasonably well, mostly fish and vegetables, being Tlingit and all. My mom always said a good diet is the best medicine.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear. And you're right, a good diet really is important! Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years and never had a reaction. We used to forage a lot when I was a kid, so I probably would've found out if I was allergic to anything! Nothing comes to mind, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. And just to be thorough, could you tell me about your family’s medical history, if you know it?
PATIENT: Well, my mom lived to be 85, and she was pretty healthy right up until the end. She did have arthritis, but that's about it. My dad… he had some heart trouble when he got older, but he smoked for years, so that wasn't a surprise. And like I said, my grandpa had a bad back. My sister has high blood pressure, I think. But that’s about all I know off the top of my head. We weren't a big family for talking about health stuff, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That's pretty common. Okay, and finally, do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I always figured a clear head was more useful for inspecting buildings!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s great. So, to recap, you’re here for a general check-up and immunizations, feeling generally well, with some lower back aches after physical activity. No major medical history, no allergies, no medications, and a family history of arthritis, heart trouble, and high blood pressure. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right! You’ve got a good memory, Dr. Yoshino. It's good to know you were listening. Now, what kind of immunizations did you have in mind? And do I need a shot, or just a little prick? I’m not a fan of needles, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I definitely was listening! And I completely understand the dislike of needles – nobody loves them. We'll try to be as quick as possible. Let's see… based on your age and health history, I recommend a Tdap booster if you haven’t had one in the last ten years, and a flu shot, since it’s almost that time of year. We can also check your COVID-19 vaccine status and see if you’re due for any boosters. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. I think I had a tetanus shot… maybe five or six years ago? But I don't really remember. Flu shot is probably a good idea, too. I’m pretty careful, but you never know. And… COVID booster, yes, that makes sense. Okay, let's get it over with, then. The quicker we get it done, the better! Is it just one shot each, or are we talking multiple pokes?
DOCTOR: We can do them all in one visit, but we don't have to! It depends on your comfort level. We could do one today, and schedule another appointment for the others if you prefer. Generally, it's just one poke per vaccine, but sometimes we can combine them if appropriate. Before we start, I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, that’s good to know. Combining them sounds… less ideal, maybe? One at a time is probably best. And yes, a quick exam is fine. You have to check everything, I suppose. Just… try not to poke too hard, okay? My back is a little sensitive, remember? Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we'll take it slow and be gentle, especially with your back. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your ears, nose, and throat, and do a quick neurological assessment. Finally, I'll palpate your abdomen and check your back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough! You've thought of everything, haven’t you? Alright, let's get it over with. I trust you, Dr. Yoshino. Just… try not to surprise me, okay? I don't like surprises. Where should I put my arms?
DOCTOR: You're in good hands! And I promise no surprises. We’ll explain everything as we go. If you could just put your arms up on the armrests, that’s perfect. I'm going to start with your blood pressure. It's just a cuff around your arm that squeezes for a moment. 130 over 80. That's a little elevated, but not concerning, especially if you were a bit anxious about the visit. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart. Can you take a nice deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath. My dad always said I had a strong heart. It's just… sometimes it races a little when I get stressed. Is that normal? I don't usually worry about it. What are you listening for exactly? You don't have to be too technical, I'm not a doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: Your dad was right to be proud, sounds perfectly normal to me! A little racing with stress is very common. I’m listening for any unusual sounds – murmurs, clicks, or whooshing noises – that might indicate a problem. Your heart sounds strong and regular, though. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Can you take another deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… My grandma used to smoke, but she quit when she was young. She always said it was the worst thing she ever did. It’s good she quit, I suppose. Are my lungs okay? Do I sound… wheezy? I don’t usually have trouble breathing.
DOCTOR: Your grandma was very smart to quit smoking, a very courageous thing to do. Your lungs sound clear and open – no wheezing, crackling, or other unusual sounds. Everything sounds perfectly normal. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Open wide, please.
PATIENT: Okay, open wide. I haven’t had a sore throat in ages. I always try to stay hydrated, you know? My mom used to say honey and lemon were the best medicine. Is everything okay in there? Do I have… tonsillitis or something? I always worry about something, you know. It's a habit.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks perfectly normal – no redness, swelling, or other signs of infection. Your ears look clear too. You’re doing great! Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological assessment – just checking your reflexes and balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Okay, follow your finger. I used to be pretty good at those eye tracking things. My husband says I'm a good observer. Is everything okay? Am I… twitching or something? It's just…I'm not very good with medical stuff, you know. It always makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: Your eyes are following smoothly and there’s no twitching at all! You're doing wonderfully. You’re a very good observer indeed! Now, I'm going to test your reflexes. Just relax your arm. Good reflex! And now the other arm. Good one on this side too. Everything looks normal. Finally, I'm going to just palpate your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath. I ate a little too much last night, maybe? I had some salmon with my husband. It was really good, though. Is everything okay down there? Am I… bloated or something? I always worry about my stomach. It's a habit, you know. I'm a worrier.
DOCTOR: Everything feels normal – no tenderness, no masses, no abnormalities. It’s perfectly fine to enjoy a nice meal, salmon is very good for you! And it's okay to be a worrier, it just means you care. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Overall, everything looks remarkably good! Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not concerning given your anxiety. Heart and lungs sound clear, abdomen is soft, and reflexes are normal. Now, let’s talk about those immunizations. Do you want to go ahead with the Tdap and flu shot today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear! Really good. A little elevated blood pressure… maybe I should’ve had less coffee this morning? And yes, let’s get the shots over with. Tdap and flu, you said? Might as well get them done. Where do I sit? And… do you always give the shots in the arm? I have a slightly sensitive arm on my left side.
DOCTOR: A little less coffee is always a good idea, though! You can sit right here. And yes, the usual place for those shots is in the arm, but we can definitely do the left arm if it’s more comfortable for you. I'm going to clean the site with an alcohol swab, and then give the injection. It will sting for a moment, but it will be over quickly. Here we go. One quick pinch. And now for the flu shot.
PATIENT: Ouch! Not too bad, I suppose. It’s over quickly, like you said. Okay, let's get it over with. Flu shot next, you said? Please be quick! And... can I have a little sticker afterward? Just kidding… mostly.
DOCTOR: Almost done! And… that's it! All finished. See?
PATIENT: Okay, done! It's really over. That wasn't so bad, actually. Thank you, Dr. Yoshino. You were very gentle. And… you know, a sticker would be nice. Just kidding… maybe. What do I need to do now? Any side effects I should watch out for? And when should I come back for my next check-up?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah! And I’m glad it wasn’t too bad. You might have some soreness at the injection sites for a day or two – that’s normal. You could take some over-the-counter pain relievers if you need to. Otherwise, just keep an eye out for any unusual reactions like a high fever or severe allergic reaction – those are very rare, but it’s good to be aware. As for your next check-up, let’s schedule one for about six months from now. We can check your blood pressure again and see how you’re doing. And… I think I do have some stickers somewhere… Here you go! A little something for being so brave.
PATIENT: Oh, how lovely! Thank you, Dr. Yoshino. You really are the best. Six months from now sounds good. I’ll mark it on my calendar. Well, I think that’s everything. I appreciate you taking such good care of me. And… thank you again for the sticker! It’s very cute. I guess I’ll see you in six months then. Have a good day, Dr. Yoshino!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. It was a pleasure meeting you! Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you in six months. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a wonderful day!
