DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I’m Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Albino. Well, my back... it hurts. Lower part, mostly. Been hurting for a little while now, but it's getting worse. Feels like…old, you know? Like something is just tired in there.
DOCTOR: Alright, Albino. "Tired," I understand. And how long has it been hurting, specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…oh, maybe six months ago? Little aches here and there. But the real trouble started about a month ago. I bent over to pick up a box of dates – my daughter sent them from Lebanon – and oof. Sharp pain. Not all the time, but often enough to bother me. It makes sleeping hard too.
DOCTOR: Six months with increasing pain, a specific incident a month ago…dates, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, dates! From my daughter, Layla. She thinks I don’t eat enough fruit. Good girl, that Layla. But those dates…they were heavy. And now, this back. It’s not like a sudden thing, more of a…slow burn, you know? It’s always there, a little ache, then sometimes it really flares up. I mostly just try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Right, a gradual onset…careful movements. Do you have any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, no pain in my legs. Just the back. Sometimes it feels stiff, especially in the mornings. Makes getting out of bed a little…difficult. I just take my time. And lots of small sips of coffee! Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the mornings, no leg pain. Any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet at all?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. And my legs feel strong enough. I still walk to the market most days, you know? Just not as fast as I used to. It's more like… a general discomfort, all around my lower back. It doesn't shoot or anything. It just…is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no shooting pain, general discomfort. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Well… lying down helps. And when my daughter, Layla, rubs it… that helps a lot. She's got strong hands, that girl. Otherwise, not much. Warm baths, maybe? But it doesn't last long. And heat makes me a little…sweaty.
DOCTOR: Laying down and daughter’s massage helps. Alright. And have you had any problems with your bladder or bowels recently?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, no, Doctor. Everything’s… regular. No trouble there, thankfully. No changes. That's a good thing, right? I always try to drink plenty of water.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. And, just to be thorough, any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No fever. No chills. And my weight? I probably have lost a little weight, but that's probably because I'm not eating as much. When my back hurts, I don’t have much appetite. It’s not like a big change though, Doctor. Just…less.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm, no history of cancer?
PATIENT: No, no cancer. Never. My mother…she had some trouble with her heart, but nothing else in the family. We’re mostly a healthy bunch, thankfully. I try to stay positive, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you lie down on your stomach on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just let me know if I need help getting up, Doctor. This back…it's a little tricky sometimes. Is this okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good, Mr. Vankampen. Just relax as much as possible. I'm going to gently press on your back to see where it's tender. I'll also check your range of motion. Okay… Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right… there. About two inches to the left of my spine. That's where it hurts the most. Not a sharp pain, more of a…deep ache. Like a bruise, almost. Is that what you were looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness about two inches to the left of the spine. And how about when I ask you to bend forward, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oof… I can't go much further, Doctor. It really hurts when I bend. It feels…tight. Like something is blocking me. And it hurts right in the middle of my back when I try. That wasn't very good, was it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you lie on your back and I lift your leg straight up, does that cause any pain radiating down your leg?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. No, no pain in the leg. Just a little pull in my back. Nothing too bad. It’s more uncomfortable than painful, really. Is that what you wanted to check, Doctor? I get a little nervous when someone touches my back, if you don't mind me saying. It's just... sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. Okay. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain or sprain in your lower back. It's common, especially with your age and activity level. We can start with some conservative treatment. I’ll recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. Heat or ice packs can also help. And gentle stretching, as tolerated.
PATIENT: Okay… ibuprofen, you say? That sounds… sensible. And heat or ice, whatever feels better. Stretching… I'll try. I’m not very good at stretching, to be honest. I mostly just try to avoid moving too much when it hurts. Will this help, Doctor? I just want to be able to walk to the market again without feeling like I’m eighty years old.
DOCTOR: It should help, Mr. Vankampen. If it doesn’t improve within a few weeks, or if the pain gets worse, we may need to consider an X-ray to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to give you a handout with some stretching exercises. Do those gently, and stop if you feel any sharp pain. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, a handout, that's good! Helps me remember. X-ray… I don’t want an X-ray if I can avoid it, but I understand. Stretching… I'll try my best. Um… will the pain ever just… go away completely, Doctor? And is there anything else I can do? Like, is there a good way to sit or stand? I try to be careful, but I don’t want to make it worse. Layla worries about me, you know.
DOCTOR: Most muscle strains do improve with time and conservative treatment, Mr. Vankampen. It may not disappear completely, but we can aim to reduce the pain and improve your function. As for sitting and standing, try to maintain good posture, and avoid bending over repeatedly. Short, frequent walks are better than long periods of sitting. Do you have any other questions, or are we all set for today?
PATIENT: Good posture… I’ll try to remember that. Layla always tells me to stand up straight too. No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for your time. And thank you for not suggesting an X-ray right away. I appreciate that. I’ll try the ibuprofen and stretching, and I’ll let you know if it doesn’t get better. One last thing… should I be worried about this being something serious? Like, something really bad? I just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be anything serious, Mr. Vankampen, given your description and the exam findings. However, if you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, or if you have any trouble controlling your bladder or bowels, please come back immediately. Those would be signs of a more serious problem. Otherwise, try to stay positive and follow the recommendations. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Okay… numbness or weakness. I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. Have a good day to you too.
