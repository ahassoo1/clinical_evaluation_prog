DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 40 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Yeah, morning. Look, I don’t really have time for all this, to be honest. It's… my stomach, I guess. Been feeling kinda puffed up. Like I swallowed a balloon. It’s annoying, that’s all. Is that enough information? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: “Annoying,” alright. While I appreciate you being direct, Mr. Kristofik, “puffed up” can mean many things. To help me understand what’s going on, and to ensure nothing serious is happening, I’m going to need a little more detail. When did this start?
PATIENT: Ugh, when did it start? Honestly? I don't know. A while ago, probably. Look, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about my stomach, okay? Maybe a few weeks? A month? It comes and goes. It's not like it's constant. Why does it matter exactly when? It just… happens. And it's uncomfortable. That’s all I know.
DOCTOR: It matters because timing can give us clues, Mr. Kristofik. Is it related to what you eat?
PATIENT: Food? I eat… food. What kind of question is that? Look, I work construction. I eat what keeps me going, okay? Burgers, sandwiches, sometimes something my wife used to make… never mind. Doesn’t really seem to matter what I eat. It just… happens randomly. I really don't pay attention to these things. Can we just get this over with? I'm sure it's nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does anything relieve it, Mr. Kristofik?
PATIENT: Relieve it? Not really. Sometimes… laying down helps a little, I guess. But mostly it just… goes away on its own. I don't do anything special. I'm not one for fussing over things. Honestly, I just try to ignore it. It's a stomach. People get bloated stomachs. Is this really a doctor's visit? Feels like a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, while it may seem simple, abdominal distension can be caused by a number of things, some of which require medical attention. To rule those out, I need a more complete picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Look, I told you, I don't look for symptoms. I’m a pile driver operator, not a hypochondriac. I work hard, I eat, I sleep… sometimes my stomach puffs up. I haven't noticed anything else… specifically. Maybe a little tired, but that's the job, right? Is this going somewhere? Because I have a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s try this. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Seriously? Now you're asking about… that? Look, I don't discuss… personal things with strangers. This is ridiculous. I came in because my stomach feels big, not for a full interrogation. Is this how you treat all your patients? I think I’m done. Just… give me something for the gas, or whatever, and let me go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your discomfort, but I need to ask these questions to properly assess your condition. Dismissing potential issues without a thorough evaluation is not responsible medical care. However, I recognize you are clearly reluctant to provide further information. Before we proceed, I must strongly advise that without a more complete history and a physical examination, I cannot provide you with any meaningful treatment. I am happy to proceed with an exam, or we can discuss a referral to another physician if you prefer. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Look, this is pointless. I’m not getting poked and prodded, and I’m definitely not telling you about… any of that. You want details? I don’t have details! I’m a working man, not a medical textbook. Just… forget it. I’ll deal with it myself. This has been a complete waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kristofik. I strongly advise you to reconsider. However, I respect your decision. I will document your refusal of a full evaluation. Please be aware that if your symptoms worsen, you should seek immediate medical attention. Here is my card, should you change your mind. .
