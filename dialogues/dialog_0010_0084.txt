DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been getting harder to breathe, I suppose. Not suddenly, you understand. Just… slower, over time. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It's quite bothersome, actually. I don’t… I don’t really know why it’s happening.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Getting harder to breathe… slower over time” and “dry mouth and eyes.” That’s a good starting point. When you say “harder to breathe,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question. It’s not like a sharp pain, or a cough. It’s more like… I have to work a little more to get enough air. Like… when I walk up a small hill, I find myself noticing my breathing more than I used to. It doesn't happen all the time, just with… effort, I think. And sometimes, even when I'm resting, I feel… a little winded. I apologize, I'm not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Kobler. You’re doing just fine. "Working harder to get enough air" and noticing it even at rest… and it's been gradual. And you mentioned dry mouth and eyes. Are those symptoms constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They… mostly constant, I believe. Though, some days are worse than others. Like today, it feels particularly… scratchy. And my eyes feel gritty, even with drops. I don’t… I don’t remember when they started, exactly. It just feels like they’ve always been a little dry, lately. Does that make sense? I'm sorry if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound like rambling at all. “Mostly constant, worse on some days,” gritty eyes despite drops… Okay. To get a better picture, let’s go through some other things. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I recall. I haven’t been feeling unwell in that way, thankfully. No chills, no fever… and certainly no night sweats. I sleep quite soundly, actually. Though… sometimes I wake up feeling a little more tired than I should, perhaps. But I attributed that to… well, just getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, chills, or night sweats. Waking up tired, but attributing that to age. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. I haven’t specifically looked for swelling, if that makes sense. I… I don’t believe so, no. I wear fairly comfortable shoes, and I haven't noticed any difficulty getting them on or off. I suppose I should pay more attention. Is that a symptom of… whatever this is? I apologize for my ignorance.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Ms. Kobler. It's good to be aware of your body, and you're right to ask. No noticeable swelling. Now, are you experiencing any chest pain, or palpitations—that is, a feeling like your heart is racing or fluttering?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No chest pain at all. And my heart feels… normal, I think. It doesn’t race or flutter. It beats at a regular pace, as far as I can tell. I’ve always had a… steady heart, if that helps. I do get a little anxious sometimes, but that doesn't cause any… physical sensations like that. Just… worry, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. No chest pain, no palpitations. Steady heart. Do you have any cough, or shortness of breath when you lie down flat?
PATIENT: I… I do have a little cough, sometimes. It's not a bad cough, more of a… tickle in my throat. And yes, now that you mention it, lying flat is a bit more difficult. I usually sleep with a couple of pillows, which helps. Without them, I do feel a little… breathless. I hadn't really connected the two, to be honest. It's just easier to sleep propped up.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little cough, worse when lying flat, relieved with pillows. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions like asthma, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a… difficult question. I don't believe so. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was quite young, but I recovered fully. And… I had a surgery on my shoulder a few years ago, but that's it. No asthma, no heart disease, no diabetes… I don't think. My memory isn't what it used to be, I'm afraid. I apologize if I'm forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize. We can always look things up. Let’s check your EHR. Okay, I see here you did have pneumonia at age 7, as you mentioned. Shoulder surgery in 2021 for a rotator cuff tear – that explains that. Otherwise, your record is remarkably clean. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: That is… reassuring. Remarkably clean, you say? That is nice to hear. As for allergies… I don’t believe so. I can eat most things without issue, and I haven't had any bad reactions to medications that I recall. I have a slight sensitivity to strong perfumes, sometimes, but that’s more of an irritation than an allergy, I think. Nothing life-threatening, thankfully. I suppose I should make a list, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies, slight sensitivity to perfumes. And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Let me see… Currently, I take a low-dose aspirin, as recommended by my previous doctor, for… preventative reasons, I believe. And I use over-the-counter eye drops for the dryness, several times a day. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. I don't really like taking pills unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, low-dose aspirin and over-the-counter eye drops. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives—parents, siblings, grandparents—have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, lung disease, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: That is… a good question. My mother passed away several years ago from… complications of old age, I believe. She was always fairly healthy, though. My father, he… he had some heart trouble later in life, I think. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had some sort of… lung condition. She used to cough a lot. I'm afraid my family isn't very forthcoming about medical history, so I don't have many details. I apologize for being so vague. It's difficult to recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother passed due to age-related complications, father had heart trouble, grandmother had a lung condition. That's helpful to know. And finally, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. Never had any desire to, to be honest. My mother always discouraged it, and it never appealed to me. I do… enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's it. I'm not a heavy drinker, I assure you. Mostly, I enjoy reading and spending time outdoors. I live a fairly quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay. Never smoked, occasional glass of wine, enjoys reading and spending time outdoors. Alright, Ms. Kobler, that gives me a good starting point. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and oxygen levels, and take a look at your throat and eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and I hope you can determine what's causing this… discomfort. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your lungs now… and your heart sounds regular. I do notice your breath sounds are a little quieter than I'd expect, particularly lower down. Your throat looks a little dry, but nothing significant. And your eyes are definitely dry. I also notice some mild conjunctival injection, meaning some redness in the whites of your eyes. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is good.
PATIENT: That doesn't sound… entirely good, does it? “Quieter breath sounds” and “mild injection…” Is that… serious? I apologize for being anxious, I just… I dislike not knowing what's happening. I understand you need to consider everything, but any preliminary thoughts would be greatly appreciated, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be anxious, Ms. Kobler, and you have every right to ask. “Quieter breath sounds” and “mild injection” aren't necessarily serious on their own, but they do point us in a direction. Based on everything you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, it sounds like we're dealing with a combination of things. The dry mouth and eyes, combined with the diminished breath sounds, raises the possibility of Sjögren's syndrome. It's an autoimmune disorder that often causes dryness of the eyes and mouth and can affect other organs like the lungs. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions. Other things could be causing these symptoms, such as medication side effects or even just age-related changes. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These tests will check for certain antibodies that are commonly found in people with Sjögren's syndrome, as well as rule out other potential causes. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Sjögren’s… syndrome? That sounds… concerning. An autoimmune disorder… I don’t believe I’ve ever heard of it. I suppose if it will help determine the cause… yes, Doctor, I’m willing to have the blood tests. If you believe it's necessary, then please proceed. I trust your judgment. Could you… could you explain a little more about it? What would be involved, and what kind of results would we be looking for? And… what if it is that? What are the treatment options? I apologize for all the questions, I'm just… trying to understand.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly okay to ask questions, Ms. Kobler, that's what I'm here for. Sjögren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder where your immune system mistakenly attacks your moisture-producing glands, primarily your salivary and tear glands. That's why you're experiencing dryness of the mouth and eyes. It can also affect other organs, like the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system, though the severity varies greatly from person to person. The blood tests I'm ordering will look for specific antibodies, like anti-SSA and anti-SSB, and measure your inflammatory markers. They will also help rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. If the tests come back positive, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have Sjögren’s, but it would warrant further investigation. We might need to perform a Schirmer’s test to measure tear production and a salivary gland biopsy to examine the glands themselves. As for treatment, there's no cure for Sjögren’s syndrome, but the symptoms can be effectively managed. We can use artificial tears and saliva to relieve the dryness, and medications can help suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. Depending on the organs affected, other treatments may be necessary. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that makes… a little more sense, thank you, Doctor. It sounds… complicated, and a little frightening, to be honest. The idea of my immune system attacking my own body… “Artificial tears and saliva” and “medications to suppress the immune system…” I understand those are options, but… what are the side effects of those medications? And how long would I need to take them? I’m… I’m a little worried about the long-term implications. I suppose I should have asked about this sooner, but is this something that would shorten my lifespan? I apologize for being so… morbid, I just… I need to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You are not being morbid at all, Ms. Kobler. Those are very valid and important questions, and I'm glad you're asking them. It's crucial to be fully informed. The medications used to suppress the immune system—like methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine—can have side effects, though they vary depending on the specific medication and the dosage. Common side effects include nausea, fatigue, and increased susceptibility to infections. We would monitor your blood counts and liver function regularly to ensure the medications aren’t causing any harm. As for the duration of treatment, it depends on the severity of your symptoms and how well you respond to the medications. Some people need to take them long-term, while others can taper off after a period of remission. Regarding your lifespan, Sjögren’s syndrome itself doesn’t usually shorten lifespan. However, severe complications, such as lung disease or kidney problems, can impact your overall health. With proper management and regular monitoring, most people with Sjögren’s syndrome live normal, active lives. I want to emphasize that we don’t know yet if you have Sjögren’s syndrome. The blood tests will give us more information, and we'll discuss the results thoroughly and develop a personalized treatment plan if necessary. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers most of my immediate concerns, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient and thorough. It’s… reassuring to know that it doesn’t necessarily shorten lifespan, and that it can be managed. Just one final question, if you don’t mind. When can I expect the results of the blood tests? And will you contact me directly, or should I schedule another appointment? I apologize for all the trouble. I really appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kobler. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. The blood tests usually take 3-5 business days to come back. I will contact you directly, either by phone or through the patient portal, to discuss the results as soon as they are available. We’ll then schedule a follow-up appointment to review them in detail and develop a plan. And you’re not causing any trouble at all. It’s my job to answer your questions and provide you with the best possible care. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that will be all for today. Thank you again for your time and patience. I feel much better informed, and less anxious. I’ll await your call. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kobler. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before I call. .
