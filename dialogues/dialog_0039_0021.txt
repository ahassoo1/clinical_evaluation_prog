DOCTOR: Hello Ricky, welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Kamahele, nice to meet you too. Well, my foot's been awful swollen, especially my ankle. It started a few days ago, I think… maybe last Tuesday? It’s just gotten bigger and more painful each day. It hurts to walk on it, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, a swollen and painful ankle… starting maybe last Tuesday. That gives us a little something to work with. Can you tell me a bit more about how it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t really remember doing anything to it. I was just… walking around, you know? I work at the loan place downtown, and I’m on my feet a lot. I didn’t trip or anything, didn’t bump into anything. It just…started feeling tight, and then it started swelling. I didn’t think much of it at first, figured I just walked too much. But then it got worse, like I said. I’ve been trying to stay off it, but it’s hard when I gotta work.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it came on gradually while you were at work, just with normal activity. No specific injury that you recall. And it's been getting progressively worse despite trying to rest it. Okay. Have you noticed any bruising at all, or is it just swelling?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yeah, there’s a little bit of bruising, now that you mention it. Not a lot, but kinda purple-ish around the inside of my ankle bone. It wasn't there at first, just the swelling and the pain. It showed up yesterday, I think. It’s not too bad though, not black and blue or anything. Just… discoloration.
DOCTOR: Okay, some purple discoloration developing yesterday. That's helpful to know. And what about pain?
PATIENT: The pain… it’s kinda a dull ache most of the time. But if I try to put weight on it, or move my foot a certain way, it gets sharp. Like a stabbing feeling, right on the inside of my ankle. It’s worse in the mornings, I think, when I first get up. And it throbs a little, even when I’m just sitting. It’s a real bother, honestly. Makes it hard to concentrate at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with sharp pain on movement, worse in the mornings, and some throbbing. I'm going to take a quick look at your ankle, if that’s alright with you. Just want to see the swelling and range of motion. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. I don't have insurance, you see, so… it’s a little worrying. But thank you for looking at it, Dr. Kamahele.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ricky. I’m feeling around your ankle now. It is quite swollen, and tender to the touch here, along the medial malleolus – that’s the bump on the inside of your ankle. And when I move your foot up and down, and side to side… …there’s some limitation and discomfort, as you probably noticed. I also feel some warmth around the joint. Does this feel particularly painful when I do this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that's… that's the spot. When you bend it like that, yeah, it feels kinda sharp. Not unbearable, but definitely uncomfortable. And yeah, it does feel warm. I hadn't really noticed that before, to be honest. It's just been sore, you know? I'm a little worried now, if you don't mind me saying. Is it… broken? Or something? I gotta work, Dr. Kamahele. I can't afford to be off my feet for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ricky, I understand your concern, especially with needing to work. Based on what you've told me and my initial examination, it could be a sprain, or possibly a minor fracture. The warmth and tenderness are concerning enough that I want to get an X-ray to rule out a fracture. Would you be able to go to the imaging center across the street?
PATIENT: An X-ray… I guess so. But how much is that gonna cost? I really don't have a lot of money, Dr. Kamahele. I didn’t even ask how much the visit was gonna be, I was so worried about my foot. I’m afraid of getting a big bill I can’t pay. Do they take… cash? I don't have a credit card. I can pay you something now, if that helps. Just tell me how much it's gonna be.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ricky, and I completely understand. Let me see what I can do. The imaging center does offer a cash discount, and I can also see if they have a payment plan option for you. I’ll call them now while you’re here to get an exact cost and discuss those options. In the meantime, let’s just try to keep weight off of it as much as possible. We can use this cane to help you get around. Just one moment while I call…
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Dr. Kamahele. That would be a big help. I really appreciate you looking into that for me. And yeah, a cane sounds good. It’s just…it’s a little embarrassing, you know? But I gotta get to work. Thank you again. I hope it’s not too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ricky. Good news and… slightly less good news. The imaging center will take cash, and they do have a discount for cash payments. The cost will be $150 with the discount. They also offer a payment plan, where you can pay it off in installments. As for the less good news, they are quite busy today. The earliest they can fit you in is in about an hour and a half. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: An hour and a half… Well, I guess so. I can probably get someone to cover my shift for a little bit. It's not ideal, but $150… I can probably manage that with a payment plan. Is there anything else I need to do before I go over there? Do I need a form or something? And…will they be able to tell me right away if it’s broken? I just… I really need to know. And I really hope it’s not too bad. I've got bills to pay, Dr. Kamahele.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ricky. I understand. I've just sent a requisition form to the imaging center electronically, so they'll have it when you arrive. You don't need to bring anything with you. As for whether it's broken, the radiologist will read the X-ray and send the report back to me. I'll review it and call you as soon as I have the results, which should be within a few hours. They can often give a preliminary read right away, but I always want to be the one to explain the findings to you. In the meantime, try to keep weight off of it, elevate it when you can, and you can use an ice pack for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day to help with the swelling and pain. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, elevate it, ice pack… got it. No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Kamahele. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything and looking into the cost. I’m still worried, but I feel a little better knowing what’s going on. I’ll go over to the imaging center now. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ricky. You're very welcome. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before I call you with the results. And take it easy on that foot! We'll get this figured out.
