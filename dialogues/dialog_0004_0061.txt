DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my son, he signed me up. Something about a… tryout? For… sports. Old man things, I guess. I don't quite remember all the details, to be honest. My knees ain’t what they used to be, though!
DOCTOR: A “tryout,” you say. Well, that’s… certainly one reason to come in. Though I suspect there's more to it than just knees for sports, given your age. Let’s start with the knees, then. Can you describe the issues you’re having with them?
PATIENT: Oh, you are right to ask! My son, he’s always getting me into things. It's… a team, I think. Baseball? Maybe? I forget. The knees… they just ache, you know? Especially when I try to… walk up stairs. And bending down… forget about it! Feels like… little rocks grinding around in there. It's not always bad, but… yeah. It’s a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, “grinding” is a good way to put it. And it’s worse with stairs and bending. Is it a sharp pain, or more of a dull ache?
PATIENT: Hmm… mostly a dull ache, I think. Sometimes, if I really try to get up fast… a little sharp pain. But that doesn’t happen much. Mostly just… a heaviness, you know? Like somethin' is stuck. And clicks. They click a lot! Is that… bad? I don’t know much about these things.
DOCTOR: Clicks can be normal, but combined with the aching and heaviness… it's something we need to investigate further. Do you recall any specific injury that brought this on, even a long time ago?
PATIENT: Injury… oh, boy. Let me think… I played a lot of… softball, when I was young. A long time ago! I remember… sliding into second base. Probably banged my knee a few times. Nothing major, I don’t think. I kept playing! I don’t know if that caused it… it was so long ago, Doctor. I’ve fallen a couple times lately, just… tripping over things. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. A history of softball and some recent falls… that gives us a little more to work with. Let’s do a quick physical exam of your knees. Can you come over here and sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. These old bones don't move like they used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. I’m going to gently bend and rotate your knees. Please let me know immediately if you feel any pain. And I’m going to palpate around the joint—that just means I’m going to press on it to feel for tenderness. First, let’s start with your right knee. Can you extend your leg straight out for me?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Straight out… like this? There we go. Careful now, it might creak a bit!
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m feeling some crepitus—that’s the crackling sound—and mild tenderness along the medial joint line. No significant swelling at this point. Now, can you bend your knee as far as you can, keeping your heel on the table?
PATIENT: Okay, bending… There… that’s about as far as it goes without it really bothering me. It feels… tight. Like somethin’s blockin’ it. Is that normal? Everything feels normal?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Your left knee feels… similar. Some crepitus, mild tenderness on the medial joint line, and limited range of motion, although it seems slightly more restricted than your right. There's no obvious instability, and I don’t feel any significant swelling in either joint. Based on this exam, it appears you likely have osteoarthritis in both knees. It's a common condition, especially with age and previous activity. It’s a gradual wearing down of the cartilage in the joints. This explains the aching, clicking, and limited range of motion.
PATIENT: Osteo… what-itis? That sounds… serious. Is that why they ache so much? And why I can’t bend them like I used to? My son… he’s always worryin’ about me. He wants me to be able to… well, play baseball with him! Is there… anything you can do about it? I don’t wanna be a burden.
DOCTOR: “Osteoarthritis” simply means joint inflammation due to wear and tear. It’s not necessarily serious, but it can certainly be bothersome. It explains your symptoms, yes. As for treatment… well, there are options, but it's not a cure. We can manage the pain with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve your range of motion. Weight management, if applicable, can also reduce stress on the joints. As for playing baseball… realistically, that may not be feasible. But we can work on improving your function so you can remain as active as possible. We could also discuss a cortisone injection, which can provide temporary relief from the pain and inflammation, but that's not a long-term solution. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. My wife, bless her soul, always took care of all that. I just took whatever she gave me! She passed a few years back… so I haven’t had to worry about that stuff lately. I just take a little bit of… something for my blood pressure, I think. A white pill. That's all I remember. Baseball… well, I guess I can settle for watchin’ my son play.
DOCTOR: Alright. A white pill for blood pressure… we’ll need to get the exact name of that medication. It's important to know what you’re taking. Given your osteoarthritis and blood pressure, I recommend a referral to a physical therapist for an evaluation and treatment plan. And I’m going to order some blood work to check your overall health. I'll also need you to schedule a follow-up appointment in six weeks to assess your progress and discuss further management options. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Six weeks… alright. Physical therapy… that sounds good. I always liked stretchin' when I was younger. And the blood work… okay. Just… will the blood work take long? I got a few things I need to do this week. My grandson, he’s comin’ to visit. I don’t want to miss that.
DOCTOR: The blood work shouldn't take long, Mr. Murph. We can get it done here in the clinic. It will likely take about fifteen to twenty minutes. My assistant will schedule that for you before you leave. Here’s a referral for physical therapy and a list of local providers. I’ll also have the lab order printed out for you. If you experience any worsening pain or swelling in your knees before your follow-up appointment, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other concerns before you go?
