DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse took my blood pressure yesterday and it was kinda high, she said. That’s why I’m here, to check it out. It’s just... I don't really feel sick or anything, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. High blood pressure sometimes doesn’t have obvious symptoms, that’s very common. So, yesterday the nurse noted it was elevated… do you recall roughly what the reading was, if she told you?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. She said something like... 140 over 90, maybe? Or was it 150 over something? Honestly, numbers aren’t my strong suit. I just remember her looking a little concerned, and saying I should come see you. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Those numbers… alright. And have you ever been told you had high blood pressure before, or is this a first?
PATIENT: No, never. This is completely new to me. My mother has it, but she’s… well, she’s much older than me, and has had it for years. I always figured I was too young to worry about stuff like that. I'm usually pretty healthy, eat okay, try to walk when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history is good to know. And you mentioned eating okay… could you tell me a bit more about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Sure. I don't really cook fancy, if that's what you mean. I eat a lot of fish, usually with rice and some kind of steamed vegetables. I like a good salad too. I do have a sweet tooth though, I confess. Love a piece of cake with my tea in the afternoon. And I probably have too much salt, I do like to season my food well. Does that sound alright?
DOCTOR: That sounds reasonably healthy, all things considered! The cake and salt are things we might look at a bit closer. Now, let’s talk about other habits. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No smoking, never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month, if that. I mostly drink water, to be honest. It's Barbados, it's hot! You gotta stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Hydration is important. Alright, Mykeisha. Before we do a quick check-up, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just the usual over-the-counter stuff if I have a headache, like paracetamol. No prescriptions, no vitamins, nothing like that. I try to get everything I need from my food, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies to any medications that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. Never had any trouble with anything like that. My mother always said I had a strong constitution, whatever that means!
DOCTOR: Well, that's good to hear. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again, just to confirm what the nurse saw. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine with me, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if anything feels… weird or anything. I'm not really a fan of doctors, to be honest, but I know it’s important.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable. I'll explain everything as I go. Okay, if you could just sit back and relax... First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let's check your pulse… Pulse is 78 and regular. And now, let's take your blood pressure again. Okay… 148 over 92. A little elevated, consistent with yesterday’s reading. I’m also going to quickly look in your ears and throat… Ears are clear, throat is normal.
PATIENT: Okay, that didn't hurt. So... is it bad? Is it really high or something? I feel perfectly fine, honestly. I just hope it’s not something serious. I got a lot going on right now, you know? I'm trying to help my sister with her kids, and… well, I just don’t have time to be sick.
DOCTOR: It’s not immediately alarming, Mykeisha, but it is something we need to take seriously. 148 over 92 is considered Stage 1 hypertension. And, as I said, it's consistent with yesterday's reading. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re unwell right now, but consistently high blood pressure over time can lead to more serious problems like heart disease, stroke, or kidney issues. That’s why it’s important to get it under control. Now, given your age and that this is a new finding, I’d like to run some additional tests, just to get a better understanding of what's going on and rule out any underlying causes. We'll need some bloodwork and a urine sample. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay... bloodwork and a urine sample. That sounds… a bit much, to be honest. But if you think it’s necessary… alright. What exactly are you looking for in the bloodwork? Is it something to worry about? And will it take long? I really don't have a lot of free time, like I said.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. We'll be looking for things like kidney function, electrolytes, cholesterol levels, and checking your blood sugar. It helps us understand if there’s a specific reason for the high blood pressure – things like kidney problems, thyroid issues, or diabetes can sometimes cause it. It's a pretty standard panel, shouldn't take too long – about 15-20 minutes for the blood draw, and a quick urine sample. The results will take a couple of days, usually 2-3 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're back. In the meantime, we can also discuss some lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure – things like diet, exercise, and stress management. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Okay, 2-3 days isn’t too bad. And lifestyle changes… I guess I can try that. Less salt, more walking… I can definitely try. So, we do the bloodwork and urine sample now? Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Like, should I fast or anything? And where do I… you know… do the urine sample?
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s get those tests ordered. You will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw – that means no food or drinks except water. And for the urine sample, you’ll get a little cup in the bathroom just down the hall. It’s a clean catch sample, so you’ll need to wipe the area clean first and collect a mid-stream sample. The nurse will give you instructions when she calls you in. I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood and collect the urine sample, then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound alright, Mykeisha?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Fast for 8 hours, clean catch… I think I can manage that. Just let me know if there’s anything else. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything really well, and I feel a little bit less worried now. I guess I’ll go wait for the nurse then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. That’s what I’m here for. Don't hesitate to ask if anything comes to mind. I'll have the nurse come get you shortly. Take care.
