DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't really do small talk. Just...bloating, okay? It's been happening. Feels like I'm gonna pop. That's it. Can we just…get on with it? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kristofik. No problem at all. We can definitely get straight to it. Bloating, you said. And it feels quite significant?
PATIENT: Significant? Yeah, you could say that. Like I swallowed a beach ball. It's uncomfortable, alright? And it comes and goes. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to when exactly. Just happens. I eat…stuff. Normal stuff. I don’t sit around cataloging my digestion, if that’s what you’re asking. Is this gonna take long? I really don’t have the patience for a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. "Normal stuff" is a good starting point. Could you give me a general idea of what a typical day of eating looks like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Look, I work. Pile driving. It's hard work. So I eat to fuel it. Breakfast? Coffee, usually. Maybe a pastry if I'm feeling generous to myself. Lunch is whatever my wife – was – made before…never mind. Usually a sandwich, chips. Dinner…same kinda thing. Meat, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes. It's not fancy, okay? I don't sit around making kale smoothies. It’s food. Does it matter what kind of meat? I eat meat. Look, I told you, I don't remember specifics. I just need to not feel like I'm gonna explode, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. No need to apologize for not being a dietitian. Just getting a general sense is helpful. And I appreciate you sharing about your work – that does give me a better picture. You mentioned this has been happening for a while. Has anything changed recently that you've noticed alongside the bloating?
PATIENT: Changed? No. Not really. Work's been the same. Weather's been hot, that's about it. Look, I really don't think it's anything serious. Probably just…old age catching up, or something. It's not like I'm sick sick. Just uncomfortable. And frankly, I’m tired of feeling this way, that’s all. Can we just skip to whatever test you’re gonna do, or a pill or something? I don't have time for a guessing game.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Mr. Kristofik. While I understand your desire to get straight to a solution, it's important to rule out any potential underlying causes for your discomfort before we proceed with testing or medication. It’s not about a "guessing game" but responsible medical practice. To help me do that, could you describe the bloating a bit more?
PATIENT: Look, I already told you, it feels like a beach ball. What more do you want? It's in my stomach. It's…full. And hard. And uncomfortable. It comes and goes, like I said. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes not. I don't pay attention! Is this really necessary? I feel perfectly fine otherwise. I'm a working man. I don’t have time to be poking and prodding at my insides for…for what? A little gas? Honestly, I think you're overthinking this. Just give me something for the bloating and let me go. It’s a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, and I respect your time. However, "just bloating" can sometimes be a symptom of other things, and it’s my job to make sure we aren't missing anything. To help me narrow things down, let's go through a quick review of some other symptoms. This won’t take long. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Seriously? Now you want to talk about…that? Look, I'm not comfortable discussing this with you. It's…personal. And frankly, it's irrelevant. I eat, I…go to the bathroom. That's it. What does it matter how? It’s not like I'm…constipated or anything. Just normal stuff. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. This is ridiculous. I'm a grown man, not a…a baby. Just skip it. Seriously. Just give me something for the bloating and let me leave. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I apologize if my questions are making you uncomfortable. That is absolutely not my intention. I completely understand your reluctance to discuss personal details, and I respect your boundaries. However, to provide you with the best possible care, I need some information. If you're unwilling to discuss bowel habits, that's your right. But it does limit my ability to determine the cause of your bloating. Let me ask this: Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
