DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Dhanoa. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, um, thanks. It’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been… annoying me for a bit now.
DOCTOR: “Annoying” is… vague. How long is “a bit”?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry. Vague, yeah. Probably… about three weeks now? It comes and goes, but when it's there, it's pretty constant. Like a high-pitched whine, sometimes. Other times it's more like… a buzzing.
DOCTOR: Three weeks. And is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly my right ear. Sometimes I think I hear it in my left, but it’s not as bad. It's hard to explain, it's not always there, you know? Like, if I’m really focused on something, I might not notice it for a while.
DOCTOR: Focused on something… like what?
PATIENT: Uh… work, mostly. I'm a waiter, so there's always something to do. Lots of noise, too – people talking, music, dishes clattering… It’s a busy place. Does that… make a difference? I don’t know much about this ear stuff.
DOCTOR: It could. Noise exposure is… a common culprit. Have you noticed it getting worse, or has it stayed about the same for the past three weeks?
PATIENT: I think it's maybe… a little worse. Like, I have to really concentrate to hear people sometimes. And it keeps me up at night, which is not good when you have to wake up early for work. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any ear infections recently?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. I haven’t been to the doctor in ages, to be honest. Divorced life, you know? Things get… busy. Not a lot of time for myself. But no ear infections, no. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a look. I’ll need to do a quick exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Please sit still.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you need. Just… quick would be good, if possible. I have a shift later.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tympanic membrane looks normal in both ears. No signs of infection or fluid. Weber is midline, and Rinne is positive bilaterally. Hearing seems… within normal limits, based on a quick screening. Though, that doesn't rule anything out. It could be tinnitus. It's… common. Often related to stress or noise exposure.
PATIENT: Tinnitus? Is that… serious? Like, am I going to go deaf? Sorry, I just… it’s worrying, you know? I need to be able to hear at work. And sleep.
DOCTOR: Deafness is… unlikely, Mr. Dhanoa. Most cases of tinnitus aren’t a sign of a serious underlying problem. It’s more of a… nuisance. Though, it can be persistent. It could also be related to some anxiety, given everything you’ve mentioned. I’m going to recommend some strategies for managing it. Avoid loud noises when possible, try to reduce your stress levels – easier said than done, I know – and we can try some white noise at night to help you sleep. There are apps for that. We could also consider a hearing test, just to be thorough, though I doubt it will show anything.
PATIENT: Okay… white noise, right. And avoid loud noises… work's going to be tricky. Stress… yeah, tell me about it. A hearing test sounds… good, I guess. Just to be sure. Is there… anything else? Like, medication or something? I just want this to stop.
DOCTOR: There aren't really any medications that cure tinnitus, Mr. Dhanoa. Some people find relief with antidepressants, but those come with their own issues, and given your… stress levels, I’m not convinced that’s the best course of action right now. I’m going to give you a referral to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing test. This paper has the information. And I’m going to recommend some mindfulness exercises. I'll also print out a pamphlet about tinnitus management. Honestly, sometimes it’s just about learning to live with it. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay… mindfulness. Right. I… I guess not. Just… is it going to get worse? That’s what I’m really worried about. And… will the audiologist be able to… fix it? If it is serious?
DOCTOR: It’s impossible to say with certainty, Mr. Dhanoa. Most people find their tinnitus remains stable, or even improves over time. The audiologist will perform a thorough evaluation and determine if there’s an underlying cause that needs to be addressed. They can also discuss strategies for managing your symptoms. If it is serious – and I highly doubt it is – they will refer you to a specialist. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Focus on reducing your stress, protecting your hearing, and try to be patient. It takes time. Do you need a work note?
