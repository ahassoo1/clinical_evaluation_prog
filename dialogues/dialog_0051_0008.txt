DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, right. My ear. Feels…blocked, mostly. Full. It’s been going on…well, a bit. Honestly, I can't quite put my finger on when it started. It just…is. It’s a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blocked or full feeling in your ear. And you’re having trouble pinpointing exactly when it began. That's alright, we can try to narrow it down. Is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, I think. Yes, the left. Though…sometimes it feels like it’s both, but it’s definitely worse on this side. I wouldn’t say it’s painful, exactly. More…annoying. Like when you’re on a plane, you know? But it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, left ear primarily, with occasional fullness in the right. Not painful, but more of an annoying, pressure-like sensation, similar to what you experience on a plane. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm…other symptoms. Let me think. Not really. I mean, I’m a bit hard of hearing anyway, you know, getting older…but that’s always been the case. Maybe…a little dizziness, sometimes. But I fall over a lot, so it's hard to tell if it's that. Does that make sense? I don’t remember anything specific being with the ear thing, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, some pre-existing hearing difficulty, and occasional dizziness—though it’s difficult to determine if that’s new or related. We'll keep that in mind. Just to clarify, when you say dizziness, is it a spinning sensation, a feeling of being off-balance, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Not spinning, no. Definitely more…off-balance. Like I might stumble. Or, I do stumble, usually. My wife…well, she used to say I was always clumsy. But, uh…she’s gone now. So it’s hard to say if it’s worse. Sorry. Didn’t mean to get…sidetracked.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Please, take your time. It’s important for me to understand everything. So, feeling off-balance…has this been happening alongside the ear fullness, or did it start around the same time?
PATIENT: Around the same time, I think. Yes. Both seemed to…creep up on me. Not suddenly, you understand. It wasn’t like a bang, or anything. Just…there. I do a lot of work outside, you see. Agricultural inspections. Maybe it's from that? I'm always bending over, looking at crops…could be anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so both the fullness and the off-balance sensation gradually developed around the same time, and you're wondering if your work—agricultural inspections, involving bending and looking at crops—might be a factor. That’s a reasonable thought. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… No ringing in my ears, no pain…I don’t think I’ve noticed any discharge. No fever, nothing like that. Honestly, Doctor, it’s just…annoying. It makes it hard to hear people sometimes, and I keep having to ask them to repeat themselves. It’s embarrassing, you know? I don’t know if that counts as a symptom, but…
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts as a symptom, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Frustration and difficulty with daily life are very important things to consider. No ringing, no pain, no discharge, no fever…primarily just the fullness, occasional off-balance sensation, and difficulty hearing. Alright. I’d like to take a quick look in your ears, if you don’t mind. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Yes, go ahead. The looking thing. I suppose I should have expected that. I always feel a bit silly when someone looks in my ears. But, uh, do what you need to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay…I see a bit of cerumen – that’s earwax – but nothing immediately concerning. The eardrum appears intact, though slightly dull. The right ear is similar – some cerumen, intact eardrum, also slightly dull. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing, but there doesn’t appear to be any sign of infection or significant inflammation. I'm going to document these findings.
PATIENT: Right. Dull, you say? Is that bad? Honestly, I don't know much about ears. I always just assumed…they worked. Or didn't. But dull doesn’t sound…good. Is it the wax? Could that be causing it?
DOCTOR: “Dull” is a bit of a technical term, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It just means the eardrum isn’t as translucent as we’d like to see. It could be due to the wax, and that’s a possibility we can address. However, it can also indicate a bit of fluid build-up behind the eardrum, or sometimes even a minor issue with the pressure equalization system in the ear. To get a better understanding, I’d like to perform a simple hearing test, and also a tympanometry test—that measures the movement of your eardrum. It's quick and painless. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests, right. Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I always seem to end up with tests. But go ahead. As long as it gets to the bottom of things. I just want to be able to hear properly again, you know? And not stumble all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Guerrerolopez. We'll do our best to get you back to hearing and feeling your best. Okay, let’s start with the hearing test. I’m going to put these headphones on you, and you’ll hear a series of tones at different pitches and volumes. Just indicate when you hear the tone by pressing this button. We'll start with your right ear.
PATIENT: Right ear first. Okay. I always have trouble with these things. I think I’m just bad at hearing quiet noises. But go ahead. I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s the right ear done. Now we’ll repeat the same process with the left ear. This will give us a good baseline to work with. Just relax and let me know when you hear a tone.
PATIENT: Left ear now. Right. I hope this doesn’t take too long. It’s a bit…tiring, you know? But I'll try. Just let me know if I’m doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guerrerolopez, that’s the hearing test completed. I’ll need a few moments to review the results. It appears you have mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears, slightly worse on the left. Now, we’ll do the tympanometry test, which measures how well your eardrum moves. It involves placing a small probe in your ear canal. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Mild to moderate…that doesn’t sound good, does it? I figured I was losing my hearing, but I didn’t realize it was that bad. The probe thing now, you said? In my ear? As long as it doesn’t hurt. I really don’t like things going in my ears.
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, but it's also quite common with age, Mr. Guerrerolopez. And it’s manageable. The probe is very small and flexible, and it shouldn't cause any discomfort—just a slight sensation of pressure. It will only take a few seconds per ear. I’ll explain everything as I go. Alright, just relax. I’m getting a reading now…okay. Now the left ear.
PATIENT: Slight pressure, you said? Okay. It’s a bit…weird. Not painful, just…odd. Get it over with quickly, please. I really don’t like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guerrerolopez, that’s everything. The tympanometry results show some reduced flexibility in both eardrums, which could be due to fluid build-up or mild blockage. Based on the hearing test and tympanometry results, combined with the physical exam, it appears you’re experiencing mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, likely exacerbated by some conductive component due to wax build-up and possible fluid. The dizziness and off-balance sensation may be related, but further investigation may be needed to rule out other causes.
PATIENT: Sensorineural…conductive…fluid…It's all a bit much to take in, Doctor. So…what does that mean? Am I going deaf? And what about the stumbling? Is there something seriously wrong with me? I just want to know what’s going on, and what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It’s a lot of information, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. You’re not going deaf, but you do have some hearing loss, which is common as we age. Sensorineural hearing loss means there’s some damage to the inner ear, and conductive hearing loss means there’s some blockage preventing sound from traveling properly. The wax build-up and possible fluid are contributing to the conductive component. As for the stumbling, it’s possible the fluid build-up in your ears is affecting your balance, but we need to rule out other causes. I’m going to recommend the following. First, we’ll remove the earwax to see if that improves your hearing. I can do that today. Second, I’d like you to see an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation and to discuss hearing aids if needed. Third, given the dizziness, I recommend a visit to a physical therapist specializing in vestibular rehabilitation—that's therapy for balance disorders—to assess your balance and strength. Finally, if the dizziness persists or worsens, we should consider a referral to an ENT specialist—an ear, nose, and throat doctor—to rule out any other underlying causes. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay. That…sounds like a lot. A lot of appointments. And tests. Earwax removal today, that’s good. I suppose. Hearing aids…I always thought those were for old people. And physical therapy…for balance? I just thought I was clumsy. An ENT…that sounds serious. I don’t know, Doctor. It’s all a bit overwhelming. Can’t we just…do something quick? Something to make it stop?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It is a lot, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Unfortunately, there isn’t a quick fix for hearing loss. Removing the earwax is a good first step, as it may improve your hearing immediately. We can then assess the extent of the hearing loss and determine the best course of action—which may or may not include hearing aids. As for the dizziness, it’s important to rule out other causes to ensure we’re addressing the underlying problem. The ENT referral is just a precaution, and the physical therapist can assess your balance and strength and provide exercises to help improve it. I want to assure you that we’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to guide you through the process. We can start with the earwax removal today, and then schedule the appointments for the audiologist and physical therapist at your convenience. I’ll also provide you with a referral to an ENT specialist, just in case. Would you like me to schedule those appointments for you now, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Okay. One step at a time. That…sounds better. Yes, please. Schedule the appointments for me. If you don’t mind. I just…don’t have the energy to deal with it all right now. And the ENT…yes, schedule that too, just to be safe. Just…get it done, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I understand. Let me see… I've scheduled you for a hearing evaluation with Dr. Anya Sharma, audiologist, next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. And for physical therapy with Ms. Benita Rodriguez, vestibular rehabilitation specialist, next Thursday at 10:00 AM. Finally, I’ve scheduled a consultation with Dr. Thomas Chen, ENT specialist, two weeks from today, on August 16th at 1:30 PM. I’ll send you confirmation emails with all the details. Before you leave, I’m going to remove the earwax from both ears. I’ll provide you with a prescription for some over-the-counter pain reliever, just in case. I’ll also give you some written instructions on how to care for your ears. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No…I don’t think so. Just…when will I be able to hear properly again? That’s all I really want, Doctor. To hear. Is it going to be soon?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Removing the wax should improve your hearing, possibly quite a bit, especially if it's significantly blocked. We’ll know more after I clean them. If the hearing loss is more significant, the hearing aids may take some time to adjust to, but Dr. Sharma will work with you to find the best fit and ensure you’re comfortable. Let's start with the wax removal, and we’ll go from there. It shouldn’t take long, and hopefully, you’ll notice an improvement immediately. I’ll do my best to make you comfortable throughout the process. Alright, let’s get started.
PATIENT: Okay. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolopez, that’s everything. I’ve removed the wax from both ears. I’ll just take a quick look… Okay, it looks much better. Your ear canals are clear now. I’d like you to listen to some sounds to see if you notice an improvement. Can you hear me clearly?
PATIENT: Yes…yes, I think so. It…sounds a bit clearer. Not perfect, but definitely better. It's like…a weight has been lifted. Still a bit muffled, but…better. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's excellent news, Mr. Guerrerolopez! It's good to hear you’re already noticing an improvement. The muffling may be due to the underlying hearing loss, which we’ll address with the audiologist. For now, I’m going to provide you with some written instructions on ear care, and a prescription for over-the-counter pain reliever, just in case. Remember, if you experience any pain, bleeding, or dizziness, contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No…I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. You’ve been very patient. I hope…I hope the hearing aids help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It was my pleasure. I’m optimistic that the hearing aids will make a significant difference, but we’ll take things one step at a time. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointments.
PATIENT: .
