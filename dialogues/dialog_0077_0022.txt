DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me a little about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Yes, hello. It’s… nice to meet you too, Doctor… Pirl, you said? Hmm. Well, my tummy… it feels big. And I don’t want much food. Not like before, you see? It's just... not feeling right. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. A little while, I think?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. “Tummy feels big, and not much appetite.” And you mentioned this has been going on for a little while, but you're unsure of the exact timeframe. That’s perfectly alright; we'll try to piece things together. Could you describe the feeling of “big”?
PATIENT: Hmm… big… like I ate too much, maybe? But I haven’t! It’s… full. And kinda… hard? Not painful, exactly, just… there. It feels different than when I just have a full tummy after dinner. It’s lower down, you see? Around… here. I don't know… is that helpful? I forget things so easily now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. McConnon. Lower abdominal fullness, not associated with pain… and different than a typical feeling after a meal. I understand your memory is a little unclear at times, that’s quite common. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… oh dear. What’s that mean? Do you mean… going to the bathroom? Yes… well, it's not… regular, I guess. Sometimes it’s okay, sometimes it’s not. Hard to say, really. I don’t pay much attention, if I’m honest. It's not something I talk about, you see? Is it bad that I don't remember?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. McConnon. It's perfectly normal not to focus on those details. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember precisely. We are just trying to get a complete picture. "Not regular," you said. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh… well, sometimes it’s… hard to go. And sometimes… well, it’s very easy. It changes. A lot. And sometimes it’s… different shapes, I suppose. I’m not a very good explainer, am I? It’s just… not how it used to be. I used to be very regular, you see. Everything was… predictable. Now… not so much. It doesn't hurt, though, not usually. Just… different.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. Change in bowel habits, alternating between constipation and… looser stools, you might say. No significant pain. That’s all very helpful. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool at all?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood? No! No, I don’t think so. I… I would remember that, wouldn’t I? No, no blood. Definitely not. That sounds… scary. I haven't seen any blood. No blood, thank goodness. Is that… bad if there is blood? I hope not.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. McConnon. You're right to be concerned about blood, and it’s good you haven't noticed any. It can be a sign of various things, so it’s always good to check. Now, let’s talk about your appetite. You mentioned you don't have much of an appetite these days. Has your weight changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my weight… well, I used to be quite a bit heavier, I think. But now… I’m not sure. I haven’t weighed myself in… a long time. Perhaps I’ve lost some weight? Everything feels so… distant now. I don’t really pay attention to those things anymore. It's just… hard to keep track. I just know I don't feel hungry much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. Decreased appetite, potential weight loss. It sounds like things have been gradually changing. Now, I'm going to ask you about some other things, just to get a better overall picture. Have you been experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, nausea… that's that sick feeling, right? No, no, not really. I haven’t thrown up, not at all. Sometimes I feel a little… queasy, maybe, after I try to eat. But not really sick, you understand? Just… not very pleasant. And I don't eat much, so there's not much to throw up, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. No nausea or vomiting, just occasional queasiness after eating. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine—color, frequency, or any difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My… water? Well, I go to the bathroom when I need to, I suppose. It's… yellow, usually. I don't pay much attention to it, if I'm honest. It’s just… water. And no, no difficulty. It doesn't hurt to go. Everything is… normal, I think. Just… old. Is this important, Doctor? I’m getting a little tired now. All these questions…
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. McConnon, but I understand your fatigue. We’re just trying to gather all the information to figure out what’s going on. And we're almost finished. Now, let me ask you a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions—like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical… conditions? Well, I was always quite healthy, you see. Very active. I walked everywhere. But… when I got older… hmm. The doctor, long ago, said something about my… pressure, maybe? I don't really remember. And I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But that healed, thankfully. I don't really have any… serious illnesses, I think. Just… old age. Is that a condition, Doctor? Being old?
DOCTOR: Being old isn’t a condition, Ms. McConnon, but it does come with changes that we need to be aware of. You mentioned high blood pressure in the past and a broken wrist. Do you know if you are currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… No, no, I don’t take anything. Not anymore. The doctor, a long time ago, gave me some pills for my pressure, but I stopped taking them. They made me feel… funny. And I haven’t seen a doctor in… a long time. I just didn't bother anymore. Everything just felt… complicated. Is that bad, Doctor? Not taking pills?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. No current medications. It's good you're honest about that. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… No, not really. I don't think so. I used to eat everything! And I never had any problems. Sometimes I get a little… itchy after I eat strawberries, maybe? But it’s not very bad. Just a little itch. Nothing serious. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything important. I’m a pretty sturdy old woman, you see. Everything usually just… passes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. No known significant allergies, just a mild itch with strawberries. Now, one last thing. Before we finish, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… My mother… she lived to be a very old age, you see. Very healthy, just like me. And my father… he passed away when I was young, I think. I don't remember much about him. And I have a sister, but we haven’t spoken in many years. She lives far away. As far as I know, no one in my family had any… serious illnesses. Just… old age, like me. It runs in the family, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Well… alright, I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. Just be gentle, dear. My old bones are a little… fragile. I don't want to break anything! Just… please be careful. And tell me what you're doing, so I don't get scared.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McConnon. I will be very gentle. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally for me. Your heart sounds a little bit fast, but that could be from being anxious or just from talking. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. This might be a little tender, please let me know if you feel any pain. I notice some fullness in your lower abdomen, as you mentioned. It doesn't feel acutely painful, but it is definitely enlarged. Abdomen is soft but with noticeable fullness in the lower quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little… strange. It feels… different than usual. Not painful, exactly, just… different. Like a balloon, maybe? Is that bad, Doctor? A balloon tummy? Should I be worried? I haven't felt this… full before. It's making me a little… nervous.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. McConnon. It’s good you're telling me how you feel. A "balloon tummy" is a good way to describe it. The fullness I feel and what you’re describing suggests there may be some trapped gas or fluid in your abdomen. It's not necessarily something to be immediately worried about, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Now, I’d like to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your abdomen to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The blood tests will check for any signs of infection or other underlying problems. The CT scan will allow us to visualize your organs and identify the cause of the fullness. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood tests and a… a scan? That sounds… scary, Doctor. I don't like needles! And a scan… will it hurt? Is it safe? I don't want any… radiation or anything like that. I'm an old woman, I don't heal very well! Is there… another way? I just want to feel better, I don't want to go through all of that…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. McConnon. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about these tests. The blood tests are relatively quick, and I'll make sure the phlebotomist is very gentle. As for the CT scan, the amount of radiation is very low, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. It will help us understand what’s causing your discomfort and rule out any serious problems. However, I respect your wishes. We could start with the blood tests and see if those give us any clues. If the results are inconclusive, we could consider a less invasive imaging test, like an ultrasound, before resorting to a CT scan. Would that be a more comfortable approach for you?
PATIENT: Oh… an ultrasound? That sounds… less scary than a scan. No radiation, you said? Yes, that would be… much better, dear. If we can try that first… that would make me feel a lot better. I really don't like needles, but I suppose I can manage a little blood test if it means I don't have to go through a scary scan. Yes, let’s try the blood test and the ultrasound first. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a little better already.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. McConnon. We'll start with the blood tests and then schedule an ultrasound. I’ll write you a requisition for both tests. The phlebotomist will come in shortly to draw your blood. And I'll have my assistant schedule the ultrasound for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or inability to pass stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. Emergency room… if it gets really bad. I understand. Pain, fever, sick… and no… bathroom. Yes, I remember. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I just want to feel better. When will I get the results? Will it take long?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McConnon. We’ll get the blood test results back within 24 to 48 hours. The ultrasound results may take a little longer, typically a few days, as the radiologist needs to review the images. My assistant will contact you as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoiding foods that might cause gas or bloating. And try to stay hydrated. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Smaller meals… and no gas. Okay. No… I don’t think so, dear. You’ve explained everything very well. Just… thank you again. For being so patient with me. I forget things so easily, you see. I appreciate your kindness. I think that’s all. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McConnon. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. My assistant will be in shortly to take your blood. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this.
