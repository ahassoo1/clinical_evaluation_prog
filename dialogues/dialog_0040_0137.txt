DOCTOR: Right. So, you're here for a pre-admission physical, essentially. Husband's being cautious. Good for him, I suppose. Look, I haven't got all day, so let’s just run through some things. What exactly is he worried about?
PATIENT: Oh… he just want make sure I strong enough. I… sometimes forget things, you know? Not big things, but… little things. And my legs, they get tired when I walk too much. He worry I fall. He good husband.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness, tired legs… typical. Alright, let's see… do you have any major medical problems?
PATIENT: Major…? Hmm. I have the… the pressure, sometimes. The doctor give me little pills for it. And my back, it ache when it is cold. Is that… major? I don't know what is major.
DOCTOR: The pills… are those for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. The little white ones. Doctor Ramirez, he give them to me. Long time ago now. Maybe five years? I take them every day. He good doctor, but he move away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the blood pressure and your back, anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… no. I think that is all. I have the… the normal old lady things. You know? Aches and pains. Sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. Is not so bad.
DOCTOR: Right. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don’t think so. I eat everything. My husband, he make good food. Spicy sometimes! No, no allergies. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: No… just the white pills. Sometimes, when my back hurt bad, I take the… the pain medicine. The red ones. But not every day. Only when I really need it. Husband buy them for me at the store.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's just get a quick physical done. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can stand. Is okay. Just a little slow, you know? Old legs.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated, but not drastically. Heart sounds… a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can walk. Like this? Is okay. Just… slow. My legs feel a little weak.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, that's enough. You have a slightly unsteady gait and a little shortness of breath. We’ll need to run some blood work to check your potassium and thyroid levels. And I think an EKG wouldn’t hurt. Just to be safe.
PATIENT: Okay… blood work? EKG? Is that… bad? I just want to go to the nice place, you know? With the garden. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's not bad, it's routine. We just need to rule things out. It’s standard procedure before you move into assisted living. Nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I'll order the EKG. Don't worry about it. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay… relax. Is long time since I have blood take. I don't like needle. But… if you think is best, I do it. Is just… is lot of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will explain everything. I have other patients waiting. We’ll get you sorted.
