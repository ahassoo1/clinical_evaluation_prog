DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, welcome. I'm Dr. Amussen. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. A letter saying I’m able to fly. It’s… for a trip I’m planning. It sounds silly, I know, but the airline needs it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fit-to-fly letter. Not silly at all, airlines often require those. Just to be clear, are you experiencing any current health issues that make you concerned about flying, or is this just a standard requirement from the airline?
PATIENT: No, no health issues at all. Nothing like that. It’s just… after my husband passed, I haven't flown since. The airline just wants confirmation from a doctor that I'm okay to travel, you know, because of the time that’s passed. They were very specific about needing a letter.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That’s very reasonable of them, and I'm happy to provide that for you. Just so I have a good record, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. I’ve been generally very healthy my whole life. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… but nothing major. In my twenties I had my appendix removed, and I had a pretty bad bout of pneumonia about ten years ago, but I recovered fully. Other than that… honestly, not much. I’m on Medicare, mostly just for preventative stuff. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. And you said your husband passed away – I’m very sorry to hear that. Losing someone is incredibly difficult. Has that loss impacted your health in any way?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… a few years ago now. And no, not really physically, thankfully. It was emotionally difficult, of course, and I did see a therapist for a bit, but that helped. I’ve been doing… okay. I just haven’t needed to see a doctor much since then, so my records are… probably a bit sparse. I don't think it affects my ability to fly at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And you said you're on Medicare, mainly for preventative care?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Just the annual checkups and things like that. I'm not on any regular medication. Blood pressure is good, cholesterol is good… the usual. I actually had a checkup in February and everything was fine. I can get you those records from my primary care doctor if that would be helpful?
DOCTOR: That would be helpful, yes. It’s always good to have the most up-to-date information. In the meantime, let's just do a quick physical exam to get a baseline, just to be thorough. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. I want to be sure everything is okay too. The sooner I get this letter, the sooner I can book this trip. I’m trying not to get my hopes up too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let's start with your vitals. Can you please sit here for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Do you need me to take anything off? Just let me know. I'm comfortable either way.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, thank you. Okay, your blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 – all within normal limits. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, if that’s okay.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Everything feels normal to me, but do what you need to do. I haven’t had any trouble breathing or anything like that. I actually walk a lot, so I think my lungs are pretty good.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds strong and regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything looks good there as well. Now, just a quick neurological exam - can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that alright? I sometimes get a little dizzy if I move my head too quickly, but I don't think that will be a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No nystagmus or anything to be concerned about. Your reflexes are normal as well. Everything seems to be in good order, Kiante. Based on this exam, and assuming no other underlying medical conditions, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't be fit to fly.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! That’s such a relief. Thank you, Doctor. I was really worried about needing to go through a bunch of tests. So, what do we need to do about the letter? Do I just… wait for it?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could reassure you. I'll draft the letter right now, outlining that you've been evaluated and are cleared for air travel. It'll include a brief summary of today’s exam. It may take me a few minutes, as I want to make sure it's thorough. Do you have a preferred way you’d like to receive it?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect. Email is fine, actually. My address is kiante.sayar@email.com. I don't really need a super detailed letter, just something that confirms I’m okay to fly. I really appreciate you doing this so quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ve got that noted. kiante.sayar@email.com. I'll get that emailed over to you shortly. While I’m doing that, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Really, thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I think I can finally start looking at flights again. It's been a long process just getting to this point.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I just emailed the letter over. Please let me know if you don’t receive it within the next few minutes. And you’re very welcome, Kiante. I'm happy to have helped. Enjoy your trip when you book it! Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Amussen. You’ve been wonderful. I really appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. It was my pleasure. Have a wonderful day, and safe travels! .
