DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well… I coughed up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come in. It happened just yesterday.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Not… a lot, but enough to worry me. It was… bright red. And it happened with a normal cough, you know? Not a bad cough, just… a regular one. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Regular” is subjective, Ms. Weichers. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. Was it with your first cough of the day?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Sorry. No, not the first cough. It was… maybe the third or fourth cough after I woke up. I was already up and getting ready for work. I usually have a little cough in the mornings, but nothing like this before. It just… surprised me.
DOCTOR: And how much blood are we talking, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: Oh, um… It wasn’t a lot, Doctor. Maybe… a teaspoon? A little more than a teaspoon, perhaps? It was mostly… mixed with my regular mucus, you know? Not pure blood. I hope that helps. I’m trying to remember exactly. It was frightening.
DOCTOR: A teaspoon… mixed with mucus. Alright. Have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. No fever, no chills. Not really any pain, except maybe a little bit of soreness in my chest, but I thought that was from the coughing. I haven’t been feeling tired, or losing weight, or anything like that. Just… the blood. And a little worried, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a little cold maybe a month ago, but it was very mild. Just a stuffy nose for a few days. Nothing serious at all. I haven’t been sick before that, no. I usually stay pretty healthy, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Oh! No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. My husband… he used to smoke, a long time ago, but he passed away last year. He quit many years before he got sick, though. But I have never smoked, no.
DOCTOR: Good. What about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Just… a little bit of something for my blood pressure. My doctor prescribed it after my husband passed. It helps, you know? It’s a small white pill, I take it every morning. Other than that, no. Nothing else, Doctor. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Weichers, it’s important. What’s the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I’m… not very good with names. Let me see… Ah, here it is. It’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. 10 milligrams. I take one every day. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, alright. And any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve had a few bug bites, of course, but nothing serious. No allergies to food or medicine, no. I’m quite lucky, actually. I don’t get sick very often.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen to your lungs. Please sit up straight and take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I can do that. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m a little nervous, but I’ll try my best. I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Okay… Deep breath… and again… Alright. Breathing sounds are… clear bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect right now. Your heart sounds are also normal. Now, I’m going to check your throat and listen again. Open wide and say "ah."
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Ah… Is that alright? Do you need me to say anything else? It's a little dry in my mouth, I think. I had some tea this morning, but maybe that’s it.
DOCTOR: Throat looks clear. No obvious signs of infection. A little bit of redness, but nothing concerning. Alright. Everything still sounds… normal. Now, I want to get a quick look at your oxygen saturation. I’m just going to clip this to your finger.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That doesn't bother me. Is that what tells you how much air I’m getting? It's a little cold, this metal thing. I’m ready when you are. Please let me know if you see anything wrong. I’m a little worried, you see.
DOCTOR: 98%. Good. That’s within normal limits. Now, Ms. Weichers, I want to be upfront with you. This is a little… unusual. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, warrants further investigation. It could be something minor, but we need to rule out anything serious. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? A chest X-ray… and blood work? Is it… serious? What are you looking for, Doctor? I’m a little scared now, to be honest. Is there anything I should be particularly worried about? I’m not very good with medical things, you see.
DOCTOR: Ms. Weichers, I understand your concern, but panicking won’t help. A chest X-ray can show us if there’s any inflammation, infection, or other abnormalities in your lungs. The blood work will help us check for signs of infection, anemia, and clotting issues. It’s routine in a case like this. We need to rule things out, that’s all. We’re looking for things like bronchitis, pneumonia, or, in rare cases, more serious conditions. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to be thorough. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now and schedule the X-ray for later this afternoon. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Routine… that makes me feel a little better. So, it doesn’t necessarily mean something bad is wrong? And the nurse will draw blood now? Okay. Um… Will the X-ray hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just… I don’t like waiting, you know? My husband… he always hated waiting for test results. This is all a little overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Ms. Weichers, the X-ray is painless. You’ll just stand still for a few seconds while the machine takes a picture. The results usually come back within a few hours, but sometimes it can take a day or two depending on the radiologist’s schedule. I’ll review them as soon as they’re available and call you with the findings. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Worrying won’t speed up the process. I'll have the nurse come in and get started with the blood work. Do you have any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies to latex. That’s good, isn’t it? Yes, okay. Blood work now. I think… I think I can manage that. It’s just… everything happened so quickly. This morning I was just having my tea, and now… X-rays and blood work. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it’s a little scary. I’ll try to stay calm.
DOCTOR: Good. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. I’ll see you after the tests. And try not to overthink it, Ms. Weichers. Nurse, could you please come in here?
