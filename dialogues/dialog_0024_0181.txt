DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I requested a general wellness check, a full lab panel if you will. I just like to keep tabs on things, you understand. At my age, one wants to be… proactive. My wife, Esmeralda, suggested it, and she is usually right.
DOCTOR: A “general wellness check,” is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Precisely. I believe the nurse explained it when she scheduled the appointment? Blood work, checking the usual things… cholesterol, blood sugar, that sort of thing. Nothing specific troubling me, thankfully. I just want to be sure everything is functioning as it should.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's get this over with. Have you had a physical examination recently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I had one approximately six months ago with Dr. Ramirez. He retired shortly after, unfortunately. A very good man, thorough examination, always took his time. It was mostly a routine check-up, nothing of particular concern was found then, as I recall. I can provide you with his contact information if you’d like, should you need it.
DOCTOR: No, that won't be necessary. I prefer to conduct my own assessments. Now, are you currently experiencing any symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Truly. That's why I scheduled this check-up now, while I don’t have any symptoms. I feel quite well, actually. Perhaps a little fatigue after a long day on the construction site – naturally, at my age – but nothing beyond the ordinary. I sleep soundly, my appetite is good, and I have no pains or discomfort to report. Is that… satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Satisfactory is…relative. Now, let’s review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Thankfully, no. My family has a history of… robust health, if you will. My father lived to be 92, and my mother, 88. Both were very active people, right up until the end. I've always been careful with my diet, avoided excessive alcohol, and tried to maintain a reasonable level of physical activity. Though, admittedly, construction labor is quite demanding. I did have a bout of shingles a few years back, but that cleared up quickly with medication. Other than that, nothing significant to report.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. A repair to my rotator cuff, about fifteen years ago. It was a consequence of years of lifting heavy materials on the job. The surgery was successful, and I have full range of motion now, though it does ache a little after particularly strenuous work. The surgeon, Dr. Alvarez, did excellent work. I followed his rehabilitation plan diligently. No complications, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I’m aware of. I’ve taken various medications over the years for minor ailments – pain relievers, antibiotics, that sort of thing – and have never experienced an adverse reaction. My wife always double-checks when I’m prescribed something new, just to be safe, but so far, so good. I have no known allergies to food or environmental factors either. A perfectly unremarkable medical record in that regard, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Let’s move on. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. Never have. My father always warned me about the dangers of smoking, and I heeded his advice. I find the habit… distasteful, frankly. And Esmeralda would never allow it in the house, naturally. She’s quite… firm on such matters. I do enjoy a glass of red wine with dinner occasionally, but that's the extent of my indulgences. A small pour, for enjoyment, and for the antioxidants, you understand.
DOCTOR: And alcohol consumption...how many drinks per week, on average?
PATIENT: Doctor, as I mentioned, it's usually just a single glass of red wine with dinner, perhaps three or four times a week. On occasion, if we have guests, I might have two. But rarely more than that. I'm a moderate drinker, certainly. I've never been one for excessive revelry. I prefer a quiet evening with Esmeralda, a good book, and a pleasant conversation. Nothing boisterous or… disruptive. Is that… sufficient detail?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, for the sake of completeness, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just one regular medication. I take a low-dose aspirin daily, as recommended by my previous physician, Dr. Ramirez. He suggested it as a preventative measure for my heart health. And I occasionally take ibuprofen for minor aches and pains after a particularly strenuous day at work. Nothing else. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, but that's more of a habit than a necessity. Esmeralda insists. I believe she reads something about it in one of her magazines.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let us proceed with a brief physical examination. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I trust it's calibrated correctly? I’ve maintained a relatively stable weight for the past several years, despite the demands of my profession. It's mostly muscle, you understand. Years of physical labor will do that to a man.
DOCTOR: 90 kilograms. And your height is recorded as 193 centimeters. A Body Mass Index of 22.8. Within normal limits. Now, please face the wall. We'll take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. I always appreciate a thorough examination. It’s reassuring to know everything is functioning as it should. I believe in preventative care, you understand. Esmeralda instilled that in me. She's a very practical woman. Do let me know if you detect anything unusual. I'm quite… resilient, but one can never be too careful.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/80. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear, bilateral. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. No obvious abnormalities detected during auscultation. Now, open your mouth. Let me examine your throat.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you can see, everything appears to be in order. I maintain excellent oral hygiene. Esmeralda is quite meticulous about that as well. She believes a healthy mouth is indicative of overall health. Do you require me to say "Ahhh"? I’ve had a fair amount of experience with this, you understand.
DOCTOR: Normal pharyngeal mucosa. No exudates or lesions. Palpating lymph nodes… no significant enlargement. Now, if you'll excuse me, the nurse will draw some blood for the panel you requested. We should have the results in a few days. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at the moment. That sounds perfectly reasonable. A few days is quite acceptable. I appreciate your thoroughness, even if you are… somewhat brisk. I trust the nurse is proficient with the blood draw? I have… relatively prominent veins. And thank you for your time, Doctor Mutnick. I look forward to receiving the results. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood draw? Fasting, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to fast for 12 hours prior to the blood draw. No food or caloric beverages. Water is permissible. The nurse will provide you with the necessary paperwork. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Have a good day, Mr. Mombrun. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. I shall adhere to the fasting instructions. A good day to you as well, Doctor Mutnick. .
