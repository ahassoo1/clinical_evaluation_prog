DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a little hard to say exactly. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. My family… we’ve always had a lot of headaches. It’s just… things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, you know? I forget so easily now.
DOCTOR: Right. Weakness and headaches. And you said your family has a history of headaches?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. My mother, and her mother before her… terrible headaches. They'd have to lie down in a dark room for hours. And my brother… he used to get them so bad, it would make him… well, he couldn’t do anything. I've had headaches my whole life, but they haven't been… like theirs. Not usually, anyway. Lately, they’ve felt… different. Hard to explain. It’s like… a heaviness, almost. And sometimes my hand feels… clumsy. Not all the time, just… now and then.
DOCTOR: “Clumsy,” you say. And when did you notice this… change in the headaches, and the hand weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Time… it just slips away. I’d say… maybe the last few months? Around springtime, perhaps? It’s hard to pinpoint. The headaches have been more frequent, definitely. And the hand… I noticed it when I was trying to bake cookies for my grandson. Dropped the dough a couple of times. Silly things, really. But it wasn't like me. I used to be quite the baker, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I can recall, really. My daughter keeps asking me if I've noticed any trouble speaking, or seeing double, but no. Everything seems… normal, mostly. Though I do get tired easier, I suppose. Old age, you know? I used to have so much energy, but now… a little nap in the afternoon is nice. Not a problem, really. Just… slowing down, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any other medical problems that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, let’s see… Well, the doctor years ago, he said my blood pressure was a little high. I was on a little pill for it, but he took me off a while back. Said it was under control. And… oh! I had my gallbladder out, goodness, must be twenty years ago now. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Just this one. For my arthritis, mostly. Just when my hands bother me. It’s… naproxen, I think? My daughter helps me with all this, you know. It’s hard to keep track of everything. I take it every morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, dear. Not that I know of. I used to be stung by a bee when I was a little girl, but that was… oh, a lifetime ago! Didn't have any trouble with it then, and I haven't had any trouble with anything since. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Though, sometimes dairy upsets my stomach a little… but that’s not really an allergy, is it? Just… a sensitivity, I suppose.
DOCTOR: And your family history... besides the headaches, are there any other conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. My brother… he had some trouble with his heart, later in life. Needed a stent, I think. And my father… he had diabetes. It wasn't good. He lost his sight, eventually. And… My aunt… on my mother’s side… she… she had something with her mind, I think? Something about forgetting things. It wasn't good. She needed someone to look after her. That’s all I really remember, dear. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't very close to her. It’s all a bit hazy, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now. We’ll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Just a routine check, Ms. Tofani.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I haven’t had a proper exam in… goodness, I don’t even remember. Be gentle, now.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's start with your reflexes. Just relax your arm. And now the other one. Good. Now your legs. Relax... and the other leg. Reflexes are… slightly diminished bilaterally, but not significantly. Now, can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Is that… is that hard enough? I don't want to be a bother. It's a little difficult, you know, my hands aren't as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now I'm going to check your strength. Can you push against my hand?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just tell me if I'm doing it wrong. I don't want to make a fuss. Is that… is that enough? It feels a little… weak, doesn’t it? Not like it used to be, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. Right here. And now… is that alright? I hope I’m not making a mess of things. My eyes sometimes get tired, you know. It’s just… getting older, I suppose. Is something… wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to order a CT scan of your brain, and some blood work. It’s just to rule out anything serious. We need to investigate the weakness and headaches further.
PATIENT: Oh, a scan? Is it… is it something bad? I don’t like scans. They make me feel… claustrophobic. And blood work… oh dear. I always bruise so easily. Are you sure it’s necessary? Could we maybe… try something else first? Perhaps some medicine?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, I understand your concerns, but this is standard procedure. We need to get a clear picture of what’s going on. The scan will help us rule out stroke, tumors, or other serious conditions. The blood work will check for infection, inflammation, and other potential causes. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially given your symptoms. I will write you a prescription for an anti-anxiety medication to take before the scan, and we will ensure the technician is aware of your concerns. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, dear. If you think it’s necessary. But… will it hurt? And how long will it take? I have to pick up my grandson later… And… what if they find something? Please… tell me everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: The scan is painless, Ms. Tofani. You will lie still for about 20-30 minutes. As for finding something… that’s why we’re doing it. The sooner we know what’s going on, the sooner we can address it. I am not going to speculate on the results. I’ll review them as soon as they are available and discuss them with you. Here is a referral for the scan, and a prescription for lorazepam to take an hour before. Please schedule the scan as soon as possible. Do you have any further questions, or are we finished here today?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Lorazepam… that’s for the anxiety, is it? I hope it works. No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, dear. I’ll… I’ll try to schedule it. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Right. You're welcome. Have a good day, Ms. Tofani.
