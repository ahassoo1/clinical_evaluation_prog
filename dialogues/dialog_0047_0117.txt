DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, it's this cough. Been coughin' up stuff... got blood in it sometimes. Not a lot, but... yeah. It worries me. I smoke, if that matters. Been doin' that a long time.
DOCTOR: Right. A cough with some blood…and you smoke. Yes, that does matter. How long have you had this cough, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Long? Geez. A while now. Maybe... a couple months? It started small, just a tickle. Now it... well, now it's this. I don't really keep track of things like that. It just... got worse. Sorry, I'm not good with dates.
DOCTOR: A couple of months. Alright. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Worse in the mornings, usually. And when I… when I’ve been workin’ hard. It’s my job, see? Power lines… dispatchin’. Lots of stress sometimes. That makes it worse, I think. I don’t know. It’s just a cough. I hope it ain't nothin' serious.
DOCTOR: Dispatching… stressful work indeed. And you said you cough up blood sometimes?
PATIENT: Yeah. Not every time. Mostly when I really cough hard. It's... it's not a lot. Like, I see a streak when I spit. It scares me, but I don't... I dunno. I thought maybe it was just from coughin' so much. Old habit, you know? Smokin' for years.
DOCTOR: Right. And how much do you smoke, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Uh... a pack a day. Maybe a little more when things are bad at work. Been doin' it since I was, uh... young. A long time. I should quit, I know. Always sayin’ I should quit.
DOCTOR: A pack a day for… how long exactly, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Geez, lady. A long time. Since I was... eighteen? Nineteen? Something like that. I don't keep track of these things. A lot of years. It's hard to remember. I wasn't expectin' a quiz. Is this important? I just want to know if I'm gonna be okay.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Reyno. Smoking for that long, combined with coughing up blood… it requires a thorough examination. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Uh... I get tired easier now. And sometimes I get kinda short of breath. But I'm not a young man anymore, you know? Could be just gettin' old. I don’t really know. And... sometimes a little chest pain. Not bad, just... a dull ache. Mostly when I cough a lot. Does that make sense? I’m not good at explainin' these things.
DOCTOR: Right. Fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain... along with the cough and blood. We need to rule some things out. Have you had a fever, night sweats, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever? Not that I know of. I don't check my temperature. Night sweats... sometimes. But I live in a hot place, so... maybe that’s just the heat? And weight loss… I guess I’ve lost a little. But I ain’t been eatin’ much lately. Worried about this cough, see? It’s messin’ with my appetite. It’s all kinda blurry, I'm sorry. I don't remember things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Reyno, with your history of smoking, the cough, the blood, and these other symptoms, we need to get a chest X-ray. It's standard procedure, and it will help us determine the cause of your cough. I'm also going to listen to your lungs. Would you mind if I do that now?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Okay. Whatever you think is best. I just wanna know what’s goin’ on. And yeah, go ahead and listen to my lungs. I guess. Just… get it over with, please. I got things to do. Work, you know? Folks depend on me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just sit up straight and take a few deep breaths. I'm going to listen to your back and then your chest. Try to relax as much as possible. Alright. Take a deep breath… and again… and one more. Okay. Your breathing is a little… wheezy. And I can hear some crackling sounds in the lower part of your lungs. This doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it does support the need for that X-ray. We'll get that ordered now. Then we'll discuss the results.
PATIENT: Okay. Wheezy, huh? Cracklin’? Sounds bad. Just... hurry up with the X-ray, please. I gotta get back to work. I hope it ain't nothin' serious. I got a lot on my plate. Can I at least get a glass of water after this? My throat's kinda dry.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can have a glass of water. The X-ray will be ordered right away. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. It usually takes a day or two. In the meantime, I’m going to ask about your past medical history, any medications you take, and your family history. It’s important information, even if it seems unrelated. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Other conditions? Uh... not really. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And my back's been botherin' me for years, but that’s just from work. Liftin’ things, you know? Not much else. I don’t go to the doctor much. I usually just tough it out. Medications… just some pain relievers for my back, when it gets real bad. And family history… my grandpa smoked, if that matters. He died young. But… that was a long time ago. I don’t remember much about it. This is a lot of questions, lady. I'm gettin' tired.
DOCTOR: Right. Pain relievers for your back, a grandfather who smoked... and died young. What kind of pain relievers do you take, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Uh... over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, I think. Sometimes Tylenol. Whatever's on sale at the store. I don't keep track of these things. I just grab whatever works. Does it matter what kind? I just want to know if this cough is serious. I got people dependin' on me. This is stressin' me out. Can we just get the X-ray done?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, I understand your concern, and your desire to get back to work. But it is important to have a complete picture. Ibuprofen and Tylenol…do you take them regularly, or only when your back pain flares up?
PATIENT: Only when my back hurts. Not every day. Maybe a couple times a month. Sometimes not even that. I just pop a couple pills and try to ignore the pain. I don't like takin' pills. Look, I ain't a complicated man. I just need to know if I'm gonna be okay. This cough... it's scarin' me. Can we please just get this X-ray done? I feel like I'm bein' interrogated.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. I have documented your history. I will order the chest X-ray. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. It’s best to have it done as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid strenuous activity and try to get some rest. I know that’s easier said than done, but it’s important. The nurse will be in shortly to give you a glass of water. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just… get the X-ray done. I gotta get back to work. Thank you. I think. Just… please hurry. .
DOCTOR: Very well. .
