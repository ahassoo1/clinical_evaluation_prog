DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, hi. Look, I don't have a lot of time for this. It's my breath. It smells, okay? Really bad. It’s… embarrassing. I just need something to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly frustrating when something like that is bothering you, and you're right to seek it out. We'll figure this out. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: What do you mean "more about it"? It smells bad! Like, consistently bad. It's not like, sometimes it's okay, and sometimes it's awful. It's just… always there. And it's not from me not brushing, alright? I brush. Twice a day. Maybe more when I have somewhere to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And I absolutely believe you about brushing – maintaining good oral hygiene is important. When did you first notice this consistent bad breath?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know. A while ago. Probably… after the divorce. Which, honestly, isn't your business. But yeah, sometime after that. It just… started. I didn't really pay attention to it at first, but then people started… subtly moving away. You know? It’s just annoying. Is that all you need to know? Because I really need to get back to work. The highway doesn't fix itself.
DOCTOR: I understand. And thank you for sharing that with me – sometimes stressful life events can manifest in unexpected ways. It’s good you’re addressing it now. To get a better understanding, and rule out different possibilities, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Ugh, “general health.” Look, I work on the highway. It’s not exactly a health spa. I’m… okay, I guess. I eat when I can, mostly whatever’s quick. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. I don’t get sick often, if that matters. I’m strong, I lift heavy things all day. That's about it. Don't ask me about vitamins or anything, I haven't got a clue.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you're quite active, which is great. Knowing you're generally healthy is good information. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the bad breath?
PATIENT: No. Just the breath. No cough, no sore throat, no… anything. It's just there. It's really irritating. Look, is this going to take much longer? I'm starting to feel like I’m wasting my time. People are counting on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your time, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. We're trying to get to the root of the problem. Just to be thorough, and since you mentioned it’s been ongoing, have you noticed any changes in your sinuses?
PATIENT: Sinuses? What do you even mean? Like… stuffy nose? Sometimes. But I just blow it. It's the highway, alright? Dust, dirt, everything. I don't usually bother with… whatever sinus stuff is. It’s not a big deal. Honestly, I don't see what any of this has to do with my breath.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes chronic sinus issues can contribute to bad breath, which is why I'm asking. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Don't take anything. Never really needed to. I'm not one for popping pills. I just… deal with things. I took some ibuprofen once for my back, but that was ages ago. And like, cough drops when I had a little cold, but that's it. Seriously, is this going anywhere? I’m starting to feel really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No current medications. And I appreciate your patience. Just a few more questions, and then we can do a quick examination. Have you had any recent dental work or have you been to the dentist recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, the dentist. Look, I went… a while ago. Like, before the divorce, probably. I haven't been back since. Honestly, I don't really like going to the dentist. It's expensive, and it's uncomfortable, and I don't see what good it does. Is that okay? I mean, is this a problem? I just need something to fix my breath, not a lecture about dental hygiene.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. Not having visited the dentist recently is something we'll definitely need to address as a potential cause. Okay, to get a better understanding, would you mind if I quickly examine your mouth and throat?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. I really need to get back to work. People are depending on me. And don't tell me to floss, alright? I’m not interested.
DOCTOR: Alright, I won’t lecture you. This will just be a quick look. Please open your mouth for me. Okay. Your gums are a little red, and your tongue has a slight coating, but nothing immediately concerning. I don't see any obvious signs of infection. Your throat looks clear as well.
PATIENT: So? What does that mean? Is it something serious? Just tell me what’s wrong and what I need to do to fix it. I don’t have time for medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, there are a few possibilities. The most likely cause, given your lack of recent dental care and the redness of your gums, is gum inflammation, possibly gingivitis. This can definitely cause bad breath. The coated tongue can also contribute. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. Because your insurance status is not insured, I recommend a visit to the local dental clinic for a full examination and cleaning. Would you like me to provide you with their contact information?
PATIENT: Dental clinic? Seriously? Look, I don't have the money for that. And honestly, I don’t want to go. Is there anything else? Like… a mouthwash or something? Can’t you just give me something to mask the smell? I need to get back to work, and I don’t have time for expensive procedures. People are relying on me, alright? I can't afford to be out of commission.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost and time, and I appreciate you being upfront about it. While a mouthwash can temporarily mask the odor, it won’t address the underlying cause, and the problem will likely return. In your case, given the likely possibility of gingivitis, I strongly recommend a dental visit. However, in the meantime, to help manage the odor and possibly reduce inflammation, I can recommend a few things. Rinse with an alcohol-free mouthwash twice daily. Increase your water intake, as dry mouth can worsen bad breath. And, if possible, try to avoid sugary foods and drinks, as they can contribute to bacterial growth. I can also write you a referral to the local dental clinic, and I can inquire about any potential low-cost or sliding-scale options they might have available. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. A referral, I guess. But no promises I’m actually going. Honestly, it sounds like a waste of money and time. Just… give me the paper. And can I just go now? I really need to get back to work. The highway isn't going to fix itself, and people are depending on me.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This is the contact information for the clinic. I’ve noted your concerns about cost, and they may have options available to help. I understand your hesitation, but addressing the potential gingivitis is important for your overall health. Please monitor your symptoms, and if you experience any pain, swelling, or fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. Just… thanks, I guess. Look, I’m going to go now. I appreciate you not lecturing me about flossing. It’s… something. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. And you're right, no lecture about flossing today. I wish you all the best, Zelina. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
