DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it's… it's hard to explain. I just feel tired. All the time. And… and I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I just… crave it. It's embarrassing, okay? I don’t even know why I'm telling you this. Just get me something for the tiredness, please. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not too much to ask at all, Hedy. It's good you came in. Feeling tired all the time can have a lot of causes. And… you mentioned craving dirt?
PATIENT: Yeah, dirt. Clay, mostly. Like… the red kind. Don’t look at me like that. It started a few months ago, I think. Maybe longer? Time… it all blurs together, you know? My husband… he’s gone now. Anyway. It just… feels good to eat it. I know it’s weird. Don’t tell anyone. It's not like I'm choosing to do this, exactly. It's just… a feeling. A need. Can we just skip to the part where you give me something to feel better? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d like to get straight to a solution, Hedy, and I respect that. But to figure out the best way to help, I need to ask a few more questions, if that’s alright. It’s important to understand why you're feeling tired and why you have this… craving. It could be something simple, or it could be a sign of something else. Let's start with the tiredness. Has it been getting worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Everything's just... worse. Since… well, since he passed. It's like all the energy just… left with him. I used to be able to work all day, program those machines, no problem. Now? I can barely get out of bed some days. I have to work, though. Bills don’t pay themselves. So I drag myself in, pretend to be okay, and then come home and… and this happens. The dirt thing. It's a cycle, I guess. Honestly, I don’t even remember what it feels like to not be tired. Just… fix it. Can you fix it?
DOCTOR: I understand, Hedy. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling this way. Losing someone you love is incredibly difficult, and it absolutely can drain your energy. Before we talk about treatments, I'd like to rule out some medical possibilities that could be contributing to your fatigue. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Ugh. Like what kind of symptoms? I get headaches sometimes. And… my stomach feels weird. Not like, sick, but just… off. Bloated, maybe? And I’m always cold. Even when it’s hot. Does that count? Look, I don’t do well with… with doctors asking a million questions. I just want a pill. Or a shot. Something quick. I don’t have time for tests and… and poking and prodding. Is that too much to ask? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Hedy. You’re right, it’s frustrating to have to go through a lot of questions. But a "quick fix" might not be the best solution in the long run. We need to figure out why you're feeling this way so we can address the root cause. Headaches, stomach discomfort, and feeling cold… those are all important clues. And the craving for dirt… that's something we definitely need to explore. It’s a condition called pica, and it can be related to vitamin deficiencies, especially iron. Would you be alright if I took a quick look at your chart to see if you've had any bloodwork done recently?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? I… I don't think so. I haven't been to a doctor in… years. Not since… well. No. I don’t like needles. And I don't have insurance. It's expensive, you know? Just… give me something for the tiredness. Please. Something over the counter, maybe? I really just want to get out of here. This is making me anxious. And when I’m anxious, I crave the dirt even more. It’s a vicious cycle, I tell you. A vicious cycle.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Hedy. And you’re right to be worried about costs. We won’t do anything without discussing it first. Since you haven't had recent bloodwork, and you’re understandably hesitant, let’s start with a physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your skin. It's a basic exam, and it might give us some clues. Also, just so I'm clear, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nothing. Never been much of a pill person. Just… the tiredness. And the dirt. That’s it. Look, can we just… get on with it? I don't like being poked and prodded, but if it gets me out of here faster, fine. Just... be quick, okay? And don't ask me too many questions while you're doing it. It makes me nervous. Honestly, I just wish my husband was here. He always knew what to do. Now… now it’s just me. And the dirt.
DOCTOR: Alright, Hedy. We'll take it slow. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your blood pressure. This won't take long. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. Now another one. Your breathing sounds a little… shallow, but overall, it sounds okay. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140 over 90. We’ll need to keep an eye on that. Now, let me just check your pulse… Pulse is a little fast, 90 beats per minute. Are you feeling particularly anxious right now?
PATIENT: Anxious? Does it look like I’m not anxious? I’m sitting in a doctor’s office, talking about eating dirt! Of course, I'm anxious! And my blood pressure is high? Great. Just what I needed. Look, is there anything wrong with me? Just tell me straight. I don’t need a lot of fancy medical terms, okay? Just… am I dying? Because if I am, I need to make arrangements. I have bills to pay, you know. And… and things. It’s just… a lot. Honestly, I just want this to be over. Can we please just wrap this up? I'm starting to feel lightheaded. This whole thing is making me crave the dirt even more. .
DOCTOR: Hedy, please. You're not dying. I didn't mean to cause you alarm. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that can be caused by anxiety, and we can address that. And your pulse is a little fast, also likely due to anxiety. We need to figure out what's causing you to crave dirt, and why you're feeling so tired. It's a complex situation, and I want to help, but I need your cooperation. Given your reluctance to have bloodwork done at this time, and your anxiety, I recommend starting with a simple iron supplement. It's available over the counter, and might help with the cravings. However, it’s important to rule out other underlying causes, so I strongly suggest a consultation with a mental health professional to discuss your grief and anxiety. Would you be open to a referral?
