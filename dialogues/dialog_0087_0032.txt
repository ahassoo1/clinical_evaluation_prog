DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I'm Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s a delicate matter, naturally. One doesn’t simply discuss these things with just anyone, you know. It’s… a discharge. Yes. A most unpleasant discharge. I noticed it a few days ago. Though, to be perfectly frank, my memory isn’t what it once was. It could be longer. It’s simply… there. And bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It's perfectly alright to discuss these things with me; that's what I'm here for. And it's common for things to be a little less clear when it comes to timing, especially as we get older. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Good heavens. It’s… well, it’s fluid, naturally. And not… pleasant-smelling. A bit yellowish, I believe. Though, again, my eyesight isn't what it used to be either. Is this truly necessary? Must I provide such… graphic details?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok. These details are necessary to help me determine the cause and best course of action. It’s helpful to know the color, consistency, and any odor. You mentioned yellowish – is it clear yellow, or more of a dark, amber color?
PATIENT: Amber? Really, Doctor. I haven’t the faintest idea what shade of yellow it is. It’s… yellow. Like a… a weak daffodil, perhaps? Though even that is a stretch of my fading recollection. This is quite… undignified, you know. I’ve never had to describe such things to anyone before. My wife, of course, but… well.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the unpleasantness of this conversation, Mr. Krok. It is rarely comfortable discussing these things. A pale yellow color is helpful. And you are quite right, it's perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable. Now, is this discharge coming from any specific area, or is it more general?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I should think it’s fairly obvious where it’s coming from. It’s… down there, naturally. I’m not entirely sure I appreciate being asked to elaborate further. Honestly, it's a bit…impertinent. Is this standard procedure? I've always considered myself a… private man.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern for privacy, Mr. Krok, and I assure you I respect that. I'm only asking to get a clearer picture of what's happening to provide the best care. Specifically, is it coming from the urethra – that's the opening where you urinate – or is it around the scrotum, or perhaps another area?
PATIENT: Urethra? Scrotum? Doctor, are you attempting to quiz me? I’m an old man, not a medical student! I know generally where things are, but I haven't a precise understanding of anatomical terminology. It’s… from the front. That’s all I can tell you. Really, this is quite unnecessary. Is there not a simpler way to address this?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, “from the front” is helpful. And I apologize for the line of questioning; I didn’t mean to cause any discomfort. Has this discharge been associated with any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: Hmm… pain, you say? Not exactly pain. More of a… discomfort. A slight irritation, perhaps. And yes, a little itching now and then. It's not unbearable, mind you. Just… bothersome. It keeps me awake at night, sometimes. Though, truthfully, I'm awake at night for a multitude of reasons these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort and some itching. And it's worse at night. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches along with this?
PATIENT: Fever? Good heavens, no. I haven’t a temperature, Doctor. I feel perfectly… normal, apart from this… situation. Chills? No, it’s quite warm enough these days, thank you very much. I assure you, I am not unwell. Just… inconvenienced.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or body aches. Now, Mr. Krok, I'm going to ask a few more personal questions, and I understand these may be uncomfortable. Have you had any changes in your sexual activity recently?
PATIENT: Doctor! I… I hardly think that’s relevant! I am an 83-year-old married man! Such questions are quite… impertinent, and frankly, insulting. I will not dignify that inquiry with a response. Honestly, I'm beginning to question the professionalism of this entire establishment.
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Mr. Krok. That was a poorly phrased question, and I did not intend to offend you. It's standard medical procedure to inquire about such things, but I completely understand your discomfort and I should have approached that differently. Let's move on. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Goodness, Doctor, this is simply dreadful. To be subjected to such questioning at my age... It's beyond belief. Sexually transmitted infections? I should think not! I’ve been a married man for… well, for a very long time. My wife and I are… discreet people. I find the very suggestion… appalling.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. And I apologize again for the uncomfortable line of questioning. It was inappropriate, and I should have been more sensitive. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Medications. That I can answer. I take a little something for my blood pressure, you know. Amlodipine, I believe it's called. And sometimes, a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, usually. Nothing else, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Thank you, Mr. Krok. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick examination of the area where you're experiencing the discharge. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An examination? Doctor, are you quite sure that's necessary? I've already told you everything I know. And frankly, the thought of a… physical examination at my age… it's rather… unsettling. I'm not certain I'm comfortable with that. Could we not simply prescribe something? A cream, perhaps?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok, and I wouldn't proceed with anything you're not comfortable with. However, to determine the cause of the discharge and ensure you receive the most appropriate treatment, a quick examination is very helpful. It's a simple procedure, and I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. Without an examination, it's difficult to rule out certain possibilities. It’s important to be thorough. If you truly prefer to skip it, we can discuss potential treatments, but I strongly recommend the examination for an accurate assessment. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is most unpleasant. Very well, Doctor. If you insist. But be gentle, please. And quick. I truly dislike this whole ordeal. I suppose if it’s necessary… but I must reiterate, be gentle. I’m an old man, and everything is… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle and quick as possible. I'll explain everything as I go. Please lie down on the examination table, if you're able. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm now going to gently examine the area. I see some mild redness and slight swelling. There is a small amount of yellowish discharge present. I don’t feel any obvious masses or tenderness. It appears localized to the urethral opening.
PATIENT: Oh, yes… that’s… tender. And rather… embarrassing. Localized, you say? Is that… good or bad? I truly haven't the faintest idea what any of this means. And please, be quick. I feel quite exposed.
DOCTOR: Localized is neither good nor bad, Mr. Krok, it simply means the issue is confined to one specific area. Based on what I’ve seen and your symptoms, the most likely cause of your discharge is urethritis, an inflammation of the urethra. It could be caused by a number of things, including a bacterial infection, irritation, or even a narrowing of the urethra. To confirm the diagnosis, I’d like to collect a urine sample for analysis and a swab of the discharge to test for infection. Would you be able to provide those samples?
PATIENT: More samples? Really, Doctor? This is becoming quite an ordeal. Very well. If it’s necessary. Though I must say, I'm not entirely sure I can manage all this… testing. My bladder isn't what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. We’ll take it slowly. I'll provide you with a sterile cup and instructions for collecting the urine sample. The nurse will assist you with the swab. It’s important to try and collect a mid-stream sample – meaning you start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup, and finish urinating. That helps ensure we get an accurate result. Don't worry, we'll make sure you're comfortable throughout the process. While we wait for the lab results, I'm going to prescribe a course of antibiotics to start treating a possible bacterial infection. This should help alleviate your symptoms while we determine the exact cause. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotics, you say? Yes, that sounds… sensible. As long as they don’t have any unpleasant side effects. I’ve always been sensitive to medications, you know. And please, do ensure they're easy to swallow. I have a bit of trouble with pills these days. And, Doctor, one final question… will this… affect my marital relations?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Krok. The antibiotics I’m prescribing are generally well-tolerated, but as with any medication, side effects are possible. I’ll explain those to you in detail. Regarding your marital relations, it's best to avoid intercourse until the infection has cleared and your symptoms have resolved. The discharge can be irritating, and there's a risk of transmitting the infection to your wife. Once the antibiotics have completed their course, and your symptoms are gone, you should be able to resume normal activity. Here’s the prescription for the antibiotics. Please take them as directed, and finish the entire course, even if your symptoms improve before you’re finished. I’ll also give you some instructions on hygiene to help prevent further irritation. We should receive the lab results in a few days. We'll call you with the results and discuss any further treatment if needed. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Hygiene instructions? Very well. I suppose one can never be too careful. No, Doctor, I believe that’s all. I thank you for your patience… and your discretion. It hasn’t been a pleasant experience, but I appreciate your efforts. I truly do. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I need a strong cup of tea. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns or questions after you've started the antibiotics. And I hope you enjoy your cup of tea. Get well soon.
