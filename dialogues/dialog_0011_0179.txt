DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… nice to meet you as well. Well, it is… difficult to explain. I find… the right words, they do not come so easy now. It has been happening for… some time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gyamfi. It's perfectly alright to take your time. We have plenty of time today. Perhaps you could start by telling me the main issue that’s been concerning you, and we can work through the details together. Even a general description is a good starting point. Is it a physical discomfort, or something else?
PATIENT: Not… physical. Not pain, no. It is… in my head, I think. Like… a word is on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot grab it. It is very… frustrating. It makes talking… difficult. And sometimes, I forget… what I was saying. It is… concerning.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're experiencing difficulty with word retrieval – finding the right words – and some memory lapses. You've noticed this has been happening for some time, and it’s causing you concern. Can you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a good question. Some time… a few months, perhaps? Or… longer? It is… hard to say exactly. My wife… she noticed it first, I think. But… she is gone now. So… it has been since then, definitely.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gyamfi. That must be a very difficult time for you. Losing your wife… that’s a significant loss, and it can certainly affect many things. You mentioned this started around the time of your wife’s passing, so roughly how long ago was that?
PATIENT: It was… last November, I believe. Yes, November. Almost… nine months ago now. It feels… much longer than that.
DOCTOR: I see. Almost nine months ago. And you've noticed this difficulty with word finding and memory since then?
PATIENT: Yes. It… started slowly, I think. Just… small things. Forgetting a name here, a word there. But it has… grown. It is… more frequent now. It worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gyamfi. Progressive difficulty with memory and word finding is certainly something we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a typical instance of this happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yesterday, I was… speaking with the man next door, about his garden. And I wanted to tell him… about the roses. I know the color… a very bright red. But the word… it would not come. I knew it, I felt it, but I could not say it. I… described the color, instead. It is… frustrating for both of us.
DOCTOR: So, you know the concept – bright red roses – but the word itself is inaccessible. You were able to work around it by describing the color instead. Does this happen with all types of words, or are there specific types that are more difficult?
PATIENT: Hmm… not all words, no. Names… sometimes, the names of people I know… those are difficult. And… objects. Common objects. But… simple words, like… “the” or “and”… those I can usually say. It is… random, I think.
DOCTOR: Random, and more frequent with names and common objects. That’s helpful information. Now, aside from the difficulty with word retrieval and memory, have you noticed any other changes in your thinking or behavior?
PATIENT: Changes…? Let me see. I… sometimes feel… a little lost. Like I am… not fully present. And I… I used to enjoy reading, very much. But now… I cannot concentrate long enough to finish a book. My mind… wanders.
DOCTOR: A sense of being "lost" and difficulty with concentration – those are important things to note. Have you experienced any changes in your mood, such as feeling more sad, anxious, or irritable?
PATIENT: Yes. Sadness… often. I miss my wife, very much. And… anxiety, sometimes. Worrying about… forgetting things, mostly. And… a little irritable, perhaps. It is… frustrating, not being able to say what I mean.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’ve been experiencing sadness and anxiety, particularly related to your memory difficulties and the loss of your wife. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any significant past medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had… high blood pressure, for some time. But… it was controlled with medication. And… I had a mild heart attack, about five years ago. But… I recovered well. Other than that… nothing much.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with medication, and a heart attack five years ago, with a good recovery. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Yes. I take a… a small white pill, every morning. For the blood pressure. And… a baby aspirin, to help with the heart. That is all.
DOCTOR: A small white pill for blood pressure and baby aspirin. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No… not that I know of. I have never had a… reaction to anything. Not that I recall. No allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, to get a better understanding of your cognitive function, I'd like to perform a brief cognitive assessment. This will involve a few simple questions and tasks. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… that is fine. I… I am happy to do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today…? Let me see… It is… August… the second? Yes, I believe it is August the second. The year… is… 2025? Yes, 2025.
DOCTOR: Very good. And can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… hmm. I… I am not sure. Is it… near here? I know I live in the suburbs… but the name of the city… it escapes me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Gyamfi. We can come back to that later if you’d like. Let’s try a simpler question. Can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, tell me the words.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those three words back to me, please?
PATIENT: Apple… table… and… hmm… it was… penny? Yes, I think. Apple, table, penny.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I'm going to ask you to do a few simple calculations. First, if you have ten apples and I give you five more, how many apples do you have?
PATIENT: Ten… and five… That is… fifteen. Fifteen apples.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, if you have fifteen apples and you give me ten, how many do you have left?
PATIENT: Fifteen… take away ten… That is… five.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I am going to ask you to draw a clock showing ten minutes past eleven. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Draw a clock…? Oh… yes, I can try. Here. Is this… correct?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. That’s helpful. Alright, one last thing. I’m going to ask you to name as many animals as you can in one minute. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Animals…? Yes, I can try. One minute…? Alright. Let me see… Dog… cat… horse… cow… pig… chicken… sheep… lion… tiger… bear… elephant… …Rabbit… and… hmm…
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. That was very helpful. Based on these preliminary findings, there appears to be some evidence of cognitive impairment, specifically affecting memory, attention, and executive function. However, these are just initial observations, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause. It's important to rule out any reversible causes, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or medication side effects. I would like to order some blood tests to assess your overall health. Additionally, I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment and possible brain imaging. Does this sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Cognitive… impairment…? Oh dear. Blood tests… and a neurologist…? Well… if you think it is necessary, Doctor, then yes. Whatever you think is best. I just… want to know what is happening. I do not want to… get worse.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gyamfi. We will work through this together. We are not making any definitive diagnoses at this point, just taking the necessary steps to get a clearer picture. I will write an order for the blood tests now, and you can get those done at the lab across the street. Once we have the results, we can schedule an appointment with a neurologist. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that require significant concentration or memory recall, if possible. Are there any questions you have for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… how long will it take to get the results from the blood tests? And… will the neurologist… will they be able to… help?
DOCTOR: The blood test results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have them, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. As for the neurologist, they are specialists in the brain and nervous system. They will be able to conduct more detailed assessments to determine the cause of your cognitive difficulties and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan. Treatment options can vary depending on the diagnosis, but may include medication, therapy, or lifestyle changes. We’ll take things one step at a time, Mr. Gyamfi. We will figure this out together. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, such as confusion, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much for listening to me. I feel… a little better, knowing we are doing something.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. It was my pleasure. Remember, we are here to support you every step of the way. My nurse will provide you with the lab order and instructions before you leave. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
