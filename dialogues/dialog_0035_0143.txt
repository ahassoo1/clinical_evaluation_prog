DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My daughter, she wants… she and her husband, they want a baby. And she thought I should… come here first? Before… everything? I don’t really understand all the things that need to be done, to be honest. It’s been a long time since I thought about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It can be a lot to take in. So, your daughter is planning a pregnancy, and she'd like you to have a check-up first?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. She said something about… family history? And making sure I’m okay, before… you know. I don’t want to cause any trouble. I just want to be… helpful. Is that making sense? I get a little mixed up sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Verrall. It’s very thoughtful of you to come in. Family history is important, and we want to make sure everything is as healthy as possible. Let's start with that, if you don't mind. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, certain types of cancer… anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had problems with her heart, I think. Old age, mostly. And my father… he had something with his stomach, a long time ago. Cancer, maybe? It was… a long time ago. I was young. I don't really remember the details. My sister, she’s healthy as a horse, I think. She always was. Is that… helpful? I'm sorry I can’t be more specific. It’s just… been years.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Verrall. Any information is helpful. So, heart problems on your mother’s side and possibly stomach cancer on your father’s side. And your sister is in good health. Now, thinking about you specifically, do you have any medical conditions that you’re currently being treated for – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but I think that's just… getting older. And my back… it aches a bit, especially when the weather is bad. But I don’t take anything for it. I just… try to move around. I haven’t seen a doctor in… a long time, to be honest. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat okay, I think. Nothing too bad. Does that make sense? I'm probably not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medical conditions, just some fatigue and back pain. And you haven’t seen a doctor regularly. That’s perfectly fine. Let’s talk about any medications you're taking – prescription, over-the-counter, even vitamins or supplements. Anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Not a thing. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. My daughter, she’s always telling me I should take something for my joints, but I just don’t. I try to get by on my own. Just… tea, mostly. And water, of course. Is that… okay? I hope I’m not forgetting anything. It's hard to remember things these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. No medications at all. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing football. That needed a cast, I think. And… oh! When I was younger, I had my appendix out. That was… a long time ago. And… I don't think that's all. Nothing major, really. Just… small things. I don't remember the details, to be honest. It was… a while ago. Do you want me to try and think harder? I might be able to remember something else.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child and your appendix removed. That’s helpful. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My daughter always asks me that, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat… well, I eat most things. Sometimes my stomach gets a little upset, but I think that’s just… old age, again. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, I think. Is that… what you need to know? I'm worried I'm just rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing fine, Mr. Verrall. It’s good to hear you don’t have any known allergies. Now, just to finish up with some background, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmm… I used to work very hard, Sales Engineer, travelling a lot. But I’m retired now. I mostly stay at home. I like to read, and I watch a little television. I try to go for walks when the weather is nice, but… I don’t go out much. I live alone. Is that… what you mean by lifestyle? I’m not very active, I suppose. Does that matter? I try to eat healthy, but… I like my tea and biscuits!
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture, thank you. Now, before we move on, I’d like to ask a few questions about your health history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or any heart condition?
PATIENT: No, never. Like I said, I haven't seen a doctor in years. Never been told I have any of those things. I feel okay, mostly. A little tired, but… that’s just getting old, isn't it? My daughter worries a lot, but… I feel alright. Is it important that I haven't been to the doctor? I always thought if I felt okay, there was no need to bother. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: No, it's not silly at all. It's common to feel that way. But regular check-ups are important, even when you feel well, to catch any potential problems early. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to be helpful for my daughter. A little nervous, but… okay. Where do we start? Should I… change into something?
DOCTOR: No need to change, Mr. Verrall. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax your arm for me…Good. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs sound clear. Okay, everything sounds okay, but the murmur is something to monitor. I'm going to check your reflexes now.
PATIENT: Okay. A murmur, you say? Is that… bad? My mother had heart problems… I don’t want to worry my daughter. I just want to be sure everything is alright. Should we… do some more tests? Or… I don’t know what to do. I’m not very good at this, Doctor. I just want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be concerned, Mr. Verrall. A murmur doesn’t always mean something is seriously wrong. Many murmurs are harmless, often described as ‘innocent murmurs.’ However, since your mother had heart problems, it's prudent to investigate further. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Lymph nodes are normal. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order some blood work—a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel—and an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity. That will give us more information to work with. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work and an EKG… alright. I just hope it’s not too expensive. I’m not… insured, you see. My daughter will probably help, but… I don't want to be a burden. When do we do these tests? And… will it hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Verrall. We'll see what options are available to help minimize the expense. The lab can often work with patients without insurance, and we can discuss that after the tests are ordered. The blood work involves a small needle prick, but it's usually quick and doesn't hurt too much. The EKG is painless—it involves placing sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart's electrical activity. We can schedule the blood work and EKG for tomorrow morning at the clinic. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that should be alright. I’ll have to ask my daughter to take me, she drives. And… the patches, that sounds okay. Not a needle, good. I just… want to be sure I’m not a bother. Will you… explain everything to me afterwards? I don’t understand all the medical talk. And… what about the murmur? Will these tests tell us what’s wrong with my heart?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verrall. We'll schedule the tests for tomorrow morning, and I’ll explain everything to you in plain language afterwards. No medical jargon, I promise. The tests will give us more information about the murmur – what's causing it and whether it requires any further attention. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly and create a plan together. I understand your concerns and will address them every step of the way. Now, let’s go ahead and get the lab orders and EKG request sent over. And don’t worry; you’re not a bother at all. Taking care of my patients is what I do.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a lot better. You're very kind. I just… want to be helpful for my daughter. I hope the tests are alright. I hope it's nothing too serious. I trust you, Doctor. Please, just let me know what's going on, in simple terms. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll be sure to explain everything clearly. We'll take things one step at a time. I'm here to support you. Here are the lab orders and the request for the EKG. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will be expecting you tomorrow morning. If you have any questions at all before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Now, are there any other concerns I can address before you leave today?
