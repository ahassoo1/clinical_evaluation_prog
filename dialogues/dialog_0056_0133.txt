DOCTOR: Hi Melvenia, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get some health forms signed, just a notary thing, really. I have to get them verified so I can… well, it’s a long story. But it's mostly paperwork. I hope this won't take too long, dear.
DOCTOR: Okay, paperwork. No problem at all, we can definitely get that sorted. I see here you're 76 years old... and just to confirm, is that Tippens, T-I-P-P-E-N-S?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Tippens. And yes, 76 is… accurate. Though sometimes I feel younger! I just want to make sure everything is official, you know? It's for a program… something with the county. Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, county program… I understand. While I’m happy to notarize the forms for you, as your doctor, I also want to make sure we touch base on your overall health, just briefly. It’s good practice. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I suppose that’s reasonable. I haven’t really been to a doctor in… a while. But honestly, I'm pretty healthy for my age. I just need the forms signed, if that’s alright. Is that going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: It won't take long at all, Melvenia. Just a few quick questions to get a general idea of things. It's mostly just to rule out anything that might need attention alongside getting the forms signed. How about this – we start with any current medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I take something for my arthritis, a little white pill. Can’t remember the name for the life of me. And sometimes, when my blood pressure gets high, I take something for that, too. But it’s not every day. My niece usually refills them for me. I honestly don’t keep track of the names myself. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Melvenia. It's very common for people to rely on family for medication management. We can figure it out. Do you happen to know who refills them?
PATIENT: Yes, my niece, Esmeralda. She’s a very good girl, Esmeralda. She takes care of a lot of things for me. She goes to the pharmacy near her house… it’s on… Elm Street, I think. Near the bakery. Oh, and she uses her insurance, so I don't really worry about it. I just tell her what I need, and she handles it. I'm sorry I don't have more details, dear.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Melvenia. That’s helpful. Knowing it’s Esmeralda and the location of the pharmacy gives us a good starting point. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was ages ago. And once, many years back, I had a reaction to a bee sting, but that was just swelling, and it went away. Nothing serious. I don’t really have any trouble with foods. I eat pretty much everything. Wait… sometimes, if I eat too much chocolate, I get a bit of heartburn. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Heartburn doesn’t typically count as an allergy, Melvenia. That’s more of a sensitivity. So, no known true allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, that's right. No true allergies. Just the occasional heartburn with chocolate, and I can live with that! Can we get back to the forms now, Doctor? I really need to get those signed. I have an appointment later, and I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Before I sign them, just a quick question—have you been experiencing any recent changes in your health?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… now that you mention it… I have been a bit more tired lately. And my ankles swell up sometimes, especially at the end of the day. But I figured it was just from being on my feet too long. I like to garden, you see. And… my memory hasn’t been what it used to be. But who’s memory is good at my age? I’m probably just getting old, Doctor. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That's all very good information, Melvenia. It's good you're telling me. The tiredness, swelling, and memory changes are things we should pay attention to. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me how long you’ve been noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… oh, goodness. It’s been… a few months, I think. Maybe since the winter? It’s hard to say exactly. It wasn't sudden, just… gradual. I used to be able to remember everything, but now… I have to write things down constantly. And the swelling… it comes and goes, you know? Some days are better than others. I'm really not one to complain, Doctor. I've lived a long life. Can we please get to the forms now? I'm starting to get anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. We can absolutely get to the forms. However, given what you've told me, I want to be thorough. Just a quick physical exam—checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and looking at your ankles—would help me feel more comfortable signing off on these. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Must you? I just want the forms signed. It's all so much fuss. Well… if you have to. But please be quick. And gentle. My arthritis acts up sometimes. But I swear, if this takes much longer…
DOCTOR: Of course. Quick and gentle, I promise. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax, and breathe normally. 150 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, if you don't mind, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Now let’s take a look at those ankles… Some mild swelling present in both ankles. Okay, Melvenia. Everything looks… within the range of what we’d expect for someone your age, but I do notice some things that warrant a little further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation?! Oh, dear. What do you mean? What’s wrong? Am I sick? I just wanted the forms signed! Is this going to cost me a fortune? I don't even have insurance, you know!
DOCTOR: Please don't panic, Melvenia. It's not about being “sick.” It’s just that your blood pressure is a bit high, and the swelling in your ankles, along with the tiredness you mentioned, could indicate a few things—like fluid retention or a potential heart issue. I want to rule those out to make sure everything is okay. I’d like to order a basic blood test and an EKG—that’s a simple test to check your heart’s rhythm. It’s very quick and painless. And I want to be upfront about the cost. Because you don't have insurance, I can connect you with some programs that may help cover the expenses, and we can discuss options that fit your budget. I would never want finances to be a barrier to your health. But before we do that, let’s get those forms signed so you can be on your way. However, I do want you to understand that I’ll be able to sign off more comfortably knowing we’ve taken a few basic steps to look into these things. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, dear, dear. It's always something, isn’t it? Fine. Do what you have to do. But please, hurry. And tell me everything will cost before you do it. I really can't afford a surprise bill. Just get it over with. And then sign the forms. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. I completely understand. I'll write down the estimated cost of the blood test and EKG before we proceed, and we can talk about payment options. I'll also give you a list of resources that can help with medical expenses. Okay, here are your signed forms. Now, let's discuss the blood test and EKG. The blood test will check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any underlying infections. The EKG will give us a quick snapshot of your heart rhythm. Both tests are very straightforward and shouldn’t take long at all. The estimated cost for both combined is around $200 - $250, but we'll confirm the exact amount before proceeding. I'll have my assistant schedule those for you. She can also help you with payment plans and connect you with local assistance programs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: $200 to $250?! Oh, my goodness. That's… that’s a lot of money. I don’t know if I can afford that. Honestly, I barely have enough to cover groceries this month. Can't you just… sign off on the forms without the tests? I just need to get this done. It's for the program, you know? They won't accept it without a signature from a doctor. Please. It’s really important.
DOCTOR: Melvenia, I understand your financial concerns. I truly do. And I want to help you get these forms signed. However, as your doctor, I have a responsibility to ensure your health and safety. Signing off on the forms without even a basic assessment would be irresponsible, especially given the concerns we discussed—your elevated blood pressure, swelling, and fatigue. Here’s what I’m willing to do. Let’s start with just the blood test. It’s the less expensive of the two, and it will give us some crucial information. If the results come back normal, we can revisit the EKG later. And I promise to work with you on finding financial assistance options to cover the cost. I can also write a note explaining your concerns to the program, and perhaps they'll be willing to accept the results of the blood test as sufficient documentation for now. Would that be a compromise you're comfortable with?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, dear, dear. This is just… so much fuss. Fine. Just the blood test, then. But promise me you’ll help me find a way to pay for it. And write that note to the program. Maybe they'll be understanding. I just want to get this over with. Please. And can I sit down? I'm starting to feel faint.
DOCTOR: Of course, please sit down. And I promise, I will do everything I can to help you with the cost and write a detailed note to the program explaining your situation. I’ll also have my assistant schedule the blood test for you as soon as possible and explore all available financial assistance options. Here, let me write this note to the program. I’ll explain that you’re undergoing a medical evaluation and that we’re prioritizing a blood test to assess your overall health. I’ll also mention your financial concerns and request that they consider the results of the blood test as sufficient documentation for now. Here you go. My assistant, Sarah, will be with you shortly to schedule the blood test and discuss payment options. She’s very knowledgeable and will be happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I just hope this whole thing doesn’t take too long. I have a garden to tend to, you know. Tell Sarah to hurry, please. I really want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll let Sarah know right away. She’ll be with you shortly. And don’t worry, we’ll do everything we can to make this as quick and efficient as possible so you can get back to your garden. Just relax, and let Sarah take care of the scheduling. If you feel unwell at any time, please don’t hesitate to let me or any of the staff know. And I wish you all the best with your garden. It sounds lovely.
