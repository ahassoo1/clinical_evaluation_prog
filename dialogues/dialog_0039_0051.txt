DOCTOR: Hello Darl, welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Let me see… my memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? My… son, I think it was, said I should come. Something about needing to know what kind of… blood I have? It’s for some papers, I believe. Or maybe a new… insurance thing? It's all a bit foggy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Darl. It’s very common for things to feel a bit foggy sometimes. Don’t you worry about remembering all the details. It sounds like your son is concerned about getting some updated medical information for you, perhaps a blood type and possibly some other routine tests for insurance purposes. Let’s start with that then. Just to confirm, is he wanting a blood type specifically, or did he mention anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds right. Blood type, definitely. He was saying something about… being prepared, just in case. A long trip, maybe? Or a… a change in doctors? I really can’t recall. He’s a good boy, my son. Very organized. He always worries about these things. I mostly just… let him handle it. Is it a difficult thing to find out? I don’t remember ever having that done before.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not difficult at all, Darl. It's a very simple blood test. It just tells us your blood type – A, B, AB, or O, and whether you’re Rh positive or negative. It's good information to have, and it is helpful to have on file, just in case. Your son is very thoughtful to be thinking ahead. Before we do the blood test, though, I like to get a bit of your medical history, if that’s alright with you. Just to make sure everything is as it should be. Have you been seeing a regular doctor for a while now?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a regular doctor… well, I used to. Back in… Spain, mostly. A very nice man, Doctor… Ramirez, I think. But that was a long time ago. When I moved here… it all got a bit muddled. I haven’t really had much need for a doctor since then. Just the usual aches and pains, you know? Old age creeping up on me. I’ve been mostly alright, though. No serious illnesses or anything. I hope. It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. So, you haven't been under the care of a doctor regularly since you moved here. Just the occasional aches and pains... that's common. We can definitely address those too, if you’d like. Before we move on, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions - like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me think… High blood pressure… the doctor back in Spain, Doctor Ramirez, he did mention something about that once. My husband, bless his soul, he had it too. I think he put me on some pills, maybe? But it was so long ago, I truly can't recall. I stopped taking them when we moved, I think. No one said anything about it here. As for diabetes… no, I don’t think so. I love my sweets, though! Always have. Perhaps I should have been checked for that. I really have no idea. It's all so confusing!
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information to have, Darl. It sounds like you might have had high blood pressure at some point, and we'll definitely want to check that again today. It's not uncommon for blood pressure to change over time. We'll do a quick measurement to see where you're at now. And yes, sweets are lovely! We can also check your blood sugar as part of your routine check-up. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… Yes! I had my appendix out when I was a young woman. Back in Spain, of course. It was a very… scary experience. I don't remember much detail, just a lot of white sheets and worried faces. And… oh! My husband, he had a hip replacement many years ago. I spent a lot of time at the hospital with him. But as for me… no, I don't think I’ve ever been hospitalized for anything else. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. I hope. It’s hard to be sure after so many years. My memory really isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had your appendix removed when you were younger, and your husband had a hip replacement. That’s good to know. And you haven't had any significant hospital stays yourself, other than the occasional cold and flu. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. Not that I know of, dear. I’ve always been able to eat pretty much anything. I love seafood, especially paella. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine that I can remember. Sometimes, I get a little itchy after taking some pills, but I just assumed it was my skin getting dry. My son always tells me to drink more water. He worries about everything, that boy. No, I don’t think I have any serious allergies. Just a bit of… sensitivity sometimes. Nothing to worry about, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. No known allergies. It’s always good to check, though. Now, are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… No, not really. I used to take something for my arthritis, but the doctor said it wasn’t helping much, so I stopped. And sometimes, I take a little something for my… indigestion. It’s just a little herbal remedy, nothing prescribed. My son buys it for me. He says it’s good for my stomach. But other than that… no, I don’t take any regular medications. I try to stay as natural as possible, you know? I don’t like taking too many pills. It makes me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you used to take something for arthritis, but you're not taking it anymore. You occasionally use an herbal remedy for indigestion. And you’re generally trying to avoid medications. Now, just to get a complete picture, do you have any family history of any significant medical conditions – like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that’s a difficult one. My mother, bless her soul, she died of… well, old age, mostly. But my father, he had a weak heart. He always complained about chest pains. And my sister, she had… some kind of cancer, I think. A long time ago. It was very sad. As for my husband’s family… I don't really know much about them. We didn’t see them very often. They lived in another part of Spain. So, yes, there’s been some… illness in the family, but I don’t know all the details. It was all so long ago. I wish I could remember more. My memory just isn’t what it used to be, you know? It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems with your father, and cancer in your sister’s family. That’s helpful to know, and it's understandable that the details are a little fuzzy. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, would you mind telling me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I try to take it easy these days. I enjoy my garden very much. I grow tomatoes and peppers, mostly. And I like to read. Mostly… mysteries, you know? Keeps my mind active. I don’t go out much anymore. My legs aren’t what they used to be. And I mostly eat… well, Spanish food, of course! Paella, gazpacho, things like that. My son does most of the cooking now, bless him. He’s a good boy. I used to walk more, but now I mostly just… sit and relax. I try to get enough sleep, but sometimes I have trouble falling asleep. Oh, and I do enjoy a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. It helps me relax. Is that alright? I hope I’m not telling you too much. I just… ramble on sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not telling me too much at all, Darl. That’s all very helpful information. It sounds like you enjoy a quiet life, with gardening, reading, and good food. A little glass of wine with dinner is perfectly alright! It sounds very relaxing. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your general health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine, dear. Whatever you need to do. My son always tells me to listen to the doctors. He worries about my health, that boy. Blood pressure, you say? And… listening to my heart? That sounds a little scary, but I trust you. Do whatever you need to do. I'll just sit here and try to relax. I hope I don’t faint! I used to get dizzy sometimes when I was younger. But I'm sure I’ll be alright. Just tell me if it’s going to hurt. I don't want any surprises!
DOCTOR: No surprises, I promise. It won’t hurt at all. It’s just routine. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. I’m just wrapping this cuff around your arm… and take a deep breath for me… and relax your arm… Okay, your blood pressure is 145 over 88. That’s a little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. It's good that we're checking it today. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally… deep breaths in and out… Your heart sounds are a little bit… regular but a bit strong. There are no obvious murmurs or irregularities. And your lungs are clear… I can hear normal breath sounds on both sides. And finally, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities… Just relax and breathe normally… Okay, everything feels soft and normal here. Your abdomen is non-tender to the touch. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. It was very quick and easy! How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn’t bad at all! Not scary at all, really. Just a little… strange, having someone listen to my heart. But you were very gentle. And I feel alright. A little… tired, maybe, but that’s probably just from the excitement. You said my heart was a little… strong? Is that bad? Should I be worried? My son always tells me to be careful with my heart. He says it’s important to take care of it. What does it mean, “strong”? Is it something I need to fix? I hope it's nothing serious. I just want to keep gardening and reading and enjoying my life. Do you think I'll be able to do that?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not necessarily something to be worried about, Darl. When I say “strong,” I mean your heart is working a little harder than it perhaps needs to be. That can be due to a few things - like the elevated blood pressure, or just normal changes with age. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it’s something we want to monitor. Because of the slightly elevated blood pressure and the stronger heart sounds, I’d like to order a few routine blood tests. They'll check your cholesterol, your blood sugar, your kidney function, and just give us a better overall picture of your health. It's a standard procedure, nothing to worry about. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests… I don’t really like needles, you know. I used to faint whenever I saw blood. But… if you think it's important, then I suppose I can do it. My son would want me to. He’s always telling me to get checked up. Just… be quick about it, alright? And try not to poke me too much. I hope it doesn't hurt too much. What kind of blood are you taking? Is it the same kind they need to know my blood type? Do I need to fast before the tests? I hope I remember everything… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right to ask. We'll be taking a small amount of blood from your arm, just like we did to check your blood pressure. It’s not a lot, and it doesn’t usually take long. It is a different sample than what we need to determine your blood type, though we can do both at the same time. And yes, you do need to fast for about 8-12 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We need an empty stomach to get accurate results. I’ll give you a lab order, and the staff will schedule you for an appointment. They'll be very gentle, and they’ll explain everything to you. And don't worry, I'll make sure the results are sent to me as soon as they’re available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, 8-12 hours… That means I can’t have my breakfast? I always have a little toast with my coffee. And no coffee at all? That’s going to be difficult. But alright, I suppose I can manage it. My son always says I’m stronger than I think. I’ll just have to drink a lot of water. And they’ll schedule an appointment for me? Will it take long? I don’t like waiting around. And they'll send the results to you? That’s good. I trust your judgment, dear. You seem very… knowledgeable. What happens after the tests? Will you call me if something is wrong? I always worry about bad news. And… will I have to take any pills? I hope not. I just want to keep gardening and reading and enjoying my life. Do you think I’ll be able to do that?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to refrain from food and drinks, except water, for 8-12 hours before the test. And I understand that can be difficult! But it’s important for accurate results. The lab will call to schedule an appointment for you, and the test itself usually doesn't take very long, maybe 15-20 minutes. And yes, I will call you as soon as I have the results. If everything looks normal, I’ll just give you a call to let you know. But if there are any concerns, I'll explain everything to you and we'll discuss the best course of action. As for pills… it’s too early to say. We need to see the results of the blood tests first. It’s possible you won’t need any medication at all. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, let’s just focus on getting the tests done. And yes, I absolutely believe you’ll still be able to keep gardening and reading and enjoying your life. That's the goal! These tests are just a precaution to make sure everything is as healthy as it can be. We'll work together to make that happen. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very reassuring, dear. Thank you. I think… I think that’s all for now. My son always tells me to write down my questions, but I always forget. My memory, you know? It’s a terrible thing. I suppose I should ask about the cost of the tests? I don’t want to surprise my son with a huge bill. He works so hard. And… will the tests hurt? I really don’t like needles. Is there anything I should do to prepare besides fasting? Should I wear something comfortable? I hope I haven’t forgotten anything. I always worry about forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: You’re very thoughtful to ask about the cost. Let me check with the billing department, and I’ll have them call you with an estimate. I don't want to cause any financial surprises. And as for the tests, they shouldn't hurt too much. You might feel a little pinch when the needle goes in, but it's very quick. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and they’ll do everything they can to make you comfortable. You should wear something comfortable, and it's a good idea to drink plenty of water before the test. It makes it easier to draw the blood. Other than that, just relax and try not to worry. You’ve got this, Darl. And I'm here to help you every step of the way. Do you want me to write down the lab's phone number and the fasting instructions for you?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, dear. Yes, please. My memory is just terrible. I always forget things. The lab’s phone number and the fasting instructions… that would be wonderful. I suppose I should also ask… what kind of blood are you looking for? Is it the same kind they need to know my blood type? I don't want them to take too much blood. I get dizzy easily. And… will I have to wait a long time for the results? I hate waiting. It makes me anxious. Oh dear, I'm probably asking too many questions. I'm sorry. I just… worry a lot.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Darl. Don't worry about asking questions. It’s my job to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. And to answer your questions, yes, it’s a slightly different sample than what’s needed for your blood type, but the phlebotomist will only take a small amount of blood. It shouldn’t take long, and they’ll make sure you’re comfortable the entire time. As for the results, it usually takes 2-3 business days for them to come back. I know waiting can be anxiety-inducing, but I'll call you as soon as I have them. Is there anything else I can clarify for you right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, dear. Thank you so much. 2-3 business days… I can manage that. I think… I think that’s all. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. My memory isn’t what it used to be, and I always worry about forgetting something important. I suppose I should be going now. My son is probably wondering where I am. He worries about me, that boy. Thank you again for everything, dear. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I hope I haven’t taken up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: You haven’t taken up any time at all, Darl. It was my pleasure. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’m here to help. Take care, Darl. And please, try not to worry too much. .
