DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I am Dr. Yackey. I see you're here today. Let’s try to be efficient, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, efficient sounds good to me. Though, don’t rush on my account. I’ve got time. I’m here about feeling sleepy during the day, even with the machine I use at night. It’s…well, it's a bit bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: “A machine at night,” you say. Is that a CPAP device for sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. A CPAP. My ex-wife insisted I get tested, said I snored like a freight train. Turns out she was right! Been using it for…oh, goodness, must be fifteen years now. It helps, mostly. But lately, I’ve been feeling awfully tired even after a full night with the mask on. It's not like I'm falling asleep standing up, but I just feel…drowsy, you know? Like I haven't quite woken up.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years is a considerable length of time. It’s not uncommon for settings to require adjustment over time. Have you had any recent changes in weight, sir?
PATIENT: Oh, well, yes, actually. A few pounds, maybe five or six, crept on during the pandemic. Not a huge amount, but enough that my trousers feel a little snug. I try to walk when I can, but the Florida heat…it’s something else these days. It makes it hard to get out much. And the humidity!
DOCTOR: I see your weight is documented as 92 kilograms. And you mentioned difficulty with exercise. Alright. Let's proceed with a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps check your oxygen saturation quickly. Just a standard assessment, nothing to be alarmed about.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Go right ahead. I always did trust a good listening with the stethoscope. My father was a carpenter, you know. He always said being able to listen was more important than having the best tools. Though, he wasn't talking about hearts and lungs, of course!
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular, a bit slow at 68. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles noted. Oxygen saturation is 95% on room air, which is acceptable. Blood pressure is 138/82. Alright. That’s… unremarkable, thankfully. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying this daytime sleepiness?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I wouldn’t say I feel sick, exactly. But my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I'm 83, so that's not entirely surprising! Sometimes I have trouble finding the right word, like it’s on the tip of my tongue. And… occasionally, I feel a little bit irritable, though I try not to take it out on anyone. My daughter visits every Sunday, and I wouldn’t want to spoil that. She’s a saint, that one.
DOCTOR: Memory issues and mild irritability… common at your age, sir. It's unlikely to be directly related to your CPAP therapy, but we shouldn't rule anything out. Have you noticed any headaches, dizziness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No headaches, no dizziness. And my vision… well, I get my eyes checked every year, and the doctor says it’s just normal age-related decline. I wear bifocals, of course. Makes reading the newspaper a little tricky sometimes, but that’s the only real problem. I haven't noticed anything new with my vision, if that makes sense. It’s just…getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history and the lack of any acute symptoms, I suspect your CPAP settings may need adjustment. It's possible the pressure is insufficient, or there may be a small leak in your mask. I'm going to order a sleep study to re-evaluate your therapy. I’ll also prescribe a multivitamin; it won’t hurt.
PATIENT: A sleep study… alright. That sounds sensible. I don't mind going back for another night in the lab, if it helps. And a multivitamin… well, I suppose I haven’t been eating as well lately, so that’s probably a good idea. Though, I always preferred a good orange to any pill, if you don't mind me saying so. Will the study be at the same place as last time? I remember the technician being very kind.
DOCTOR: Yes, it will be at the same facility. I'll send the order to them electronically, and they'll contact you to schedule an appointment. The results will be sent to me, and we'll discuss them at your follow-up. We’ll also review your primary care physician's notes. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s… reassuring to know you’re looking into it. My daughter will be pleased, she worries about me. So, I just wait for them to call, then? And make sure they have my insurance information? It’s Medicare, just in case.
DOCTOR: Yes, just wait for their call. They will verify your insurance. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment in two weeks. If your sleepiness worsens significantly, or you experience any other concerning symptoms, please contact my office immediately. Otherwise, I will see you then. Have a good day, Mr. Paske.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate your help.
