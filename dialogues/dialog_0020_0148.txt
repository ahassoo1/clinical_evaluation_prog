DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, it’s… a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been having some pain… down there. In the… testicular region, you said? It’s just… not right. I haven't been feeling well, and it's concerning. I don’t quite remember when it started, honestly. Everything feels a bit… hazy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, “down there” pain… and you’re saying it’s in the testicular region. That’s… unusual for a female patient, but we’ll certainly explore that. You mentioned it’s been concerning you and you're having trouble remembering when it started. That's alright, we'll take it slow. Just tell me what it feels like – is it sharp, dull, constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, you’re right to question that. It is unusual, isn’t it? I… I apologize. I get confused sometimes. It's not a constant pain, no. More… achy, I suppose. And it comes and goes. Sometimes I don’t notice it at all, and then other times it’s… distracting. It's hard to describe. Not sharp, definitely not. Just… uncomfortable. Like a heavy feeling, maybe? Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Noelani. Thank you for trying to explain. "Achy" and "heavy" are good descriptions. And it comes and goes... okay. You mentioned you've been feeling generally unwell too. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to pinpoint. Just… tired, mostly. Very tired. And a bit… out of sorts, I suppose. Not my usual self. I've not been sleeping very well either. I wake up a lot during the night. And… I think I've lost some weight, but I’m not sure. I don't really pay much attention to those things these days. It all feels a bit… foggy, like I said before. Is this… serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, trouble sleeping, and possible weight loss… Those things can be associated with a number of things, so we'll need to investigate further. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. It’s certainly worth looking into. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. That’s… difficult. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course, but… I don’t remember specifics. I think I had… something with my blood pressure once, a long time ago? But I was treated for it, and I haven’t thought about it since. I'm on Medicare, if that helps. I don't have a regular doctor, not really. I mostly just go when something feels… wrong. Does that sound foolish? I apologize for being so unhelpful. It’s just… everything is a bit blurry, honestly.
DOCTOR: No, Noelani, that doesn’t sound foolish at all. It’s perfectly alright. Many people don't have a clear medical history readily available, and it’s common for things to be a little hazy over time. The fact that you’re on Medicare is helpful, and we can access some records through that. We’ll try to piece things together. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think… yes. A long time ago. When I was quite young, I had my tonsils removed. That’s all I can remember for certain. And… maybe an appendix? But I’m not sure. It was a very long time ago, and I wasn’t feeling well afterwards, so perhaps. Nothing recently, though. Definitely not. I really wish I could be more precise. It’s just… everything feels so distant. Is it alright if we just… skip this part? It's making my head hurt trying to remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, Noelani, that’s perfectly alright. We can definitely skip this part for now. It's more important that you're comfortable. We'll work with what you can recall. Let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Family… That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she had some problems with her heart, I think. Yes, heart problems. She was quite ill towards the end. And my father… he had diabetes, I believe. He was a very quiet man, and we didn't talk about health much. My siblings… I haven’t seen them in many years. I don't know about their health. We lost touch a long time ago. Is that helpful? I wish I could provide more details, but my memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Noelani. Knowing about the heart problems and diabetes in your family is important. And don't worry about not knowing details; we're working with what you have. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine at Christmas, if that. And certainly no… recreational drugs. Never. I’ve always been very careful about my health, or at least, I try to be. I’m a woodworker, as I mentioned before. It’s a… physical job, but I enjoy it. I mostly work alone in my workshop. It keeps me busy. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Noelani. The woodworking is relevant – a physical job is good, and it’s helpful to know what you do day-to-day. Now, one last set of questions, and then we can move on to a physical exam, if that's alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t believe so. I've never had a serious allergic reaction to anything, that I'm aware of. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was many years ago, and I haven't had it in a long time. No allergies to medications, no food allergies… I think. Is it alright if we just skip this part too? I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed, honestly. All these questions… my head is spinning. Perhaps we should just focus on the pain? Would that be alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Noelani, that’s perfectly alright. We can absolutely focus on the pain. It sounds like revisiting your history is a bit stressful, and we don't want to push you. Let’s move on to a physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to examine your abdomen and… we'll gently examine the area where you're experiencing pain. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s alright. As long as it’s gentle. I do feel a bit… vulnerable, but I understand it’s necessary. Please, take your time. And… if it becomes too uncomfortable, please let me know. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds that I can detect at this point. Your abdomen is soft, but there’s a little bit of tenderness in the lower right quadrant. And here… yes, there's definite tenderness when I press here. It doesn't feel like a sharp, acute pain, more like a dull ache. Is that consistent with what you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s exactly right. A dull ache. It's not a sudden, sharp pain, it's more… persistent. It's been like that for a while now. It's… uncomfortable, but not excruciating. Still, it’s nice to know you can feel it too. I sometimes worry I'm imagining things, given my memory… What does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? Could it be… something to do with my age? I’ve always been quite healthy, and I’m a bit worried about what this could be.
DOCTOR: It’s good that we were able to pinpoint the tenderness, and you’re absolutely right to want to get to the bottom of this. It's very important to get this checked out. Given your age and the location of the pain, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be muscular pain, perhaps related to your woodworking, but it's also important to rule out other potential causes. I think it would be best to order some blood work and a urine test. These tests can help us assess your overall health and rule out any infection or inflammation. I would also recommend an ultrasound of the area, just to get a clearer image of what’s going on. Does that sound alright to you, Noelani?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds alright. Blood work, urine test, ultrasound… whatever it takes to find out what’s going on. I understand. I just want to know what’s causing this pain, and I want to make sure it’s nothing serious. Will it be painful, Doctor? The ultrasound, I mean. And… when will I get the results? I hope it doesn’t take too long. I just… I don’t like feeling like this.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound itself isn’t painful at all, Noelani. It uses sound waves to create an image, so it’s completely non-invasive. You’ll lie on a table, and a technician will move a probe over the area. It might feel a little cool, but that’s all. As for the results, the blood work usually takes a day or two to come back, and the ultrasound results typically take a little longer, maybe three to five business days. We'll call you as soon as we have them, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms—fever, chills, nausea, vomiting—or if the pain becomes significantly worse, please don’t hesitate to call the office right away. I'm also going to write you a prescription for some mild pain reliever, just to help you manage the discomfort while we wait for the results. Is there anything else I can do for you right now, Noelani?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better. No pain, just a cool probe… I can handle that. And a pain reliever would be wonderful, thank you. I think… no, that’s all for now. Just please, let me know as soon as you know something. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. It’s hard to explain how worried I’ve been. Thank you. Very much. I suppose I should get going, then? Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. I’m glad I could help ease your worries a bit. For the blood work, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand, so no food or drinks except water. The lab will give you specific instructions when you go. As for the ultrasound, no special preparation is needed – you can eat and drink as normal. My nurse will come in shortly to give you the prescriptions and schedule the lab work and ultrasound. She will also have some written instructions for you. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. We’re here to help. Take care, Noelani. I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
