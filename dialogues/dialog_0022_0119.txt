DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, actually. I don’t usually… complain about things. But it’s been going on for a few days now, and it’s not getting any better. My… friend… has a bit of a problem, if you understand. A discharge, you see. It’s quite unsightly, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wartick. It sounds a little uncomfortable, and you're right to come in and get it checked out. There's absolutely no need to be embarrassed – these things happen, and it's my job to help. When you say “friend,” are you referring to a vaginal discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not me. Heavens, no. It’s… a gentleman friend. A… close friend. I’m simply here on his behalf. He’s rather… shy, you see. Doesn’t like doctors at all. And frankly, I don’t think he’d present himself very well. He asked me to come in and explain it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're here representing your friend. That's perfectly alright. So, to clarify, he is experiencing a discharge... and he’s asked you to gather information and present it to me?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. He’s quite distressed about it, you see. It’s… well, it’s not a pleasant sight, and he’s worried it’s… something serious. He's always been a… delicate fellow. Not a robust sort at all. And he doesn’t want everyone knowing about it, naturally. It’s… a private matter.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I completely understand the need for discretion. Everything we discuss will be kept confidential. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what's going on with your friend. Could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s… it's not clear, if you catch my meaning. It’s… yellowish, I suppose. And… a bit thick. Not watery, certainly. And there’s a… an odor. Not a good odor. It’s… rather pungent, if I’m being honest. He’s been trying to… keep things tidy, but it’s… difficult, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish, thick discharge with an odor… that’s helpful. Has he noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Well… he complained of a bit of… burning. Down there, you see. And… a slight ache. Nothing terribly severe, but he mentioned it. And… now that I think of it, he’s been going to the bathroom rather… frequently. Not a lot each time, mind you, just… more often than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, so burning, a slight ache, and increased urinary frequency. Has he had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever. He's not one for getting sick, you see. Very particular about his health, generally. And no chills, no. And no… abdominal pain, as you call it. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. He hasn't said anything about it. He’s not one for… dramatic displays, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has he had anything similar happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. He’s always been… very careful, you see. Very… discreet. This is quite out of the ordinary for him. He’s worried it might be… something unspeakable, if you understand. Something… contagious. That's why he's so hesitant to come in himself. He doesn’t want to… embarrass anyone.
DOCTOR: I understand his concerns completely, Ms. Wartick. It's good he's being cautious. Has he had any recent changes in sexual partners or new sexual activity?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness! Doctor, really! I… I don’t think that’s a question you should be asking me. I mean, I know he’s a… private man, but his personal life is… his business. I’m just here representing him, you see. I don’t know anything about… that. It's rather improper, don't you think?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to point that out, Ms. Wartick. My apologies – that was a clumsy question, and entirely inappropriate to ask you. I was attempting to gather information to rule out certain possibilities, but I should have phrased that differently. Please disregard that question. Let’s move on. Has he used any new soaps, lotions, or powders in the genital area recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… now that you mention it, he did start using a new shaving cream. A… fancy one, with aloe vera. He thought it would be… gentler on his skin. But perhaps it’s the culprit? He does have… sensitive skin, you see. Easily irritated.
DOCTOR: That's a useful piece of information, Ms. Wartick. New shaving cream and sensitive skin… that could certainly be contributing. To get a clearer picture, I would like to perform a physical examination. This will involve a visual inspection and possibly a swab for testing. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A… a physical examination? Well… he’s rather… modest, you see. And I’m not sure he’d approve. And frankly, I’m not a medical professional. I wouldn’t even know where to look! I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary, but I’m not sure he’d be… comfortable with a stranger… examining him.
DOCTOR: I understand his reluctance completely, Ms. Wartick. And you are right, a physical examination is ideal. However, without it, I would be limited in my ability to provide an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Perhaps we can consider a referral to a urologist?
PATIENT: A… a urologist? Oh dear. That sounds… terribly invasive. He’d absolutely hate that. Is there… nothing else we can do? Couldn’t you prescribe something? Some sort of… cream? Or ointment? He's quite good at following instructions, you see. As long as it doesn’t involve… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your willingness to explore options, Ms. Wartick. While I understand your friend's discomfort with a more thorough examination, prescribing medication without a clear diagnosis isn't ideal and could potentially worsen the condition. However, given his strong aversion to seeing a specialist and undergoing a physical exam, I can offer a cautious approach. I can prescribe a topical antibiotic cream to see if it provides some relief of symptoms. It's a broad-spectrum cream that may address a common cause of discharge, but it's important to understand that it's not a definitive solution. If his symptoms don't improve within a week, or if they worsen, it will be necessary to seek a proper diagnosis from a urologist. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Well… a cream sounds… manageable. Yes, that would be… preferable. As long as it’s not too… complicated to apply. He's not very good with… detailed instructions, you see. And a week seems… reasonable. If it doesn't work, well… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. But let’s try the cream first.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. We'll proceed with a topical antibiotic cream. I'm going to write a prescription for Mupirocin 2% ointment. Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily for seven days. Be sure he washes his hands thoroughly before and after application. I will also give you a handout with detailed instructions. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very understanding. I appreciate you not… pressing the matter of the examination. He’d be… quite upset if you had.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wartick. I'm glad I could help. Please encourage your friend to contact the clinic if his symptoms worsen or don't improve within a week. And remember, if he changes his mind about seeing a specialist, we are here to support him. Have a good day, and please give your friend my best wishes for a speedy recovery.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And… goodbye to you as well.
