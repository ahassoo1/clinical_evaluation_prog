DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… cough. Been coughin’. And… somethin’ in it. Red stuff. Not… not a lot, but it was there. I smoke, you know. Always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. A cough with some red… sputum, you mean?
PATIENT: Sputum? Is that… the stuff you cough up? Yeah, that’s it. Red stuff. Been happenin’ for… a little while now. Maybe a week? Hard to say, things kinda blend together these days. It’s mostly when I first wake up.
DOCTOR: Alright. A week of coughing, mostly in the mornings, with some red-tinged sputum. Okay. And has this cough been changing at all?
PATIENT: Changin’? Hmm… I dunno. Feels… the same, I guess. Just… more worried about the red. Never seen that before. Used to just be… regular cough stuff. You know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me see… I get outta breath quicker, maybe? When I’m doin’ things. Like… carryin’ stuff. Or walkin’ up the hill. But I’m old, so… That could just be gettin’ older. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Shortness of breath with exertion. And just to clarify, when you say exertion, is that only with physical activity, or are you noticing it at rest as well?
PATIENT: At rest? Nah, not really. Just when I do somethin’. Like… workin’ on the truck. Or gettin’ firewood. It ain’t… terrible. Just… notice it more now, I guess. I’m a power dispatcher, mostly sittin’ all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. Not that I noticed. Chills… sometimes cold, but that’s the AC. And weight loss… I ain’t been weighin’ myself. Eat okay, I think. Not much appetite sometimes, but… that's just gettin’ older too. Is this important? All this askin’? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Reyno, and I apologize if it feels like a lot of questions. It helps me understand what might be going on. Just trying to be thorough. Okay. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – anything you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doc told me somethin’ once, years ago. Put me on pills for a while, then I stopped takin’ ‘em. Felt better without ‘em. That's about it. Don’t think I got nothin’ else. Besides the usual old man stuff. Back aches and whatnot.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in the past, but not currently medicated. And no other medical conditions. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… Had my appendix out when I was a kid. And… I think I had somethin’ on my knee once, a long time ago. But it was just somethin’ small. Not much to remember, really. It’s been years. Lots of years.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendectomy as a child and a knee procedure, unspecified. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mom… she had… somethin’ with her lungs. Real bad cough towards the end. That’s about all I remember. My dad… he was a strong man, lived a long life. Didn't get sick much. We don't really talk about that stuff much in my family. It's… bad luck to dwell on things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lung problems in your mother, otherwise generally healthy family. And do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… No. Not really. Just… sometimes I take somethin’ for my back when it’s real bad. Can’t remember the name of it. It’s… a white pill. I get ‘em from the pharmacy. That's about it. Honestly, I try not to take nothin’ if I can help it. This is takin’ a long time. Is this gettin’ me anywhere?
DOCTOR: Okay. Occasional medication for back pain, unspecified. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or insect stings?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had no problems with nothin'. I eat everything. Bees sting me sometimes, but I don’t die. Regular stuff. I think. Can we get this over with? I gotta get back to work. Power don't dispatch itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. I understand your time is valuable. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… be quick about it. Don't want to be gone too long. Gotta keep the lights on.
DOCTOR: Okay. Deep breath in… and out. Again… Okay. And one more. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 90. And your lungs… I'm hearing some crackles, primarily in the lower lobes. Your throat looks a little irritated, but nothing remarkable. Let me check your EHR... Alright. Previous recordings show a consistently elevated blood pressure. And a chest X-ray from three years ago showed some mild scarring, consistent with past lung irritation. Mr. Reyno, given your cough, red sputum, shortness of breath, history of smoking, and these findings, I’m concerned about possible bronchitis or, less likely, something more serious. We need to investigate further. I recommend a chest X-ray and a sputum sample to rule out infection. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: X-ray again? And… spit in a cup? Sounds… unpleasant. Look, I ain’t been feelin’ great, but I ain’t fallin’ apart. Just a cough, right? Can't I just get somethin’ for the cough? Antibiotics or somethin'? I really gotta get back to work. This is holdin’ up the whole system.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about getting back to work, Mr. Reyno. However, simply prescribing antibiotics without knowing what’s causing the cough could be ineffective, and even harmful. The red sputum is concerning, and we need to rule out other possibilities, like pneumonia or, though less likely, something more serious. The X-ray and sputum sample will help us determine the best course of treatment. It's a quick X-ray, and the sputum sample is just a bit of mucus you cough up. It will take a few minutes. We have the lab right next door. We can get these results quickly, and then I can provide you with the proper treatment. If it’s just bronchitis, antibiotics might be the right answer, but we need to be sure. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Do the tests. Get it over with. Just… tell me how long it’s gonna take. And I need somethin' for this cough now, while we wait. Even if it’s just a cough syrup. Somethin’ to stop the hackin’. It's drivin' me crazy. Power don’t wait for nobody.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. I understand. Let’s get you set up for the X-ray and sputum sample. The radiology department is just down the hall, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes. While you’re waiting, I’ll write you a prescription for a cough suppressant with codeine to help manage the symptoms. It won't cure the underlying issue, but it should provide some relief. Okay, I'm prescribing you Tessalon Perles, 30mg twice a day. Please take it as directed, and do not exceed the recommended dosage. And remember, this is just to manage the cough while we determine the cause. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you set up with the orders for the X-ray and the lab. Once you've had those done, come back, and we’ll discuss the results. Do you have any questions before we get started?
