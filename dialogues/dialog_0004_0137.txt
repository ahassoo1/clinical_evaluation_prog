DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My… how you say… the place for old people? My husband and me, we want to go there. They need… paper from doctor, yes? To say I am okay.
DOCTOR: You’re referring to a nursing facility or assisted living?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Assisted… that is it! For help. We… we are getting old. It is hard to do everything now. My son, he say we need the paper.
DOCTOR: Right. A medical evaluation for admission. So, to be clear, you're requesting documentation to assess your suitability for assisted living. And your son suggested this?
PATIENT: Yes. He worries about us. He work so much, no time. He say the place… they check you, make sure you are… strong enough? Healthy enough? Something like that. Is good son.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of him. Alright. Well, let's go through some things to get a better picture of your current health. I’ll need to ask a lot of questions, and then I’ll do a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. Never had problem with… pills. Maybe a little sleepy sometimes, but not… allergy. My husband, he gets itchy when he eats shrimp, but not me.
DOCTOR: No known medication allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just… for my water. The doctor give me something for my knees. They hurt sometimes. Little white pill. And… sometimes I take something for sleep, when I can't sleep. But not every night. Is small, blue one.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, medication for your knees and something for sleep, as needed. Can you tell me the names of those medications, if you remember?
PATIENT: Hmm… the knees… I think… Meloxicam? Yes, Meloxicam. And the sleep… Oh dear. I forget. The little blue one. My son, he give it to me. He knows everything. I just take it when I need.
DOCTOR: It’s important that I have a complete list of everything you’re taking, Ms. Abdollahi. Do you mind if I check your medication list in our electronic health record system?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That is good. I forget so much now. Maybe you can see it on… the computer? That would be very helpful. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me pull up your file… Okay, here we are. It looks like you've been prescribed Meloxicam 15mg daily for osteoarthritis, and… ah, here it is. Trazodone 50mg as needed for insomnia. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! That is right. Trazodone. My son say it help me sleep. He is very good. I take one when I cannot rest. Sometimes two. Is that okay? I don't want to take too much.
DOCTOR: Two Trazodone is not routinely prescribed, Ms. Abdollahi. We need to discuss that. However, let’s get back to why you’re here today. Aside from needing the evaluation for assisted living, are you experiencing any specific health problems at the moment?
PATIENT: No, no big problems. Just… old. Knees hurt, sometimes. And I get tired. But that is normal, yes? I walk a little slow. And… my memory is not so good. But everything is okay. I eat, I sleep… mostly. I am just… getting old. It is hard work, this getting old.
DOCTOR: Well, aging is a process. But we still need to assess your overall functioning. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions in the past – things like heart disease, diabetes, stroke, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother, she had… the sugar. Diabetes, yes? I did not get it. I have good luck. And my husband, he had problems with his heart, long time ago. But me? No. I think I always been healthy. Just… the knees. And a little tired now. But not sick. No, never been really sick.
DOCTOR: No prior history of major medical illness reported. Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes. Long time ago. When I was young. I have… babies. Two babies. C-section. That is surgery, yes? And… I think I had my appendix out when I was a girl. But that was very long ago. I don’t remember much.
DOCTOR: C-section and appendectomy. Good. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any significant medical problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, dementia, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My father… he got sick with his brain. Old age, I think. He forgot things. My sister, she had… the cancer. Very sad. And my mother, she had the sugar, like I said. And my husband’s father, he had… problems with his heart. Is that enough? Everyone got something, yes? Everyone gets sick. Is normal. It is just… sad.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's… typical. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, before we move on to the physical exam, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, no smoking. Never liked it. And… sometimes a little wine with dinner. Just one glass. My husband, he likes a little beer. But not too much. And… no, no other things. I am a good woman. I go to church. We don't do bad things.
DOCTOR: Occasional wine consumption. Alright. Now, let's move on to the physical exam. I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen and neurological function. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, please? My knees hurt. And… I get nervous with doctors. Always have. Is okay. Do what you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Now your lungs… Deep breath in… and out… Lungs are clear, but breathing is a little shallow. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen… Soft, non-tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… feels funny, sometimes. Like… everything is loose. Old age, I think. Everything is getting loose.
DOCTOR: That’s… not uncommon. Alright. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function – your reflexes and balance. Please sit here and I’ll test your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished, but symmetrical. Now, I want you to stand up slowly… … and walk a few steps for me. Gait is slow and slightly unsteady. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, that concludes the physical exam. I’m going to order some routine blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. This will give us a more comprehensive picture.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work. Is that… painful? I don't like needles. But… if you need to do it, I will. Just… be quick, please?
DOCTOR: It’s a very quick pinch, Ms. Abdollahi. We’ll have a phlebotomist draw the blood. And it’s necessary to get a clearer picture of your health. I’ll review the results when they come back, and then we can discuss the evaluation for assisted living. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… will the paper let me go to the place? Is that what you mean? My son, he wants me to go. Is good place, he say. With… people to help. Is that what the paper is for? To let me go there?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Abdollahi. The documentation I’m preparing will assess your medical stability and suitability for assisted living. It will help the facility determine the level of care you require. Once I have the lab results, I’ll complete the evaluation and you can discuss it with your son and the facility. Now, if you’ll follow me to the front desk, they will schedule the blood work. We’ll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Okay. One step at a time. Yes. That is good. Thank you, Doctor. I will follow you.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. We’ll get everything sorted out. Could you schedule Ms. Abdollahi for a full blood panel, please?
