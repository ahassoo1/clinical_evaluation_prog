DOCTOR: Hi Stephane, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day. I woke up this morning and…well, I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face feels… droopy on that side. It's quite bothersome, really. I hope you can figure it out quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re concerned about the sudden hearing loss and facial drooping. That is concerning, and we’ll definitely get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. It’s good you came in right away. Just to clarify, which ear is the one that’s affected?
PATIENT: The left one. Definitely the left. It's not a guessing game, Doctor. It's quite obvious, isn't it? I noticed it immediately when I went to take my morning tea. Couldn’t hear a thing on that side.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Stephane, and I apologize if my question came across as insensitive. It’s just good practice to be thorough. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping on the left side is something we need to investigate seriously. To help me understand a little better, has this happened before?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. This is entirely new. I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life. And frankly, I don’t want to experience anything like this again. I’m a very healthy woman, or was until this morning. It's terribly inconvenient, you know. I have… obligations.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Stephane, and I want to assure you we’re taking this seriously. It’s good you’ve never experienced this before; that makes it even more important to figure out what’s going on. Okay, let’s talk a bit more about this morning. Besides the hearing loss and facial drooping, did you notice anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else? Let me think… I had a bit of a headache, perhaps. A dull ache, nothing terrible. And I felt a little… off, generally. Like I hadn’t slept well, even though I did. Honestly, it’s hard to pinpoint. I don't usually spend much time analyzing my body; I have better things to do. It all just happened so suddenly. Are we getting anywhere, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache and a general feeling of being unwell… that’s helpful. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t spend time analyzing your body, that’s very common! We're gathering information. Now, just to rule things out, have you experienced any dizziness, weakness in any other parts of your body, or any difficulty with speech or vision?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Weakness? No, I’m quite strong, actually. Vision is perfectly fine, thank you. And my speech is… as you can clearly hear, perfectly articulate. Honestly, Doctor, are you implying I’m losing my faculties? I find that rather… insulting. I expect a proper diagnosis, not a series of vague questions about my eyesight.
DOCTOR: Stephane, please don’t be offended. I am absolutely not implying anything of the sort. I apologize if my questions came across that way. I’m simply trying to gather all the necessary information to determine the cause of your symptoms, and rule out anything serious. It’s standard procedure. Okay, let’s move on. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? No. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I watch what I eat. Cholesterol? I haven’t had it checked in… well, a long time. Frankly, I don’t bother with those sorts of things. I’m a healthy woman, I told you. I eat well, I exercise when I can. It’s probably just… a bug. A temporary thing. Can we please move this along? I have appointments to keep.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, Stephane. We will move this along as quickly as possible. However, to be thorough, I do need to ask a few more questions. Have you experienced any recent illness – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I haven’t been sick in… years. I have a very strong immune system. I travel a lot, you know. Nigeria, mostly. It builds resistance. Honestly, I think this whole thing is… rather dramatic. It’s one ear, a little bit of drooping. It’s not like I’m paralyzed. Are we going to do any actual tests now, or are you just going to continue grilling me about my health history?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Stephane. We will do some tests. And I appreciate your patience. Before we proceed, I just need to quickly ask about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? None. Absolutely none. I prefer natural remedies, when necessary. I don’t believe in filling my body with chemicals. Honestly, Doctor, I'm quite particular about what goes into my system. Is that all? Can we finally get to the tests now? I'm losing valuable time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. That’s good to know. Alright, let's move on to a physical examination. I’m going to take a look in your ears, check your facial muscles, and do a brief neurological assessment. It won't take long. First, I’m going to take a look in your ears. This may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just let me know if you feel any sharp discomfort. I'll start with the right ear first, just to compare. Okay... the right ear looks normal. The left ear... there's some slight inflammation, but nothing significant. Now, I’m going to ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and close your eyes tightly.
