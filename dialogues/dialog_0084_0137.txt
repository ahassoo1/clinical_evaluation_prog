DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Is... is okay I sit? My back, she not so good standing long time. I come for... the place. For old people. My son, he say I need paper from you. For live there.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, please have a seat. I understand. Your son mentioned something about needing paperwork for a facility. So, you're looking for a medical evaluation to see if assisted living is appropriate for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that right. Assisted... he say good place. I want to be sure I can... do things. I still cook, you know? And clean. But sometimes... hard. Like remember everything. And the stairs... so many stairs! My son worry. He good boy. But he busy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're still so active. It's completely understandable that things are getting harder, and it's smart of your son to want to explore options. Okay, so we’ll do a quick check-up, just to get a good picture of how you’re doing. We'll talk about your overall health, any medications you're taking, and what a typical day looks like for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sound good. I take... a little pill for my water, you know? For the pressure. And sometimes... for the pain. In my hips. But not every day. Mostly when I walk too much. A typical day… hmm. I wake up, make coffee, feed the birds. Then I clean a little. Cook lunch. Watch the TV. Sometimes my daughter come visit. Is good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a medication for blood pressure, and something for hip pain as needed. That’s helpful. Do you know the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Names…? Oh dear. My son, he get them for me. I think... the water pill is white? And small? The pain one… is orange, maybe? I don’t remember the… the writing on the bottle. Is hard to see now, my eyes. I try to have my son tell me, but he work so much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s very common to forget medication names, especially if you have a lot of them. Don’t worry about it at all. We can look up the medications based on what they look like, if you’d like. Or, if you happen to have the bottles with you today, that would be even easier. And just to be sure, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No bottles, Doctor. My son have them. Allergies… hmm. No, I don’t think so. Never have I… I eat everything. Shellfish, nuts… everything. Sometimes my skin get itchy, but I think that from the sun. I live in Honduras a long time, very hot sun. But no… no allergies I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions like diabetes, heart problems, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm... the doctor in Honduras, he say my water pressure, she high. He give me the pill. And... my hips, she hurt a long time. He say arthritis, maybe. Old age, he say. I had the babies, two girls, a long time ago. Is normal, he say. No other… big problems. I not go to the doctor much. He come to my house, sometimes. In Honduras, they do that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, and arthritis in your hips. That’s helpful. Did you have any complications during your pregnancies?
PATIENT: No… no complications. Just… hard work. The babies good size. Two girls, very healthy. I breastfeed them long time. Everything normal. Just tired. Very, very tired. But normal. My mama, she have many babies, too. Is normal for women.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And what about any surgeries or hospital stays you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgery… hmm. When I was little girl, I fall from the tree. Broke my arm. They fix it. In the hospital for a little while. But that long time ago. After that… no. No surgeries. No hospital. I try to stay healthy. Eat good food, walk around. Not stay sick.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family…? My husband, he good man. We been married long time. My son, he work hard. Two daughters, they live far away. In America. I see them sometimes. Mama and papa… they gone now. Long time gone. My brother, he live in the city. We talk on the phone. Is… small family now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Has anyone in your family had any serious health problems, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mama, she get sick when she old. The doctor say... her mind, she forget things. A long time. She not remember who we were. Is sad. My papa, he have the heart problem. He sick a long time, too. But my brother and sisters… they healthy. Mostly. Just the normal things. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. So a history of dementia in your mother, and heart problems in your father. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor! No smoke. No drink. No… those things. Never. Is bad for you. My mama always say, “Stay away from those things.” And I listen to my mama. Is good advice. I drink coffee, that’s all. And sometimes tea.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that okay. You check me. I trust you, Doctor. Long as it not too long. My back, she get tired easy.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as I can. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 85. Your heart sounds regular, but a bit fast. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm just going to feel your pulse in your ankles and wrists. Pulses are a little weak, but present. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh… careful, Doctor. Is hard. My legs, they feel… weak. And my knees, they hurt. Is… not easy anymore. I used to walk everywhere, you know? But now… is hard.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Your walk is a little unsteady, and you're favoring your left knee. I’m just going to check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are a little diminished. Now, I’m just going to look in your ears and throat. Everything looks normal there. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Now, let’s talk about what all this means.
PATIENT: Okay… what it mean? Is bad? I need the place? For the old people? I want to stay in my house… if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Abdollahi. Your exam shows a few things. Your blood pressure is a little high, which we’ll want to keep an eye on. Your walk is unsteady, and you have some weakness in your legs, which is likely from the arthritis in your knees. Your reflexes are a little slow, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Overall, you're showing some signs of frailty, which is a normal part of aging. The question of whether you need assisted living depends on how much support you need with things like cooking, cleaning, bathing, and managing your medications. Do you have trouble with any of those things at home?
PATIENT: I… I can cook, mostly. Sometimes I forget things. Burn the food, maybe. Cleaning… is hard now. I do little bits at a time. Bathing… I can do it, but I need to sit down a lot. And the pills… my son, he help with the pills. He make sure I take them. I not so good remembering. Is… embarrassing. But I try. I really try.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s very common to have trouble with those things, especially as we get older. Based on what you're telling me, and the results of your exam, I think it would be a good idea to consider assisted living. It could provide you with the support you need to stay safe and healthy, and it would take some of the burden off your son. However, the final decision is up to you. I want you to think about it carefully, and talk to your son about it. We can also arrange for an occupational therapist to come to your home and assess your needs, which might help you make a decision. What do you think?
PATIENT: Occupational… therapist? He come to my house? And look at me? Oh dear… I not want nobody looking at me… like I old and broken. But… my son, he worry so much. And I… I do forget things. Maybe… maybe the place not so bad. If I have help with the pills… and the cooking… and if I don’t fall… Is… scary to think about. Leaving my house. Everything I know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Abdollahi. It is scary to think about leaving your home. And it's perfectly okay to feel hesitant. The occupational therapist isn't there to judge you, but to help you identify what tasks are difficult for you and recommend ways to make things easier. They can also suggest modifications to your home to make it safer, if you’d prefer to stay there. We don’t have to decide anything today. Let's start with the occupational therapy assessment. If it turns out that you can manage safely at home with some help, that’s great. If not, we can explore assisted living options together. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you with the occupational therapist?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. Occupational therapist… he come to my house. And look… and help. That sound good. Maybe… maybe that will help me decide. Thank you, Doctor. You… you very kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. I'll go ahead and schedule an appointment for you with an occupational therapist. They'll call you within the next few days to set up a time. Now, just to be safe, I’m going to give you a referral to a neurologist as well, just to rule out any underlying neurological issues that might be contributing to your memory problems. It’s probably nothing, but it’s always best to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Neurologist? Is… is that for the mind? You think my mind… bad? Oh dear… I just forget things sometimes. Like where I put my glasses.
DOCTOR: It’s just a precaution, Ms. Abdollahi. It doesn’t mean I think your mind is bad at all. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the nervous system, which includes the brain. It's just to rule out anything serious, like a vitamin deficiency or early signs of dementia. Most likely, it’s just normal age-related memory changes. But it's better to be safe, and we can get a clearer picture of what's going on. So, I’ll give you a referral to the neurologist, and you can schedule an appointment when you're ready. In the meantime, we’ll focus on the occupational therapy assessment. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, occupational therapist, then neurologist. So many doctors… But you think is good, I guess. I trust you, Doctor. I just want… I just want to be safe. And not fall. And not forget things. Is there… is there anything I need to do? Before the occupational therapist come? Like… clean the house? Or remember what pills I take?
DOCTOR: No, don't worry about cleaning the house! The occupational therapist just needs to see how you function in your normal environment. And don’t stress about remembering your pills. Just have a list of the medications you take, if you can. Or, if you have the bottles, that’s even better. Otherwise, just relax and be yourself. The occupational therapist will be asking you about your daily routine and what tasks you find difficult. They’ll also be looking at things like your balance and coordination. I’m going to print out these referrals for you, and I'll also give you a list of local assisted living facilities, just in case you want to start looking at your options. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s everything. You explain everything very well, Doctor. Thank you for… for being so kind. And patient. My son, he will be so happy to hear we have a plan. He worry so much. Thank you. Really, thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here for you. Take care of yourself, and have a good day. And give your son my best. .
PATIENT: .
