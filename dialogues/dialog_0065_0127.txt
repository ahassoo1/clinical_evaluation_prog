DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a little. It's been getting worse over the last few months, I think.
DOCTOR: "Generally weaker" is quite vague, Mr. Schaust. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Sorry. It’s… harder to do things, like carry groceries, or even just climb the stairs. Things that didn’t bother me before. And sometimes, my voice gets… quiet. Like it’s hard to project it. It's not all the time, but often enough that I've noticed. I’m a facilities manager, so I’m on my feet a lot, and it’s starting to… impact my work, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A facilities manager, you say. So, physically demanding work. And this weakness… is it in all your limbs, or is it more pronounced in certain areas?
PATIENT: It's… mostly in my arms and legs, I think. My hands feel weaker too, sometimes. It’s hard to say exactly, but it feels more noticeable when I’m using them – like when I’m lifting things, or gripping something. It's not painful, just… less strength. And it seems to get worse towards the end of the day. I find myself needing to rest more often.
DOCTOR: And how long ago did you first notice this progressive weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It started very gradually, so it’s hard to pinpoint. I’d say… maybe six or seven months ago? At first, I just thought I was tired, or stressed. But it hasn’t gone away, and it’s definitely getting worse, which is why I decided to come in. It’s just… concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, sometimes I feel a bit more short of breath than usual, especially when I exert myself. Not like, gasping for air, but I notice it. And… this might sound strange, but I’ve been seeing double sometimes, when I’m really tired. It doesn’t happen often, but it’s happened a few times in the last month or so. Does that… does that sound relevant?
DOCTOR: Double vision, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… it’s fleeting. Like, I’ll be looking at something, and for a moment everything seems… doubled. It goes away pretty quickly, usually within a few seconds, or if I close my eyes and open them again. It’s mostly at the end of the day, when I’m tired, like I mentioned. It’s a little unsettling, to be honest. I haven’t told anyone about it before today.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. I'm going to need to do a brief physical examination. I’ll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and a few other things. Then we'll discuss potential next steps. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any known allergies. I haven’t taken any medication regularly in years, to be honest. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing serious. I'm usually quite healthy. Or, was quite healthy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit here and I'll begin the examination. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we'll move on to some neurological tests. Blood pressure is 128/82, pulse is 76 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes, but don't move your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that alright? I'm trying to keep my head perfectly still. It's a little difficult, actually. I sometimes have trouble with… coordination.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. Now, I’d like you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. And please let me know if you feel any pain. Don't hesitate.
PATIENT: I’m squeezing as hard as I can, Doctor. It doesn’t… it doesn’t feel as strong as it used to. And, no, no pain. Just… weak. It’s a little… disconcerting. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is diminished bilaterally. Now, please sit back and let me assess your reflexes. I’m going to lightly tap your knees, and I want you to keep your legs relaxed.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Relaxed legs… Just let me know if it’s going to be… forceful, or anything. I’m a little nervous, to be honest. This is a bit more… involved than I expected.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are diminished. Now, I’d like you to stand up and walk for me, please. I want to observe your gait.
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It feels a little… awkward. I’m trying to walk normally, but it’s not easy. I seem to be… off balance.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust, please sit back down. Based on this brief examination, your symptoms and findings are concerning. We need to investigate this further. I suspect there may be a neurological component to your weakness. I'm going to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and a creatine kinase level. And, I'm going to recommend an MRI of your brain and spinal cord.
PATIENT: An MRI? Is that… serious, Doctor? What are you thinking it could be? I mean, I understand you need to investigate, but… an MRI sounds quite… drastic. And what does a creatine kinase level even mean? I’m starting to get quite anxious, to be honest. I’m divorced, and I don’t really have anyone to… help me through this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, I understand your anxiety. It's perfectly natural to be concerned. A creatine kinase level will help us determine if there's any muscle damage. And the MRI will allow us to visualize your brain and spinal cord, to look for any abnormalities that might be causing your symptoms. I'm not going to speculate on a definitive diagnosis at this stage, as that would be irresponsible. However, your symptoms – the progressive weakness, the double vision, the diminished reflexes – could indicate a number of possibilities, including myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, or a neuromuscular disorder. It is crucial that we determine the underlying cause to ensure you receive appropriate treatment. I'll also refer you to a neurologist for a formal evaluation and further testing. Do you have any questions about the tests or the referral?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… multiple sclerosis… those sound… frightening. So, more tests, and then a specialist. How long will this take, Doctor? And… will I be able to work? I’m a facilities manager, and if I can’t work… I don’t know what I’ll do. I haven’t got insurance, either. This is… a lot to take in. Could you explain the tests again, maybe, a little slower? And… what kind of costs am I looking at? I really appreciate you explaining everything, but I’m just… completely lost right now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, I understand your distress. It is a lot to process. Let’s go through this again. The blood tests are relatively straightforward – they will give us a baseline of your overall health and look for any signs of inflammation or muscle damage. The creatine kinase level specifically measures the amount of an enzyme released from damaged muscle tissue. An elevated level could indicate muscle breakdown. The MRI, however, is a more involved imaging study. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain and spinal cord. It's painless, but it requires you to lie still inside a scanner for about 30 to 60 minutes. Regarding costs, I’m afraid I can’t give you a precise figure, as it depends on the facility and your insurance status. As you are uninsured, the costs will be higher. I can, however, direct you to the hospital’s financial assistance department. They may be able to offer a payment plan or reduce your costs based on your income. As for your ability to work, that will depend on the results of the testing. Until we have a diagnosis, I can provide you with a temporary medical note excusing you from physically demanding tasks. But I strongly advise against operating heavy machinery or performing tasks that could put you at risk. I also recommend you avoid strenuous activity until we have a clearer understanding of your condition. Does that clarify things somewhat?
PATIENT: Okay… blood tests, MRI, financial assistance… temporary note. It’s… a lot. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you for explaining everything, and for the note. I’ll contact the financial assistance department as soon as I can. I suppose there’s nothing else to do but… wait for the tests. It’s just… scary, being alone with all this. But I appreciate your help. I think… I think I’m ready to go for now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schaust. I’ll have the lab requisition and a referral for the neurologist ready for you. The temporary note will be printed as well. Please schedule the MRI as soon as possible. And don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. I wish you all the best, and I’ll be in touch once the test results are available. Please take care of yourself.
