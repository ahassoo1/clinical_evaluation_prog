DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you’re 49 years of age. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, 49. I came in because… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It’s just… different than it used to be. I can't quite place it, and it’s worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: Different, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s not… bad, exactly. Just… not me. I always smelled… clean, you know? A little bit like soap, maybe. Now it’s… harder to describe. Almost… sweeter? And stronger, even after I shower. It started maybe a month ago, I think. I'm pretty good with remembering dates, usually.
DOCTOR: A change in body odor… right. And it’s been approximately one month, you believe. Now, has this change been consistent, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It’s been pretty consistent, actually. It’s not like it comes and goes. It’s there, all the time, after I wash. I’ve even tried different soaps, thinking that might be it, but no luck. And I’ve been using the same deodorant for years, the one with the aloe… nothing seems to make a difference.
DOCTOR: Different soaps, same deodorant… and consistently present for about a month. Hmm. Now, Ms. Purtee, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. Not really, not that I can pinpoint. My appetite’s been normal, I haven’t lost or gained any weight. I sleep okay, maybe a little restless sometimes, but nothing major. Oh! I did have a cold a couple of months back, but I got over it pretty quickly. No fever or anything lasting. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No weight changes, normal appetite, restless sleep… recent cold, resolved without complications. Alright. Now, I'm going to ask a slightly more personal question, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any unusual vaginal discharge or odor in addition to what you've described?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… well, yes, actually. Now that you mention it. I hadn’t really connected the two, but… yes. There is a bit of discharge, and it smells a little different too. Not awful, but definitely not normal. It’s… fishy, I guess? I’m so embarrassed to even say this. I just thought it was… a normal thing sometimes. I haven’t told anyone.
DOCTOR: A fishy odor, you say. And associated vaginal discharge. Right. Now, Ms. Purtee, do you have any new sexual partners, or has your partner had any new partners recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve been divorced for five years now, and I haven’t… well, I haven’t been with anyone. I just haven’t met anyone I connect with, and I haven't been actively looking, if that makes sense. So, no new partners for me, and definitely not for anyone I’ve been with. I hope that clarifies things. It’s… a little uncomfortable talking about all this.
DOCTOR: No new sexual partners. Very well. Now, Ms. Purtee, I’m going to need to conduct a brief pelvic exam to assess the vaginal discharge. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s… that’s fine. I understand. I just… what are you thinking it could be? Is it something serious? I’m a little worried now, to be honest. It’s just the changes are so… unexpected.
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say definitively without a proper examination. However, based on your symptoms—the altered body odor, the vaginal discharge with a fishy scent—bacterial vaginosis is a strong possibility. It’s a common infection, easily treatable with antibiotics. It's rarely serious, but left untreated, it can cause discomfort and potentially lead to other complications. Now, if you’ll just lie down on the examination table…
PATIENT: Okay. Antibiotics… that sounds… manageable. Alright. I’ll just… get comfortable here. Let me know if there’s anything I need to do. And thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything. It does make me feel a little better knowing it might just be something easily fixed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. This may feel slightly uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. Hmm… yes, the discharge is present, and appears somewhat grayish-white. There’s a distinct odor, as you described. No signs of inflammation or lesions at this time. I'll take a sample of the discharge for laboratory testing to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities. This will only take a moment. Alright, that's all. I’ll have the results back within a few days.
PATIENT: Okay, that wasn’t too bad. Thank you, Doctor. A few days, you said? And it does sound like bacterial vaginosis, so that’s… reassuring, I guess. What happens if it is that? Do I need to take anything special, or…? And is it… contagious? I'm probably asking a lot of questions, sorry.
DOCTOR: You are not asking too many questions, Ms. Purtee. It’s important to be informed. If the laboratory confirms bacterial vaginosis—which, given the examination findings, is highly probable—we’ll prescribe a course of antibiotics, typically metronidazole or clindamycin. It’s administered orally, and the course usually lasts for seven days. As for contagion… while it’s not a sexually transmitted infection in the traditional sense, it’s more of an imbalance of the natural bacteria in the vagina. Sexual activity can sometimes trigger it, but it’s not required for transmission. It's not something you can “catch” from a toilet seat, for example. We would recommend abstaining from sexual activity while you are undergoing treatment. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s very clear, thank you. Antibiotics for seven days, and no sexual activity during treatment. So, it’s not something I did wrong, then? Just… a natural imbalance? That’s a relief. I was starting to worry I’d… I don’t know, done something to cause it. It's good to know it's not my fault, so to speak. And I appreciate you explaining it so thoroughly, even if it’s a little… awkward to talk about. I think that’s all my questions, for now. Unless… is there anything I need to do to prevent it from happening again, after the treatment? Like certain soaps to avoid, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Prevention… yes. While there’s no foolproof method, maintaining a healthy vaginal flora is key. Avoid douching, as it disrupts the natural balance. Use mild, unscented soaps for external cleansing only. Cotton underwear is preferable. And avoid overly tight-fitting clothing. As for specific soaps to avoid… generally, anything with harsh chemicals or fragrances. It’s a matter of common sense, really. I'll send the lab order to the front desk. They will contact you when your results are available, typically within three to five business days. In the meantime, I'll write a prescription for metronidazole, to be filled at your pharmacy of choice. Do you have any further questions before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate your patience. Metronidazole, no douching, mild soap, cotton underwear… I think I can manage that. Thank you again. I’ll let you get back to your other patients.
DOCTOR: Very well. The front desk will assist you with scheduling a follow-up appointment if necessary. Have a good day, Ms. Purtee.
