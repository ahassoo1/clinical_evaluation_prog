DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Helaina. Honestly? It’s…a bit embarrassing to talk about, but a friend mentioned I should look into something to help stay safe, you know? She said it was a daily pill. Something about preventing…well, you know. HIV. I don't really understand all the details, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask.
DOCTOR: Helaina, please, don't feel embarrassed at all. It's very responsible of you to be proactive about your health, and it's absolutely not something to be ashamed of. Your friend is likely referring to PrEP – Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. It’s a daily medication that can significantly reduce the risk of contracting HIV. It's excellent that you're asking questions. Let’s talk through what it is, whether it might be right for you, and address any concerns you have. First, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Well, I’m 55, as you can see. I work as a parking attendant, so I’m on my feet a lot, which keeps me moving. I have Medicare, thankfully. No big health problems, really. A little arthritis in my knees, but that’s about it. I’ve never been tested for…anything like that, if that matters. Not HIV, not STDs, nothing. Does that sound bad? I mostly keep to myself, haven't been with anyone regularly for a long time, so I just...never thought about it, honestly.
DOCTOR: No, Helaina, that doesn’t sound bad at all. It's very common for people to not have regular screenings if they haven’t been sexually active recently or with multiple partners. And it’s excellent that you’re thinking about it now. Okay, so you mentioned some arthritis. Are you currently taking anything for that?
PATIENT: Just over-the-counter stuff when it flares up, you know? Ibuprofen mostly. Sometimes a cream. Nothing prescribed. Look, Doctor, is this something I need if I haven't…been intimate with anyone in a while? I just don’t want to take pills if I don’t have to, if that makes sense. And are there any side effects? I always worry about those.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Helaina. It’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of any medication. PrEP isn’t necessarily something everyone needs, but it’s an excellent option for reducing risk if there’s any possibility of exposure to HIV. Even infrequent exposure. To help me understand if PrEP might be right for you, let's talk a little more about your sexual history. When you say you haven’t been intimate with anyone regularly, could you clarify that a bit?
PATIENT: Okay. Well… it’s been…over ten years, honestly. Not since my divorce. I had a few…dates, here and there, but nothing serious, nothing…protected, if that makes sense. I just...didn’t think about asking. And with everything going on in the world, I just…stopped. It’s embarrassing to admit, but I haven’t really been with anyone since then. So, I guess…no recent partners. And truthfully, I’m not actively looking for any. But, you know, you never know. Does that make sense? I feel silly even talking about this.
DOCTOR: Helaina, please don’t feel silly at all. You've been very open and honest, and that's exactly what I need to help you make the best decision for your health. It takes courage to talk about these things, and I appreciate you sharing. Given your history, PrEP could still be a good option to consider, especially if you are considering becoming sexually active again. Even a single exposure carries risk, and PrEP offers a high level of protection. Before we go further, let’s do a quick review of your medical history, just to make sure there aren’t any contraindications. Have you ever been diagnosed with any kidney or liver problems?
PATIENT: No, never. My doctor always said I was as healthy as a horse, except for the knees, of course. I’ve had the usual things – colds, flu, a broken wrist when I was a kid, but nothing major. No surgeries, no serious illnesses. I get a yearly check-up with my family doctor, but he just checks my blood pressure and cholesterol, mostly. He hasn’t really asked about…well, this sort of thing. Is there anything else you need to know? I just want to get this sorted out quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Helaina. It sounds like you're generally in good health, which is excellent. We'll want to do some blood work to confirm that you're a good candidate for PrEP, just to check your kidney function and rule out any existing HIV infection. It's standard procedure. Now, before we move on to the blood work, let’s talk about how PrEP works and what to expect if you decide to start it. It’s a daily pill, as your friend mentioned, and it works by preventing HIV from establishing an infection if you're exposed. It's very effective, but it doesn't protect against other sexually transmitted infections, so safe sex practices are still important. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything the doctor has given me. My mother was allergic to penicillin, but that's not me. Honestly, Doctor, all of this sounds…a bit complicated. A daily pill, blood tests… I just wanted something simple. Is there anything else I can do to stay safe besides taking a pill every day? Maybe a shot or something? I’m not good with remembering things, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Helaina. It can feel overwhelming at first, and you're right to ask about simpler options. There is another option now – an injectable form of PrEP that's given every two months. It's called Apretude, and it’s a long-acting injectable. It’s given by a healthcare professional, so you don't have to remember a daily pill. However, it does require a bit more commitment upfront with the initial injections and follow-up appointments. There are also some specific requirements to qualify for it, and it's not suitable for everyone. Before we decide which option might be best for you, I think it's important to do the blood work to rule out any existing HIV infection and check your kidney function. It will also give us a baseline to monitor your health if you do decide to start PrEP or Apretude. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…better. A shot every two months is definitely easier than a pill every day. Okay, let’s do the blood work. Where do I go? And how long does it take to get the results? I have a parking lot to run, you know. I can’t be gone all day. And…will it hurt? I hate needles. I really appreciate you explaining all this to me, Doctor. It's a lot to take in, but you’re making it easier.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. I’m glad I can help. We’ll do the blood work right here in the clinic. It's a standard blood draw, just a few vials of blood. I'll write you a lab order, and the nurse will come in and draw the blood for you. It will take about 15-20 minutes, including the wait time. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine if you’re a good candidate for Apretude or PrEP. As for the needle… it’s a quick pinch, and most people don’t find it very painful. The nurse is very skilled, and we can use a numbing cream if you’re particularly anxious. Let me write that lab order for you now. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Just…getting the results and hopefully getting the shot sounds good. Thank you again, Doctor Asami. You’ve been very kind. I’m glad I came. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. I'm glad you came as well. I’ll have the nurse come in right away to draw your blood. It's a good first step, and we'll take it one step at a time. Just try to relax, and let me know if you have any questions or concerns while the nurse is taking your blood.
