DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I’m Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s this…patchiness, really. On my skin. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, a bit unsightly. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it hasn't gotten any better on its own. It's not painful, thankfully, but it's…noticeable.
DOCTOR: Hm, patchiness… alright. And where exactly are you noticing this patchiness?
PATIENT: On my arms, mostly. Both of them. It’s…hard to describe. It’s not a rash, exactly. More like…faded areas. Like someone took a very weak eraser to my skin. It’s more prominent when I’ve been…out in the sun, I suppose. Though I always use a good sunblock, you understand. A very good one. SPF 50.
DOCTOR: Right, faded areas…more noticeable with sun exposure, even with sunscreen. Okay. And has this happened before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, never. And I’ve had…good skin, generally. My grandmother always said it was the sour cream. Though I suspect it's more genetics, frankly. But no, this is entirely new. I certainly haven’t been doing anything different – same routine for years, you know. Same soaps, same lotions…everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no history of this before. Let's take a look. If you don't mind, could you please roll up your sleeves for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though I must say, I find it rather odd. It’s not as if I’ve been neglecting my skin. It’s a very moisturizing lotion, you know. There. You can see it's not…red or inflamed. Just…pale. Patches of pale. It’s quite subtle, really. Unless you’re looking for it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. Areas of hypopigmentation…loss of pigment. Not raised, no scaling… appears fairly symmetrical, though. I'm noting some mild dryness overall. Let me palpate… no nodules or anything concerning. Have you been experiencing any itching, burning, or any other sensations associated with these areas?
PATIENT: Oh, no itching. Absolutely not. And no burning, either. It’s just…there. Visually unpleasant, that's all. Honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing. I usually have such a…composed appearance. And now this. It's not like I’ve been ill, or stressed, or anything of the sort. I keep a very regular schedule, you understand. Everything is quite…orderly.
DOCTOR: No associated symptoms… Alright. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I'm quite careful about what I put in my body, and on it, you understand. No reactions to anything, ever. Though my husband gets a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s him, not me. I eat a very balanced diet, mostly Ukrainian cuisine, of course. Fresh ingredients, everything homemade. No processed foods. It's likely not internal, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Right. No allergies. And you mentioned a regular schedule… any recent travel?
PATIENT: Travel? Oh, no. Not recently. We went to visit my sister in Philadelphia last autumn, but that was months ago. And we didn't go near the beach. Just…city things. Museums, restaurants… perfectly normal. We haven’t left the state since. It's just…this appeared out of nowhere. Honestly, Doctor, it’s quite baffling. I’ve never had anything like it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent travel. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Only my blood pressure pills. A very low dose, the doctor prescribed it after my annual check-up last year. And a daily multivitamin. Nothing fancy, just a standard one. And sometimes, if I’m feeling a bit…under the weather, I’ll take a vitamin C supplement. But that’s it. Absolutely nothing else. I believe in a natural approach to health, you understand. Avoiding unnecessary things.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure medication, multivitamin, occasional vitamin C. Okay. Do you have any family history of skin conditions?
PATIENT: Skin conditions… hm. My aunt, on my mother’s side, had eczema when she was a child, but she outgrew it, I believe. And my grandfather had…something on his hands, years ago. The doctor said it was a type of dermatitis, but it wasn't contagious, thankfully. Nothing…serious, really. No one in the family has ever had anything like this, though. It’s all rather perplexing, isn’t it? A healthy lifestyle, good genes… and this.
DOCTOR: Alright, some family history of eczema and dermatitis. Okay. Let me document all of this… . Ms. Bartock, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it could be a few things. It’s presenting like post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, meaning it could be a reaction to something—even something minor—that caused a slight inflammation and then left these lighter patches. Or, it could be pityriasis alba, a common skin condition, often seen in younger individuals, though it can present later in life. It's not usually serious. However, to be certain, I'd like to order a potassium hydroxide prep to rule out any fungal infection, and a skin biopsy to get a definitive diagnosis. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: KOH prep and…a biopsy? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds rather…excessive. A biopsy? Is that absolutely necessary? It sounds rather…invasive. And fungal infection? I assure you, I keep a very clean home. I don't believe that’s the issue. Couldn't it just be…a temporary reaction to something? Perhaps the sunscreen itself? A new soap? I mean, surely we can try a different approach before resorting to…cutting into my skin. I’m not particularly fond of unnecessary procedures, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Bartock. And I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it was prudent. While it could be a reaction to something simple, we need to rule out other possibilities. The KOH prep is a very simple test, just scraping a small sample of skin to look for fungus under a microscope. It’s not invasive at all. As for the biopsy, it's a very small sample of skin that is sent to a lab for analysis. It will give us a definite answer, and it's the only way to be completely certain of the diagnosis. It’s a quick procedure, usually done with a local anesthetic, so you won't feel any pain. However, if you’re strongly opposed to the biopsy at this time, we can try a course of topical corticosteroids—a mild cream to reduce any inflammation—and monitor the situation for a few weeks. But, please understand that without a definitive diagnosis, we’re just treating symptoms, and there’s a chance it could be something else. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Topical corticosteroids… that sounds…more reasonable. A cream, yes. That I can accept. I truly don't see the need for cutting into my skin. I’ve never had a problem with skin before, and I highly doubt it's anything serious. Perhaps a simple cream will resolve it. And we can monitor, as you say. But I would like you to document my strong objection to the biopsy. I don't want it on my record as something I willingly agreed to. It’s simply…unnecessary, in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. I've documented your objection to the biopsy in your chart. We'll proceed with a course of topical corticosteroids, a mild potency cream. I'm prescribing hydrocortisone 1% cream to be applied twice daily to the affected areas for two weeks. Here is the prescription. It’s important to apply it as directed. If you don't see any improvement within two weeks, or if the condition worsens, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can reconsider the biopsy. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hydrocortisone… twice daily. Very well. No, I don’t think so. I appreciate you…accommodating my concerns. I simply prefer to avoid unnecessary interventions, you understand. Hopefully, this cream will resolve the issue. And if it doesn't, well, we can discuss it further then. Thank you, Doctor. I believe that is all.
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: Very well, Ms. Bartock. You're welcome. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
