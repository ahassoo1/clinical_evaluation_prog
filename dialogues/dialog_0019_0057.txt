DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well… it’s about the cancer. I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Cancer… right. Just to be clear, and to help me understand everything, were you recently diagnosed with cancer somewhere else, and you’re here for a second opinion, or is this something… new?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… it was diagnosed a little while ago, I think. I’m not very good with dates. And… my husband, he… he handled a lot of the appointments and stuff. He passed a few months back. So I’m trying to figure things out on my own now. It’s… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's… a tremendous amount to deal with on top of everything else. It’s perfectly alright if dates are difficult right now. We’ll take things slow. Do you remember where the cancer was diagnosed, or what kind it was?
PATIENT: I… think it was in my breast? That's what the doctors kept saying, at least. And… something about stage two? I really don't remember much about the stages, though. It all felt very fast. And a lot of… numbers.
DOCTOR: Okay, breast cancer, possibly stage two. That gives us a starting point. Just to confirm, were you receiving treatment for this – chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes. I had… surgery, I think. And… pills. Lots of pills. And… something with a machine. It wasn't very comfortable. I went a few times a week. I’m so sorry, I just… I can’t seem to remember the names of everything. It was all so scary.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Chellsea. Don't apologize at all. It’s perfectly normal to have trouble remembering details when you’ve been through a lot. Surgery and pills… and radiation, most likely, given the machine. We’ll try to piece things together. Do you happen to know if they did any scans – like a CT scan or an MRI – to see if the cancer had spread anywhere else?
PATIENT: I… I think so. They did a scan of my bones, I remember that part. It hurt to lie still for so long. And… something of my chest? They said it was to see if it went to my lungs. But I don’t know what the results were. My husband always explained everything to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, bone scan and a chest scan. That’s helpful. And you’re right to ask about the results. It’s important to know what those showed. Do you have any records from your previous doctors that we could take a look at?
PATIENT: I… I think there might be some at the hospital? But I don't know how to get them. My husband always took care of all the paperwork. I haven't really… been back to the hospital since… well, since he passed. I'm not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chellsea. We can definitely help you get those records. Our office has a medical records release form – I’ll have one of the nurses bring you that. And we can even help you contact the hospital directly if you’d like. Don't worry about a thing. In the meantime, could you tell me about any symptoms you're experiencing right now?
PATIENT: Well… I’ve been feeling very tired. Just… exhausted all the time. And my appetite isn’t very good. I don’t really feel like eating much. And… sometimes I have a little pain in my chest, but it comes and goes. It’s not too bad, usually. But it worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue, decreased appetite, and intermittent chest pain. We'll want to take a listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being patient with me. It’s just… everything feels so overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. It is overwhelming, and you’re doing a very brave thing by coming in today. Let’s just take one step at a time. Okay… your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, but nothing concerning right now. I’m listening to your lungs now… take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling, which is good. Your heart sounds regular. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your chest… to check for any tenderness or lumps. Let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s fine. Ouch… that’s a little sore. Right there. It’s not… sharp, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Tenderness in that area. It’s not a large lump, but there is some sensitivity there. And it seems to be more pronounced when I press on it… Do you feel any swelling or warmth in that area?
PATIENT: No, not really. It just… hurts. And it feels… different than it used to. Like… tighter. That's the best way I can explain it.
DOCTOR: Okay, “tighter.” I appreciate you describing it that way. I’m just going to check your lymph nodes now… under your armpits… take a deep breath… Good. Do you feel any lumps or tenderness here?
PATIENT: No… not that I can feel. It doesn't hurt when you press there. Just… tired. Everything just feels… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no tenderness in the lymph nodes, which is good. Now, I'm just going to take a quick look at your throat… open wide for me, please… Say "ahhh…"
PATIENT: Ahhh… It feels a little dry back there. I haven’t been drinking much water lately. Not really thirsty, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little dryness, that's not uncommon. It's important to stay hydrated, especially when you're not feeling well. Alright, Chellsea, I’ve completed the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. The tenderness in your chest, combined with the fatigue and decreased appetite, warrants some additional testing.
PATIENT: Okay… what kind of testing? I’m a little scared, to be honest. What are you thinking? I really don’t want to go through a lot more… everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, and I want to assure you that we’ll take things at your pace. We'll start with some basic blood work to check your overall health and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. We’ll also want to get a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and see if we can determine the cause of the tenderness. And… it would be helpful to get a copy of your previous medical records so we can compare results and get a complete picture of your treatment history. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay… blood work and an X-ray. And the records… I think that’s okay. As long as it’s not too much… everything feels so overwhelming, like you said. Can the blood work tell if the cancer is… back? That’s what I’m most scared of.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Chellsea. The blood work can help us look for certain markers that might indicate the cancer has returned, but it’s not always definitive. It’s just one piece of the puzzle. The X-ray will give us a clearer image of your lungs, and comparing that to your previous scans, along with your medical records, will give us a much better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll also need to discuss your previous treatment plan in detail, to see if there were any specific side effects or long-term risks we need to consider. I want to be upfront and honest with you – it’s impossible to say definitively right now whether the cancer has returned, but we’re going to do everything we can to get you answers and develop a plan that’s right for you. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I mean, I’m still scared, but… I guess I’m ready to get it over with. When can I get the blood work done? And the X-ray?
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. We can get the blood work done right here in the clinic today. I’ll have the nurse draw the samples now. And we can schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow morning, at the hospital. They’ll need your insurance information, of course, which we can get sorted out right now. While we wait for the results, I'll also have the nurse give you a referral form for a mammogram, just to get a baseline image of your breasts and ensure we have a complete picture. It's a standard precaution. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s fine. Mammogram, too. I just… I just want to know what’s going on. I can’t keep living like this, wondering all the time. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. And you're right to want answers. That's perfectly understandable. We'll work together, and we'll take things one step at a time. I'll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood and go over the paperwork for the X-ray and mammogram. And I'll be sure to review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, you're not alone in this. We're here to support you every step of the way. .
