DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling well, Ms. Dudney, and that’s good. However, high blood pressure is often a silent condition, meaning it doesn’t always present with noticeable symptoms, especially in the early stages. That’s why routine screenings are so important. The nurse flagged it because it was elevated, and we need to investigate further to ensure your long-term health. Could you tell me a bit more about when you were last told your blood pressure was checked, and what the reading was, if you recall?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't keep track of things like that. It was probably at my yearly physical, but I don't remember the number. My husband probably knows. He's always fussing about my health. It's irritating, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, that's alright. We can certainly look it up in your records. However, to get a clearer picture today, I’d like to take your blood pressure myself, and then we’ll discuss any necessary follow-up. Before I do that, have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath recently?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Look, is this going to take long? I have things to do, you know. My schedule is pretty full.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Dudney. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Taking your blood pressure will only take a few minutes. Then we can briefly discuss the results and determine if any further investigation is needed. Just relax your arm for me, please. It's important to be still during the reading. Have you had any caffeine today?
PATIENT: Just one cup of coffee, this morning. It was a long night. My husband was up sick and... well, it was rough. I needed it. Is that going to mess things up?
DOCTOR: It can slightly elevate your blood pressure, yes. We’ll keep that in mind. It’s best to avoid caffeine for at least 30 minutes before a reading, but we can still get a baseline today. Just breathe normally, please. Hmm. It’s elevated – 148 over 92. As I suspected. Now, I’d like to ask a few more questions to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes or kidney disease?
PATIENT: No. Never. And my family is healthy. Well, my immediate family, anyway. My mother's side... that's a different story. Look, is this number bad? Like, really bad? Because honestly, I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, Ms. Dudney. A reading of 148 over 92 is considered Stage 1 hypertension. While you may not be experiencing symptoms now, consistently elevated blood pressure puts you at increased risk for serious health problems down the line – heart disease, stroke, kidney failure… it's important to address it. And you mentioned your mother's side of the family. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: They have… issues. A lot of them. Heart problems, mostly. And diabetes. My aunt lost a foot last year because of it. My mother always said it was the genes. I try not to think about it. Honestly, it's depressing. But I eat healthy, I mostly… I try to stay active. It's just...life gets in the way. What are you going to do about it? Are you going to put me on pills? I really don't want to take pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about medication, Ms. Dudney. We don’t immediately jump to pills. However, ignoring this blood pressure reading won’t make it go away. First, I’d like to review your medical history more thoroughly. Have you ever had a cholesterol test?
PATIENT: I think so. At the yearly physical, like I said. My husband handles all that stuff, though. He's always on me about getting check-ups and… well, he’s a worrier. I honestly don't remember the numbers. I just know he said it was “okay.” Is this going to take much longer? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your frustration, but we need to gather more information. Relying on “okay” isn’t sufficient when we’re discussing your health. Let's try this. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These will give us a better baseline understanding of your overall health. Additionally, I'd like you to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week, twice daily – morning and evening. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No. My husband used to have one, but I haven't seen it in years. He probably put it away somewhere. Look, can't we just… wait and see? I feel fine, and I don't want to bother with tests and machines and… everything. Honestly, this is all just stressing me out. I need to get home and relax. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, with all due respect, “wait and see” is not a responsible approach to elevated blood pressure. It is a significant risk factor for serious cardiovascular events. We need data to make an informed decision about your health. I am going to write you a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor. It's a simple device, and it will allow you to track your readings accurately. I will also give you a log to record your numbers. I need you to bring that log back with you in one week. If you do not bring the log, I will be unable to continue providing care. Do you understand?
