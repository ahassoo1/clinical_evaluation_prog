DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac, good to see you. Or… good to meet you. I'm Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. My name is Lennie Tkac. I believe you have my chart here, but to be clear, I am here to get cleared for a senior living facility. I am hoping to move into one soon, and they requested a check-up first. A very sensible request, I think.
DOCTOR: Right, right… senior living. Sensible indeed. A lot of paperwork involved with those transitions, as I recall. Okay, so a general check-up for clearance… Let’s see… just to get a baseline, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I have been quite fortunate with my health, all things considered. I am a baker, you see. Always have been. Keeps me moving, though my hands aren't as steady as they once were. I do have private insurance, which I hope covers everything. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, quite some time, truthfully. Just the usual aches and pains for a man my age. Nothing serious, I assure you. I eat well, mostly. And I sleep soundly.
DOCTOR: Baker, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My family has been bakers for generations. We specialize in traditional Lakota breads and pastries, though I make a mean apple pie as well. I still enjoy it very much, even if I don't bake as much as I used to. It’s a good life, baking. A very good life. Do you… enjoy apple pie, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Can’t say I’m a bad company for a slice, no. Alright, Mr. Tkac… so, mostly good health, a bit of hand trouble… Any specific medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing specific that I know of. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything serious. I did have a bout of pneumonia when I was a young man, a long time ago. But I recovered fully. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, which is why I wear glasses, as you can see. But I don’t consider that a medical condition, more… a natural part of growing older. I do take a daily vitamin, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. I don't believe I have any allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. Though, thinking on it, I recall a slight rash once, many years ago, after eating some wild berries. But I wasn’t certain it was the berries. It could have been anything. I generally avoid taking medications unless absolutely necessary. I prefer natural remedies when possible.
DOCTOR: Okay… no known allergies. And you said a daily vitamin… do you recall the name of it?
PATIENT: Let me see… It's a multi-vitamin, Doctor. A standard one, really. I purchase it from the general store down the street. It's a brown bottle, with a blue label. I can't recall the specific brand name, I'm afraid. I just ask for “the senior multi-vitamin” and they always know what I mean. It has all the usual things in it - Vitamin D, B12, things like that. I take one tablet each morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Tkac, just to get a full picture, have there been any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: That's a fair question, Doctor. No, not really. My weight has been fairly stable, I think. I weigh about 170 pounds, give or take a few. Perhaps a little less in the winter, a little more in the summer. But nothing significant. I haven't been keeping strict track, but I would estimate around 170. I try to maintain a healthy weight, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any major medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That is a thoughtful question, Doctor. My mother lived to be a very old woman, nearly ninety years, she did. She was a strong woman, always busy. She did have some trouble with her joints in her later years, arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had a weak heart, I think. He passed away when I was still a young man. But other than that, not that I recall. My family has generally been a healthy lot, all things considered. We were outdoors people, always active.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything besides that bout of pneumonia when you were younger?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing else. No surgeries. No other hospital stays. Just the pneumonia when I was a young man, a long time ago. I’ve been fortunate to avoid those things. I’ve always taken good care of myself, I think. And I’ve always been careful. I’ve never been one to take unnecessary risks.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tkac, that’s very helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, take a look in your ears, and a quick check of your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Proceed as you see fit. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. … 138 over 82. Not bad, not bad at all. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. … Heart sounds regular, a slight murmur, but that’s common at your age. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. … Ears look clear. A little wax build-up, but nothing concerning. And finally, I’ll just check your reflexes. … Reflexes are a little slow, but within normal limits for your age.
PATIENT: That all sounds… satisfactory, Doctor. I am glad to hear everything is within normal limits. Though, I confess, I don't understand much of what you just said. "Murmur" sounds rather alarming, but you said it was common?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. A murmur is just a sound the heart makes, often due to blood flowing through it. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. As you get older, it's very common to develop a small murmur. It’s like a little whooshing sound. I didn’t hear anything concerning, just a very mild one. I wouldn’t worry about it at all. Now, just to be thorough, I'd like to order some basic bloodwork. Just to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function… routine stuff. And maybe a chest X-ray, just to get a good look at your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. A thorough check is always a good idea. Yes, I would be happy to have the bloodwork and the X-ray. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. For the bloodwork, you’ll need to fast for eight to twelve hours beforehand – no food or drinks, except water. And for the X-ray, just wear comfortable clothing, no metal zippers or jewelry. The lab and radiology department are right down the hall. The receptionist will give you the instructions. I'll have the results sent to me, and we can discuss them next week. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe I do. You have been very thorough and patient with my questions. I appreciate your kindness. I suppose I will head down the hall and arrange these tests, then. And I will await your call next week. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. The nurse will give you a summary of today’s visit as well. Have a good day.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor Gorga. I wish you a good day as well.
