DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it's this stool, Doctor. Black as night, it is. Been happening for… well, I don’t know exactly how long, truthfully. Probably a week? Longer? Doesn’t matter. I take those pain pills, you see. For my arthritis. Been on ‘em for years. It's probably that. Just wanted to get it checked, you know, just in case. Don’t have time for this, really.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Black stools, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, black stools. Like I said. Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? I’ve lived a long life. I know my body. It’s probably just the pills. They make everything… dark. Don't you think? Is there a quick test you can do? I have a garden party this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Well, we always need to investigate black stools, regardless of medication. It’s not something we dismiss. It can indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract. Now, are these stools consistently black, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Goodness gracious. I feel perfectly fine! A little achey, naturally, but that's the arthritis. Consistently black, I suppose. I haven't been paying that close attention, Doctor. It's… stool. Honestly. I just noticed it was different and thought I should get it looked at, even though I’m sure it’s nothing. Are you going to poke around in there? Because I’d really rather not.
DOCTOR: No, I'm not going to "poke around," as you put it. But I will need to examine you. I need to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll do a quick rectal exam to check for any… abnormalities, and to see if there’s any evidence of blood. It’s standard procedure. And frankly, dismissing it outright is… irresponsible. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Really, Doctor? At my age? I hardly think that's necessary. I told you, I feel fine. And “dismissing it”? I’m not the one being irresponsible, I’m the one trying to get this over with so I can get to my garden party! I’ve been taking these pills for years, and I’ve never had a problem. No other symptoms. No stomach pain, no vomiting, no… anything. Just the black stool. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. Is this going to be much longer?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Hatchard, I understand you’re frustrated. But I’m trying to be thorough. Black stool requires investigation. It’s not a matter of if you're feeling alright, it’s a matter of ruling things out. The exam will be quick, and it will help me determine if further testing is needed. We need to consider things like ulcers or even… something more serious. Now, if you'll just allow me to proceed... I'll need you to lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick, Doctor. Very quick. And don’t you go poking around unnecessarily. Honestly, the things they make you do these days… it’s ridiculous. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Hatchard. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Just relax and breathe normally. Now, I need you to bend over slightly… just a quick examination. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is most undignified. And cold! This table is absolutely freezing. Just get it over with. I have prize-winning roses to attend to, you know. Don't you have any younger patients to bother?
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything appears normal externally. However, I’m still concerned about the black stool. It could be something minor, but we need to rule out anything serious. I’m going to order a fecal occult blood test – that’s a test to check for hidden blood in your stool. And I’d also like to order a complete blood count, just to see your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. Hidden blood? I feel perfectly fine! And a complete blood count? What for? Look, I’ll take the stool test. Fine. But I’m not doing any more. I have a life, you know. And I really need to get going. Where do I… do this test? And how long will it take to get the results? I really don't have time for this prolonged nonsense.
DOCTOR: The lab will give you a kit for the fecal occult blood test. It involves collecting three small samples of stool at home. They’ll give you instructions on how to do it. As for the blood work, the results usually take about a week. Here’s the lab requisition. It’s located just down the hall. If the stool test is positive, or if your blood work shows anything concerning, we'll need to discuss further investigation – possibly a colonoscopy. Now, if you have any other questions… though frankly, I doubt you do. Are you all set?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Absolutely not! I will not be having a colonoscopy. This is preposterous. I'm perfectly healthy, and you're trying to scare me with these unnecessary procedures! Honestly, the medical profession these days… Fine. I’ll get the stool test. But that's it. No more. And I expect a call if everything’s “normal,” so I don't waste any more of my time. Now, if you’ll excuse me. I have roses to tend to. .
DOCTOR: Honestly. Some people… .
