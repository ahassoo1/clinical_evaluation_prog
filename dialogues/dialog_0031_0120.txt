DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't really do small talk. Just... I want to have a baby. And I want it to be easy, you know? No problems. My husband... well, he was a very healthy man, and I'm not exactly getting any younger. So, let’s just figure out what needs to be done, quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Villarreal. Planning for a family is important, and it's wise to be proactive. “Easy” is always the goal, isn't it?
PATIENT: Exactly! And honestly, I expect it to be. I take care of myself. I eat reasonably well, I exercise... it shouldn't be a thing. What kind of tests are we even talking about? I've got things to do today, so let's not drag this out.
DOCTOR: Certainly. To ensure the best possible outcome, we typically start with a comprehensive evaluation. For you, that would involve a medical history review – details about your past health, any surgeries, medications, allergies, and family history. We’ll also want to perform a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. Then, we’d order some blood tests to check hormone levels, assess your overall health, and screen for any potential infections or underlying conditions that could impact fertility. Does that sound reasonable as a starting point?
PATIENT: Ugh, a pelvic exam? Seriously? Look, I trust you're a professional, but... is that absolutely necessary right away? I mean, I'm not feeling sick or anything. And blood tests are fine, I guess. But the exam... feels a bit much. Can we maybe skip that for now? I really don't see the point if everything should be okay.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Villarreal. A pelvic exam allows me to assess the health of your reproductive organs – the uterus, cervix, and ovaries – and identify any potential issues that might not be apparent from a medical history alone. However, we can certainly discuss proceeding with the blood tests first, and revisit the exam if the initial results indicate a need for further investigation. Would that be a more comfortable approach for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be much better. Honestly, the less poking around, the happier I’ll be. Just… get the blood work done. What do I need to do? And how long is this going to take? I’ve got a lunch appointment I can’t miss.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll write an order for a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and some hormone level tests – specifically, FSH, LH, estradiol, and prolactin. The lab is just down the hall; the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes for the blood draw and processing. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. In the meantime, could you please tell me a little more about your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Ugh, my cycle? Really? Look, it’s... regular enough. Every month, it happens. I don’t keep a calendar, or anything. I just... know. When it's late, I know. Is that good enough? I don't understand why you need all these details. I’m a healthy woman, I told you! What exactly are you looking for? Honestly, this is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Ms. Villarreal. Knowing the typical length of your cycle and any changes you've noticed can help us assess whether you are ovulating regularly, which is crucial for conception. It doesn’t need to be precise, just a general idea. For example, approximately how many days does your cycle usually last, from the first day of one period to the first day of the next?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't know! About… 28 days, maybe? Give or take a few. Honestly, I'm terrible with dates and numbers. I just know when it arrives and when it leaves. And it's usually pretty… predictable. Can we just skip this and get the blood work done? I have a very busy life. I don't have time to sit here recounting my menstrual history. It’s embarrassing, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Villarreal, and I apologize if I'm making you feel pressured. We can proceed with the blood work as you wish. It's important to remember that these tests are simply gathering information to help us provide the best possible care. Before the nurse comes, could you briefly tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just my blood pressure medication – Lisinopril. And sometimes, I take ibuprofen for headaches. That’s it. I try to stay away from a lot of pills if I can. And honestly, that’s all. I’m a pretty healthy person, really. Can we please get this over with? I'm starting to get a headache just talking about this.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Lisinopril and occasional ibuprofen – noted. Okay, I will send the order to the lab now and the nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’s excellent and will make the process as quick and comfortable as possible. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions for me before I have Maria come in?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. And make sure they don’t poke around too much. Honestly, I’m not looking forward to this at all. Just… hurry up, please. I really have things to do. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Villarreal. I’ll let Maria know to be as efficient and gentle as possible. I’ll also note your preference to minimize discomfort. I’ll have her come in right away. Thank you for your patience. .
