DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Denis Minatra. I received some results back from a test… a test of my insides, I believe, and they weren’t quite right. They called it a GI Endo Test. I was hoping you could explain them to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Denis. A GI endoscopy – that sounds like you had a scope to look inside your digestive tract. I can definitely help with that. Let me pull up those results in your chart here. Alright, I see them now. To make sure I explain everything clearly, could you tell me a little more about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. For some time now, I’ve been experiencing… discomfort. Not pain, precisely, but a persistent feeling of… fullness, even when I haven’t eaten much. And occasionally, a bit of nausea. It's been going on for several months, perhaps six or eight. My previous doctor thought it best to investigate further, and that led to this endoscopy. It wasn't particularly pleasant, but I understood it was necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness even with limited food intake and some nausea for six to eight months. That definitely warrants investigation. And you're right, the endoscopy isn't the most fun procedure! Just to get a clearer picture, can you describe the nausea?
PATIENT: Certainly. It isn’t… constant. More like waves, really. It comes and goes. It’s usually in the mornings, before breakfast, and doesn’t last terribly long – perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes. It isn’t… violent, if you understand. No… forceful vomiting, just a feeling of being unwell. And it sometimes accompanies a bit of… a strange taste in my mouth. Difficult to describe… metallic, perhaps? Though not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent nausea, mostly in the mornings before breakfast, lasting 15-20 minutes, no vomiting, and sometimes a metallic taste in your mouth. That's helpful. Now, regarding the fullness… where exactly do you feel that?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to pinpoint precisely. It’s not a sharp, localized discomfort. More of a general sensation throughout my upper abdomen, if that makes sense. Right around here… …and sometimes, it seems to extend upwards a bit, towards my chest. It’s not painful, but it’s… unsettling. As if I’ve eaten a very large meal when I haven’t. It's very peculiar.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general fullness in your upper abdomen, sometimes extending upwards towards your chest, occurring even when you haven’t eaten much. And you’ve emphasized it’s not painful, just unsettling. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t believe so. I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I had a bout of… influenza, perhaps ten years ago, but nothing serious. I lost my husband, Samuel, three years ago. He had… complications with his heart. But as for myself, no chronic illnesses, no surgeries, no major injuries. I do take a daily vitamin supplement, just a standard multivitamin, and I try to maintain a healthy diet. I’ve always been a bit… petite, as you can see. . But other than that, I'm relatively healthy, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, a bout of the flu ten years ago, no chronic conditions, no surgeries, husband passed away three years ago due to heart complications, daily multivitamin, and you consider yourself petite. That’s all good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I have never experienced an allergic reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things throughout my life and taken various medications when necessary - painkillers for headaches, antibiotics when I've had a cold, that sort of thing - and never had a problem. I do have a bit of a sensitive stomach generally, but that’s just a lifelong tendency. Not an allergy, precisely. No, no allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That is a… difficult question. My family… we weren’t very good at keeping records. My parents are both deceased, and I didn't have a great deal of contact with my extended family. I know my mother’s side had… some instances of diabetes, I believe. But it was many generations ago, and I don't have specifics. My husband’s family, Samuel’s side, had a history of heart problems, which, sadly, is what took him. Beyond that… I honestly can’t say with any certainty. It’s a bit of a… blank, really. I apologize for not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Denis. Family history can be difficult to track, and it’s not always easy to come by. And finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I am… widowed, as I mentioned. Samuel and I lived a quiet life. He was a carpenter, a very skilled one, and I… I worked alongside him whenever possible, mostly with the bookkeeping and administrative tasks. We didn’t have any children. After his passing, I’ve kept myself occupied with… various hobbies. I enjoy gardening, reading… and metalwork, surprisingly. I create small sculptures and decorative pieces. It keeps my mind active. I don’t smoke, never have. I have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I’m not a heavy drinker. I live alone in my home, and I have a few close friends who I see from time to time. It's a… peaceful existence.
DOCTOR: Okay, widowed, quiet life, enjoyed gardening, reading, and metalwork, no smoking, occasional glass of wine, lives alone with close friends. That's good to know. Alright, Denis, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, let’s go back to those endoscopy results. What did the report say, specifically?
PATIENT: I confess, Doctor, I found the report quite… technical. It was full of… medical terms I didn’t understand. I believe the doctor who performed the test said there was some… inflammation. And something about… small nodules. He used the word “gastritis” as well, I think. He said further investigation was necessary, and that’s why I was referred to you. I have the report here, if you’d like to see it. I’m afraid I can’t decipher much of it myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here… you're right, there is evidence of some gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining. And you’re also correct about the small nodules. They are described as being… …scattered in the antrum. The doctor also noted some mild erythema, which is redness of the stomach lining. There’s no mention of bleeding or ulcers, which is good. Now, the question is… what’s causing this inflammation and what are these nodules?
PATIENT: That is precisely what I was hoping you could determine, Doctor. It is unsettling to feel unwell without knowing the cause. I have always been a healthy person, and this is quite… unusual for me. Is it something serious, in your opinion? Should I be concerned? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I am naturally a bit… anxious.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be anxious, Denis, and you're not at all asking too many questions. It's my job to address your concerns. Based on the report alone, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing this. Gastritis can have several causes, including infection with H. pylori bacteria, long-term use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen, or even stress. As for the nodules... they could be benign polyps, or they could require further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. First, I'd like to test for H. pylori – that's a simple stool test. Second, I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of anemia or infection. And finally, I think a biopsy of those nodules would be a good idea – that involves taking a small tissue sample during another endoscopy to see what they are composed of. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Yes, I believe that would be best. I want to know what is happening, and if these tests will give you a better understanding, then I am happy to proceed. A stool test… and a blood test… and another endoscopy… I understand. It’s a bit daunting, but I trust your judgment. Will the biopsy be… painful? And how long will it take to get the results back?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad you agree. The stool test and blood test are both very straightforward and shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. As for the biopsy... it's generally well-tolerated. You'll be sedated during the endoscopy, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. You might feel a little bit of pressure or discomfort afterwards, but that's usually mild and can be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. As for the results, it typically takes about a week to get the pathology report back from the biopsy. The stool test and blood test results should be available a bit sooner, within a few days. I'll give you the lab requisitions for the stool and blood tests now. And I’ll schedule you for another endoscopy with me as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting blood, or black, tarry stools – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve explained everything very clearly. A week for the pathology report… and I will be sedated during the procedure… and I will be alert if there are worsening symptoms… I understand. You've been very thorough and reassuring. Thank you. I will schedule the endoscopy as soon as possible. Perhaps we should discuss the cost of these tests? As you know, I am not insured, and I would like to be prepared for the expenses.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. I'm glad I could ease some of your concerns. That's a very important point, and I apologize for not bringing that up sooner. Let me check with our billing department to get an estimate of the costs for these tests. Okay, it looks like the stool test will be approximately $150, the blood test around $200, and the endoscopy with biopsy will be about $1800. That’s before any potential discounts. We do have a financial assistance program available, and our billing staff can help you determine if you qualify. They can also discuss payment plan options with you. Would you like me to have someone from billing come and speak with you now?
PATIENT: That… is a considerable amount of money. Eighteen hundred dollars… I had not anticipated such a high cost. . A financial assistance program… and a payment plan… Yes, please. I would be very grateful if someone from billing could speak with me. I would like to explore all available options. Perhaps we could also discuss the possibility of a less expensive alternative to the endoscopy, if that’s feasible? I understand the importance of accuracy, but… the cost is a significant concern.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Denis. That is a significant expense, and it’s perfectly reasonable to explore all available options. To be honest, given the need to accurately assess the cause of your symptoms, a full endoscopy with biopsy is really the gold standard. There aren’t really any less expensive alternatives that would provide the same level of information. However, we can discuss potentially phasing the tests. Perhaps we could start with the stool and blood tests and, depending on those results, re-evaluate the need for the endoscopy. That would allow you to spread out the costs. Let me call the billing department now and have them come speak with you. They’re very knowledgeable about our financial assistance programs and payment plans, and they can also discuss the possibility of a phased approach. “Hi, this is Dr. Auelua. I have a patient here, Denis Minatra, who would like to speak with someone about billing options… Yes, thank you.” They should be here in just a few minutes. In the meantime, is there anything else I can answer for you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything for now. Thank you for being so understanding and thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly, and for your willingness to explore different options. I will speak with the billing department and see what arrangements can be made. Hopefully, we can find a solution that works for everyone. I am… relieved to have finally taken steps towards getting to the bottom of this. Perhaps a glass of water before I speak with them? My mouth feels a bit dry.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could help. It's completely understandable to feel anxious in these situations, and I'm happy to work with you to find a solution. Absolutely, let me get you a glass of water. Here you go. Take your time, and don't hesitate to let me know if there's anything else I can do for you. I’ll be right here if you need me. .
