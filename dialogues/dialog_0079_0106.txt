DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s not a pleasure, exactly, being here, but… here I am. This foot of mine is just dreadful. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it’s not getting any better, despite my best efforts. A sore, really. A very nasty sore. And it hurts.
DOCTOR: Very well. A sore on your foot, has been present for several weeks. And it is painful, you say. Could you describe the sore to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Honestly, Doctor, it looks… awful. It's red, of course, and quite deep. And there's a ring of… well, it’s not clean looking around it. It's not neat, if you take my meaning. More… ragged. And it smells. I’ve been trying to keep it clean, believe me, but it just doesn’t seem to want to heal. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. I suppose you’ll want to look at it, eventually. But it's not a pretty sight, I assure you.
DOCTOR: A ragged, deep sore with redness and an unpleasant odour... located on the plantar aspect of your foot, near the heel. You’ve been attempting to keep it clean, but it is not responding to your efforts. Alright. I will certainly need to examine it, Ms. Cannington. Please, have a seat on the examination table and I’ll take a look. Before I do, have you noticed any pus or discharge from the sore?
PATIENT: Pus? Oh, yes. There is something coming out of it, Doctor. It’s… yellowish. Sometimes a bit brownish. And it stains my socks, naturally. I try to keep it covered, but it still… seeps out. Not a lot, but enough to be concerning, wouldn’t you say? I've never seen anything quite like it, and I’ve lived a long life, let me tell you. A very long life. It’s not a clean wound, that’s for certain.
DOCTOR: Yellowish to brownish discharge… not a clean wound. Hmm. And when did you first notice this discharge, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It started… around the same time the sore really started to bother me, I suppose. Maybe three, four weeks ago? It wasn't much at first, just a little dampness in my sock. But it’s gotten worse, gradually, over the weeks. As the sore got deeper, so did the… the leaking, I suppose you’d call it. It's quite unpleasant, frankly. I've tried all sorts of things, you know. Salves, bandages… nothing seems to stop it.
DOCTOR: Discharge present for approximately three to four weeks, coinciding with the worsening of the sore. Alright. Now, Ms. Cannington, I’m going to need to examine your foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can get a proper look?
PATIENT: Well, finally. I was wondering when you’d get to that. It's not exactly comfortable, you know. My ankles aren't what they used to be. Be careful now, it's a bit snug. Old age, you see. Everything swells. There. There you are. Don't say I didn't warn you. It’s not a pretty sight. And it does smell, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is… substantial. There is significant erythema surrounding the ulcer, and the base appears quite deep. There is purulent discharge, as you mentioned. The odor is also quite noticeable. I’m noting some surrounding edema as well. Ms. Cannington, this doesn't appear to be a simple wound. It’s likely infected. I’m going to need to obtain a culture to determine the specific type of bacteria causing the infection. We will also need to check your blood sugar levels, as diabetes can significantly impair wound healing and increase the risk of infection. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, diabetes. Well, that’s what my niece has been saying, you know. She’s a practical woman, my niece. Always fussing about my sweets. The doctor did mention something about it a few years back, something about “borderline,” but I don’t take a lot of notice of those things, frankly. I enjoy a little treat now and then. It keeps my spirits up. And I don’t see the harm in it. But yes, I suppose he did mention blood sugar. Always lecturing me. She says I need to watch it. But honestly, Doctor, at my age, what’s the point? Still, I suppose you’re the doctor. So, yes, “borderline” or something. What does it matter, really, as long as I’m still here? You'll have to speak up, dear. I didn't quite catch what you said about a “culture.”
DOCTOR: A “culture”, Ms. Cannington, is a test we perform on the discharge from the wound to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. Knowing the bacteria will help us choose the most effective antibiotic to treat it. And while you are correct that your age is a factor, controlling your blood sugar, if it is elevated, will significantly improve your chances of healing and prevent further complications. It's not about lecturing, it’s about providing you with the best possible care. Now, I’m going to draw some blood for a blood sugar test, and then we’ll collect a sample from the wound. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you insist. But don't expect miracles, Doctor. I've lived a long time, and these old bones don't heal like they used to. And I don't like needles, you know. Never have. But if it’s absolutely necessary… go ahead. But be quick about it. And don’t poke too hard. Honestly, at my age, a little poke can cause all sorts of trouble. Just get it over with. And don't expect me to be cheerful about it. Honestly. Blood tests and wound samples… it's all so undignified.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cannington. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. This will only take a moment. There. All done. Now, I’ll need to collect a sample from the wound itself. This may cause some discomfort, but I will be as careful as possible. And that’s all. Now, we’ll send these samples to the lab for analysis. It should take approximately 24 to 48 hours to get the results. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic to cover the most common types of bacteria. We will adjust the antibiotic based on the lab results. I'll also recommend a special dressing for the wound to help promote healing and prevent further infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Enough poking and prodding for one day. Honestly, I feel quite faint. A broad-spectrum whatsit… and a special dressing? It all sounds rather complicated. Just make sure it doesn’t hurt too much, and that it gets me home as soon as possible. And no lectures, please. I’ve had enough of those. What will I need to do? Will I have to come back? And what about my niece? She’ll want to know everything. Honestly, all this fuss over a little sore. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry, but… Just tell me what I need to do, and let’s get this over with. And, please, speak up. I can barely hear a thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. You’ll need to take this antibiotic – it’s called Amoxicillin-Clavulanate – twice daily for seven days. It’s very important to complete the full course, even if you start feeling better. As for the wound, I’m prescribing a special dressing called a hydrocolloid bandage. It will help keep the wound moist and protected. You’ll need to change it every 24 hours, following the instructions I’ve given you. And yes, you will need to come back in two to three days for a follow-up appointment. We’ll assess the wound and see how you’re responding to the antibiotic. I’ll also review the lab results at that time. As for your niece, I'm happy to discuss your care with her, with your permission, of course. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Amoxicillin-Clavulanate… Hydrocolloid… It’s all rather a mouthful, isn’t it? And seven days… Every 24 hours… Honestly, it’s more than I can keep track of. Will someone call me to remind me? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. And my niece… yes, she can come with me. She’s very practical, my niece. She’ll keep me on the straight and narrow. Very well. I suppose I have no choice. But don’t expect miracles, Doctor. I’m an old woman, and these old bones don’t heal easily. Just get me home, and let’s hope for the best. And please, speak slowly. I can barely hear a thing. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cannington. I’ll have a nurse call you tomorrow to confirm your appointment and remind you about the medication. And we will do our best. It’s good your niece will be joining you. She can certainly help. Here are the discharge instructions and the prescription. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of symptoms, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, or fever. I wish you a speedy recovery, Ms. Cannington. .
