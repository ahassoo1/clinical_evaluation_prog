DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes. Well, it's... the bathroom. I seem to be going quite a bit. More than I used to, that’s for sure. It's a bother, really. Wakes me up at night sometimes, and… well, a man needs his sleep, doesn't he?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. Increased frequency of urination can certainly be disruptive. Now, let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Could you describe a typical day for me, specifically regarding your fluid intake?
PATIENT: Fluid intake? Now there's a question. I drink… water, mostly. When I’m thirsty. And coffee, of course. A good, strong cup in the morning. My wife, bless her heart, makes it just the way I like it. Not fancy stuff, mind you, just… coffee. How much? I couldn't rightly say. A couple of mugs, maybe? It’s not like I’m counting, you know. A man doesn't need to measure his coffee.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Mr. Segretto. I simply need a general sense. And besides coffee and water, do you consume any other liquids throughout the day?
PATIENT: Other liquids… Hmm. Sometimes a little juice with supper. Orange juice, usually. Or tomato juice. My wife tries to get me to drink more of those fancy herbal teas… but they taste like weeds, if you ask me. Honestly, I stick to the basics. Nothing too… frivolous.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, regarding this increased frequency... has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… now that you mention it, I did start taking that new… whatchamacallit… for my knees. Dr. Henderson said it might help with the arthritis. Little blue pill, it is. Been taking it for… oh, maybe a month? Two? It’s hard to keep track, to be honest. Could be that, I suppose. Never know with these things.
DOCTOR: That is potentially relevant, Mr. Segretto. And thank you for mentioning that. Now, when you say "increased frequency," could you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Quantify? You want me to… count? Goodness. Well, before, I used to… go maybe three, four times a day? Now? It feels like every couple of hours. At least. And a couple of times during the night, like I said. It's a nuisance, truly. A man should sleep through the night.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Segretto. And quantifying is simply for my assessment. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Not like a sharp pain, anyway. It's… uncomfortable sometimes. A little bit of a sting, perhaps. But nothing I'd call painful. It's just… irritating. Like something's not quite right, you know?
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any difficulty starting urination, or any weakness in the stream?
PATIENT: Weakness? Hmm. Now that you mention it… yes, I suppose there is. Not a gushing stream like when I was a young man, of course. It’s… more of a trickle, these days. Takes a bit longer to get going, too. Have to… push a bit, sometimes. Not terribly uncomfortable, but noticeable. It's just… old age, I reckon. Things don't work like they used to.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, Mr. Segretto, have you noticed any changes in the color or odor of your urine?
PATIENT: Color or odor? Heavens. A man doesn't pay attention to such things! Honestly, I just… go. But now that you ask… I think it's a bit darker than usual. Maybe? It's hard to say. And as for odor… well, it smells like… urine. I don't know what you want me to say! It's not like I'm sniffing it, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. I simply need to gather as much information as possible. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Dr. Henderson, he's my regular doctor, he’s the one who keeps track of all that. I got… high blood pressure, I think? He puts me on pills for it. And my knees, of course, that arthritis is a real bother. Oh, and a bit of trouble with my cholesterol, he said. Something about… plaques? I don't rightly remember. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. A man gets old, things start to… overlap.
DOCTOR: I understand. And do you know what medications you are currently taking for these conditions?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me see. There’s the little white pill for my blood pressure… takes that every morning. And the blue one for my knees, like I said. And sometimes I take something for… indigestion? When I eat something rich, my wife always tells me to take one. A pink one, I believe. And… that’s about it, I think. I keep them in a little dish in the kitchen. My wife handles most of it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Segretto, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. My wife tries to get me to eat more vegetables, but… I’ve never had a problem with anything. A little bit of gas sometimes, but that’s just old age, I reckon. Nothing serious. Never been one for fancy foods or anything, so I haven't had much chance to be allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Segretto, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Specifically, I'd like to check your abdomen and perform a prostate exam. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A prostate exam? Goodness gracious. Now that’s a bit… personal, isn't it? I... I don't know. I've never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? I'm not a young man anymore, you know. Things aren’t as… flexible as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your hesitation. However, given your symptoms—increased frequency, nocturia, a weaker stream, and difficulty starting—a prostate exam is a standard part of assessing the cause of these issues. It allows me to evaluate the size and condition of your prostate, which can often contribute to these types of urinary problems. It is a necessary step in determining the appropriate course of action. We will, of course, maintain your privacy and dignity throughout the procedure. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, when you put it like that… I suppose. It is rather bothersome, this bathroom business. And if it’s necessary… I just wish doctors didn’t have to poke around in… well, you know. Is it… painful? My wife always says I’m a bit… tender in that area.
DOCTOR: It is rarely painful, Mr. Segretto, although it can be slightly uncomfortable. I will explain everything as I go, and we can stop at any time if you feel any significant discomfort. We will use a lubricant to minimize any sensation. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll just need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll provide a drape for your privacy.
PATIENT: Alright. Alright, I suppose. Just… try to be quick about it, will you? And, as I said, gentle now. A man doesn’t want to be… prodded around unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. Now, if you could just relax… I am checking your abdomen for any tenderness or abnormalities. I am now going to perform a digital rectal examination to assess your prostate. You may feel some pressure. The prostate feels mildly enlarged, and slightly firm. There are no acutely tender areas or suspicious nodules detected. Alright, Mr. Segretto, that concludes the examination. Please sit up when you are ready.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t pleasant. Not pleasant at all. Enlarged, you say? What does that mean? Is it… serious? I don't want any… you know, complicated procedures or anything. I just want to be able to sleep through the night.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, an enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is a very common condition in men as they age. It's rarely cancerous, and generally isn’t serious, though it can cause bothersome urinary symptoms like the ones you’ve been experiencing. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder. When it enlarges, it can compress the urethra and make it difficult to urinate completely. Based on the exam and your symptoms, I suspect this is the most likely cause. Now, we have several options for managing this, ranging from lifestyle modifications and medication to more advanced procedures. We won't jump to anything drastic right away. First, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. The urine analysis will check for infection or other abnormalities, and the PSA test will help us to rule out prostate cancer, though it is not a definitive test. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Goodness gracious. Seems like all you doctors do is poke and prod and draw blood. But… I suppose if it will rule out something serious… Alright. Alright, do the tests. But no more poking around, if you please. And please explain everything thoroughly. I don’t like surprises. Especially unpleasant ones.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I understand your apprehension. No more poking around for now, I assure you. I’ll order the urine analysis and PSA blood test. The lab technician will need to draw a small sample of your blood. It's a routine procedure. We'll also need a brief medical history from your primary care physician, Dr. Henderson, to have a complete picture. While we wait for the results – which typically take a few days – I recommend increasing your fluid intake during the day, but limiting fluids in the evening before bedtime. Also, avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate the bladder. We can also discuss some bladder training exercises, if you are interested. These can help improve bladder control. Would you like me to provide you with a handout explaining these exercises?
PATIENT: Handouts? Bladder training? It's all rather a lot to take in, isn't it? I suppose more information can't hurt. Alright, give me the handout. And just… try to keep it simple, will you? I don't want any fancy medical jargon. It’s just… a man wants a good night’s sleep, that’s all. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Segretto. It’s written in plain language, and outlines some basic exercises you can try. It explains how to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and gradually increase the amount of time between trips to the bathroom. These exercises can take time and effort, but many men find them helpful. I understand your frustration. It's perfectly reasonable to want a good night's sleep. We will work together to find a solution that works for you. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, pain, or blood in your urine, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it… for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it's… a lot to take in. I'll try the exercises. And I'll try not to drink too much coffee before bed. Hopefully, that will help. And if it doesn’t… well, I suppose we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. I’ll have the lab results sent to my office as soon as they become available. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they are in. In the meantime, take care of yourself, and try to get some rest. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again. .
