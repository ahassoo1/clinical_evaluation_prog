DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. My name is Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It feels…constant, if that makes sense. I eat, and not long after, I’m wanting more. And I'm drinking a lot more water than usual. I was hoping you could perhaps shed some light on it. I'd like to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Constant thirst and hunger, even after eating and drinking… that’s definitely something we should look into. When did you first start noticing this increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s difficult to say precisely. Perhaps… six weeks ago? It started gradually, a little more water with meals, then a slightly bigger portion of food at dinner. But it's been noticeably worse the last two weeks, I’d say. It's interfering with things, if I'm being honest. It’s… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks ago, gradually worsening, more noticeable in the last two weeks. Disruptive, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, disruptive. I find myself thinking about food and drink constantly. At work, it’s difficult to concentrate. And… well, my ex-wife and I share custody of our daughter, and I'm worried it’ll start affecting my ability to… be present, you understand? It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, but it is what it is. I just want to know why this is happening, and, if possible, what can be done about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Christen. It’s good you’re addressing this now. Thinking about food and drink constantly and impacting your concentration and family life is certainly concerning. Let's try to get a better picture of what might be going on. Besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. I've been going to the bathroom more often, certainly. Both, if you catch my meaning. And… I feel a bit more tired than usual, though I put that down to the general stress of everything, to be honest. No weight loss, if that’s what you’re asking. If anything, I'm maintaining my weight, despite eating more. I haven’t been feeling unwell, per se, just… off. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. Increased urination, fatigue, maintaining your weight despite increased appetite… Okay. Do you have any family history of diabetes, Christen?
PATIENT: Diabetes… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had it. She was diagnosed quite late in life, I believe. Perhaps in her seventies. My mother herself doesn’t have it, as far as I know. And I haven't heard of it being particularly prevalent on my father's side, no. Is that the sort of thing it is, inherited? I’m not very good with medical things, I confess.
DOCTOR: It can be, yes. Family history increases your risk. Okay, so a grandmother with a late-onset diagnosis. Let's talk about your general health. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was… decades ago. I’ve never been particularly ill, to be honest. I get the occasional cold, but nothing major. I don't take any regular medication, and I don't have any allergies. I'm generally quite fit and healthy, aside from this, obviously. I work on my feet a lot, so I’m reasonably active.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No other medical conditions, appendix removed as a child, no medications or allergies, reasonably active. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Never have, never will. I don’t approve of it, and my late father was quite insistent on that point. I do enjoy a pint or two at the pub with friends occasionally, but that’s about it. I wouldn’t say I drink heavily. A social drink, nothing more.
DOCTOR: Okay, just social drinking. And what about your diet generally?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… ideal, to be frank. It’s fairly standard fare, I suppose. I eat a lot of ready meals, to be honest. Work keeps me busy, and it’s just… convenient. I try to have some fruit and vegetables, but it’s not always easy. I wouldn't say I’m a particularly healthy eater, no. Plenty of carbohydrates, if that's what you mean. And I do enjoy a biscuit or two with my tea. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know, Christen. While not ideal, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the cause, but it’s good information. Okay, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. And I think we should run some blood tests. That will help us determine what might be going on and rule out or confirm some possibilities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly sensible. The quicker we figure this out, the better. Physical exam and blood tests… yes, go ahead. I'd prefer to get it sorted, if possible. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the blood tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I have work commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. No specific preparation for the blood tests, just try not to have a huge meal right before. Results typically take 24-48 hours, depending on the lab. I’ll have the nurse schedule those for you. Let’s start with a quick exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and I’d like to take a look at your feet. Blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your feet… Okay. Your feet look generally healthy, but I notice a slight loss of sensation here and here… …and your reflexes are a little slower than I’d expect. This could be consistent with early neuropathy, which is nerve damage. It's not definitive, of course, but it's something to note.
PATIENT: Neuropathy? That doesn’t sound pleasant. Is that… serious? And is that connected to the… everything else? The thirst, the hunger, the tiredness? I’m not very good with medical jargon, I’m afraid. Could you explain it to me in… simpler terms? And what are the next steps? I’d really appreciate a clear idea of what we’re dealing with here.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s break it down. Neuropathy simply means nerve damage. It can cause numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and hands. It’s not always serious, but it can be a sign of underlying conditions. Given your symptoms - the increased thirst and hunger, fatigue, slightly elevated blood pressure, and now the potential neuropathy - the most likely possibility is diabetes, specifically Type 2 diabetes. The high blood sugar levels over time can damage the nerves, causing the neuropathy. However, we need the blood tests to confirm this. They will measure your blood sugar levels, your HbA1c, which gives us an average blood sugar reading over the past few months, and check your kidney function. The next step is to get those blood tests done. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan, if needed. This might involve lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, and potentially medication. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Diabetes… That’s… not what I wanted to hear. My grandmother… so it could be hereditary, as I suspected. And lifestyle changes… I already work long hours. So, to be clear, you’re saying this isn’t confirmed yet. It’s just… a strong possibility. And if it is diabetes, it’s manageable? With diet and exercise and… medication, if necessary? Is it… something I’ve done? Or is it just… bad luck?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take it one step at a time. You’re right, it’s not confirmed yet. The blood tests will give us a definitive answer. And yes, Type 2 diabetes is generally manageable with lifestyle changes – a healthier diet, regular exercise, and sometimes medication. It’s not a death sentence, and many people live long, healthy lives with it. As for whether it's something you’ve done… it’s rarely a single cause. There’s a genetic component, as we discussed, so you may be predisposed to it. But lifestyle factors, like diet and exercise, can certainly play a role in developing it, and can also help manage it. It’s not about blame, it’s about taking control and making positive changes. I'm going to have the nurse draw blood now. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
