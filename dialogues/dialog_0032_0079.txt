DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, well, it’s my bruising. It’s just...worse lately. I’m on blood thinners, and normally a little bump is just a little bump, you know? But it's been feeling different. Like, bigger bruises from nothing, and they last longer. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Blood thinners, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Warfarin. Been on it for…oh, let me think…almost five years now. My doctor prescribed it after a blood clot in my leg. Everything was pretty stable, but like I said, these bruises are new-ish. I haven't changed anything with my medication or anything.
DOCTOR: And how often would you say you're experiencing these new bruises, Ms. Hainley?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s hard to say exactly…maybe…three or four times in the last month? Before that, it was maybe once every few months. Usually just on my arms or legs, from bumping into stuff. Now it feels like just existing is causing them. Honestly, it's a bit silly, but it's making me nervous. I don't wanna end up in hospital.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside these bruises?
PATIENT: No, not really. No dizziness or headaches, nothing like that. Just the bruising. And… maybe a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? It’s probably nothing. But I figured it was best to get it checked, just in case. I don’t want to mess around with blood thinners, you know? They’re…serious.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any bleeding from other areas?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No nosebleeds, no bleeding gums, nothing like that. Just the bruising. Everything else feels…normal, if that makes sense. I just keep looking at my arms and legs and thinking, "That shouldn't be there!" It’s a bit unsettling, honestly. I don’t think I’ve ever had bruising like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley. Let's perform a brief physical examination. I’d like to assess the bruising directly, as well as check your vital signs. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, and then I’ll take a look at your extremities. Please, if you would roll up your sleeves and pant legs a bit.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem. Here you go. Just let me know if you need me to move anything. I'm always a little worried about falling, so if I wobble, just catch me, okay? Not that I expect to, but…better safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, these bruises… yes, they are quite extensive, particularly on your lower extremities. And the discoloration does appear somewhat darker than I would typically expect. Any pain with palpation here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, a little bit there. Not terrible, just…sensitive. Like a really bad bruise should feel, I guess. It’s not like a sharp pain, just…tender. And yeah, they do look worse than usual, don't they? I noticed a couple on my stomach too, which is new. I definitely didn't bump into anything there! Oh, that one’s a bit sore.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. And are you noticing any warmth or redness around these bruises?
PATIENT: No, not that I've noticed. They just look…bruised. No heat, no swelling, nothing like that. Just purple and sore. It’s just… worrying, you know? I'm not a doctor, so I don't know what's normal and what's not. I just want to make sure it's nothing serious. Warfarin…it’s a scary drug if it’s not right.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley. Given the recent increase in bruising, the extent of the discoloration, and the fact that you are on warfarin, I think it is prudent to order some laboratory tests. We'll need a complete blood count, a prothrombin time to assess your warfarin levels, and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any other underlying issues. I also want to order a liver function test, as that can sometimes affect clotting.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. So, blood tests then? How long will that take? And do I need to fast or anything? I'm trying to get to a family thing later, and I don't want to mess that up. I hope it's not too complicated.
DOCTOR: Yes, blood tests. Fasting is required for 12 hours prior. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours. I'll have the lab technician draw the samples now. We will review the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid any activities that could lead to injury. And, if you experience any unusual bleeding – nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your stool – please go to the emergency room immediately.
PATIENT: Okay, 12 hours fasting. Got it. No injuries, and emergency room if there's bleeding. Right. That's… a lot to keep in mind. Hopefully it’s nothing serious, and I can just eat dinner with my family. Where do I go for the blood tests? Is it down the hall or…? I'm a bit directionally challenged, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, to your left. The lab technician is expecting you. They’ll provide instructions on the procedure. I'll contact you as soon as the results are available. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just… down the hall, fasting, no injuries, and call if it's bad. Okay, thank you, Doctor Pipkorn. I’ll go do the blood tests now. Hopefully it’s just a fluke. .
