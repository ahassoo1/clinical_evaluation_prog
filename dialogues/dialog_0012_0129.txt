DOCTOR: Hi Dawnetta, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get on with it. It’s my… well, it's my stool. It’s black. Like, really black. And I take those pills, you know, for my arthritis. The red ones. Been taking ‘em for years. It’s probably that. Is that what this is about? Just tell me if I need stronger ones or what.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're concerned about the black stool, and you’re wondering if it’s related to your arthritis medication. It’s good you’re bringing this up – it's always best to check these things out. You mentioned red pills for your arthritis – do you remember the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Why would I need to remember the name? I just take ‘em. They come in a bottle. Little red pills. The pharmacy sends them every month. Look, I'm not a pharmacist, am I? It’s probably ibuprofen or something. They’re all the same, aren't they? It’s the black stool that’s bothering me. Is it serious? Are you going to have to poke around? Because I really don't have time for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. It's common not to remember medication names. We can figure it out. I see here you’ve been prescribed naproxen 500mg for osteoarthritis. Is that the medication you mean?
PATIENT: Naproxen… yes, that sounds right. Everything sounds right, honestly. They all sound like chemicals to me. But yes, that’s it. Naproxen. Now, about this stool… is it the pills? Is it something serious? I don’t want to mess around with this. My husband would have a fit if I ended up in the hospital. He’s not good with… well, anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Naproxen can sometimes cause black stools, but it's not the only possibility. Black, tarry stools usually indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract – like the stomach or the beginning of the small intestine. It’s important to rule out other causes. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to ask you a few more questions. And then I’ll need to do a quick physical exam, including listening to your abdomen and checking for any signs of blood in your stool. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More questions? Fine, go ahead. But honestly, I take good care of myself. I eat my vegetables. Mostly. And I don’t drink… well, not much. Just a little wine with dinner. And poking around? Absolutely not. I told you, I don’t have time for that. Can’t you just… give me something? Something to make it stop? Or tell me it’s nothing? I really don’t want a scope or anything like that. My neighbor had one, and it sounded awful. Just tell me what I need to do. Pills, probably, right? More pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you I’ll do everything I can to figure this out with the least amount of disruption possible. We're not jumping to any conclusions about scopes right now. First, let’s get a little more information. Besides the black stool, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? It comes and goes, you know? That’s what stool does. Sometimes it's hard, sometimes it's soft. Sometimes it's… regular. Honestly, I don't sit around analyzing my… output. I just go to the bathroom and get it over with. I’m a busy woman. Are you writing all this down? It’s a waste of paper, if you ask me. Just tell me if it's the pills and if I need a different brand. Or a stronger dose. That’s all I want to know.
DOCTOR: I understand. I am writing everything down, just to be thorough. And you're right, stool consistency can vary. But I need to rule out anything serious. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, even a little bit?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Absolutely not! Are you implying I'm… bleeding internally? Goodness gracious. No, there’s no blood. I would know if there was blood. I'm not an idiot. It's just black. Like coffee grounds, my husband said. He noticed it too, which is rare. He doesn’t usually pay attention to… well, anything. But no blood. Definitely not. Now, can we please get this over with? What do I need to do? More pills? Less pills? A different kind of pill? Just tell me.
DOCTOR: Okay. I appreciate you telling me there’s no blood. It’s good you and your husband noticed the color change. Black, tarry stools, like you said, can be caused by something as simple as iron supplements or certain foods, but it can also be a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract. And because you’re taking naproxen, which can sometimes irritate the stomach lining, we need to be cautious. To be safe, I’d like to do a quick abdominal exam to listen for any unusual sounds and check for tenderness. It's a very simple exam. And I'd also like to order a stool test to check for hidden blood. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But quick. I mean it, Dr. Yoshino. I have things to do. And hidden blood? What does that even mean? You’re making me nervous now. My neighbor, the one who had the scope… she said they had to drink something awful beforehand. Is that what I'm going to have to do? Look, if it's going to be a lot of fuss, just give me a referral to a specialist. I’d rather deal with someone who knows all about… internal things. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. But you said quick exam, right? Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you we’re not jumping to anything drastic. The stool test is very simple – you’ll just collect a small sample at home and bring it in. No awful drinks involved, I promise. And if you prefer, I’m happy to give you a referral to a gastroenterologist right away. That’s completely your choice. But let's just do the quick abdominal exam first, and then we can discuss the stool test or a referral, whichever you prefer. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. It won’t take long, and it’s painless. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Quick, remember. I really don't like being poked and prodded. And don't expect me to be comfortable with this. I'm a busy woman, and this is a waste of my time. Just… get on with it. And tell me if you find anything awful, okay? Don’t beat around the bush. Just be direct. I can handle the truth. Mostly. But quick, please. Very quick.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just lie back on the exam table, and I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. I’ll also gently press on your belly to check for any tenderness. It will take just a few moments. Take some deep breaths for me, please. And let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. I'm not hearing any unusual sounds, and your abdomen feels soft. There's no tenderness to the touch. That’s a good sign. But we still need to rule out bleeding. Would you like me to order the stool test, or would you prefer a referral to a gastroenterologist?
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t as bad as I thought. Still a waste of time, if you ask me, but… okay. Look, just give me the test. I don’t want to go to another doctor if I don’t have to. And tell me exactly how to do it. I don't want to mess it up. And can I eat normally beforehand? I have a pot roast planned for tonight, and I'm not giving that up for some… stool sample. Just tell me what I need to do, and let me get out of here. I have a life, you know? A busy life.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can eat normally before the test. The instructions are pretty straightforward. The lab will give you a collection kit and detailed instructions. Basically, you'll collect a small sample of your stool in the container they provide, and then bring it to the lab within a certain timeframe. Here are the instructions and the requisition form. The lab is located at [Address of local lab]. They’re open from [Lab hours]. Do you have any questions about the instructions?
PATIENT: [Address of local lab]… hmmm. That's a bit of a drive. And [Lab hours]... Ugh. Fine. I'll figure it out. I always do. No. I think I understand. Collect stool. Bring to lab. Sounds… delightful. Is that everything? Can I go now? I really need to get home. My husband gets worried when I'm gone too long, and he's not very… resourceful. So, yes. Is that it? Can I go?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything for today. We’ll call you with the results of the stool test as soon as they’re available, usually within a few days. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope you enjoy your pot roast! Have a good day, Dawnetta. And please, don't worry too much. We're just being thorough.
PATIENT: Hmph. Thorough. That’s one way to put it. Alright. Fine. Goodbye. And I will be enjoying my pot roast. It's a family recipe. Waste of time, if you ask me. But better safe than sorry, I suppose. .
