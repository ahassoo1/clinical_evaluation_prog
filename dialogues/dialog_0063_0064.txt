DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, it’s my chest. It’s been… bothering me. Like a heavy feeling, sometimes. Not all the time, you understand? Mostly when I walk a little fast.
DOCTOR: “Bothering” is… vague. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Vague? Oh, yes, sorry. It’s… hard to explain. It's not really pain, pain like when I fall, no. It's more like… someone is sitting on my chest? A heavy weight. And sometimes, a little squeezing. Not so bad I stop, but enough to make me slow down. Does that make sense? I walk to the market, you see, and up the hill… that’s when I feel it.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this “heavy feeling” been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… maybe… three months now? It started slow, just a little tired feeling when I did a lot. But the last month, it’s been… more often. Especially with the hill. My husband, Ricardo, he says I'm walking too fast to get the best tomatoes! He likes a good tomato, that one. But I think it’s more than just walking fast.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this… discomfort?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me see. I do get a little… breathless sometimes, with the chest feeling. Not always, just when I’m really walking up the hill. And… oh! My arms, sometimes they feel a little… tingly. Just my left arm, usually. Not bad tingly, just… different. Like when you sit on your arm too long, maybe? I don’t know. Is that important?
DOCTOR: “Different” is not helpful, Ms. Chelberg. Tingling in the left arm could be significant. Now, let's move on. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the doctor told me a few years back my pressure was a little high. He gave me a little pill, a white one. I take it every morning. Ricardo reminds me! He's good at that. Cholesterol… I don’t know about that. I think the doctor checked it once, but I don’t remember what he said. Diabetes? No, no diabetes. I like sweet things, but the doctor always said my sugar was good. Is high blood pressure bad? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: The records indicate you were prescribed Lisinopril for hypertension approximately two years ago. And your cholesterol levels are… elevated. Now, have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, yes, that’s the one! See, I do remember some things. Elevated cholesterol… well, that explains why Ricardo keeps buying me so many apples! He thinks they're good for everything. Smoked? Oh, no, never. Not even once. My mother, she smoked a little when she was young, but I never liked the smell. It made me cough. I like fresh air, you see. And good coffee! But not with smoking. Never.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, regarding your family history… have any of your immediate family members – parents, siblings – experienced heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems… oh, that’s a good question. My mother, she had a very weak heart at the end. She was very old, though, almost ninety. The doctor said it was just old age. My father, he was strong as a bull! Never sick a day in his life, almost. He worked in the coffee fields until he was eighty. And my brother… he had some trouble with his legs, but not his heart, I don’t think. Mostly he just complained a lot! He liked to sit and talk, that one. Does complaining count as a heart problem? I always thought it was more a problem with his personality.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Please remove your jacket.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s a little warm in here, anyway. I hope my blood pressure isn't too high. Ricardo will be very worried if it is. He makes a lovely cup of chamomile tea when I’m stressed. It helps, you know.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is… elevated, 150/90. Heart sounds are… regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation. No edema noted. Now, I'm going to order an EKG and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your heart and lungs. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Chelberg.
PATIENT: An EKG? And a chest X-ray? Oh dear. Is something wrong, Doctor? Is it serious? The murmur… what does that mean? Ricardo is going to worry so much. He gets very anxious, you see. He always thinks the worst. Is it my walking? Is it the tomatoes?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, please. I’m not prepared to offer a diagnosis at this stage. A murmur simply indicates an abnormal sound during your heartbeat. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. The EKG and X-ray will provide more information. It’s a precautionary measure. Now, the nurse will take you to the radiology department. Please try to remain calm. Worrying won't help.
PATIENT: Oh. A precautionary measure. Yes, that sounds… better. But the hill… could it be the hill? Ricardo always says I push myself too hard. He worries about my breathing. Alright. The radiology department. I hope it doesn't take too long. And I hope they have a comfortable chair. My knees aren't what they used to be. Will the nurse tell me what to do? I don’t want to do anything wrong.
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain everything, Ms. Chelberg. Just follow her instructions. I will review the results as soon as they are available. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Oh. Alright then. Follow her instructions. Yes. .
