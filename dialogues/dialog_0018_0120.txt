DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doctor, it’s… well, it’s about having a baby. I want one. And I don’t want any… problems. My late husband and I, we always talked about it, but… things happen, right? I just want to make sure everything works before I get too far along, if you know what I mean. I'm not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Villarreal. It’s very wise to be proactive and ensure everything is optimal before trying to conceive, especially given your circumstances. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? Oh, goodness. Honestly, Doctor, I don't really keep track. They come and go. I think… regular-ish? Maybe? It’s been a while since I really paid attention, to be frank. After… well, never mind. Are you going to need exact dates? Because I definitely don’t have those. It's just… a bit embarrassing to talk about, really.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Villarreal. Many women don’t keep precise records, and it's completely understandable, especially given everything you’ve been through. We can certainly work with “regular-ish.” Roughly, how long do your cycles usually last – from the start of one period to the start of the next?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, this is why I didn't want to come. Numbers… I'm terrible with numbers. Okay, fine. I think around… four weeks? Maybe a little more? Sometimes they’re shorter, sometimes longer. It really varies. Look, Doctor, is this important? Can’t we just… do a test or something to see if everything is okay? I really don't want to sit here and try to remember old periods.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Villarreal. We absolutely can do some tests. Knowing the approximate length of your cycles is helpful, but not essential at this stage. Your concern is valid, and we’ll focus on what is most helpful right now. To start, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: No. Never. It… it wasn’t meant to be, I guess. It’s a long story. And frankly, a sad one. I don't really want to relive it. Let’s just say my late husband and I had… difficulties. That's why I'm here now, before it gets… complicated again. Can we skip this part? It's really upsetting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Villarreal. Absolutely. We can certainly skip that line of questioning. Your emotional wellbeing is my priority. We’ll proceed at your pace and focus on what you feel comfortable discussing. Let’s talk about your general health. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No. Well… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it's been fine since. The doctor put me on some pills, but I stopped taking them. Seemed to fix itself. And no, nothing else. I try to eat healthy – mostly. And I walk when I can. I'm not a sickly person, if that's what you're asking. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if I can have a baby without a lot of trouble.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear, Ms. Villarreal. It's helpful to know you generally feel healthy and active. "Generally healthy" is a good starting point. The previous blood pressure issue is noted; we may want to re-check that as a precaution. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a multivitamin, sometimes. And ibuprofen when my arthritis flares up. That's it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for taking a lot of pills. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. And really, that’s all. I don’t go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. This is already… a lot.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Villarreal. We'll keep things as minimal as possible. Multivitamins and ibuprofen are good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes with certain fabrics, but that's not an allergy, is it? Nothing serious. I ate shellfish my whole life without a problem, and I haven’t changed my laundry detergent recently. I’m pretty… durable, honestly. Can we just get to the tests now? I really don't want to spend the whole day here talking about my life.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Villarreal. We can absolutely move on to the tests. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to get to the practical aspects of things. Before we do, just one quick question regarding your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history… Honestly, Doctor, it’s a mess. My mother had… problems. She wasn’t a healthy woman. And my father… he just died of old age, as far as I know. Lots of early deaths, if that’s what you mean. It’s not something I really dwell on. I'm trying to break the cycle, if that makes sense. Can we please just skip this? It's depressing, and frankly, none of my business anymore. Let's just see if I'm healthy.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Villarreal. I understand completely. We can absolutely skip that line of questioning. Your feelings are paramount, and we will proceed at your pace. Alright, let’s move on to a physical exam and some initial tests. I'd like to check your blood pressure, weight, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'd like to order some blood work to assess your hormone levels and overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Finally. That sounds… good. Just get it over with, please. I have things to do, you know? And I'm not a fan of doctors poking and prodding. Quick and efficient, if you could. No need for a lot of small talk.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Villarreal. I understand. I will be as quick and efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this point. We’ll keep an eye on it. Your weight is 130 pounds. Height is noted as 164 centimeters. BMI is 24.1, which is within the normal range. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to order some blood work. This will help us get a clearer picture of your hormone levels and overall health. We’ll need to take a sample from your arm. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Quickly, please. I hate needles. And don't tell me how it's going to feel, I already know. Honestly, Doctor, you'd think they'd have invented a better way by now. Just… poke and prod, and let's be done with it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Villarreal. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I’m just going to insert the needle now. You may feel a brief pinch. Alright, that's all done. Please keep pressure on this site for a few minutes to prevent any bruising. The lab results should be available in a few days. Once I have them, I will contact you to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any excessive bleeding or discomfort, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. Can I go now? I really need to get home. Hopefully, this whole thing won’t be a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Villarreal. You are welcome to leave now. I will have the lab results sent to my office and will contact you as soon as they are available, likely within 3-5 business days. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you all the best. .
