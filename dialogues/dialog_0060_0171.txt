DOCTOR: Alright, Lacreasha, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. It's my nails, okay? They just...look weird. Not pretty at all. I don't know why they look like this, and frankly, I don't have time for this. I'm an audiologist, you know. Important work.
DOCTOR: Nails, alright. And you’re an audiologist, yes, I see that here. It’s…unusual to come to a family doctor for nail issues, but alright. Can you describe what "weird" means exactly?
PATIENT: Well, they're…discolored. Like, not a nice pink. More…yellowish? And kinda thick, I guess. I don't do manicures or anything, so it's not from polish. Honestly, I just noticed it a few weeks ago and it’s getting worse. I just want it fixed, you know? I don’t have time to explain every little detail.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discoloration and thickening. A few weeks, getting worse. Right. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with them?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little…sensitive, maybe, when I’m typing. But I type a lot. So it could just be my fingers. I don’t know. It’s not like, throbbing pain or anything. Just…annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any injuries to these nails recently?
PATIENT: Injuries? No! I'm careful. I work with…sound. Delicate work. I haven’t, like, slammed them in a door or anything. Honestly, I can't think of a reason why they'd be like this. Maybe it's just…age? I'm forty, you know. Things start falling apart.
DOCTOR: Forty is hardly “falling apart,” Lacreasha. But alright. Any family history of nail problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history? I don't do family history. My mom…she liked shiny things. That's all I really know. We weren’t close, okay? And I doubt she had weird nails. Probably just…normal mom stuff. I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… Oh! Just a little something for my…well, never mind. It's nothing important. It doesn’t affect my nails, I’m sure. And I don't really like talking about it, okay? It’s personal.
DOCTOR: Lacreasha, withholding information isn't helpful. Even seemingly "unimportant" medications can have side effects. I need a complete list to properly assess your condition. Is it anxiety medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It's…for my nerves, okay? I get a little…worked up sometimes. It's just a small dose. My sister told me about it. It’s not like, a big deal. And it’s definitely not affecting my nails. Honestly, you're making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at these nails then. Could you extend your hands, palms up, please?
PATIENT: Here. Just get it over with, okay? I have appointments. Important appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm seeing some thickening, discoloration – as you mentioned – and some slight crumbling. There appears to be some debris under several nails. It could be a fungal infection, which is quite common. However, given your mention of anxiety medication and the fact that you work with delicate instruments, we need to rule out other possibilities. Let's take a small scraping from under one of your nails to send to the lab for a fungal culture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A scraping? Like…you're going to dig under my nail? Oh, no. No, that sounds awful. Really awful. Can't you just…give me something for it? Like a cream or something? I don’t want anything taken from me. Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Lacreasha, I understand your reluctance, but a proper diagnosis requires a sample for testing. I cannot prescribe medication without knowing what we’re treating. It could be a fungus, it could be something else entirely. Applying a cream blindly could make things worse. It’s a very quick and relatively painless procedure. I use a sterile instrument, and it will allow us to determine the cause of your nail issue and get you the appropriate treatment. Are you willing to allow me to take a small scraping, or would you prefer a referral to a dermatologist?
PATIENT: A dermatologist? Ugh, more appointments. More waiting. No. Fine. Just...get it over with quickly, okay? And be gentle. I have important things to do. Don't want to mess up my hands. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's all done. Barely felt a thing, I presume?
PATIENT: It wasn't pleasant, okay? And don't tell me it barely felt a thing. I can feel everything. But…fine. It’s done. Now what? How long until I get…results? And what if it is a fungus? Do I have to take pills? I hate pills.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 1-2 weeks. We’ll contact you as soon as they’re available. If it is a fungus, treatment options include topical medication – a nail lacquer – and in some cases, oral antifungal medication. We'll discuss the best course of action based on the severity of the infection. In the meantime, keep your nails trimmed short and dry, and avoid excessive exposure to water. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Trimmed short? That's…not very professional looking, okay? I need to look presentable for my clients. And avoid water? I wash my hands! A lot! Honestly, this is just…a lot of trouble for some weird nails. Fine. No, I don’t think so. Just…call me when you have the results. And don't make me wait too long. .
DOCTOR: Alright. We will contact you as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, Lacreasha. .
