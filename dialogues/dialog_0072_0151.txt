DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I am Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tingling. It's mostly in my hands and feet, you see. It’s been going on for a little while now, and honestly, it's starting to bother me. I just want to know what’s causing it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Uzarski. Tingling in the hands and feet can be quite disruptive. “A little while now” is rather vague, though. Could you be more specific about when this tingling started?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right, I’m terrible with dates. Let me think… It started, oh, maybe… six, seven months ago? Around November, I think. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little… pins and needles, you know? But it’s gotten worse since then. Especially if I’m on my feet too long – which, being a mail carrier, is pretty much all the time.
DOCTOR: Six to seven months ago, around November. And it's exacerbated by prolonged standing, as is typical with your profession. Do you notice any particular time of day when it’s worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that you mention it… it is worse at the end of my route. My feet are just… achy and numb, and the tingling is much stronger then. Not so bad in the morning, usually. Though I do wake up with a little bit sometimes, now that I think about it. Not every day, but… more often than it used to.
DOCTOR: So, it’s present intermittently in the mornings, but significantly worse at the end of the workday. Does this tingling radiate anywhere – up your arms, for example, or higher up your legs?
PATIENT: No, thankfully it hasn’t gone up my arms or legs. It stays mostly in my hands and feet. Though… my hands do feel a bit clumsy sometimes. Like I’m dropping things more than usual. Is that related, do you think? I haven’t been able to hold onto things as well, especially small things. It’s worrying me, you know? I need my hands for work!
DOCTOR: Clumsiness is certainly something to note. It could very well be related, Ms. Uzarski. Now, let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… not exactly. It's not like I can't do things, but I get tired easier. Like, sorting the mail at the end of the day is much more of a struggle. My hands just feel… heavy, I guess. And sometimes my feet feel like they’re dragging a little. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a sudden weakness, it’s just… a feeling of being worn out faster. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Uzarski, thank you for clarifying. Fatigue and a sensation of heaviness are important details. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or temperature of your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Oh… you know, now that you ask… yes, actually. My hands get cold really easily. Colder than they used to, anyway. And sometimes my fingertips look a little… pale. Not always, but I’ve noticed it a few times, especially when it’s cold outside. My feet too, but I usually wear thick socks, so it’s harder to tell with them. Does that sound important? I don't want to bother you with silly things.
DOCTOR: It’s not “silly” at all, Ms. Uzarski, these are all pertinent observations. Cold hands and pale fingertips are quite telling. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid problems, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… let me think. No, not that I know of. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything serious. My husband, God rest his soul, he was the one with the health problems. High blood pressure, you know? I just… always felt pretty good, all my life. I haven't been to the doctor much, to be honest. I just turned 63, and I haven’t really needed to. Is that bad? I should probably have seen someone sooner, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: It’s not ideal, Ms. Uzarski, but we'll address things now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a surgery, not a hospital stay. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, climbing a tree, but that was it. Just a cast for a few weeks. Nothing serious, really. I’m a pretty sturdy woman, usually. This tingling is just… unsettling. I’m not used to feeling like this.
DOCTOR: No prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Alright. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – diabetes, heart disease, neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me see. My mother had arthritis, badly. She was always complaining about her joints. And my grandfather, on my father's side, he had… something with his heart, I think. He died when I was quite young, so I don't remember the details. Nothing else that I can think of, really. We weren't a family that talked much about health problems, to be honest. More about cooking and gardening, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. And do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a thing. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just a cup of chamomile tea before bed, if that counts. I always figured a good night’s sleep was better than any medicine. I just… I'm not used to needing anything. This is all very strange.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I haven't had any bad reactions to anything that I can remember. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. I’m starting to feel a little bit silly, Doctor. I'm just an old woman with a little bit of tingling. Is it something serious? I have to get back to work, you know. The mail doesn't deliver itself.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, while I appreciate your resilience, dismissing these symptoms would be unwise. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. Please extend your arms. I'm going to assess your muscle strength and reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright… if you think it’s necessary. But please be quick, Doctor. I really do have a route to finish. I don't want to keep my customers waiting. It’s just… I have a lot of responsibility.
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is slightly diminished bilaterally, and your reflexes are somewhat diminished in the lower extremities. Sensory function appears intact, but I will need to perform further testing. Your response to light touch is slightly delayed in your fingertips and toes. Now, let's take a look at your feet. Your feet are cool to the touch, and there is some mild pallor present. I'm also noting some diminished pulses in your dorsal pedis arteries bilaterally.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s cold. And… are you sure that’s normal? My feet always feel cold, but I just thought it was because I’m old. Is something… wrong? This doesn’t sound good, does it? I really need to get back to work, but… what are you thinking, Doctor? Is it my circulation? My husband used to have problems with his legs…
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, based on my examination, your symptoms and findings are concerning for Peripheral Artery Disease, or PAD, potentially compounded by a possible neuropathy. The diminished pulses, cool feet, pallor, and delayed sensory response are all indicative of reduced blood flow to your extremities. The diminished grip strength and neuropathy suggest nerve damage. However, further testing is required to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity. We need to rule out other potential causes as well. I am ordering a vascular ultrasound of your lower extremities and a comprehensive nerve conduction study. I will also order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to evaluate your overall health.
PATIENT: PAD… neuropathy… those sound like very serious things. My husband… he had a leg amputated, you know? Is that… is that what’s going to happen to me? Oh dear. I just… I need my legs for work. I need to deliver the mail. What does this mean? And… how long will it take to get these tests done? And will they… will they hurt? I don't do well with needles.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, please try to remain calm. While PAD can lead to serious complications, including amputation in severe cases, we are catching this early. With appropriate management, we can often prevent further progression and minimize your risk. The vascular ultrasound is non-invasive and painless; it simply uses sound waves to visualize blood flow in your arteries. The nerve conduction study involves small electrical impulses, which may cause a brief, mild discomfort – a tingling sensation, similar to what you've been experiencing. It is not a painful procedure, but it can be uncomfortable for some patients. The lab work will require a standard blood draw, which I understand you are apprehensive about. I can ask the phlebotomist to use a smaller needle and to be as gentle as possible. The results will likely take 2-3 business days to come back. In the meantime, I am prescribing you a low-dose aspirin to help improve blood flow. However, it’s crucial that you contact me immediately if you experience any chest pain, leg pain at rest, or changes in skin color or temperature. I will also need to refer you to a vascular specialist for further evaluation and potential treatment options, should the tests confirm my suspicions. It’s imperative that you adhere to these recommendations to safeguard your health and maintain your quality of life. Now, do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Aspirin… okay. And… a specialist? Oh dear. This is a lot to take in. Chest pain… leg pain at rest… I don’t even know what that feels like. I just want to go back to work. Will I… will I still be able to deliver the mail? Is that even possible? And… how much will all of this cost? I don’t have insurance, you know. I just… I don't know how I'm going to manage this. It’s just me now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, I understand your concerns. It’s natural to feel overwhelmed in this situation. Regarding your ability to continue your work, that will depend on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. We need to obtain the test results before making any definitive conclusions. As for the cost, I am aware you do not have insurance. I will have my staff assist you in exploring potential financial assistance programs and lower-cost options. There are several resources available, and we will do our best to navigate this with you. Regarding leg pain at rest, it typically presents as a sharp, burning pain in your toes or feet, even when you are not active. It is a sign of advanced disease, and we need to prevent it. I am also providing you with a handout outlining the signs and symptoms of PAD and the importance of foot care. It's crucial that you schedule the vascular ultrasound and nerve conduction study as soon as possible. My staff will assist you in scheduling those appointments. In the meantime, please avoid prolonged standing, elevate your legs when possible, and wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes. And most importantly, contact me immediately if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Do you have any other questions at this time, or would you like me to clarify anything?
