DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen. It's been bothering me. And, um, the nurse told me to mention I have a bit of an irregular heartbeat, she called it atrial… something. I get it checked regularly, but the leg is new.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Nixon. It sounds like we have a couple of things to discuss – the swelling in your left leg and your existing management of the irregular heartbeat, which you mentioned is atrial fibrillation. Let's focus on the leg swelling first. Can you tell me when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Right. Swelling is… concerning. Um, let me think. It started, I believe, about three days ago. I noticed it after a long day of standing while I was setting up computers for the new students. It didn't hurt much then, just felt… bigger, you see? It's gotten worse since then, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, it began approximately three days ago, following a prolonged period of standing. And it's progressively worsened since then. Is the swelling present in the entire leg, or is it localized to a specific area?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my lower leg, I think. From my knee down to my foot, really. My ankle is quite puffy, and it feels… tight. My calf is a bit swollen too, but not as bad as the ankle. It's not really up higher, towards my thigh. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Nixon. Thank you for clarifying. So, the swelling is predominantly in your lower leg, particularly around the ankle and calf, with less involvement higher up. Now, have you experienced any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: There isn't much pain, no. It's more of a… heavy feeling. And it's a bit tender to the touch, if I press on it. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And it feels warmer than my other leg, I think. It’s hard to tell, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a heavy feeling, tenderness to the touch, and a possible sensation of warmth. That’s helpful information. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your skin in the affected leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, it is a bit redder than my other leg, yes. Not a bright red, but… a bit flushed. It’s hard to see properly, as I don’t spend a lot of time looking at my legs, if I’m honest. But when I compare it to the other one, there’s a difference, certainly. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’ve noticed that, Nixon. The redness, along with the swelling, warmth, and tenderness, raises a few possibilities. To get a better understanding, I’d like to ask a few more questions and then perform a quick physical examination of both legs. First, have you had any recent injuries to your left leg?
PATIENT: No, sir. No injuries at all. I haven’t tripped or bumped it, or anything like that. I’m quite careful, usually. I work with delicate equipment, so I try to be mindful of my surroundings. The swelling just… appeared, as I said. It’s very puzzling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nixon. It is important to investigate the cause of new swelling. Now, have you noticed any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness accompanying the swelling?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I’ve been feeling perfectly fine, apart from the leg. No chest pain, no dizziness, and I can breathe normally. I haven't been feeling unwell in any other way, which is why it’s so strange. I’m usually quite healthy, for my age. Do you think it could be something serious? I apologize for asking, it's just… worrying.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly reasonable to be worried, Nixon, and you're right to bring it up. It's always best to address concerns directly. Let’s move on to some questions about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, aside from the atrial fibrillation you mentioned?
PATIENT: Well, I have had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure in the past, but it's usually well controlled with medication. Nothing else, really. I haven’t been seriously ill, thankfully. I try to eat healthily and get enough exercise, when I can. Is the blood pressure relevant, do you think? Perhaps it's connected to the leg?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you manage your blood pressure, Nixon. Yes, it could potentially be related, so thank you for mentioning that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, other than those for your blood pressure and any relating to your atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Um, let me think... Just the blood pressure tablets, and a beta-blocker for the atrial fibrillation. The nurse gave me a list, I believe. I usually take them as prescribed, first thing in the morning. And a vitamin D supplement, but that's not prescribed, just something I take for general health. Do you want to know the names of the medications? I have them written down somewhere.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, if you don’t mind. Knowing the specific names and dosages is helpful. And thank you for being so thorough. While you locate that list, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Right, here we are. The blood pressure tablet is… Lisinopril, 20mg, once a day. And the beta-blocker is… Metoprolol, 50mg, twice a day. And no, I don’t have any allergies, thankfully. No food allergies, no reactions to medications, nothing like that. I’m very lucky in that regard. Is that all the information you need for now?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Nixon. Lisinopril 20mg daily and Metoprolol 50mg twice a day. No known allergies. Excellent. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. I'll need to examine both legs, check your pulses, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’ll… I’ll just sit here, shall I? I hope it won’t take too long. I have a computer science lecture later this afternoon. Though, I suppose my students can manage without me for a little while.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nixon. We'll be as efficient as possible. Okay, I’m feeling both legs now. Your left leg is warmer to the touch than your right, and it is tender when I press here, along the calf. Your pulses are present in both feet, although the pulse in your left foot is slightly weaker than in your right. And I’m listening to your heart and lungs now… I hear a slightly irregular rhythm, consistent with your atrial fibrillation. Your lungs are clear. Based on this brief examination, and given your history of atrial fibrillation, the swelling, warmth, redness, and tenderness in your left leg raises a suspicion of deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. This is a blood clot in a deep vein, and it requires prompt investigation. It’s important to rule this out or confirm it quickly.
PATIENT: DVT… a blood clot? Oh dear. Is that… serious? I’ve heard about those. Is there anything I can do? Will I need… will I need to go to the hospital? I apologize for asking so many questions, but this is rather alarming. I haven’t felt unwell, so it’s quite unexpected. I was hoping it was just a sprain, or something minor.
DOCTOR: It is understandably alarming, Nixon, and you are right to ask questions. A DVT can be serious, as a blood clot can travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism, which is a medical emergency. That's why we need to investigate this promptly. The fact that you haven’t felt acutely unwell is reassuring, but it doesn’t rule it out. To confirm or exclude a DVT, we’ll need to order a D-dimer blood test and, most likely, a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. The ultrasound is a non-invasive scan that will show us if there is a clot present. Given your symptoms and the suspicion of DVT, I recommend we send you to the Emergency Department for these tests and an initial assessment. They are best equipped to handle this situation quickly and efficiently. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: The Emergency Department… Oh dear. I was hoping to avoid that, if possible. I have a lecture to prepare, and my students… But, I suppose if it's necessary, it's necessary. A pulmonary embolism sounds… frightening. So, a blood test and a scan, then? And you think it’s best I go to the hospital now? It’s just… a bit overwhelming, if I’m honest. Will they need to keep me overnight? I don’t have much clothing with me, and I haven’t arranged for anyone to look after my flat. Perhaps I could take some medication first? Would that help? I apologize for asking so many questions, I’m just… a bit flustered.
DOCTOR: It is perfectly understandable to feel flustered, Nixon. It’s a lot to take in. Yes, a blood test and a Doppler ultrasound are the next steps. And, given your symptoms and the potential seriousness of a DVT, I strongly recommend going to the Emergency Department now. This isn't to alarm you, but to ensure you receive prompt diagnosis and treatment if necessary. Whether or not you’ll need to stay overnight depends on the results of the tests. If a clot is found, you’ll likely need to start anticoagulation medication immediately and be monitored closely. If the tests are negative, you may be discharged home. We can discuss arranging some medication to take with you, but it wouldn’t be appropriate to start anticoagulation without a definitive diagnosis. Starting medication prematurely could be harmful. I can write a note for the Emergency Department explaining your situation and my concerns. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A note would be very helpful. And… perhaps you could explain everything to the doctors there? I’m a bit… overwhelmed, as you’ve noticed. I don’t understand all the medical terms, and I’m afraid I’ll forget something important. And… is it likely to be a long wait at the hospital? I have a computer science lecture tomorrow morning, and my students are expecting me. I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m a bit worried about disrupting my schedule. Although, I suppose my health is more important. It’s just… I feel very flustered.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nixon. I will write a detailed note for the Emergency Department outlining your history, symptoms, my examination findings, and my concerns about a possible DVT. I’ll also explain the medications you’re currently taking. I’ll be sure to mention your atrial fibrillation and blood pressure management. I understand your concern about your lecture tomorrow, and we'll do everything we can to expedite the process. However, I can’t predict the wait time at the Emergency Department, as it depends on the current patient load. The priority will be to assess your condition and ensure you receive appropriate care. I'll also include a note regarding your lecture to help them understand your schedule constraints. Here you go. Please give this to the triage nurse when you arrive at the Emergency Department. They’ll be able to prioritize your assessment. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
