DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. I’s gotta get this life insurance thing done. The paperwork said I needed an exam. I hope it doesn’t take too long, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. A life insurance physical. While I can do that, this is a medical clinic, Mr. Putney. We address health concerns, not insurance requirements. However, if part of that insurance requirement is a general health assessment, we can certainly cover that. But don't expect me to simply rubber-stamp a form. We'll actually do an exam. So, before we get started, is there anything you’ve been concerned about health-wise?
PATIENT: Well, no, not really. I felt a little tired last month, but that’s about it. Old age, probably. I’m 49. Just want to get this insurance sorted, if that’s okay. I don’t really do doctors unless I have to.
DOCTOR: "Old age," right. Well, even in “old age,” we still need to establish a baseline. Fatigue can be a symptom of several things, though I suspect it’s not much. Still, we’ll need to do a basic review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um... let me think. My blood pressure’s been a little high sometimes, the doctor told me a few years back, but he said to watch my salt and stuff. Nothing I had to take pills for. And my knees bother me, but that’s just from work, I guess. I’m a lodging manager, lots of walking and standing.
DOCTOR: "A little high" is vague, Mr. Putney. Do you know what your blood pressure readings were?
PATIENT: No, not really. He just said to watch the salt. I don’t keep track of numbers. It was at a quick check-up, you know, when I was getting a flu shot. Honestly, I just try to ignore it unless it feels bad. Does it matter for this insurance thing?
DOCTOR: It always matters, Mr. Putney. Even for an insurance physical. We need to have accurate information. I’m going to order a complete blood panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG just to be thorough. And yes, we will be checking your blood pressure today. Now, have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any. Just... this insurance thing is gonna take all day, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It will take as long as it takes to get a complete assessment, Mr. Putney. It's not about speed; it’s about accuracy. Family history?
PATIENT: Um… my mom had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was pretty young, maybe in her 60s. My dad, he just… got old. No real problems that I remember. Nobody smoked, if that matters.
DOCTOR: “Something with her heart” is, again, vague. Do you know if it was a heart attack, heart failure, or something else?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. I was a kid, okay? My aunt took care of a lot of it. She’d just say “her heart wasn’t strong.” I don’t know medical terms. Is this really important for life insurance?
DOCTOR: It’s important because heart disease has a genetic component, Mr. Putney. I need to determine if you're at increased risk. Now, social history. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, a couple of beers sometimes, on the weekend. Nothing crazy. And I don’t smoke, never have.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve taken a few things over the years, for colds and stuff, never had a reaction.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. Let's get a quick physical exam done. We'll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Don’t be alarmed; it's just a standard check-up. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148/92. Pulse is 78 and regular. Respiration is 16, unlabored. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs auscultated, but S1 is diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I palpate his abdomen; it’s soft, non-tender, and non-distended. “I’m hearing a slightly diminished S1 heart sound, Mr. Putney. It could be insignificant, but we’ll need to monitor it. We’ll also review your EKG results when they come back. Now, I'm going to listen to your reflexes. Please relax your arms.”
PATIENT: Okay… reflexes. I hope this doesn't take much longer.
DOCTOR: Alright. That completes the physical exam. Now we wait for the lab results and EKG. I've ordered those now. It will be about 15-20 minutes. While we are waiting, I will start on your life insurance form. I will need a detailed list of your current medications, including over-the-counter medications and supplements.
PATIENT: Uh… I don't really take much. Just some ibuprofen sometimes, for my knee. And maybe a multivitamin now and then. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: “Ibuprofen PRN for knee pain. Multivitamin, infrequent use.” Mr. Putney, while I appreciate your cooperation, I need more accurate information. When was the last time you took ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Last week, I think. Maybe a couple of days ago. I don’t really keep track. It was just for my knee, after I was lifting some stuff at work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I understand you want this insurance sorted quickly, but accurate medical information is crucial. I’m obligated to document this as precisely as possible. We’ve been going back and forth, but I’m not getting a clear history. Is there anything you're not telling me?
PATIENT: No! I’m telling you everything. It’s just… I don’t remember dates and stuff, okay? I’m a lodging manager, not a doctor! I just want this insurance thing done.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I’m documenting “Patient provides vague and inconsistent medical history. Difficulty recalling specific details. Insistence on expediting insurance physical despite incomplete assessment.” Frankly, this is making me concerned about completing this form. I am documenting that I strongly recommend you establish care with a primary care physician for a comprehensive evaluation. Until you can provide a more accurate medical history, I am hesitant to sign off on this insurance form. This isn't about being difficult; it's about responsible medical practice. Do you understand?
PATIENT: …Look, I… I get it. I just… I really need this insurance. My wife… ex-wife, she needs the money. It's just… I haven’t been to a doctor in years. It’s embarrassing, okay? I don’t know all the details. Fine. I’ll try to find a doctor. But can you please just fill out the form? Just something to get the ball rolling?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. I will complete a preliminary form with the limited information you've provided, noting my concerns regarding the incomplete history and the need for further evaluation. However, please understand the insurance company may require additional information. I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with a primary care physician as soon as possible. I have a list of local physicians I can provide you with. Now, let me finish up with the form. I’ll need your signature confirming the information provided and acknowledging my concerns. While I do that, I’ll pull up the list of doctors.
PATIENT: Okay. That’s… that’s fine. Just… get it done. And yeah, the list of doctors would be good. Thank you. .
