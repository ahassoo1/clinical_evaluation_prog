DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, I’m just so tired. Always tired. It’s been going on for… a long time now, I guess. I don’t really keep track of things like that anymore. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: “A long time,” right. Well, we need to get to the bottom of it. “Just tired” can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me a little more specifically what you mean by tired?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Not like after a hard day’s work. It’s… in my bones, almost. Like a weight. I wake up tired, and I stay tired. Even if I sleep a good long time. I just… don't have the energy to do things. It makes it hard to… well, everything, really. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it’s not related to activity level. It’s a constant fatigue, even with sufficient rest. And you say it feels… deep. Hmm. Are you having any trouble with your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Oh, memory… yes, a little. Not big things, but… little things. Names, mostly. And… I sometimes forget what I was going to say, mid-sentence. Like now… what was I talking about? Oh, right, the tiredness. It’s… frustrating, you know? My husband used to remind me of things… but he’s gone now. It’s harder to keep track of everything myself.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, these things happen as we get older, dear. It's perfectly normal to experience some cognitive slowing. But we do want to rule out anything more serious. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue and memory issues?
PATIENT: Oh, other symptoms… Let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit… achy, all over. Not like a bad cold, just… dull. And I get… I don't know… a little breathless sometimes, even when I’m just walking around the house. Nothing major, mind you. It’s just… things aren’t how they used to be, that’s all. I don’t know if that helps. Everything feels a bit… muted. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Muted… alright. We're gathering information. Now, let's go through some basics. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never been allergic to anything, not that I remember. I take… well, I take something for my blood pressure, I think. The little white pill. And… oh, something for my cholesterol, maybe? The doctor used to tell me, but I don't write these things down. I really should, but… it all gets confusing. Medicare sends me a lot of things in the mail.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's important to know exactly what you're taking. Let me see… <typing sounds> Ah, here we are. You're on lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension and atorvastatin 40mg daily for hyperlipidemia. Have you been taking these medications regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, I think so. Every day, usually. Sometimes I miss a dose, if I’m not feeling well. Or if I go to visit my sister. It’s not often, but… I try to remember. They’re small pills, easy to forget. Does it matter if I miss one now and then? I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: Well, consistency is important with these medications. Missing doses can affect their effectiveness. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Other conditions… hmm. I had a bad flu a few years ago, very bad. I was in bed for a week, couldn't eat a thing. And… oh, I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. That was… unpleasant. Other than that, not much, really. I was always quite healthy, until… well, until recently. I can't really remember anything else. It’s all a bit of a blur. Honestly, Doctor, it's just the tiredness. Everything feels so… distant.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, cholecystectomy years ago, and a recent severe influenza infection. Any family history of significant illness?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. My mother… she had a bad heart, I think. She died when I was quite young, actually. My father… he was a strong man, a farmer. He lived a long life, but he had… arthritis, I think. In his hands. He couldn't work the land anymore towards the end. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. We don’t see each other much. It was a long time ago. It's all so… hazy. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll work with what we have. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor! Heavens, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband used to smoke, a little, but he quit years ago. And I don't drink alcohol, not really. A glass of wine with Christmas dinner, maybe. And drugs… absolutely not! I’m a simple woman, Doctor. I just want to feel better, that’s all. I don’t have time for any of that nonsense. Is this taking long? I have to pick up my prescription later.
DOCTOR: We're getting there. Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and pulse. And just a quick look in your ears and throat. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Lungs sound clear, but a little diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Heart sounds… normal, but a slight murmur. I'll note that. Ears and throat look fine. I'm also going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes… alright. I’m not very good at sitting still, Doctor. It makes me a bit dizzy, all this. But… alright. Do what you need to do. I just hope you can figure out what’s wrong with me. This tiredness is just… draining. Is it something serious? It feels like it’s getting worse, slowly but surely. I really need to get my energy back. I miss doing things. Honestly, I just want my life back. Is it possible to feel normal again?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but not significantly. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it sounds like we're dealing with a constellation of symptoms—fatigue, mild memory issues, achiness, and some shortness of breath. And diminished reflexes. It's unlikely to be anything serious, dear. It's more likely a combination of age-related changes, perhaps some mild anemia, and possibly some underlying vitamin deficiencies. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'm going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. And just to be safe, an EKG. .
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work… that sounds… complicated. An EKG, too? Is it expensive? I’m on Medicare, you know. I don't want to get a huge bill. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I just want to feel better. But really, Doctor, is it just old age? That’s what my sister keeps telling me. But I feel… I feel like there’s something more to it. Something isn't right. .
