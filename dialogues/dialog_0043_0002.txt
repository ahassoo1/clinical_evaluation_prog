DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Kalinski, you say? Hmm… well, it’s this… going to the bathroom. It’s been a little hard lately. Not… not painful, exactly. Just… takes a bit of effort, you know? I forget what it was like before, really. It’s just… slow.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s helpful to get a clear picture of what’s been going on. When you say it takes effort, could you describe what that feels like specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s like… pushing, I suppose. But not a bad push, just… I have to think about it. And sometimes it just… dribbles out. Not a lot, but enough to be annoying. I used to just… go, you know? Without thinking. Now I gotta… concentrate. It’s silly, really. Old age, I reckon. I don't remember when it started, though. A while ago, definitely.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Ms. Stoffregen. Changes like this are quite common, and it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. So, to clarify, this has been happening for a while, and it involves a feeling of needing to strain to urinate, and some dribbling after you finish?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Strain… yes, that's a good word. And the dribbling… oh, it happens most times, I think. Not every time, but… a lot. It's a little embarrassing, to be honest. I have to… well, I have to check. After I’m done. Do you… understand? I don't know if I'm explaining this very well. My mind isn't what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. Stoffregen. There's absolutely no need to feel embarrassed; these things happen, and we’re here to figure out what’s going on. It's very helpful that you’re describing everything so thoroughly. To get a better picture, could you tell me about how much fluid you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. I drink… tea, mostly. Several cups. And water, when I remember. Not a lot, I don't think. My daughter, Lani, she always tells me to drink more. She worries. But I get thirsty when I’m thirsty, you know? I don’t keep track, if that’s what you mean. Just… enough to get by. Maybe six cups of tea a day? It could be more, it could be less. I really don't know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. An estimate is helpful. And it's good to know Lani looks out for you. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Hmm… color? No, I don’t think so. It looks… yellow. Like it always has. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I figured that was just ‘cause I haven’t had enough to drink. Smell? I don’t really pay attention to the smell, to be honest. I just… go. And hope for the best. Is that bad? Should I be smelling it? My mind’s just all… fuzzy today.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright that you don’t routinely smell your urine, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s not something most people do. I was just checking for any potential signs of infection. Now, have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I know of. And no chills either. My old bones get cold sometimes, but that's just… old age again. And no pain. Not really. Just… uncomfortable, you know? Down there. But not painful. Like a… a dull ache, maybe? But it comes and goes. Mostly just when I'm trying to go. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain. I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Ms. Stoffregen. You’re explaining things very well, and everything you tell me is helpful. A dull ache that comes and goes with urination is good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My doctor, Doctor Silva, he always checked my pressure. It was a little high sometimes, I remember. He gave me a little white pill for it. But I don’t take it anymore. He… he moved away, you see. And I haven’t really seen a doctor since. Diabetes… I don’t think so. Lani keeps telling me to watch my sugar, but I don’t have that sickness. Just… old age, mostly. Everything hurts when you get old. Is that what you want to know? My mind is just… a blank sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Stoffregen. It's good to know you were previously treated for high blood pressure, and that you haven't been diagnosed with diabetes. And it’s understandable that your memory isn’t what it used to be. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries… let me see. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… and my hip replaced, maybe ten years ago? It was a little painful, but Doctor Silva was very good. And… I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist. Fell down the stairs, silly thing. But that was a long time ago. I think that’s all. My mind is just… swimming today. Everything feels so… distant. I hope I'm not bothering you with all this.
DOCTOR: You're not bothering me at all, Ms. Stoffregen. It's important to get a complete picture of your history, and you're doing a wonderful job. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take a little pill for my arthritis, the red one. And… and sometimes I take something for my sleep, when I can't get to sleep. It's a little blue one. That's all I think. I used to take something for my water pills, but I stopped taking those when I stopped seeing Doctor Silva. Lani brings me some vitamins sometimes, but I forget to take them. My mind is just… a mess today. I'm so sorry. Is this helpful? I feel like I'm just rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Ms. Stoffregen. Knowing about the arthritis medication, sleep aid, and previous water pill is very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me think… No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Lani always worries about that too. She says I should watch my salt, but… I like salt! No, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I used to get hives when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. And I don't remember what caused them. My mind is just… a blank sometimes. Is that what you want to know? I'm so sorry if I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. Knowing you don’t have any known allergies is good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… let me see. My mother… she had a bad heart. She died when I was young. And my father… he had something wrong with his kidneys, I think. He was always sick. And my brother… he had diabetes. He lost a leg. But that was a long time ago. Everyone in my family seemed to have something wrong with them. It’s probably just old age, though. Everyone gets sick when they get old. Is that what you want to know? I'm so sorry if I'm not being very helpful. My mind is just… fuzzy today.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s good to know about the heart disease, kidney problems, and diabetes in your family. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Lifestyle… What does that mean? Well, I mostly stay at home. I like to watch television. And I like to garden, when the weather is nice. I used to go to church, but I haven't been going much lately. My old bones ache too much. I don’t do much… traveling anymore. Mostly just stay home and take it easy. Lani comes to visit sometimes. She helps me with the groceries. I don’t really… do much. Is that what you want to know? I'm so sorry if I'm not being very helpful. My mind is just… swimming today.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Knowing you primarily stay at home and enjoy television and gardening is helpful. And it’s good to know Lani visits and helps you out. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I would like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam? Yes, that's fine. I suppose. Just… be gentle, please. My old bones are a little creaky. And… don’t mind if I fidget. It’s hard to sit still for too long. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. My mind is just… wandering today. Is that alright? I'm so sorry if I'm being a bother.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Stoffregen. We'll take things slow and I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen. Your reflexes are a little slower than normal, but that’s not uncommon at your age. And your strength is good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but a little faint. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'd like to do a quick prostate exam to rule out any issues there. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a prostate exam? Well… I… I haven’t had one of those in a long time. Is it… necessary? I don’t really understand what that involves. My old bones are a little sensitive, you see. And… well, it’s a little embarrassing. Is there anything else we can do? I just… I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that. My mind is just… all mixed up today. I'm so sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Stoffregen. It's a very personal exam and it’s perfectly alright to feel uncomfortable. It’s important to rule out any issues with the prostate, as it can sometimes contribute to urinary difficulties. However, we can absolutely skip it if you are not comfortable. Given your history and the exam findings so far, I'm leaning towards a possible diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia – or BPH – which is an enlargement of the prostate gland that's common in older men, and can cause difficulty urinating. To confirm this, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. The urine analysis will check for infection, and the PSA test will help assess the size of your prostate. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… BPH? Is that… serious? And a blood test and… urine? Oh goodness. Well… if it’s necessary to find out what’s wrong, I suppose so. Lani always says I should get things checked out. She worries a lot. A blood test and urine… alright. But… will it hurt? And… how long will it take? My old bones ache when I sit for too long. And… will I have to fast? My mind is just… swimming today. I’m so sorry. Is this going to be expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be concerned, Ms. Stoffregen. BPH isn't typically serious, but it can cause uncomfortable symptoms and, if left untreated, can lead to complications. The good news is it's very treatable. The blood test and urine sample will only take a few minutes. The blood test requires a small sample of blood from your arm, and the urine sample can be collected in a cup. You do not need to fast before the blood test. Regarding cost, I will have the lab check with Medicare to confirm your coverage. We can also discuss potential financial assistance programs if needed. I want to ensure you receive the care you need without any undue financial burden. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options, which may include lifestyle changes, medication, or, in some cases, a minor procedure. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… alright. No fasting is good. And Medicare will cover it? That's a relief. Lani would be so worried if I had to pay a lot of money. And… lifestyle changes? What does that mean? Less tea? Oh goodness. Yes… yes, please schedule the tests. The sooner it’s done, the better, I suppose. My mind is just… all mixed up today. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I’m so sorry for rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Ms. Stoffregen. It's my pleasure to help. Okay, I’ve scheduled the lab tests for you tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM at the clinic next door. They’ll call you to confirm. Lifestyle changes could include things like limiting caffeine intake, practicing pelvic floor exercises, and going to the bathroom regularly. We can discuss these in more detail once we have the results. I’ll also have my nurse give you a list of instructions before you leave. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh… tomorrow morning? Alright. 8:00 AM… I’ll have to remember that. Lani will remind me, I’m sure. And pelvic floor exercises? What are those? Oh goodness. Let me see… I think that’s all the questions I have for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’m still a little worried, but I feel better knowing what’s going on. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate it very much. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Or… is it alright if I just go home and rest? My old bones are aching a little.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s my pleasure to help. No, there’s nothing else you need to do right now. Just rest and try to relax. My nurse will come in shortly with the instructions and answer any further questions you may have. We'll take it one step at a time. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your appointment tomorrow. Have a good day, and get some rest.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I suppose I’ll be going now. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and we’ll see you tomorrow.
