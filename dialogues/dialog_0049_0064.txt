DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s my chest, you see. It’s been… not good. A little pain, mostly. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It started, hmm… maybe last week? I think it was Tuesday. Yes, Tuesday.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pain in the chest, starting last Tuesday. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a sharp pain, you know? More like… a squeezing. Like someone is hugging my chest too tight. And it feels… heavy. Not always, like I said, but when it happens, it’s… uncomfortable. It doesn’t go all the way through to my back, if that makes sense. Just… right here. <points to center of chest>
DOCTOR: Squeezing, heavy… localized to the center of your chest. Does anything bring on the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. It seems to happen when I walk too fast. Or… when I climb the stairs. Even just carrying groceries, sometimes. Anything that makes me… breathe hard, I guess. Not always, but mostly. And… when I get excited, maybe? Talking too much! <laughs lightly> It’s funny, really.
DOCTOR: So exertion brings it on – walking, stairs, carrying things… and sometimes emotional excitement. And when it happens, does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Yes, yes it does! If I stop and rest… just sit down for a little bit… it goes away. Not right away, but… after a few minutes. And… if I take a few deep breaths, that helps too. Slow breaths, you know? Not fast ones. My husband, he tells me to breathe! He’s a good man. He worries, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like rest and deep breathing alleviate it. Have you noticed any other symptoms with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Sometimes I get a little… short of breath. Not always with the pain, but sometimes. And… my arm feels a little… tingly. My left arm. Not bad, just… a little funny feeling. And… I’ve been a little tired lately, but I’m old! <chuckles> So maybe that’s just me. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Short of breath, tingling in the left arm… and fatigue. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My doctor… the one before, he told me I have a little bit of high blood pressure. He gave me a pill for it. I take it every morning. I don’t know about the cholesterol… or the diabetes. He never said anything about that. I’ve been with this new doctor for not long. He’s nice, but… I don’t see him very often. Just for check-ups.
DOCTOR: And do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh dear, it’s a little white pill. Small. The bottle… it says… <squints, as if trying to remember> Lisinopril! Yes, Lisinopril. That’s the one. I take one every morning with my coffee. I never miss it.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Long time ago. When I was young, I had my tonsils out. And… when my son was born, I had to stay in the hospital for a few days. That was… a long time ago now! Maybe forty years? And… I broke my wrist a few years back, when I fell in the garden. But that was just an outpatient thing. They put a cast on it, and I went home. Nothing serious, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of heart problems – heart attacks, strokes, or sudden death?
PATIENT: Oh dear… yes, a little. My father… he had a heart attack when he was older. He didn't… he didn't make it. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had a stroke, maybe ten years ago. She’s still alive, but she can’t talk very well now. It’s sad. But… nobody else, really. Just them. My mother was healthy as a horse, and my brothers are fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor! No smoking, never. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. But that’s it. And no… no drugs, never have, never will. I’m a good girl! My husband would kill me. <laughs lightly> He’s very strict.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just let me know if it will be cold. My skin gets chilly easily. <adjusts her sweater slightly> I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. <Listens to heart for approximately 30 seconds> Hmm. I hear a slight murmur. It’s not alarming, but we’ll need to investigate further. <Listens to lungs for approximately 30 seconds> Your lungs are clear. Now, let me check your blood pressure and pulse. <Takes blood pressure and pulse> Your blood pressure is 145/90, and your pulse is 82. A little elevated, but not unexpected given what you’ve described. <Looks at the patient> I’m also going to check your oxygen saturation. <Checks oxygen saturation> 96% - good. <Looks at the patient> Now, I want to order an EKG and some blood work. The EKG will check your heart rhythm, and the blood work will look at your cholesterol, sugar, and other important levels. This will help me understand what’s going on and determine the best course of action. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a lot of tests! But… yes, that’s alright, Doctor. If it will help me feel better, I’ll do whatever you need. An EKG… is that painful? And the blood work… will it take a lot? I don’t like needles very much. But… if you think it’s important, I trust you. I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? I don’t want to worry my husband too much. He gets so anxious.
DOCTOR: No, the EKG is not painful at all. It’s just a few stickers on your chest. And the blood work… yes, it involves a needle, but it’s very quick. A little pinch, that’s all. The lab technician is very good, they’ll make it as comfortable as possible. We need to rule out anything serious, and these tests are the best way to do that. I understand your concerns, and I’ll explain everything every step of the way. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. <Looks at the patient directly> Is there anything else you're worried about?
PATIENT: Well… I’ve been a little tired lately, like I said. And… sometimes I feel a little dizzy, especially when I stand up too fast. Is that… is that something to worry about? I don’t want to faint or anything. My husband would be so scared. <fidgets with her purse> It’s just… I want to feel like myself again. I used to walk everywhere, you know? Now… I get so winded. It’s frustrating. And… I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue and dizziness, especially upon standing. That's good information. We'll definitely investigate that as well. Those symptoms could be related, or they could be something else entirely. The blood work will help us rule out several possibilities, including anemia and electrolyte imbalances. I also want to check your thyroid levels, as that can sometimes cause fatigue and dizziness. <pauses> It's important to remember that we're not jumping to any conclusions yet. We're just gathering information. <Looks at the patient directly> We’ll get to the bottom of this together. I'm going to write an order for the lab tests, and the nurse will come in to draw your blood shortly. In the meantime, please try to relax. I'll be back as soon as I have a moment to discuss everything with you. <Starts typing on the computer> Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… thank you. Thank you for listening. It’s nice to feel like someone is taking me seriously. My old doctor… he never took the time to listen. <smiles weakly> You’re very kind. I just hope… I hope it’s not something too bad. And… please, tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle. That’s all. <looks down at her hands>
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. I understand your concerns, and I promise to do everything I can to help you. I’ll make a note for the nurse to be as gentle as possible. <Hands the patient the lab order> The nurse will be in shortly to get you started. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns while you're waiting. I'll be back to discuss the results as soon as they're available. <Starts to exit the room> We'll get this figured out. I'll see you shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. <nods gratefully> I appreciate it. <looks at the lab order with a worried expression> I’ll just sit here and wait, then. <sighs softly>
