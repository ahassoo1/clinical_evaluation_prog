DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Renzi, you said? Yes… well, it’s this shaking. My hands, mostly. It's been… a while now, I suppose. Honestly, time slips away, you know? I just thought I'd get it checked. It's getting harder to, uh… hold things steady.
DOCTOR: Yes, time does tend to do that. Okay, so the shaking... primarily in your hands, and it’s been going on for some time. And it’s making it difficult to hold things?
PATIENT: Right. Holding a cup of coffee is… an adventure these days. And trying to write? Forget about it. It's not constant, you understand. Comes and goes. Worse when I'm… stressed, maybe? Or tired. I don't really pay much attention to it, to be honest. It just is.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it’s impacting your daily life, which is definitely worth looking into. So it’s intermittent, comes and goes, and seems to be worse with stress or fatigue… Have you noticed if anything improves it?
PATIENT: Hmm… improves it? That’s a good question. Let me think… Honestly, not really. Maybe… when I’m resting? But then again, I’m usually just sitting when I’m resting, so it’s not like I’m doing anything. It's hard to say. I don’t really focus on when it gets better, just when it’s bothering me. I mostly just try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. It sounds like it’s been something you’ve just… lived with for a while. Okay. And has this shaking been gradually getting worse, or has it been pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Gradual… yes, I think so. It started… well, a long time ago. Just a little tremble, barely noticeable. Now… well, you see it. It’s definitely more pronounced. I remember my wife… she used to tease me about it, said I was getting old. That was a while back, though. A long, long time. I don’t really remember specifics. Sorry. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Jezik. Memories can be tricky. It sounds like it has been a gradual progression. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… I get tired easily, I suppose. But that’s just getting old, isn’t it? And… sometimes my muscles feel a bit stiff. Especially in the mornings. But I wake up stiff every morning, so… No, I don't think so. Nothing else really. Just the shaking, and the tiredness. I don't feel sick, if that makes sense. No pain, no fever, nothing like that. I just want it to stop shaking, you know? It’s embarrassing sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like it's more of a nuisance than anything else, but a very frustrating one. Okay. Now, I'd like to ask a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. I’ve seen a few doctors in my time, let me tell you. I had… high blood pressure, I think. Years ago. They gave me some pills for it. And… I had my gallbladder out, I remember that. And… Honestly, Doctor, I don’t really keep track of these things. It was all so long ago. My wife used to handle all the paperwork and appointments. Since… well, never mind. I'm sorry. I just don’t have a good memory for medical stuff. I'm probably forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Jezik. Don’t worry about it. It’s perfectly understandable. We can go through things slowly. High blood pressure and gallbladder removal are good to know. Do you happen to know what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, I really don’t. Just a little white pill, I think. They gave it to me years ago. I don't remember the name, and I certainly don't have the bottle anymore. Everything got… cleared out after… everything. I just stopped taking it when my wife… when she wasn’t around to remind me. I probably shouldn’t have, but… it just slipped my mind. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good at this medical history stuff. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Jezik. We’ll do the best we can. It sounds like it’s been a difficult time for you. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not anymore. Haven’t taken anything in… well, a long time, I suppose. Just some over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, for my arthritis. But that’s it. And even those, I don’t take very often. I just try to… put up with it, you know? It's not worth bothering with, really. Are we almost done? This is… tiring, trying to remember all this.
DOCTOR: Almost done with the questions, Mr. Jezik. We're just trying to get a complete picture. Now, just a few more quick things. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a runny nose sometimes, but that's just the pollen, I think. No serious allergies, no. Never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I’m a pretty tough old bird, you know? Can we finish now? I'm starting to feel a bit lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Yes, we're almost finished. Just one last thing. Do you have any family history of shaking, neurological problems, or anything like Parkinson’s disease?
PATIENT: Parkinson's…? Oh dear. That's… my mother, I think. She had some trouble walking when she got older. Shaky hands, too. They said something about… nerves, maybe? But I was just a boy then. I don't really remember the details. And my father… he was perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Strong as an ox. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is just terrible. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. Are we really finished now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Jezik, we are finished with the questions. Thank you for your patience. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: An exam…? Oh. Well… I suppose so. But please be gentle. I’m not as sturdy as I used to be. And… try to be quick, if you wouldn’t mind. I don’t like being poked and prodded. This whole thing is… a bit much, to be honest. But if you think it’s necessary… go ahead. Just… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. We’ll take it slow and gentle. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I’ll take a look at your reflexes and do a simple neurological exam to assess the shaking. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds… thorough. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Blood pressure first, you said? Alright. Just… try not to make a fuss. Let’s just get this over with. I’m starting to feel a bit faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik, just relax your arm for me. This will only take a moment. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not overly concerning given your history. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight crackling in your lungs, which could indicate some mild congestion. It's not alarming, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Oh, my… everything aches. Crackling in my lungs, you say? That doesn’t sound good. My wife always said I should quit smoking… but I never listened. Go on, then. Check my reflexes. The quicker we get this over with, the better. Just… be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is common at your age. Now, let’s take a look at the shaking. Could you please hold your hands out in front of you like this?
PATIENT: See? There it is. Always worse when I try to hold still. It’s like they have a mind of their own. I told you. It’s getting worse. I can barely hold a glass of water anymore. Just… look at them. It’s awful. Is there anything you can do about it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Jezik, I see the tremor. It appears to be a resting tremor, meaning it’s most prominent when your hands are at rest. It’s also symmetrical, affecting both hands equally. Now, I’d like you to perform a few simple tasks, if you’re able. Can you tap your fingers together?
PATIENT: Like this…? It’s not easy, you know. It feels… clumsy. See? It’s just… all over the place. I used to be a carpenter, you know. I could build anything. Now… I can barely hold a nail. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it… something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Now, can you try to alternate tapping your thumb and each finger?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. This is… difficult. Like trying to tie knots with mittens. I can't. It's too hard. It just… won't work. See? It's getting worse all the time. I'm afraid I'm losing control. Is there anything you can do? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. Based on the physical exam and your history, it appears you are experiencing a tremor, which is most prominent at rest and symmetrical. Given the gradual onset and the presence of a similar tremor in your mother, Parkinson’s disease is a possibility. However, other conditions can also cause tremors, such as essential tremor, medication side effects, and certain neurological disorders. To get a more accurate diagnosis, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any other potential causes. I would also like to schedule a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation, including imaging studies of your brain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Parkinson's…? Oh dear. I’ve heard about that. My neighbor… she had it. It was… not pretty. Blood tests and a… neurologist? More poking and prodding? Fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… want it to stop. This shaking… it’s ruining my life. I suppose so. Do what you need to do. But please… hurry. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life like this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood for the tests right away. I’ll also get the referral to the neurologist started. I’ll need to get your insurance information for the referral, though you mentioned you are not insured. We can discuss options for affordable neurological care. In the meantime, I can recommend some supportive measures to help manage the tremor. Occupational therapy can help you learn strategies to adapt to everyday tasks. And if the tremor is significantly interfering with your quality of life, we can discuss medication options, but we need a definitive diagnosis first. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… not really. I’m just… overwhelmed. No insurance, you say? That figures. Everything always costs money. Occupational therapy and… medication? I don’t know. Just… get the tests done. And see the neurologist. That’s all I ask. I just want to know what’s happening. And if there’s anything… anything at all… that can be done about it. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life shaking like this. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. We'll do everything we can. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll have my assistant schedule an appointment with the neurologist and explore resources for affordable care. Here is a written summary of our visit today, including the plan for blood tests and the neurology referral. Please read it over when you have a chance. Do you have any difficulty with transportation?
PATIENT: Transportation…? Well, that's a good question. My old car… it's not running very well these days. And my neighbors… they're busy people, you know. I usually walk, if the weather is good. But… getting to a neurologist… that might be a bit far. I suppose I'll figure something out. I always do. But thank you for asking, Doctor. It's… thoughtful of you. I think that's all. I just want to go home now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. We can explore transportation options for you, such as public transportation or ride-sharing services. We also have a social worker available who can assist you with finding resources for transportation and affordable care. I’ll have my assistant provide you with her contact information. For now, please try to get some rest and avoid any strenuous activities. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. The nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. For everything. Just… thank you. It’s… nice to know someone is trying to help. I think I’ll just… go home now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. We’re here to help. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
