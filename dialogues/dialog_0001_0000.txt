DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my legs, doctor. They just…gave out. Not completely, you understand, but really weak. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a terrible cold. I haven't felt this unsteady in years. It’s quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Weakness, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, weakness. It’s…difficult to explain. It's not like a sudden collapse, more like trying to walk through thick mud. And it’s both legs, which is what worries me. I mean, I’m usually quite active, you know, leading tours and all. This is…inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Right. Tours. So, it came on after a cold?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. A nasty one, too. Congestion, the whole nine yards. I thought it was just lingering effects, but this…leg business isn’t going away. It feels…different. And honestly, doctor, I don’t have time for this. My season is starting, and I have a reputation to uphold. People expect a certain standard, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. So, no fever now?
PATIENT: No, no fever now. Thankfully. I had a bit of a temperature with the cold, but that’s gone. It's just…this feeling. Like my legs are made of cotton wool. Honestly, I’ve never experienced anything quite like it. It’s…degrading, frankly. I pride myself on my stamina.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, sometimes post-viral things linger. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: Numbness? No, not really. It’s not that kind of weakness. It’s more…a lack of power. Like trying to push through something heavy. Honestly, I thought it might be a vitamin deficiency, but I eat quite well, doctor. Mostly. I mean, when I’m not traveling, that is. It’s just…frustrating. A perfectly good season wasted, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Any history of…problems with your legs before?
PATIENT: Problems? No, none whatsoever! I've always been very healthy, doctor. Perhaps a bit of arthritis in my knees when I was younger, but nothing serious. Certainly nothing that would explain this. Honestly, I find it hard to believe it’s anything serious, but my sister insisted I come. She's always been a bit of a worrier. Really, I’m probably fine. A little rest, a few vitamins, and I’ll be right as rain.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. Let's just do a quick exam, just to be sure. Nothing extensive. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Oh, must I? I really don’t see the point, but I suppose if you insist. Though I warn you, it’s not going to be a pretty sight. I'm already unsteady as it is. Honestly, I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Just…stand as straight as you can. Now, can you try and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, this is humiliating. See? Perfectly dreadful. Like a newborn foal. And it feels even worse trying to compensate for your…clinical scrutiny. Honestly, it's probably just fatigue. A long flight, you know. These things happen. There. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Strength is… diminished in both legs. Some ataxia present. Now, can you sit back down for me?
PATIENT: Ataxia? What does that mean? Honestly, doctor, you're speaking a different language. And I was perfectly capable until you started poking and prodding. I really don't appreciate being made to feel like an invalid. Honestly, I’ve never felt so…unsettled. Is this going to involve blood tests? I really dislike needles.
DOCTOR: Look, it's probably nothing serious, okay?
PATIENT: “Probably”? Honestly, doctor, that's not very reassuring. “Probably” isn’t a diagnosis. I have a schedule to keep, and “probably” doesn’t pay my bills. And frankly, this isn't a very thorough examination. Are you even listening to me? I'm a professional, and I need to know what's going on, not vague assurances and dismissive notes. Honestly, I may need to seek a second opinion.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can do some blood work. Rule some things out. But frankly, Ms. Firestone, it sounds like post-viral fatigue. You need rest. Hydrate. That's it. I'll order the basic panel. But don't expect any dramatic revelations.
PATIENT: “Dramatic revelations”? Honestly, that's incredibly condescending. So, you’re not even going to try to find out what's wrong? Just dismiss it as “fatigue”? Fine. Blood tests. But if it's just fatigue, I’m sending you the bill for wasting my time. Honestly, I’ve had more helpful conversations with airport security. Do I need to fast? Because I had a perfectly good breakfast.
DOCTOR: No fasting necessary. And look, I’ve got other patients, okay?
PATIENT: “Other patients”? Honestly, doctor, that’s hardly a justification for subpar care! Very well. Where do I go for these tests? And how long will they take? Honestly, I have a tour scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. I’m starting to suspect this is going to be a complete disaster.
DOCTOR: There's a lab down the hall. Should be quick. And frankly, I don't know your tour schedule. If you’re worried, cancel it. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: “Cancel it”? Honestly, doctor, are you deliberately trying to be unhelpful? You have no idea how much planning goes into these tours! This is completely unacceptable. Fine. I’ll go. But if these tests reveal anything serious, I’m holding you personally responsible for the disruption to my career. Honestly, I've dealt with less aggravation coordinating a trip through a war zone. No. There’s nothing else. Except perhaps a sincere apology for wasting my time and dismissing my concerns. But I doubt I’ll receive that. .
