DOCTOR: Good morning, Zoie. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think... it’s my waterworks, I think. It's a bit hard now, to… to go. Not painful, just… slow. Yes, slow. I have to push a little more than I used to. It's been like this for… oh, a while now. A long while. I forget exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Okay, slow urination, requiring a bit more effort. And you said this has been going on for a while… Do you find you’re emptying your bladder completely each time, or do you feel like you still need to go shortly after?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. It's funny, isn't it? I go, and I think I'm done, and then… a little bit later… there's still a little bit left. Not much, mind you. Just a little dribble sometimes. It’s… annoying, mostly. I have to go back more often. It's just… old age, I guess!
DOCTOR: It's not always just old age, Zoie. It's good you're bringing this to my attention. We want to figure out what's going on. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… Hmm. Let me think. Well, I get up in the night sometimes to go. I used to sleep right through, but now… not so much. Maybe two, three times a night? It’s… bothersome. And I don't drink as much water as I should, I suppose. My daughter keeps telling me to drink more. But I don't feel thirsty, you know? Is that important? I forget what she said...something about my kidneys?
DOCTOR: Okay, so nighttime urination – getting up two or three times a night – and you’ve noticed you’re not drinking as much water. Your daughter mentioned your kidneys… that’s good she’s looking out for you. It is important to stay hydrated. The kidneys play a role in urination, absolutely. Do you have any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at all. Just… weak, I think. It’s not a strong stream. And like I said, it takes a bit longer to get going. No burning, though. Definitely no burning. I’ve had enough pain in my life, believe me. I don’t need that trouble again.
DOCTOR: No pain is good to hear. Alright, Zoie. Just to get a more complete picture, have you experienced any fever, chills, or any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don’t think so. My daughter checks my temperature sometimes, when I’m feeling a bit off, but it's always normal. Chills… not really. It gets a bit cool at night, but that's just the air conditioning. Bowel habits… Oh dear. I'm an old woman, you know! What do you mean? Do you want to know if I go to the bathroom regularly? It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Zoie, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. I just need to rule out anything else that might be going on. When you say regularly, do you experience any constipation, or difficulty passing stool?
PATIENT: Oh! Constipation… yes, sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. But it can be… hard, you know? And I have to push a little bit. Like with my waterworks, really. It comes and goes. Sometimes it's fine, sometimes it’s… a struggle. Is that what you wanted to know? I hope I’m not telling you too much!
DOCTOR: No, you're not telling me too much at all, Zoie. This is all very helpful. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My medical history… Let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, and I broke my arm once falling out of a mango tree. And… I had a bad flu a few years back. And… my arthritis, of course. That’s always bothering me. I’ve had it for years and years. It’s mostly in my hands and knees. Is that important? I take pills for that, you know. A little blue pill. I forget the name of it, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils removed, broken arm, flu, and arthritis. The arthritis is good to know. We can look up the name of the medication later. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. Maybe… maybe a skin tag removed from my neck a long time ago? But that was tiny. Nothing big. Definitely nothing like a proper surgery. I don’t like hospitals, you know. Too many… smells. And noises. I avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major surgeries. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a little white pill for my blood pressure. My doctor said my blood pressure gets a bit high sometimes. And… sometimes I take a pain reliever for my arthritis if it’s really bad. Just a little one, over the counter. And... oh! And a vitamin D pill, my daughter gives me that. She says I need it because I don't get enough sun. I think that’s all. It’s a lot of pills, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It can be a lot to keep track of. Okay, Zoie. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Well… I get a bit itchy when I eat shellfish sometimes, but that’s just a little itch. Nothing serious. My daughter says I should carry an EpiPen, but I don’t like the idea of carrying needles around. It frightens me. So… no, I don’t think I have any allergies. Not really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological assessment. And I’ll also need to do a urine test to check for infection and other potential problems. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. That sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but I trust you. And a urine test… well, that’s just going to the bathroom, isn’t it? As long as I don’t have to be in a cold room, that’s fine. Just… be gentle, please. And tell me what you’re doing, so I’m not surprised.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. I’ll explain everything as I go, and I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me… Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear, but with slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, with no acute tenderness, but slightly distended. No masses palpated. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. I’m doing my best to breathe deeply. It’s a bit hard, you know, getting the air in. And my stomach… it does feel a bit puffy, doesn’t it? I haven't been eating very well lately. Lost my appetite, you see. It's probably just old age, though. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re noticing these changes, Zoie. Diminished breath sounds can be normal with age, but we'll want to investigate further. And it's also good to know about your appetite loss and abdominal distention. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished, but symmetrical. Now, if you could just try to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can… Grip strength is slightly decreased bilaterally. Now, for the urine sample, I'll just leave you with a cup and instructions. Please try to collect a midstream sample, and I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. A midstream sample… I remember those from years ago. It's just going to the bathroom, isn't it? A bit tricky getting just the middle part, but I’ll try my best. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, going to the bathroom with instructions. But I’ll do it. You be right back, you said? I hope it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'll be right outside, and take your time. No rush at all. I'll be just a few steps away if you need anything. Okay, Zoie. Did you manage to get the sample okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. I got it. It took a bit longer than I expected, and it wasn’t very much, but I got some in the cup. It’s a bit embarrassing, you know, talking about these things. But I did it. Is that enough? Do I need to try again? It's hard getting old, you know. Everything takes a bit longer.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Zoie. You did great. We don’t need any more at this time. I’ll send this off to the lab for analysis. Now, while we wait for the results, let's discuss what we’ve found so far. You’ve been experiencing slow urination, incomplete emptying, nighttime urination, constipation, and a loss of appetite, along with a slightly distended abdomen. Your physical exam revealed diminished breath sounds, diminished reflexes, and decreased grip strength. These findings suggest a few possibilities. Given your age and symptoms, we need to consider several things, including an enlarged prostate, although that’s less common in women, a weakened bladder, constipation contributing to urinary retention, and potentially some neurological involvement contributing to the diminished reflexes and grip strength. It’s also important to rule out any underlying infection.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Enlarged… what did you call it? And weakened bladder? Is that bad? I don't understand all those big words. And neurological… what does that mean? Is something wrong with my brain? I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again. Is that too much to ask? Is it something serious? Will I have to go to the hospital?
DOCTOR: It does sound complicated, Zoie, but we’ll take it one step at a time. An enlarged prostate is a gland that men have, and it can sometimes cause problems with urination, but as I said, it's less common in women. When I said weakened bladder, I simply meant that the bladder muscles might not be as strong as they once were, which can lead to incomplete emptying. And when I said neurological involvement, I simply meant we need to rule out any problems with the nerves that control your bladder and bowel function. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong with your brain. We're going to start with the urine test to rule out infection. Then, I’d like to order a couple of imaging tests – an ultrasound of your bladder to see how well it’s emptying, and potentially a CT scan to get a better look at your abdomen and rule out any other potential causes. These tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. As for the hospital, that’s not something we’re considering right now. We’ll start with these tests, and see what they reveal. If the results show something serious, we'll discuss all your options, and make a plan together. But right now, there’s no need to worry about that. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… that does sound a bit better, dear. Ultrasound and… a CT scan. Those don’t sound as scary as the hospital. And no need to worry right now. That’s good. So… I just have to wait for the tests? How long will that take? And what if… what if it is something serious? What kind of options would I have then? Would it be painful? I don’t want to be a burden to my daughter, you know. She has her own family to worry about.
DOCTOR: The tests usually take a few days to schedule and a little longer for the results to come back. I'll have my nurse call you to schedule them as soon as possible. As for what if it is something serious, there are many options depending on the diagnosis. For example, if it's a weakened bladder, there are medications and exercises to strengthen the muscles. If it’s a blockage, there are procedures to clear it. We’ll discuss all the risks and benefits of each option before making any decisions. And as for pain, that depends on the treatment. Some treatments are minimally invasive and cause very little pain, while others may require a longer recovery period. But we’ll do everything we can to manage your pain and make you as comfortable as possible. And please don’t worry about being a burden to your daughter. Caring for her mother is something many daughters find fulfilling, and we'll work together to make sure you have all the support you need. We also have resources available to help with transportation, home care, and emotional support. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done, and see what they reveal. I'll also write you a prescription for a mild stool softener to help with the constipation in the meantime. That can often help with urinary retention. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a stool softener… that does sound good. Maybe that will help. And you'll write everything down, you said? About the tests and… and what could happen? That would be good. I forget things so easily these days. You’ve been very kind, dear. I was so worried when I came in here. But you explained everything so well. Thank you. I suppose… I suppose I should just wait for the nurse to call, then? And try not to worry too much in the meantime? It’s hard, though. It's hard not to think the worst.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Zoie. That’s what I’m here for. Yes, just wait for the nurse to call and schedule the tests. And you're right, it’s hard not to worry. But try to focus on taking things one step at a time. I'll be here every step of the way to answer any questions you have and provide support. Here’s my direct number if you have any concerns before the nurse calls. Don’t hesitate to call, even if it’s just to talk. And remember, we haven’t even done the tests yet, so there’s no need to jump to conclusions. Let’s get the information we need, and then we’ll make a plan together. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, dear. I think you’ve answered everything. I just… I appreciate you being so patient with an old woman like me. It's easy to get confused these days. I guess… I’ll just go home now and try to relax. And wait for the nurse to call. Thank you again, Dr. Bombara. You’ve been a lifesaver. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Zoie. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. And remember, try to relax and take things one day at a time.
