DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a rather delicate matter, to be frank. It’s something I’ve been… noticing. A discharge, you see. Not a pleasant thing at all, and quite frankly, unbecoming for a man of my age. I haven't the foggiest idea why it would be happening now, after all these years. It's simply… unexpected.
DOCTOR: A discharge, you say. Unexpected, certainly. And how long have you been noticing this discharge, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… slips away, doesn't it? Let me see… it must be… a week, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. It’s difficult to say precisely. My wife, bless her heart, was the one who first pointed it out. She has a keen eye, you see. I didn’t pay it much mind initially, of course. Thought it was… well, nothing important. But it persisted, and she insisted I come see someone. Women… they worry so.
DOCTOR: Right. And can you describe the discharge for me, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Describe it? Hmm. That’s… a peculiar request, Doctor. It's… well, it’s not water, certainly. More… viscous, I suppose. And… yellowish. Not a bright yellow, mind you, more of a… faded sort of color. And… there’s not a great deal of it, thankfully. Just… enough to be noticeable, and rather unsettling. It's not painful, thank heavens, just… there. A nuisance, really. It stains the undergarments, you see. A most unfortunate business.
DOCTOR: Viscous, yellowish, and not painful. And you said it stains your undergarments?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. A most unwelcome stain, I assure you. My wife is very particular about laundry, you see. She insists on everything being spotless. It's… embarrassing, to say the least. I've been using… extra soap, but it doesn't seem to make much difference. Honestly, Doctor, at my age, one expects certain… diminishments, but this is quite unexpected and, frankly, a little demeaning. It makes one feel… unclean. I do hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Krok, we’ll need to do a quick examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Have you experienced any burning or itching in the area?
PATIENT: Burning or itching? No, no, not at all. Quite the opposite, actually. No discomfort whatsoever, beyond the… indignity of the situation. It's just… there. A silent, unwelcome visitor. I’ve not noticed any… swelling, either. My wife would have mentioned it, she’s very observant, you know. She fusses over every little detail. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t felt any change in… sensation. It’s simply… an issue of cleanliness, or lack thereof. A most bothersome nuisance, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you'll just excuse me for a moment, I'll need to gather some supplies. Please undress from the waist down and lie on the examination table. I will be right back. I need to see what's happening, Mr. Krok. A description is simply not sufficient.
PATIENT: Undress? Good heavens. Well, I suppose it’s necessary, if you insist. It's rather… exposing, at my age, you understand. But if it’s for the sake of… cleanliness, I shall comply. Though I must say, Doctor, I’ve never felt the need for such… scrutiny before. A most unusual circumstance, indeed. But very well. Just give me a moment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Just relax. I’m going to take a look. This will only take a moment. Now, I'm going to need you to lie back with your knees bent.
PATIENT: Bent knees, you say? Goodness. This is… undignified. Very undignified. I haven’t been in such a position in… well, decades. I trust this won’t take long, Doctor. I have a rather important appointment with the garden club this afternoon, you see. And I wouldn’t want to be… indisposed. Just… get it over with quickly, if you would be so kind. And please, be gentle. A man of my age isn't as… resilient as he once was.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is some mild erythema of the urethral opening, and a small amount of purulent discharge visible. No obvious lesions or swelling beyond that. It seems you have a mild case of urethritis. It’s not uncommon, even at your age. We’ll need to get a urine sample to confirm, and likely a course of antibiotics. Now, let’s get that sample, shall we?
PATIENT: Urethritis? Good heavens. Is that… serious? Antibiotics, you say? I've never taken antibiotics in my life. My wife always swore by herbal remedies, you see. She has a whole garden dedicated to them. And a sample? Must it be… that kind of sample? I’m rather particular about my… privacy, you understand. And I have that appointment with the garden club, you know. Perhaps there’s a simpler way? A tea, perhaps? My wife makes a lovely chamomile.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, herbal remedies are not a substitute for proper medical diagnosis and treatment. Urethritis is an infection, and it requires antibiotics. And yes, a urine sample is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate antibiotic. It's a standard procedure. We have a private collection room. It will be discreet. And your garden club appointment will have to wait. An untreated infection can lead to more serious complications. Now, if you'll follow me.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. You win. An infection, you say? And antibiotics… I suppose I have no choice. My wife will be disappointed about the chamomile, but… better to be safe than… infected, I suppose. Lead the way. But I do hope this collection room is… adequately private. A man of my age has a certain… dignity to maintain, you understand. And I truly do hope this won’t take too long. The garden club meeting starts promptly at three.
