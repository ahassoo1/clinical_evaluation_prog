DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't have a lot of time for this. It's…well, it's my stomach. Just constantly running to the bathroom. It's been going on for weeks, and honestly, nothing the other doctor gave me has touched it. It's embarrassing, and it's interfering with my work. I'm a painter, you know? Can't exactly be climbing ladders when…well, you get the picture.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for any inconvenience this is causing you. It sounds incredibly disruptive, especially with your work. We’ll get to the bottom of this. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Ugh, “a little more”? Where do I even begin? It's…watery. A lot. Several times a day. Sometimes even waking me up at night. I've tried everything – bland food, that stuff my aunt uses…I don’t even remember the name. Nothing stops it. And it's not like a one-time thing. It’s been weeks. Honestly, I'm just tired of being asked if I'm okay every five minutes. Is that enough "more" for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. It sounds quite debilitating, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. The frequency and duration are definitely concerning. When you say weeks, can you recall approximately when this started?
PATIENT: Honestly? Around the beginning of July, I think. Maybe the tenth? It was right after that…that fundraiser for the tribal center. Lots of food, lots of people. I don’t usually get sick from stuff like that, but…I don't know. It just started shortly after. Does it matter? It's still happening, and that's what matters.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Woodring, as it helps us consider potential causes. The timing with the fundraiser is useful information. Okay, so starting around July 10th. Have you noticed anything with the diarrhea – any cramping, bloating, nausea, vomiting, or fever?
PATIENT: Cramping, yeah, constantly. Like someone’s twisting my insides. And bloating, definitely. I look six months pregnant some days, it's ridiculous. Nausea sometimes, but I haven’t actually thrown up. No fever, though. I’m a pretty healthy person, generally. This is just…frustrating. It's not like I'm sitting around eating bad things. I take care of myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you clarifying that. It's good to know you generally feel healthy. The cramping and bloating along with the diarrhea are key symptoms. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or a change in its color – particularly anything dark and tarry, or very pale?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Now we’re talking about…that? Look, I'm a painter, not a medical professional. I haven't exactly been examining my…output. But I don’t think so. No bright red, no black tar. It's…normal-ish color, just…watery. A lot of it. Are you going to ask me about every single detail now? Because honestly, I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Woodring. I understand this is unpleasant, and I’m not trying to be invasive. These questions are simply necessary to get a clearer picture of what’s happening. Okay, “normal-ish color” is good to know. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss during this time?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well… now that you mention it, my clothes have been a little looser. I hadn’t really thought about it, honestly. Been too busy running to the bathroom to worry about my weight. I'm not trying to lose weight, if that's what you're getting at. I just…haven't been eating much. It's hard to keep food down when you're worried about what’s going to happen five minutes after you eat it. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, thank you. Unintentional weight loss along with the other symptoms is concerning. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any underlying medical conditions – anything you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Look, I'm pretty healthy, like I said. Nothing major. High blood pressure, maybe, a few years ago, but I lost weight and it went away. My aunt had diabetes, but I don’t. I’m Tlingit, you know. We’re strong people. Generally good health. I really don’t have a long list of ailments. I just want this…problem…fixed. Are we getting any closer to that?
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a resolution, Ms. Woodring, and we are working towards that. It’s good to know about the previous high blood pressure. Okay, and have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’m not one for letting people cut me open unless absolutely necessary. I’ve been lucky so far. Look, is this going to take much longer? I have a job to get back to, you know. People are depending on me. It's not like I can just sit around all day answering questions about…everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Ms. Woodring, and I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Okay, no surgeries. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And I took something the other doctor gave me for the…problem. I can’t even remember the name. Something with -azole in it? It did absolutely nothing. Honestly, everything seems to just make it worse. I really don't like taking pills unless I have to. I prefer to just deal with it, but this has been going on too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and something with -azole that wasn’t effective. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I eat all sorts of things. I’m not one of those people who avoids everything. I grew up eating what we caught and gathered. I can handle a little spice. Really, I don’t have a long list of anything. I'm pretty straightforward. Are we almost done? I'm starting to feel a little…off. Just a general unsettled feeling. Which, you know, is not surprising.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. One last section, Ms. Woodring, and then we’ll do a quick physical exam. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a grown woman. I don’t need to answer these personal questions. I eat healthy, I work hard, and I don't cause trouble. What does my social life have to do with my stomach? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. If you can't figure out what's wrong with me based on what I've already told you, I don't know what to tell you. Let’s just get to the exam, okay? I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if the questions feel intrusive. They are important for a comprehensive assessment, but I respect your wishes. Let’s move on to the physical exam. If you’ll just lie down on the table, I’d like to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It will only take a few moments.
