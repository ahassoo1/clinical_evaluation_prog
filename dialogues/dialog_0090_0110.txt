DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I’m Dr. Kur. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kur. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I feel…a bit faded, if that makes sense. Like an old photograph. I’m hoping you can help me get a little…jumpstarted, shall we say? I just want to feel more like myself again. I’m 87 years young, you know, and while I’m grateful for every year, I’d like to enjoy them with a bit more…pep.
DOCTOR: “Faded,” hmm. I see. And how long have you been feeling this way, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It hasn’t been sudden, not at all. I’d say…maybe the last six months or so? It’s a slow sort of thing. Not a dramatic fall, just…less energy. Less interest in doing things, even things I usually enjoy. It’s hard to pinpoint, really. It’s just…not as bright as it used to be. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. McNabb. It sounds like a gradual decline. And can you tell me specifically what things you’ve lost interest in?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think. Well, I used to love gardening, always had a beautiful hibiscus bush. Haven't touched it much this year, to be honest. And I used to volunteer at the school, reading to the little ones…haven’t felt up to it lately. Even my bingo nights with the ladies…I’ve been skipping those more and more. It’s not that I don't want to, it's just...harder to get motivated, you know? And I find myself napping more often, even during the day. It's not a sickness nap, just...a tired nap.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gardening, volunteering, bingo…and increased daytime napping. We'll note all of that. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That's a good question. My appetite…it’s not as strong as it used to be. I don't skip meals, not exactly, but I don't enjoy them the way I used to. Everything just seems…bland. And I think I have lost a little weight, yes. Not a lot, but my clothes are a bit looser than they were. I haven’t weighed myself regularly, but I can tell. My daughter, she commented on it when she visited last month. She’s always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, decreased appetite, weight loss…and your daughter noticed. Good. We’ll note that as well. Now, have you been experiencing any difficulty with sleep at night?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. It's funny, I nap during the day, but getting to sleep at night…that’s been a little harder. I don’t stay awake for hours, not usually, but it takes me longer to drift off. And sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and have a little trouble getting back to sleep. It’s not every night, but it happens often enough to notice. It's just...restless, you know? Not painful, just…not restful.
DOCTOR: Okay, restless sleep, difficulty falling asleep…we're building a picture here, Ms. McNabb. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a worry, isn't it? Well…I wouldn’t say my memory is bad, exactly. I still remember my childhood, clear as a bell! But…little things. I forget where I put my glasses sometimes, even though they're usually right on my head! And I have trouble remembering names, especially when I meet someone new. And…sometimes I just feel…foggy. Like I’m trying to find the right word, but it’s just out of reach. It's frustrating, more than anything. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s enough to notice. I'm still me, but I feel a bit…slower, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright. Forgetfulness, difficulty with names, feeling foggy…it's good you're noticing these things. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's…a bit personal, isn't it? Well…yes, actually. I’ve been a little…irregular, shall we say? Not terribly so, but not as regular as I used to be. Sometimes a little constipated, sometimes…well, the other way. It’s not painful, just…uncomfortable. And I haven’t really thought much about it, to be honest. I just figured it was part of getting older. But you asked, so I thought I should mention it. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is, Ms. McNabb. Changes in bowel habits can be important. Thank you for mentioning it. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any unexplained weight loss, or any fevers, chills or night sweats?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no fevers or chills or night sweats, thank the Lord. And I already mentioned a little weight loss, didn’t I? Nothing dramatic, just…clothes a bit looser. I haven’t been feeling sick, not like a cold or the flu. Just…tired and faded, like I said. And a little…out of sorts. It’s hard to explain. It's not a pain, or a specific symptom. It's just…a general feeling of not being myself. Is that helpful at all, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is, Ms. McNabb. It is helpful. We've covered a lot. Now, before we move on to your medical history, let’s just quickly go over medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. It's a very small dose, the doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And I take a multivitamin every day, just a basic one. And sometimes, when my joints are acting up, I take some glucosamine and chondroitin for my knees. That’s it, really. Nothing fancy. My daughter always makes sure I don’t mix anything new without checking with the doctor first. She’s a good girl, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril for blood pressure, multivitamin, glucosamine and chondroitin as needed. Good. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. I can eat anything, knock on wood. And I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications, as far as I know. My daughter always asks when I get a new prescription, but I haven’t had to tell her about anything. I’m grateful for that, too. It’s one less thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, the doctor told me a few years ago that my blood pressure was a little high, that's why I'm on the Lisinopril. And I have a little arthritis in my knees, that's why I take the glucosamine. But other than that…no, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, things like that. But I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I haven't had any serious illnesses or surgeries, thankfully. And I’ve never been in the hospital for anything major. I’m grateful for that, too. I try to take care of myself, eat healthy, and stay active. But, like I said, I’m getting older, and things are starting to slow down. It's just…a bit worrying, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure, arthritis in the knees…we're getting a clearer picture. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just the one. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. It was a long time ago, back in…oh, goodness, maybe 1985? It wasn’t a very serious surgery, and I recovered quickly. But other than that, no. I’ve always been lucky enough to avoid major surgeries. I’m grateful for that, too. It's one less thing to worry about. I don’t like hospitals much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal in 1985. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Let me think. My mother, she had heart trouble later in life, that’s true. And my brother, he had diabetes. But other than that…not really. My father was pretty healthy, lived to be 88. And my sisters, they’re both still alive and doing pretty well, as far as I know. I don’t know much about my grandparents, to be honest. They both passed away when I was young. It’s hard to say, really. But I don’t think there’s a strong history of any major illnesses in my family. I’m grateful for that, too. It’s one less thing to worry about. It's a bit stressful thinking about all of this, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. McNabb. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were terrible for you, and I believed her. And my husband, he didn’t smoke either. We always had fresh air in our house. I’m grateful for that, too. It’s one less thing to worry about. I always thought it was a silly habit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, never smoked. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Very little. Maybe a glass or two a week, if that. Nothing fancy, just something to relax with. My husband and I used to enjoy a glass of wine with our meals, but he passed away a few years ago. I don't drink as much now, to be honest. It doesn't taste as good without him. But it's just a little, nothing excessive. It’s just…a habit, really. It’s one less thing to worry about. It's just… a comfort, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Occasional light alcohol use. Now, lastly, let’s talk about your social life. Do you live alone, or do you have family or friends nearby?
PATIENT: Oh, I live alone now, yes. My husband passed away a few years ago, as I mentioned. But my daughter, she lives about twenty minutes away, thank the Lord. She comes to visit often, and she always checks on me. And I have a few friends from church who I see regularly. We have bingo nights sometimes, when I'm feeling up to it. And I always enjoy a good chat with my neighbors. I'm not lonely, not exactly. But I do miss my husband, terribly. He was my best friend, you know? It's just… different now. It’s one less thing to worry about, having my daughter nearby, but it's still… quiet sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McNabb. Thank you for answering all of my questions so thoroughly. I have a good understanding of your history now. Based on what you’ve told me – the gradual decline in energy, the decreased appetite and weight loss, the restless sleep, the forgetfulness, and the changes in bowel habits – it sounds like we need to investigate a few things. It could be a number of things – vitamin deficiency, a mild thyroid issue, even just the natural effects of aging. I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. I also want to check your B12 levels, as a deficiency can cause similar symptoms. And, just to be safe, I'd like to order a stool test to rule out anything concerning. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds…sensible, Doctor. If it will help me figure out what’s going on, then yes, I’m happy to have the tests. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? It’s just… tiring, feeling faded all the time. So, yes, please, let’s do the tests. Vitamin levels, thyroid…whatever you think is best. And a stool test, you say? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very pleasant, but if it's necessary, then so be it. I’m willing to do whatever it takes. When can we get this done, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write you a lab order now. The lab is just across the street; you can go anytime that's convenient for you. They don't require an appointment. As for the stool test, they will give you instructions on how to collect the sample at home. It's not the most pleasant thing, I agree, but it's important to rule things out. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. Once I have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I want you to continue taking your Lisinopril as prescribed. And try to get a little bit of gentle exercise each day, if you're able. Even a short walk can make a difference. Also, try to eat as balanced a diet as possible, even if your appetite isn't great. Small, frequent meals can be helpful. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… manageable, Doctor. Thank you. Gentle exercise…small meals…I can do that. I used to love gardening, perhaps I could start with that again, just a little bit at a time. Let me think… a question… yes. Um… how long will it take to see a difference, if it is something simple, like a vitamin deficiency? I just… I’m eager to get back to feeling like myself, you know? I don’t want to wait months and months to feel better. Is that a reasonable question? I just… I get anxious sometimes, worrying about things.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Ms. McNabb. And a common one. If it is something simple like a vitamin deficiency, you should start to feel some improvement within a few weeks of starting supplementation, assuming that’s what the tests reveal. It’s not always immediate, but you should notice a gradual increase in energy levels and overall well-being. However, it’s important to remember that everyone is different, and the timeline can vary. If you're not seeing any improvement after a month or so, we'll need to investigate further. I also want to be upfront and say that it could be something more complex, though it’s too early to say. But we’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll keep you informed every step of the way. Do you have any other concerns or questions I can address for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… reassuring, Doctor. A few weeks. I can manage a few weeks. And you’ll keep me informed, you said. That’s good. I appreciate that. No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve answered all of my questions, and you’ve put my mind at ease a little bit. Thank you. And thank you for listening, Doctor. It’s nice to have someone who takes the time to understand what’s going on. I’ll go to the lab tomorrow, first thing. And I’ll try to get out in the garden, just a little bit. Perhaps I can start with weeding. Thank you again, Doctor Kur. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McNabb. I’m glad I could help ease your mind, and I'm happy to listen. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And I hope you enjoy a little time in the garden. Sometimes, just being outdoors can make a world of difference. Here’s the lab order, and a sheet with instructions on how to prepare for the stool test. Take care, Ms. McNabb. I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. I will, and I appreciate everything you've done. Have a good day, Doctor Kur. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You too, Ms. McNabb. Take care.
