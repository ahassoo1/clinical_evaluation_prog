DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Right, well, to be blunt, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and…hungry, too. It’s just…more than usual, I suppose. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and I thought it best to get it checked out. I haven’t a clue what’s causing it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of increased thirst and hunger. I understand. That's certainly worth looking into. To help me get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I find myself drinking…a lot more water than I used to. I used to maybe have a pint or so throughout the day, and now it’s…easily double that, if not more. And the hunger…it’s not like a craving for anything specific, just…a constant feeling of needing to eat. Even after a good-sized meal, it doesn’t really go away for very long. It’s rather bothersome, to be frank.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a noticeable increase in both your water intake and your appetite, persisting for several weeks. Has this been accompanied by any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Let me think. No, not that I’ve noticed, really. I haven’t been feeling unwell, no fever or anything like that. Maybe a bit more tired than usual, but I put that down to work, if you understand. Shipping and receiving is…demanding, physically. I haven't lost or gained any weight, either. I suppose that’s it, really. Nothing else springs to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no weight changes, and the tiredness you attribute to work. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – more frequent trips to the bathroom, perhaps, or a different color or smell?
PATIENT: Yes, now that you mention it…I have been going to the bathroom a bit more often. Not drastically, but enough that I’ve noticed it. And, thinking about it further, the…colour is a little lighter, perhaps? I didn’t really pay much attention before, to be honest. I just assumed it was the extra water I was drinking. It doesn't smell any different, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased urination and lighter urine color. That, along with the increased thirst and hunger, is starting to paint a clearer picture. Do you have any family history of diabetes, or any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother…she had some issues with sugar levels later in life, I believe. Nothing serious, as far as I know, but she was always a bit cautious about sweets. My father was always healthy as a horse, so to speak. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ medical history, unfortunately. They…weren’t much for talking about such things.
DOCTOR: Alright, a family history of some sugar level issues on your mother's side. That's useful information. Now, let’s talk about your general health. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing major. And I’m not currently taking any medications, not even over-the-counter things regularly. I try to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No allergies and no current medications. Now, a few lifestyle questions. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Never have. I gave it a try years ago, didn't care for it at all. I prefer a good strong cup of tea, if you don’t mind. I suppose I do enjoy a pint or two with my mates on the weekend, but nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, no smoking and only moderate alcohol consumption. Do you engage in regular exercise?
PATIENT: Well, regular might be a bit of a stretch. Work keeps me on my feet quite a bit, as I mentioned. Lifting and moving boxes all day is…physical, to say the least. But I don't really do any…dedicated exercise, if you understand. I used to play football when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. These days, I'm mostly just tired after work. I sit down with a cup of tea and relax.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly. Work provides a good amount of physical activity, but not formal exercise. Okay, Christen, thank you for answering those questions. Based on what you’ve told me – the increased thirst, hunger, urination, family history of sugar issues – I’d like to run some tests to check your blood sugar levels. It’s possible we're dealing with diabetes, but we need to confirm that with a proper diagnosis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds sensible, Doctor. If it is something like diabetes, I'd rather know and get it sorted out. I'm happy to have the tests done, whatever you think is best. Let's get on with it, if you will. I'm keen to get this resolved as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that. There's a lab just down the hall. I’ll have a nurse draw some blood for a fasting glucose test and an A1c test. The A1c will give us a picture of your average blood sugar levels over the past few months. It's best to fast for at least eight hours before the test, so no breakfast this morning. The nurse will give you specific instructions. After the results are in – usually within a day or two – we'll discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or significant changes in your condition – such as blurred vision, extreme fatigue, or unexplained weight loss – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very clear, Doctor. Eight hours fasting, and I'll contact you if anything changes. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate it. I suppose there’s nothing more to it than that, then. Let’s get the tests done. I’d like to be finished with this as soon as possible, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly. She’ll take you down to the lab and get everything arranged. Please don't hesitate to ask her any questions you have as well. It was good speaking with you, Christen. We’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Right, very good. Thank you again, Doctor. And goodbye to you.
