DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, like I might fall. It’s been happening… recently, I believe. I apologize, my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly alright. We’ll take our time. “Unsteady,” you say… recently. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not constant, thankfully. It comes and goes. When it happens, things seem to… tilt, perhaps? Or wobble. It’s hard to describe. It doesn’t feel like dizziness, exactly. More like… my feet aren’t quite holding me right. And it's been… concerning me more and more lately, as it happened while I was working. I operate a rotary drill, you see, in the oil and gas fields. It’s… not ideal to be unsteady in that profession.
DOCTOR: That is concerning, especially with your line of work. Rotary drill operator… yes, stability is very important. You mentioned it’s happening more recently. Can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. If I had to put a number on it… perhaps the last month or so? It started gradually, just a little off-balance now and then. But in the past week, it’s become… more noticeable. It happened twice at work this week alone. I’m very fortunate nothing serious occurred, but it is quite worrying. I truly apologize, it’s frustrating not to be able to give you a more precise answer. Things just… aren’t as clear as they used to be.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Lilyanna. Don't worry about precision. We'll sort it out. So, over the past month, with increased frequency in the last week… Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: That’s a very good question. I’ve been trying to recall, but… no, not that I'm aware of. It doesn’t seem to be related to exertion, or… anything I’ve eaten. It doesn't happen after standing for a long time, or after I’ve been sitting. It just… happens. I do… I do get quite tired at work, being on my feet for long shifts. Perhaps that has something to do with it, but I’ve always been tired after work. I suppose it’s a physically demanding job. I wish I could be of more assistance. It's just… difficult to pinpoint anything specific.
DOCTOR: Okay. Not related to exertion, eating, or prolonged standing… fatigue is a possibility, but you’ve experienced that before without this unsteadiness. Let's move on to other things. Besides the unsteadiness and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… I have been rather… forgetful lately, as I’ve mentioned. Worse than usual, perhaps. And… sometimes my vision seems a little blurry, but I wear glasses, so I assumed it was just my prescription needing adjustment. Nothing major. Oh! And I’ve had a few headaches, nothing debilitating, just a dull ache now and then. They come and go, just like everything else. I truly am sorry for not being more helpful. It all feels rather… vague and disconnected.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Lilyanna. It's good you're telling me all of this, even if it feels vague. Forgetfulness, blurry vision, headaches… alright. Now, have you had any ringing in your ears, any trouble with your hearing, or any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no ringing in my ears, and my hearing seems perfectly fine. Thankfully. And no nausea or vomiting, not at all. I… I haven’t been sick in quite some time. It’s mostly just this… unsettling feeling of being off-balance, and the things I’ve already mentioned. The headaches are infrequent, and the vision is blurry sometimes, but mostly just the unsteadiness. It is… quite frightening, to be honest, especially given my profession. I worry constantly about an accident.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Lilyanna. It's wise to be cautious, especially with your work. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… my late husband and I were both quite healthy, thankfully. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication. I take a small dose daily. Otherwise… no, I haven’t had any serious illnesses or surgeries. I had the usual childhood vaccinations, of course. Oh, and I had a rather severe bout of the flu a couple of years back, but I recovered fully. Beyond that… nothing significant comes to mind. It’s… difficult to recall everything precisely, as I’ve mentioned.
DOCTOR: Alright, hypertension, well-controlled with medication. Good. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I eat… well, I eat a fairly varied diet. I don’t have any known sensitivities. I suppose I could say I’m allergic to being unwell, if that counts!
DOCTOR: That's a good allergy to have! Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the medication for my blood pressure. I take it every morning. That’s all. I don't take any vitamins or supplements, either. I try to eat a healthy diet and get enough rest, but… as I said, my job is quite physically demanding, and rest is sometimes difficult to come by.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do some simple balance and neurological tests. It will just take a few minutes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment completely. I’m ready when you are. I hope it doesn’t take too long, as I have a shift starting later this afternoon, but I understand if it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is within a reasonable range. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes and extend your arms straight out in front of you. Can you touch your index finger to your nose?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. There. Is that alright? I felt a little unsteady, but I did manage it. Perhaps my balance isn’t as good as it once was.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. A slight wobble is noted. Now, I’d like you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. See if you can maintain your balance for thirty seconds. I'll be right here to steady you if needed. Okay, good. A little sway, but you held it for a good amount of time. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I'm going to quickly check your eye movements. Your eyes are tracking normally.
PATIENT: Alright. That was… not too unpleasant. I do feel a little… strange, now. Perhaps a bit lightheaded, but nothing severe. Is that normal? I apologize if I’m being a difficult patient.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being difficult at all, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little lightheaded after those tests, especially with the balance component. It’s likely due to the slight exertion and focusing on maintaining your balance. We’ll take a moment. Okay, based on what you've told me and the exam findings, I’m considering a few possibilities. The unsteadiness, forgetfulness, blurry vision, and headaches, along with your controlled hypertension, could point to a few things. It could be related to the medication, although it's well-controlled. It could also be something vascular, given your blood pressure history. We need to rule out more serious causes. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and complete blood count. I'd also like to get an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. It's a precaution, but it's important to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds rather serious, Doctor. But I understand. If it’s necessary to rule things out, then I suppose it’s best. Blood tests are fine, of course. I trust your judgment completely. I… I just hope it’s nothing too concerning. My late husband… he always worried about my health. I’d like to be able to… reassure him, if he were here. Yes, proceed with the tests. The sooner we know something, the better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Lilyanna, and I’ll do everything I can to get you answers quickly. We'll start with the blood tests. I'll write you a requisition, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. The MRI can be scheduled through the radiology department, and they’ll contact you to arrange a time. It's best to avoid scheduling it right before a shift, in case you feel any side effects, though those are uncommon. I'll also prescribe a low dose of Meclizine to help with the unsteadiness and nausea in the meantime, though it's unlikely you'll need it. While we're waiting for the results, please monitor your symptoms and let me know immediately if anything changes, especially if you experience any weakness, numbness, severe headache, or difficulty speaking. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough and explained everything clearly. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible and get the blood tests done. Thank you, Doctor Bombara. I suppose… there is one thing. Is it possible the fatigue is contributing to this? I work long shifts, and it's quite a physically demanding job. Would taking some time off be advisable, while we wait for the results? Perhaps reduce my hours, if possible?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid point, Lilyanna. Fatigue can definitely exacerbate these symptoms. And yes, I would absolutely recommend considering reducing your hours or taking some time off, if possible, while we wait for the results. It will give your body a chance to rest and recover, and it may help alleviate some of the unsteadiness. It will also give us a clearer picture of what's going on if the symptoms improve with rest. I'm happy to write you a note for your employer, outlining my recommendations. In the meantime, please prioritize getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, and eating a healthy diet. Avoid any strenuous activity that triggers your symptoms. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease, or at least… lessened my anxiety. I appreciate your thoroughness and kindness. I'll schedule the tests and follow your recommendations. I suppose… I should get going. I have a shift to consider, and I need to make arrangements for some time off. Goodbye, Doctor Bombara.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Get some rest, and take care of yourself. Goodbye, and please let me know how it goes with scheduling the tests.
PATIENT: .
