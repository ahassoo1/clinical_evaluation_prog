DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 62 years of age. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, morning Doc. Just need a check-up for… well, a sports team tryout. Old man trying to prove he's still got it, you know? Hope that’s alright. Just need to make sure everything's working before I push myself too hard.
DOCTOR: A sports team tryout, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Mongolian wrestling, actually. It’s… a bit different than what most folks think of. Lots of strength, not so much running. Though I gotta be honest, getting a little harder to get up after a takedown these days. That’s why I’m here, make sure my bones are okay.
DOCTOR: Mongolian wrestling… interesting. And you’re concerned about potential issues with your… recovery time, then?
PATIENT: Something like that, yeah. Not that I'm old, but… you know. Things take longer to heal. Just want to be safe. Never had any major injuries, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll certainly assess that. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, anything along those lines?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. Never been told anything like that. I try to eat pretty good, mostly meat and dairy, like we always have. Not a big sweets guy. Doc back home always said my heart was strong. Never really needed much in the way of… regular check-ups, honestly. That’s why I put it off so long.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. Lucky, I guess. I've had a few bumps and bruises, naturally, from wrestling, but nothing that needed a doctor’s knife.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, cancer, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my father, he had some trouble with his joints when he got older. A lot of aches and pains, like I said. And my grandmother… she had something with her stomach, I think. But I don't really know the details, to be honest. We didn't talk much about that kind of thing back then.
DOCTOR: Alright, some joint issues and a possible gastrointestinal issue. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. Old habit, my wife used to make sure I took one. Haven’t been too good about it lately, though. No prescriptions, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin occasionally. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. We don't have a lot of fancy foods back home, so you kinda learn to eat what's available. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I wrestle. Try to practice a few times a week, when my bones cooperate. I live a pretty quiet life otherwise. Mostly just hanging around, watching TV, sometimes visiting friends. Don't drink much, don't smoke. Pretty boring, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of tobacco use?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched the stuff. My father always said it was a waste of money and bad for your lungs. I listened to him.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let’s proceed with a physical examination. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and assess your musculoskeletal system—your joints, muscles, and range of motion. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Get it over with, Doc. The sooner I know if I’m good to go, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please lie down on the table, we'll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Some crepitus in the knees and elbows, as expected with age. Range of motion is slightly limited, particularly in the left shoulder. No acute pain with palpation. Alright, that gives us a starting point.
PATIENT: Okay. That didn't sound too bad. The shoulder's been a little stiff lately, I guess that's what you were feeling. I've been trying to work it out, but it ain’t getting any easier. What does all that mean, Doc? Is it gonna stop me from wrestling?
DOCTOR: The crepitus and limited range of motion in your shoulder and knees are consistent with osteoarthritis, which is a common wear-and-tear condition. It doesn't necessarily mean you can't wrestle, but it does suggest you need to be cautious and listen to your body. The elevated blood pressure is something we’ll want to monitor as well. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. And an X-ray of your shoulder to assess the extent of any joint damage.
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work… alright. Sounds serious. How long does all that take? And is it expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: The blood work should be relatively quick—a few hours. The X-ray will take a little longer, as it needs to be read by a radiologist. As for the cost… I understand you don’t have insurance. The clinic offers a basic discount for self-pay patients, but it won't be negligible. I can have the billing department provide you with an estimate. I also recommend you speak with a physical therapist. They can teach you exercises to strengthen the muscles around your shoulder and knees, and help manage the pain. Perhaps a consultation with a specialist would be prudent, given your desire to continue wrestling.
PATIENT: Okay, okay… a lot to take in. Physical therapist, specialist… I just wanted to know if my bones were okay, not become a science project. Look, Doc, can you just tell me straight - can I wrestle or not? I don't wanna spend a fortune on tests and appointments if it’s just gonna tell me I’m too old.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your frustration. However, I cannot simply tell you whether or not you can wrestle without a proper evaluation. That would be irresponsible, and potentially dangerous. As I’ve stated, your shoulder exhibits signs of osteoarthritis, and your blood pressure is elevated. These factors warrant further investigation. I strongly advise you to proceed with the blood work and X-ray. It’s a small investment in your health, and will provide us with the information we need to make an informed decision. Continuing to wrestle without knowing the extent of the damage could lead to serious injury. It is my professional opinion that proceeding with these tests is the most prudent course of action.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. You're the doctor. Fine. Do the tests. But make it quick, okay? I got a tryout to train for. And get me that estimate for the bill. I need to know what I'm getting myself into. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the lab order and X-ray requisition prepared for you immediately. And I will have the billing department contact you with an estimate within the hour. I will also print out a referral for a physical therapist for your consideration. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with me once you've had the tests completed, so we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. Here are your documents. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. Thank you for your time, Mr. Kingan. .
