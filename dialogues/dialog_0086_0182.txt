DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s get on with it. It’s about this… procedure. The one my son insisted I get cleared for. Something about tightening up a bit of loose skin, I suppose. Honestly, I don’t see what the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Right. A cosmetic procedure. And your son is the one who scheduled this consultation?
PATIENT: Yes, that meddling boy. Says I “look tired”. Tired! I’ve lived a full life, I should look tired. He’s always been one for appearances, though. Always has. Anyway, he said I needed a check-up before… before they cut on me. Is that what you do here? Check if I’m not too old to have myself… fixed?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good of him to be thorough. It’s not simply about age, Mr. Orwin. We need to assess your overall health to ensure you’re a suitable candidate for any elective procedure, and to minimize potential complications. It’s… responsible. Now, let's start with a little history. Have you been generally healthy?
PATIENT: Generally healthy? Look, I’m eighty-one years old! What do you expect, a perfect bill of health? I’ve worked hard my whole life, laying terrazzo. It’s not exactly a desk job, you know. I’ve had the usual aches and pains. A bit of arthritis, naturally. But nothing a good soak in a hot tub couldn’t fix… before this whole fuss, that is. I don’t need a lecture about my age, Doctor. Just tell me if I’m healthy enough for the surgery or not.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It's not my intention to lecture. But "aches and pains" can be… significant. And arthritis isn’t just a single condition. To properly assess your risk, I need a bit more information. Do you know what type of arthritis you have – osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, something else?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. The doctor back home just gave me some pills and told me to take them when things flared up. Never bothered with fancy names. It’s in my hands mostly, and sometimes my knees. Makes bending a bit difficult. That’s about all I know. And honestly, I’ve learned to live with it. Doesn’t stop me from getting things done. So, can we just skip the medical quiz and get to the point? Is this surgery a bad idea or not? I have a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, at least. Just to check your range of motion, listen to your heart and lungs, that sort of thing. It’s standard procedure, and it will help me determine if further testing is needed before we can proceed. It won’t take long. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly. I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? Just don’t expect me to be doing any gymnastics. My working days are long behind me. Get on with it, then. The quicker this is over, the better. But I warn you, I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Orwin… and exhale. Good. Now, I’m going to feel your pulse in your wrists… And now, let’s take a look at those hands you mentioned. Could you open and close them for me, and rotate your wrists?
PATIENT: Here. Honestly, all this poking and prodding. It’s… unnecessary. There. Happy now? They ache, you know. Always have after a long day’s work. Used to be strong, these hands. Could lift a sack of cement with ease. Now… Just get on with it, Doctor. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I see. There’s some noticeable swelling in the knuckles, and limited range of motion, as you mentioned. And some Heberden’s nodes present… Now, if you could bend your knees for me, please. How far can you comfortably go?
PATIENT: Oof. Not very far, I’m afraid. There. That’s about as much as I can manage without… well, without feeling like I’m eighty-one years old. It’s a creaky business, Doctor, a creaky business. Are you writing all this down? Because it’s not going to get any better. Honestly, I told my son this was a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’m documenting everything, Mr. Orwin. And I understand your frustration. Based on this quick exam, it seems you have significant osteoarthritis in both your hands and knees. Now, do you have any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No. Never had a moment’s trouble with my heart. Strong as an ox, always has been. High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something once, years ago, but nothing serious. Pills fixed it, I suppose. And diabetes? No, I like a sweet roll now and then, but no diabetes. Worked too hard for that. Look, are you trying to find a reason not to do this surgery? My son already spent a fortune on it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I’m not trying to find a reason not to do the surgery. I am trying to determine if it is safe to do the surgery. Osteoarthritis, while common, can be complicated. And your history of high blood pressure, even if controlled, needs to be taken into account. Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I have no idea. Little white pills, mostly. I have a son who manages all that now. He brings a big bag of them every month. I just take what he gives me. Always have. Never bothered me. Look, can we just cut to the chase? Will this surgery make me look better, or won't it? That's all I care about. My son says it will take years off my face. Is it worth the risk? I’m eighty-one, after all. What do I have to lose?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, that is precisely the question we need to answer. While the surgery may improve your appearance, there are risks involved with any procedure, especially at your age. Without knowing your full medical history, including your medications and blood pressure control, and potentially running some blood tests to assess your overall health, I cannot responsibly advise you. I recommend we postpone scheduling the surgery until we have a clearer picture. I can order some basic labs and perhaps an EKG to check your heart function. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? An EKG? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds like you’re trying to talk me out of this. My son will be furious. He's already planned everything… the recovery, the follow-up appointments… everything. Fine. Fine! Do your tests. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And don’t keep me waiting. I haven't got all day, and frankly, I doubt my son does either. Just get it over with. But if these tests delay things for too long… .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. I’ll have the lab technician draw some blood, and we'll get an order in for the EKG. It should only take a few minutes each. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please continue taking your medications as prescribed by your son. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
