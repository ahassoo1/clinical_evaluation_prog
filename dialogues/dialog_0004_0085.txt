DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s this… discoloration. It’s quite bothersome, really. It just appeared, and frankly, it’s not a very pleasant sight. It’s on my arms, mostly, though I think I’m starting to notice it a little on my legs now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Discoloration, you say. And where exactly on your arms are we talking about?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not all over, thankfully. It’s mostly on the backs of my hands and forearms. Not the insides of my elbows, just… the tops. It's a sort of… brownish hue. Not a nice sun tan, I assure you. I haven’t been spending that much time in the sun. My husband prefers the shade, and I generally follow his lead. It just… appeared, like I said. A few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: A brownish hue… and you’ve noticed it developing over the past few weeks. Do you recall any specific event or change in routine around the time you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. That’s the frustrating part. Nothing comes to mind. We haven’t changed soaps, I haven’t started any new lotions… I did try a new brand of hand cream, a rose-scented one, but that was before I noticed the discoloration. And I didn’t care for it, so I stopped using it almost immediately. It smelled… artificial. I doubt that’s it, though. It was rather… pedestrian, really. A very common scent.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain associated with these areas?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. That's what's so odd about it. It doesn’t feel different. It just… looks different. It’s not uncomfortable, it’s just… unsightly. Honestly, I’m starting to worry it’s something… hereditary. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had very… delicate skin. Though I don’t recall her having anything quite like this. But she always did have a bit of a… pallor.
DOCTOR: I see. And you mentioned your grandmother had delicate skin. Did anyone else in your family have similar skin issues, or any unusual discolorations?
PATIENT: Well, my mother always said she had sensitive skin, but that’s hardly the same thing. Mostly she just avoided the sun. And my aunt, my mother’s sister, she had a lot of… freckles. But those are perfectly normal, aren’t they? Not this… brownish tinge. It’s not freckles, Doctor. It's more… mottled. Like old leather, almost. Though I wouldn’t dream of comparing my skin to leather, naturally. It’s just… a descriptive word. I’m rather particular about my appearance, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's go through some basics. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, no. Allergies are for… less refined people, frankly. I eat everything. Well, not everything, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband is the one who’s always worried about cross-contamination and such. He’s a bit… neurotic, bless his heart. I take a daily multivitamin, that’s all. And occasionally an aspirin, if I have a headache, but those are rather infrequent. I’m quite healthy, generally. I do get a bit tired easily, but I attribute that to… modern life. It’s so draining, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications, herbal supplements, or vitamins besides the daily multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, just the multivitamin. And occasionally, if I’m feeling particularly… run down, I’ll have a cup of chamomile tea. But that’s hardly a medication, is it? It’s a soothing beverage. My mother always said chamomile was good for the nerves. Though I don’t have nerves, naturally. I just like the taste. It’s very… calming. I don’t believe in relying on pharmaceuticals unless absolutely necessary. They always have such dreadful side effects, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. Could you please roll up your sleeves and extend your arms for me?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. There you are. Do be gentle, please. I have rather sensitive skin, you know. Though, ironically, it seems to be…discoloring. It’s rather confusing, isn’t it? A delicate complexion, yet prone to… this. I do hope it’s nothing serious. My husband would be terribly worried. He’s very… protective.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m noting brownish patches on the dorsal aspects of both forearms and hands. The skin feels normal to the touch – no thickening, tenderness, or warmth. The discoloration is fairly symmetrical. It doesn't appear to be actively inflamed. Have you noticed any changes in your nails recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. My nails are perfectly fine. I take very good care of them. A regular manicure, you see. Nothing fancy, just a simple polish. They’re a rather lovely shade of rose, actually. Though I suppose that’s irrelevant, isn’t it? My nails are not…discolored. They’re quite healthy. I’ve never had a problem with them. I do use a strengthening base coat, naturally. It’s important to protect one’s nails, don’t you think? They’re so… fragile.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing this discoloration without further testing. It could be a form of hyperpigmentation, possibly related to sun exposure, even minimal exposure, or perhaps a reaction to something you came into contact with. However, given the symmetry and the lack of other symptoms, we should rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a thyroid panel. We'll also want to consider a skin biopsy, just to be certain.
PATIENT: A biopsy?! Oh, my goodness. That sounds… rather invasive, doesn’t it? Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn't it just be… a harmless discoloration? My husband is a bit squeamish about medical procedures, you see. And frankly, so am I. I do hope it’s not something serious. A complete blood count and a thyroid panel, I understand. But a biopsy… Is there no other way? Honestly, Doctor, this is quite unsettling. I'm not at all fond of needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Bartock. A biopsy is the most definitive way to determine the cause of the discoloration and rule out more serious conditions. While it is a minor procedure, I appreciate your concern. We can certainly discuss alternatives, but without a sample of the skin, we're relying on guesswork. It's possible the discoloration is benign, but we need to be thorough. We’ll start with the blood tests and thyroid panel. If those come back normal, then we can discuss the biopsy further. I'll refer you to a dermatologist who specializes in skin biopsies. They can explain the procedure in detail and address any concerns you may have. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A dermatologist, you say? Well, that sounds… marginally better, I suppose. At least it’s a specialist. And blood tests… yes, I can manage blood tests. I do try to avoid needles whenever possible, but it’s a necessary evil, I suppose. A thyroid panel, too. Yes, alright. But please, Doctor, no talk of biopsies just yet. My husband would be terribly worried. And frankly, so would I. A dermatologist… yes. And blood tests. That’s all. Can we schedule those blood tests today? And a referral to this… dermatologist? I'd like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. It’s rather distracting, you see. This discoloration… it’s not very becoming.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I’m scheduling the blood work for you now, you can go to the lab just down the hall. The results should be available within a few days. I’m also putting in a referral to Dr. Anya Volkov, a highly-regarded dermatologist in the city. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Here’s the referral information and the lab order. I recommend calling Dr. Volkov’s office as soon as possible. Once she reviews your blood work, she’ll be able to determine the best course of action. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I do appreciate your… thoroughness. And for not pushing the biopsy immediately. I’m still rather anxious about it, naturally, but I suppose we must be sensible. I’ll go to the lab now and schedule an appointment with this… Dr. Volkov. Hopefully, she’ll have some good news. And perhaps a less… invasive solution. Thank you again. I’ll be sure to follow up as soon as I have the results.
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Bartock. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we'll proceed at your pace. Have a good day.
