DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Glymph, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Alese Glymph. Though, honestly, dates and names...they don't always stick with me these days. I appreciate you taking the time to see me, Doctor…Memmolo, was it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Memmolo. And you're welcome, though let's try to keep this…efficient. So, Mrs. Glymph, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this pain…down low. In my belly, really. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it’s…quite something. Very uncomfortable. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about…well, a condition I have. Something with my immune system. It’s awfully difficult to recall the specifics. It’s been happening more frequently lately, that's why I thought I should come in.
DOCTOR: Immune system… right. And how long has this “pain, down low,” as you put it, been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky question. The pain itself…perhaps a few months? But the feeling of something being off…much longer. Years, I suspect. It’s hard to pinpoint. It ebbs and flows, you see. Like the tide. And sometimes I just…dismiss it as getting older. Perhaps foolishly. But truly, Doctor, I couldn't say precisely when it began. It’s a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Years… right. And can you describe the pain specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specifics… Let me see. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More…a deep ache. A cramping, almost. And sometimes it feels like…pressure. Like something is swelling. It radiates…it goes across my lower belly. And it’s often accompanied by…a feeling of being quite unwell. A bit shaky, and tired. Though, I am always a bit tired, to be honest. It's difficult to differentiate, you see. It’s not a constant thing, thankfully. It comes in waves. But those waves…they’re becoming stronger.
DOCTOR: Waves, you say. And does anything seem to trigger these waves?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I haven’t noticed anything specific, truly. I thought perhaps certain foods…but no. Activity doesn’t seem to make it worse. Stress, perhaps? I do worry quite a bit, and when I do, everything feels…amplified. But it’s hard to say definitively. It just…happens. Which is, of course, the most frustrating part. I wish I could pinpoint a cause. I used to be so good at figuring things out…but my mind isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh…my. That’s…a personal question. Well…yes, actually. A bit. Things haven’t been…regular, shall we say. Sometimes…difficult. And other times…the opposite. It comes and goes, much like the pain. It’s rather embarrassing to discuss, to be frank. I hadn’t connected it to the pain before, though. You think it could be related?
DOCTOR: It could be. And have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I…I don't recall. I try not to look, you see. It’s…unpleasant. I believe…once, perhaps? A long time ago. But I couldn't be certain. I dismissed it as…hemorrhoids, maybe. A common ailment, I thought. I truly can't say with any certainty, Doctor. My memory is so unreliable these days. Is that…concerning?
DOCTOR: We’ll need to investigate further. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I believe I had a reaction to…sulfa, years ago. A rash, mostly. And a bit of itching. Nothing severe, thankfully. But I avoid it now, just to be safe. Other than that…no, I don’t think so. I have a rather robust constitution, usually. Though, with this…condition…I'm less certain about things these days. Is that something we should be particularly concerned about? The allergies, I mean.
DOCTOR: Noted. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure…Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And…oh, yes. Hydroxychloroquine. My previous doctor prescribed it for…well, for this immune system condition. And occasionally, a pain reliever. Ibuprofen, when things get particularly bad. But I try to avoid that as much as possible. It doesn’t seem to help much, honestly. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. And now, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than routine procedures?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a bit of a blur as well. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was quite young. And… Years ago, I was hospitalized for a flare-up of this…condition. Something with my joints. It was quite painful. I was in and out of the hospital for a few weeks. And… I believe there was something else. But the details…they’re so hazy. My mind isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. It's frustrating, I assure you. I want to be helpful, but I simply can't recall everything.
DOCTOR: Right. And did you have any surgical history besides your appendix?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. I believe…yes. Years ago, I had a hysterectomy. It was…routine, I suppose. Though it was quite a recovery. And… I think I had something done on my knee, many years ago. But honestly, Doctor, the details are so vague. It was a long time ago, and I've had so many procedures over the years. It’s all becoming a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. Do you have access to my previous medical records? Perhaps that would be helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. Let me pull them up. Alright. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a tricky one. My family…wasn’t very forthcoming with medical information. They weren’t ones for discussing such things. My mother…she had arthritis, I believe. And my grandmother…she suffered from something with her heart. But beyond that…I’m not sure. I never really asked. I should have, perhaps. But it wasn’t something we talked about. It’s rather frustrating, I know. I wish I had more information to share with you. It's difficult to diagnose anything without knowing what ran in the family, isn’t it? Is that…a problem?
DOCTOR: It complicates things, yes. And finally, social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol…just occasionally, a small glass of wine with dinner. Very rarely, though. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I've always been a very…temperate person. I believe in taking care of my health, as much as I am able. I suppose this…condition…has made me more mindful of that. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, however. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to perform a physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific. My joints aren't as flexible as they used to be, so I may need a little assistance getting situated. Is there a step stool nearby? Just in case.
DOCTOR: There is a stool. I’ll assist you. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh. Yes, actually. Right there. That’s…tender. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a…deep ache. Like a pressure. And…it radiates a little, across my lower belly. Is that…concerning? It’s been bothering me for quite some time, but it seems to be getting worse recently.
DOCTOR: There is some mild guarding in the left lower quadrant. No rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. I’m going to need to check your reflexes. Can you extend your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Though they aren’t quite as responsive as they used to be, I’m afraid. Is everything alright? I do have a bit of arthritis, so my reflexes aren't always…reliable. I hope that’s not interfering with the examination. Do you need me to try harder? I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are diminished bilaterally, but symmetrical. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I suspect this could be diverticulitis, or possibly inflammatory bowel disease. However, further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample to check for inflammation and infection. We’ll also need to schedule a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Diverticulitis…inflammatory bowel disease… Those sound…serious. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Should I be avoiding certain foods? Or…resting more? And…a CT scan? Is that…safe? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I just…I like to be prepared. And I do get anxious easily. Is this something that requires immediate hospitalization? Or can we…wait for the results?
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be anxious. Diverticulitis can be serious, but often manageable with antibiotics and dietary changes. Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic condition, but it can be controlled with medication. The CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but the benefits outweigh the risks in this case. We'll need to get a clear picture of what's going on. For now, I recommend a low-fiber diet. Avoid foods with seeds, nuts, and skins. Stay hydrated. And rest. As for hospitalization…no, not immediately. But if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools, go to the emergency room immediately. Here are your lab orders and the referral for the CT scan. Schedule it as soon as possible. We’ll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Low-fiber diet…avoid seeds and nuts… That sounds…restrictive. But I understand. I suppose I can manage. And…thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. When should I schedule the CT scan? And how long does it usually take to get the results back? I do worry about delays, you see. I have a tendency to…catastrophize. And…could this be related to this immune system condition I have? Everything feels so connected, but I can't seem to put my finger on it. Perhaps I should bring a list of my medications to the follow-up appointment? Just to be safe.
DOCTOR: You can schedule the CT scan at any time that's convenient for you. Results usually take 24-48 hours. As for the connection to your immune system condition…it’s possible. Both diverticulitis and IBD can be associated with immune dysregulation. That's something we'll investigate further. Yes, please bring a list of your medications to your follow-up appointment. It's always helpful to have a complete picture. I'm double booked now, so I won’t be able to discuss this further at this time. We'll go over everything in detail at your follow-up. We’ll schedule that with the receptionist before you leave. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You’ve…eased my mind considerably, despite the…uncertainty. I do appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It’s…reassuring to know that you’re taking this seriously. I suppose I’ll just…wait for the results, and try to be patient. Which, admittedly, isn't one of my strengths. Thank you again, Doctor Memmolo. Perhaps you could point me in the right direction?
DOCTOR: The receptionist is right over there. She'll schedule your follow-up appointment and answer any remaining questions you may have. I have another patient waiting, so I must attend to them now. Have a good day, Mrs. Glymph. .
PATIENT: .
