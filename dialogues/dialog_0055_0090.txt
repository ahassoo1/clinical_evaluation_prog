DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Please, have a seat. Now, I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Eaddy. Oh, um… yes. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe I scheduled this visit to… to make sure everything is alright before I proceed? It’s been a bit of time, and honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. I apologize if I’m being unclear.
DOCTOR: Surgery, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… a cosmetic procedure. For my… face. I’m hoping to… improve the appearance, perhaps? It’s difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been considering it for a while now, and I finally decided to take the step, but I was told I needed to get cleared by a doctor first. Is that correct? It all feels a little hazy, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, a pre-operative evaluation is… prudent. It's standard practice. Now, Ms. Brightful, let’s attempt to clarify this “improvement” you’re seeking. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it's… it has to do with some scarring. From… an accident, a long time ago. It's mostly on my cheek and… around my jawline. I’d like them to… be less noticeable, if that makes sense? I don't recall the specifics of the accident very well, I’m afraid. It happened some years ago, and… things are a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Scarring…and you wish to address it with a cosmetic procedure. Very well. Let's establish some medical context. Do you recall when this accident occurred, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s difficult. It was… several years ago. Perhaps… eight or nine years? It was before my… before my husband passed. So, definitely before 2017. I… I was much younger, of course. It was a… a car accident. But beyond that… I don't have many details. It wasn't my fault, I remember that much. But the specifics are… gone. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Eight or nine years ago. A car accident, not your fault. And you’ve had a… loss since then. Do you have any recall of medical treatment at the time of the accident?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. I remember… a hospital stay. And… bandages, of course. There was a lot of pain. I believe I needed some stitches. I… I was quite young, and very frightened. I recall a kind nurse who would bring me popsicles. But the details of the treatment itself are… lost to me. I'm fairly certain I saw a plastic surgeon initially, but I don't remember their name, or what they did… if anything. It all feels very distant. I was mostly focused on recovering, I suppose. And then… life moved on.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your current medical history, then. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I generally consider myself to be quite healthy. I eat a reasonable diet, and I try to stay active with my work – landscaping, as you can see from the paperwork. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything other than the accident. I take a daily multivitamin, and… occasionally, something for a headache, but nothing regular. I did have… a bout of the flu last winter, but that was it. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything chronic, if that’s what you mean. Oh, and I wear glasses, for reading. But that’s hardly a medical condition, is it?
DOCTOR: No, not particularly. And no history of chronic illness. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don't believe so. I’ve never knowingly had an allergic reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of foods, and I’ve tried many different medications over the years—mostly over-the-counter things for colds or aches. No hives, no swelling, no difficulty breathing… nothing like that. I’m fairly certain I’m not allergic to anything. Though, I do sometimes get a bit of a rash when I’m around certain plants—poison ivy, I think? But that's hardly an allergy, is it? Just… irritation.
DOCTOR: Poison ivy is a contact dermatitis, certainly worth noting. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, on a regular basis, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: No, not regularly, Doctor. Like I said, just the occasional headache pill—ibuprofen, I think. And the multivitamin, every morning. But I wouldn't call either of those "regular" medication. I don't take anything prescribed by a doctor, not at the moment. I haven't needed anything since… well, not since my husband passed, and that was… quite a while ago now. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Brightful, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Specifically, I’ll need to examine the area of scarring on your face. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly fine. Please, proceed whenever you're ready. I understand it's necessary. It’s just… looking at it always brings back unpleasant memories, but I suppose that’s unavoidable.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up straight and relax. I’ll need to assess the texture, color, and overall appearance of the scars. I’ll also palpate the area to determine if there is any underlying tissue abnormality. The scarring appears to be…hypertrophic, with some areas of discoloration. Palpation reveals…firmness and some textural irregularity. There’s no evidence of active inflammation currently, but the scars are quite prominent. I am noting some asymmetry as well. Do you experience any pain, itching, or discomfort in this area?
PATIENT: Um… no, not usually, Doctor. There’s a slight tightness sometimes, particularly in cold weather, but no actual pain. And occasionally, a bit of… a tingling sensation, but it’s very mild. It’s more of an awareness, if that makes sense? I don’t actively feel it unless I’m… touching it, or thinking about it. It doesn't interfere with my daily life, thankfully. It’s more of an aesthetic concern, really. It’s… quite noticeable, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Brightful, based on this initial assessment, and taking into account your medical history, I believe you are medically cleared for the cosmetic procedure. However… …given the nature of the scarring, and your… vague recollection of past treatment, I strongly recommend a consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon with extensive experience in scar revision. They will be able to provide you with a more detailed assessment and discuss the most appropriate treatment options.
PATIENT: Oh. I… I understand. That makes sense. So, you don't think… it’s something you can handle here? I was hoping to… keep things simple. I just wanted it… lessened, not… a whole ordeal. But if a specialist is recommended… …then I suppose I should listen. Could you perhaps recommend someone? Someone reliable? It all feels rather daunting, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes. As you stated, a specialist in scar revision is warranted given the complexity. I have compiled a list of several board-certified plastic surgeons in the area with expertise in this area. Dr. Eleanor Vance and Dr. Julian Bellweather both have excellent reputations. However, I would advise you to schedule consultations with multiple surgeons to discuss your goals and determine the best course of action. Do not proceed with any procedure without a thorough understanding of the risks and benefits. And ensure they have a documented history of successful scar revision cases. It's vital, given the… circumstances.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Eaddy. I appreciate your honesty, and the recommendations. It’s just… all rather overwhelming, to be frank. I suppose I should schedule those consultations as soon as possible. And I will ensure they have a good history, as you suggested. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any paperwork I need to complete? Or… any questions you have for me?
DOCTOR: No, I believe we've covered everything pertinent. Just be certain to inform any potential surgeon of your… limited recollection of past treatment and any previous medical care received. I’ll generate a summary report of our consultation for your records, which will include the referral list. My office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of your consultations, should you wish. Have a good day, Ms. Brightful.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Eaddy. I appreciate your time and assistance. I will be sure to schedule those appointments soon. And I will contact your office if I need anything further.
