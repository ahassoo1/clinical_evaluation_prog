DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jaxston. I'm Dr. Voytek. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly, it's…headaches. Bad ones. They come and go, and when they do come, it's pretty rough. I get all sweaty and my heart feels like it’s thumpin’ really hard. I don't really…keep track of when they happen, if that makes sense. It just feels like they show up outta nowhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches that come and go with associated sweating and a fast heartbeat… that definitely gives us something to look into. You said “out of nowhere,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, like…I’ll be doin’ stuff. Just normal stuff. Workin’, maybe watchin’ TV, even just…walkin’. And then BAM. Suddenly my head starts poundin’, and I feel kinda dizzy. Then the sweat starts, and my chest feels all tight. It doesn’t seem to be connected to anything specific, though. I wish it was, so I could avoid it or somethin’. It just…happens. It’s hard to explain. It usually lasts a few hours, maybe? I dunno, time gets kinda weird when I’m feelin’ bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s unpredictable, lasting a few hours, with dizziness, sweating and chest tightness. That's helpful. Have you noticed any patterns at all, even if they're not obvious?
PATIENT: Patterns… hmm. Not really, I don’t think so. I mean, I used to get 'em more when I was really stressed at work, but things have calmed down there a bit now. But they still happen. Sometimes it feels worse if I haven’t eaten in a while, but that might just be me feelin' hungry, y’know? And… now that I think about it, maybe they’re worse in the afternoons? But I honestly can't remember for sure. It’s all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially related to hunger and maybe worse in the afternoons, even though it’s not consistent. And you mentioned stress used to be a trigger. Let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside these headaches?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. Sometimes I feel kinda… tired, but I work a pretty physical job, so that's not super unusual. I haven't been sick, no fever or anything. My vision gets a little… spotty sometimes, but it’s quick, like when you stand up too fast. I don’t know if that’s related. And… oh! I’ve been a bit more irritable lately. My ex-wife and I… well, we’re not on the best of terms. Does that count? It’s been a rough divorce, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, occasional spotty vision, irritability related to a difficult divorce… thank you for sharing all of that, Jaxston. It all gives me a better picture. Now, let’s go over some more general medical questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I mean, I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, as far as I can remember. I don’t really take much medication, just the occasional painkiller for a sore back from work. And no food allergies that I’m aware of. I eat pretty much anything. Honestly, I don’t have a great memory for stuff like that. I’ve never had to worry about it before.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned taking painkillers for back pain occasionally. What kind of painkillers are you using, and how often?
PATIENT: Uh… I usually just grab whatever’s on the shelf at the drugstore. I think it's… ibuprofen? The white ones? I don't really pay attention to the name. I take ‘em maybe once or twice a week when my back’s really botherin’ me. Sometimes not even that. I try to avoid taking anything if I can, to be honest. I don’t want to get hooked on stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for back pain. Thank you. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can recall. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, like chickenpox, but nothing major. My doctor always said I was pretty healthy. I haven’t really been to the doctor much since… well, since the divorce, to be honest. It’s just been… a lot. I don’t think I’ve had any serious problems, no. I can’t think of anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single one. I’ve been lucky enough to avoid all that. I hate hospitals. They give me the creeps, to be honest. Never had a reason to be in one, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one, Doc. I wasn’t really close to my dad, and I don't really talk to my mum much anymore. She's… kinda difficult. I know my granddad on my mum’s side had something with his heart, but I don’t know what. And my aunt on my dad’s side had… I think it was diabetes? But honestly, I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. It was never really discussed. Sorry I can't be more helpful. It's kinda a blurry topic.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Uh… I used to drink a bit, mostly on weekends. A few pints with the lads after work. But I’ve cut back a lot since the divorce. It wasn’t helpin’ things, to be honest. I don’t smoke, never have. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I'm not into any of that. Just a bit of beer now and then, when I’m feelin’ up to it. Not much, though. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional beer, no smoking, no recreational drugs. And lastly, can you tell me about your work?
PATIENT: It's physical labor. I work at a warehouse, unloading trucks and stuff. Heavy lifting, lots of bending and twisting. It's a good job, pays the bills, but it’s hard on the body, to be honest. I’m on my feet all day, and it can be pretty stressful when we're behind schedule. It's not glamorous, but it keeps me busy. And it's mostly solitary work, which isn't always a bad thing, y’know?
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy physical labor at a warehouse. Thank you, Jaxston. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright. Just to check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and maybe a quick neurological check. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doc. I trust your judgement. Go ahead. I'm kinda nervous about what it all means, but I figure it’s best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Alright, please have a seat here. I'm going to start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90. It's not drastically high, but it's something we should keep an eye on. Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. It’s a soft murmur, but I’ll make a note of it. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal, and coordination seems fine. No obvious neurological deficits. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Okay, everything seems generally normal, but the elevated blood pressure and the murmur are things I want to investigate further. Do you have any history of high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Uh…no, not that I know of. No doctor’s ever told me I had it. I’ve not really been to the doctor much, like we said. Murmur, you say? What does that mean? Is that bad? I’m startin’ to get a bit worried now, Doc.
DOCTOR: Okay, it’s understandable to be worried. A murmur is just an extra sound when your heart beats. It doesn't automatically mean something is seriously wrong. It can be caused by a lot of things, some harmless, some requiring further investigation. And elevated blood pressure, even just a slightly high reading, can be a sign of several things, like stress, diet, or other underlying conditions. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some blood tests. We’ll check your cholesterol, kidney function, and also do a complete blood count. I also want to get an EKG done – that’s a simple test that records your heart's electrical activity. And finally, given your history of headaches and the murmur, I think a CT scan of your head would be a good idea, just to rule out anything serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Wow, that’s… a lot of tests. Blood tests, EKG, CT scan… I’m not gonna lie, Doc, that sounds kinda scary. Is it definitely necessary? I mean, I just thought it was bad headaches. I don’t wanna go overboard with tests if it’s not really needed. And… how much is all that gonna cost? I don’t have insurance, so… it’s gonna be expensive, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jaxston. It is a lot of tests, and you're right to be concerned about the cost, especially without insurance. However, given your symptoms – the headaches, sweating, fast heartbeat, the slightly elevated blood pressure, and the heart murmur – it’s important to rule out anything serious. The CT scan is primarily to rule out any structural issues in your brain causing the headaches. The EKG and blood tests will help us assess your heart health and look for any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I’m recommending these tests because it's better to be thorough, especially when dealing with something like headaches. Ignoring them could lead to a more serious problem down the line. As for the cost… I’ll be honest, it will be expensive. I can write you a prescription for the blood tests and EKG. You can inquire about costs with the lab and the EKG facility beforehand. Regarding the CT scan… it’s the most expensive part. I can provide you with a referral to a facility that offers financial assistance or a payment plan. I can also see if there are any local charities that might be able to help. Would you like me to provide you with the referrals and information about financial assistance?
PATIENT: Yeah, please. Give me the referrals. And the information about the financial assistance. I… I guess I don't really have a choice, do I? If you think it's important, and I can't afford to just ignore it… I'll do it. But I'm already stressed just thinkin' about the cost. I just… wish things were simpler. Thanks, Doc. I appreciate you explainin' it all, even if it's not what I wanted to hear.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaxston. I completely understand how you feel. It's never easy to hear that you need more tests, especially with financial concerns. I'll print out the referrals for the lab and the EKG facility, along with some information about financial assistance programs for imaging. I'll also write a note detailing your symptoms and concerns for the radiologist when you get the CT scan done. Please schedule those tests as soon as possible. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms—severe headache, fever, vision changes, chest pain, or difficulty breathing—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
