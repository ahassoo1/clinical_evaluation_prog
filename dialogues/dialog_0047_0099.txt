DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Minatra. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Press. It’s very kind of you to see me. Well, I received a letter regarding some… testing I had done recently with the GI doctor. It seems something wasn’t quite right, and I was advised to follow up with my primary care physician, which I understand is you. I must admit, I’m a bit anxious, as I don’t quite understand what all the results mean.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, I see here… a referral from Dr. Ramirez regarding some recent gastrointestinal testing. It's good you followed up. It is best to discuss these things properly. Now, before we delve into the results, could you tell me a little more about why Dr. Ramirez ordered the testing in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, for several months now, I’ve been experiencing… discomfort. Not pain, exactly, but a persistent feeling of fullness, even after eating very little. And, if I’m being truthful, some… irregularity. It’s been difficult to pinpoint anything specific, honestly. It just… hasn’t felt right. Dr. Ramirez thought it best to investigate, and that led to the testing. I hope that explains things sufficiently?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. “Persistent fullness, irregularity…” And how long have you been experiencing this “fullness” – several months, you said?
PATIENT: About… six months, I believe. It began gradually, almost imperceptible at first. I initially attributed it to simply getting older, you understand. But it became more pronounced, and I felt it was unwise to ignore it any longer. It’s… unsettling, to have your body feel so unlike itself. Perhaps a bit dramatic, but that is my honest feeling.
DOCTOR: Right. And would you describe this irregularity as constipation, diarrhea, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: That’s a… delicate question, Doctor. I suppose it’s been a bit of both, truthfully. Sometimes difficulty passing anything at all, and at other times… the opposite. It’s inconsistent, which is, I suspect, part of what concerned Dr. Ramirez. It isn’t predictable, and it’s certainly not comfortable. It feels… chaotic, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: “Chaotic” is… a descriptive term. Alright. And have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not that I've observed, thankfully. I always check, of course, as one does, but no, there hasn't been any blood. It's the unpredictable nature of everything, and the feeling of fullness, that’s been the most concerning. I feel as though I’ve eaten a large meal, even when I’ve barely touched my food. It’s… quite perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: No nausea, thankfully. And no vomiting either. As for weight loss… that’s a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, and I suppose I haven’t felt significantly different in that regard. Perhaps a little less energy, but I attributed that to… well, everything. It’s difficult to say definitively. My clothes fit much as they always have, if that is of any help. I haven’t needed to adjust my belt, if you will.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: That’s… diminished, I suppose. It’s not that I don’t want to eat, but I find myself feeling full very quickly. Even a small portion leaves me feeling quite bloated and uncomfortable. So, while I haven’t lost my desire for food, my capacity for it has certainly decreased. It’s… a rather unpleasant cycle, really. I eat less because I feel full so easily, and then feel weaker because of the lack of sustenance. A bit of a conundrum, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Certainly. I had my gallbladder removed approximately twenty years ago. Other than that… I’ve been quite fortunate, really. No major illnesses, no surgeries, nothing of that nature. I’ve always prided myself on being a rather healthy individual, up until these recent issues, of course. My husband… he was the one with the medical problems. I spent many years caring for him. It’s… ironic, isn’t it? I've spent my life caring for others and now...this. Perhaps I’m rambling. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Right, gallbladder removal. And any family history of gastrointestinal issues, such as colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother… she suffered from diverticulitis, I believe. It caused her considerable discomfort in her later years, but I don’t believe it was ever terribly serious. My father… he was a very stoic man. He didn’t speak much of his ailments. I don’t recall any major illnesses on his side of the family, truthfully. I do have a cousin, on my mother's side, who was diagnosed with colon polyps several years ago, but that’s the extent of my knowledge. I do hope that is helpful information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's… noted. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but nothing regular. I always believed in moderation, you understand. My husband, he enjoyed a good scotch, but I’ve never developed a taste for it myself. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea, if I’m being truthful. It’s much more soothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I truly try to avoid medications whenever possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself, you understand? I take a daily multivitamin, of course, and occasionally an aspirin for a headache, but that’s the extent of it. I've always been fortunate enough to remain in good health, so I haven’t needed to rely on any prescription drugs. It’s… a point of pride, perhaps. I always believed in a healthy diet and regular exercise. Although, admittedly, I haven’t been as active lately, with these recent issues. But generally, no, I’m not taking any medications.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mrs. Minatra, based on what you've told me and the referral from Dr. Ramirez, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. I’ve reviewed the results of your testing, and they do indicate some abnormalities. While I don’t want to alarm you, we need to rule out a few possibilities. I would like to conduct a physical exam now, if you don’t mind. Then we can discuss potential next steps. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. "Abnormalities," you say? That doesn't sound promising. A physical exam… yes, of course. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed. I understand the necessity of investigating further. I'd rather know what I'm facing, even if it's not good news. I suppose I’m ready. Although… if you wouldn't mind explaining the potential possibilities afterwards, I would be most grateful. I always find it helps to understand the reasoning behind things. Perhaps you could start with the least concerning options? That might ease my mind a little.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll start with a basic abdominal exam. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll listen to your bowel sounds and then palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. As for potential possibilities… we need to consider things like irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and, unfortunately, we can’t rule out the possibility of a malignancy. However, it's important to stress that these are just possibilities at this stage. We need further testing to confirm anything. Now, please relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. “Bowel sounds are… present, though slightly diminished. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain.”
PATIENT: Oh… malignancy. That is… unsettling. But you are right, of course. Best to know. I shall try to relax. “There’s… a slight discomfort here, on the left side. Not pain, exactly, but… a pressure. And… a little tenderness here as well, just below my navel.” I wince slightly. "Is that… normal?"
DOCTOR: “Tenderness left lower quadrant and periumbilical region.” Yes, some tenderness is not uncommon with gastrointestinal issues. However, the location and severity are important. “Does this cause any sharp pain, or is it more of a dull ache?
PATIENT: “Oh… that’s… a bit more uncomfortable, yes. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. But there’s a… a pressure as well. It feels… almost like a fullness, even though I haven't eaten anything recently. It’s… a rather peculiar sensation. And it seems to radiate slightly towards my back, on the left side. Not intense, but… noticeable.” I attempt to relax, but my muscles remain tense. “Is this… concerning, Doctor?” I ask, my voice laced with anxiety.
DOCTOR: “Tenderness LLQ, periumbilical region with radiation to left flank. Guarding present.” Yes, Mrs. Minatra, these findings warrant further investigation. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, I would like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will give us a more detailed look at your internal organs and help us determine the cause of your discomfort. It’s important to rule out anything serious. I’m also going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and inflammatory markers. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and more blood work. That sounds… rather extensive. But if it’s necessary to determine the cause… then yes, of course. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Although… would you mind explaining the potential implications of the CT scan? What are you hoping to see, and what would indicate a more… serious problem? I understand you may not want to alarm me, but I prefer to be informed, even if the news is not what I’d like to hear. It’s better to be prepared, wouldn’t you agree? And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m rather anxious, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Very well. The CT scan will allow us to visualize your liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and other abdominal organs. We’ll be looking for any signs of inflammation, obstruction, masses, or abnormalities in the bowel wall. A serious problem would include things like a tumor, a blockage in the intestines, or evidence of diverticulitis. However, it’s important to remember that these are just possibilities. Most likely, we’re dealing with something less serious, like irritable bowel syndrome. As for the timing, the CT scan should be scheduled within the next 24-48 hours. The results typically take 1-2 business days to come back. I understand your anxiety, Mrs. Minatra, and I will be sure to contact you as soon as the results are available. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for when we have the results to discuss them in detail. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… agreeable. 1-2 business days… I suppose I can manage that. It's just… the uncertainty is rather unsettling. A tumor… that is a frightening thought. But you are right, Doctor, it’s best not to jump to conclusions. And a follow-up appointment is certainly necessary. I would like that very much. "Would you mind writing down the instructions for the CT scan? And perhaps the name of the facility where I should go? I tend to be a bit forgetful, you understand. And… is there anything I should do to prepare? Fasting? Anything like that?" I ask, my voice laced with apprehension.
DOCTOR: "Here you are. The instructions for the CT scan, the facility’s name and address, and the phone number. You will need to fast for four hours prior to the scan, and you should drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. There’s also a contrast dye involved, so if you have any allergies, especially to iodine or shellfish, you’ll need to inform the radiology technician. I’ve noted that on here as well. Also, if you are pregnant or think you might be pregnant, you should tell them immediately. I've included a contact number for the radiology department if you have any questions. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: “Four hours fasting… and the contrast dye… iodine allergy… yes, I’ve always been a bit cautious with shellfish.” “No, I don’t believe I have any further questions at this moment, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. I suppose… I’ll just try to remain calm and await the results. And I’ll be sure to contact the radiology department if I have any concerns.” “Thank you, Doctor Press. I shall see you after the scan.” I rise slowly from the examination table, attempting to maintain a semblance of composure. “”
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms.
