DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. The pleasure is all mine. Well, I requested a general wellness check, a lab panel, if you will. I’ve been feeling… quite good, actually, but my wife, Esmeralda, she insists I stay on top of these things. Better safe than sorry, she says. And she is usually right, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of both of you, Mr. Mombrun. Preventative care is incredibly important. A general wellness check and lab panel is an excellent idea. Before we proceed, let’s gather a bit more information. Could you tell me a little about how you’ve been feeling specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically… hmm. Well, as I said, generally good. No aches, no pains that linger. My energy levels are… reasonable for a man of seventy-four, I suppose. I still enjoy my work – construction, you know. Keeps me moving. Appetite is good, sleep is… mostly good. Sometimes a little restless, but nothing a warm glass of milk doesn’t fix. I haven’t noticed any changes in my weight, thankfully. Esmeralda would have a word if I had! Is that the sort of thing you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Mombrun, that’s very helpful. You’ve given me a good starting point. It’s good to hear you’re remaining active and have a good appetite. Regarding the restless sleep, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not every night, you understand. Perhaps two or three times a week. I find myself waking up… not necessarily feeling uncomfortable, just… aware. Thinking. Sometimes about work, sometimes about the family, sometimes about nothing at all. It doesn’t last long, usually just a little while, and I can fall back asleep without much trouble. It’s more… a disruption than a true insomnia, if that makes sense. It doesn’t leave me feeling terribly tired in the mornings, thankfully. Esmeralda does occasionally comment that I toss and turn a bit more than usual.
DOCTOR: That's a useful distinction, Mr. Mombrun – a disruption rather than insomnia. And your wife’s observation is helpful as well. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… nothing major, thankfully. When I was a young man, back in Venezuela, I had a rather nasty bout of malaria. It was well treated, of course, and I haven’t had any trouble with it since. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains that come with a life of hard work. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. But it’s been well-managed with medication. I take a small pill every morning. And, oh, my knees, they aren’t what they used to be. A bit of arthritis, they said. But I manage. Is that the sort of thing you need to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very important, Mr. Mombrun. Thank you for sharing. The malaria, the hypertension, and the arthritis – I’m documenting everything. Could you please tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me think… it’s a small, white pill. The name… Esmeralda handles the refills, mostly. Ah, yes! It’s Lisinopril. That’s it. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, taken every morning with breakfast. I haven’t had any trouble with it, no side effects to speak of. It seems to keep everything under control.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the malaria?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing else. No surgeries, no other hospital stays. Just the malaria, many years ago. I’ve always been a rather… resilient man, I suppose. A bit of a stubborn one, perhaps, which helps with construction work. I’ve broken a few bones over the years – a wrist here, an ankle there – but nothing that required a hospital stay. Just a cast and a bit of time to heal. Esmeralda always took good care of me, though. She’d fuss over me something fierce.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've led a very active life, Mr. Mombrun, and have a wonderful support system with Esmeralda. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My family… it's a bit complicated, you understand. I come from a large family, mostly still in Venezuela. Heart disease, yes, unfortunately. My father had a rather weak heart, passed away when he was still a young man. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had diabetes. She lost her sight because of it. Cancer… I believe my cousin, a few years back, had some sort of cancer, but I’m not entirely sure what kind. As for Alzheimer’s… not that I’m aware of, thankfully. My mother, she was always very sharp, right until the end. It’s a worry, of course, with age, but no direct family history that I know of. It’s difficult to keep track, you understand, with so many relatives.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Mombrun, thank you. Knowing about the heart disease, diabetes, and potential cancer risk is important. Now, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My father, he smoked, and it wasn’t a pleasant sight, I assure you. I always believed in keeping my lungs clear, especially with the work I do. Esmeralda, she’s always been very supportive of that, as well. And what about alcohol? I enjoy a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally – a red wine, usually. But nothing excessive. Perhaps a glass or two, a few times a week. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Mombrun. So, no smoking history and very moderate alcohol consumption. Now, finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I’ve never had any trouble with pollen, dust, or any sort of food allergy. Esmeralda always makes sure of that, of course. She's very careful about what she cooks for me. A rather cautious woman, she is. But it’s a good thing, you understand. Better safe than sorry, she always says. I believe that covers everything, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Mombrun, that does seem to cover everything. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline reading and check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam is a good idea. I haven’t had one in a while, so it will be good to get checked over. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’d like to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I’ll palpate your abdomen and check your reflexes. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82, which is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range given your history of hypertension. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear, nasal passages are open, and throat is clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Overall, your physical exam findings are within normal limits, though we will need to investigate the slightly elevated blood pressure further.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. I appreciate you being so thorough. Slightly elevated blood pressure… is that something to be overly concerned about? I have been a bit stressed lately, with some issues back in Venezuela with family… perhaps that’s contributing to it? I take my Lisinopril every morning, as prescribed. Perhaps we need to adjust the dosage? Or maybe it’s just the stress, as I said.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly contribute to elevated blood pressure, Mr. Mombrun, and it's good you've identified that as a potential factor. However, it's also important to rule out other causes and ensure your medication is at the optimal dosage. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a complete blood count. These tests will assess your kidney function, liver function, cholesterol levels, and overall blood health. We should also repeat the blood pressure measurement at a different time of day to confirm the elevation. Do you have any allergies to latex or any contrast dyes, in case we need to consider any imaging in the future?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies to latex or contrast dyes. I've never had any problems with either. I've had a few minor injuries over the years, construction work, you understand, but nothing that required any major procedures or imaging. I'm just glad we're getting this checked out. It's better to be cautious, as Esmeralda always says. And I trust your judgement, Doctor. You seem very thorough and knowledgeable.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Mombrun. I appreciate that. I'm ordering the labs now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. She'll give you instructions on fasting if necessary. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your Lisinopril as prescribed and focusing on stress management techniques, if possible. Would you be interested in discussing some resources for stress reduction, such as mindfulness exercises or relaxation techniques?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Mindfulness exercises… hmm. I suppose that could be helpful. I’ve always been a practical man, and it’s difficult for me to sit still and… well, just be. But I’m willing to try. Perhaps some information on relaxation techniques would be more useful. Something I can do while I’m resting in the evenings, maybe. Esmeralda does a bit of gardening, and she finds that very relaxing. Perhaps I should join her.
DOCTOR: That's a wonderful idea, Mr. Mombrun. Spending time with Esmeralda and engaging in a relaxing activity like gardening is an excellent way to manage stress. I can print out some information on relaxation techniques – deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery – for you to take home. Before we finish, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve answered all my questions. I appreciate your time, and I appreciate your concern. I’ll wait for the nurse, and I’ll see you when the results are back. Thank you again, Doctor Shely. You have my gratitude.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: You as well, Doctor Shely. And thank you once again.
