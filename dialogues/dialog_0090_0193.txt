DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Kur. It is… a little embarrassing to talk about, but I have been having… much gas. More than usual, you see. It is… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It happens… at all the wrong times, Doctor. Like… when I am trying to concentrate at work, or… if I am sitting quietly. It is… not polite, and it makes me feel… uncomfortable. I work at the burger place, you know, and… well, you can imagine.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? At least a month. It was slow at first, just a little bit more than usual. But the last week… it has been… quite a lot. I am… not sure if something I ate, or… I do not know. I eat the same things mostly.
DOCTOR: And what do you typically eat, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Well… at work, I sometimes eat the french fries. A small order. And a burger, maybe once a week. Usually just a plain burger. At home… I like soup. Vegetable soup, mostly. And bread. I eat a lot of bread. And… sometimes, a little bit of sausage. But not much. It is… simple food, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Bread, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. White bread, usually. Or rye bread sometimes. It is… easy to eat. And… I like the taste. Is bread… bad for this? I do not know much about what causes… this problem. I have never had to come to a doctor for gas before.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Goodstein, let's just say some foods are… more conducive to gas production than others. White bread, in particular, isn't known for being easy on the digestive system. Do you experience any bloating or abdominal pain along with the gas?
PATIENT: Bloating… yes, Doctor, I think so. My stomach… it feels full, even when I have not eaten much. And… sometimes a little bit of cramping. Not bad pain, just… uncomfortable. It happens… after I eat, mostly. Especially after the bread, I think. But sometimes with the soup too. It is… hard to say for sure. I am not very good at knowing what is happening inside my body.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. I have been a little tired, I suppose. But… I always feel a little tired. I work long hours, you know. And… no, I don’t think so. No… changes in my… bowel movements. Nothing like that. Just the gas, and the bloating, and a little bit of tiredness. And… maybe a little bit of heartburn sometimes, after I eat a big meal. But not often.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your abdomen, and feeling it a bit. Nothing invasive, just to get a better sense of things.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. Is there… anything I should do beforehand? Should I… empty my pockets? I have my wallet, and… some small coins. And… a handkerchief.
DOCTOR: Empty your pockets, yes. And just lie flat on the table, please. We'll start with listening.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I am ready. Do you… need me to do anything? Breathe a certain way? I am… not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: Breathe normally, Mr. Goodstein. Just relax. Hmm. A little tenderness here, on the left side. And… yes, some increased bowel sounds. Okay. Nothing too concerning, but it does suggest some… digestive upset.
PATIENT: Digestive upset… Is that… serious, Doctor? Should I… worry? I do not want to be… sick. I need to work, you know. And… I do not have much money for… medicine.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, let's not jump to conclusions. "Digestive upset" is a broad term. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. It simply means your digestive system isn't functioning optimally. Now, given your symptoms and the exam findings, it's likely related to your diet. We'll start with some simple changes. I want you to significantly reduce your intake of white bread. Try switching to whole-grain bread, and limit your portion sizes. Also, try to incorporate more fiber into your diet – vegetables, fruits, things like that. We'll see if that helps. If your symptoms persist, we can consider further testing, but let’s try this first.
PATIENT: Whole-grain bread… and more vegetables… Yes, Doctor. I can… try that. It will be… difficult, maybe. I like white bread. But… I want to feel better. And… I need to work. So, I will… make an effort. How long should I… try this for? Before I come back?
DOCTOR: Two weeks. Give it two weeks, strictly adhering to the dietary changes. If you don't see a noticeable improvement in your gas, bloating, and overall comfort, then schedule a follow-up appointment and we'll discuss further options. I'm making a note of this in your chart. And Mr. Goodstein, try to manage your stress. Stress can exacerbate digestive issues. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Stress… Yes, Doctor, I understand. Work is stressful sometimes. But… I do not know how to… manage it. I just… work. Is there… something I can do? A… a pill, perhaps? But… I have no money for… expensive pills. And… the whole-grain bread… where do I find that? Is it… expensive? I go to the small grocery store on Elm Street. They do not have much… variety.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, honestly. A pill is not the answer to everything. And stress management… that requires effort on your part. As for the bread, any grocery store should carry whole-grain options. It may be slightly more expensive than white bread, but it’s a worthwhile investment in your health. Ask the store clerk if you can't find it. And frankly, if you're concerned about the cost, perhaps you should consider reducing unnecessary expenses elsewhere. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. I will… try my best. I will find the whole-grain bread, and… I will try to reduce my stress. And… I will see if it helps. Two weeks, you said? I will… make an appointment then, if it does not. Thank you, Doctor. I hope… I hope it works. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Very well. That will be all, Mr. Goodstein. The receptionist will schedule your follow-up if needed. Have a good day.
