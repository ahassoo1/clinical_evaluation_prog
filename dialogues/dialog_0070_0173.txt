DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Abady, nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve just been getting these chills, and it’s a little worrying. It started a couple of days ago, and it keeps happening on and off.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills that started a couple of days ago, coming and going. Can you tell me a bit more about those chills?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… They’re not like, shivering cold, more like a sudden wave of coldness that goes through me. It doesn’t last long, maybe five or ten minutes, and then it’s gone. It doesn’t really matter what I’m doing when it happens, I could be sitting, walking, even just talking. I don't know if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Jailenne. Those details are helpful. So, a brief wave of coldness, regardless of activity. Have you noticed anything with those chills?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Sometimes I feel a bit tired when they happen, just really wiped out for a little while afterwards. And… now that you mention it, I think I had a bit of a headache yesterday when it happened, but it wasn’t a bad one. Nothing I needed to take anything for.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue accompanying the chills, and a mild headache yesterday. Have you had any fever, cough, or sore throat with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever, cough, or sore throat. Definitely nothing like a cold or the flu. I checked my temperature yesterday just to be safe, and it was normal. I haven't really had any other symptoms, to be honest. Just the chills, tiredness, and that little headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, cough, or sore throat. Just the chills, fatigue, and the headache. Let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you been experiencing any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Everything’s been pretty normal, I think. Work’s been busy, but that’s usual. I haven’t been traveling anywhere, and I haven’t been around anyone who’s been sick, as far as I know. Oh! I did start a new exercise class last week, a Zumba class, but I’m enjoying it and haven’t pushed myself too hard. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Jailenne. Starting a new exercise class is relevant. Okay, so no recent travel, no sick contacts, and you've started a Zumba class. Let’s go through some general health questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had bad asthma when I was a kid, but I grew out of it years ago. I don’t take any regular medication, and I haven’t been to the hospital for anything serious in… well, probably over ten years. I had my gallbladder out when I was in my early twenties, but that was just a routine thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood asthma that’s resolved, gallbladder removal years ago, no current medications. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I have sensitive skin, so I’m careful about what lotions and things I use, but that’s not an allergy, just… being cautious!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And just to be thorough, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me think… My mum has high blood pressure, and my dad had diabetes, but other than that, not really. My grandparents were pretty healthy, all things considered. Nothing major that I’m aware of, anyway. I mean, everyone gets something when they get older, right? But nothing like, a really serious inherited condition.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Jailenne. High blood pressure in your mother, diabetes in your father. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work full time as a Health Education Specialist, so I'm on my feet a lot, talking to people. I try to eat healthy, lots of fruit and vegetables, but I do have a sweet tooth, so I have to watch that. I don't smoke, and I only drink occasionally, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Like I said, I started that Zumba class last week, and I really enjoy it. I try to get a good night’s sleep, but work can sometimes make that difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fairly active lifestyle, healthy diet with a sweet tooth, no smoking, occasional alcohol, and a new Zumba class. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take your temperature and blood pressure. It's all routine. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 122/78, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Do you have any pain anywhere at the moment?
PATIENT: No, no pain anywhere. Everything feels normal, apart from those chills, of course. Is that blood pressure okay? I always worry about it, my mum’s always going on about hers.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is perfectly fine, Jailenne. 122/78 is well within the normal range. It’s good that you’re aware of your mother’s blood pressure, but yours is nothing to worry about. Given your symptoms – the chills, fatigue, mild headache, and normal vital signs – it’s difficult to pinpoint a cause definitively at this stage. It could be a mild viral infection, even though you don’t have a fever or other typical cold symptoms. The Zumba class could also be playing a role, as your body adjusts to the new activity. It's also possible it's a response to stress. I'd like to order some routine blood work just to rule out anything more serious, like an infection or thyroid problem. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. I’d rather be safe than sorry, definitely. Blood work sounds good. I mean, I’m pretty healthy usually, so I’m hoping it’s just something minor. What kind of blood work are we talking about? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: We'll do a Complete Blood Count – that checks your white blood cell count and can detect infections. We'll also check your thyroid-stimulating hormone – TSH – to rule out any thyroid issues, and a basic metabolic panel – that checks your kidney function and electrolytes. And yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning, if that works for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning sounds good. So, no breakfast? That’s going to be tough! Okay, I can manage. Where do I go to get the blood work done? And will I get the results straight away, or will I have to wait for you to contact me?
DOCTOR: No breakfast, I understand! It's a small sacrifice for peace of mind. The blood work will be done at the lab just down the hall, room 203. They'll take care of everything there. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. My office will contact you as soon as they're available. I’ll review them and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan, if necessary. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. 24-48 hours is fine. So, no need to do anything special before the blood work other than not eat? Okay, great. I think that’s everything then. Thank you, Dr. Abady. I feel a lot better knowing we’re getting it checked out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. No, just the fasting. And you’re right, it’s always best to be thorough. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe headache, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms – please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. Here's a written summary of our discussion and the lab order. If you don't mind, I'll make a note for my assistant to call you tomorrow to confirm the blood work appointment. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Dr. Abady. That was really helpful. I'll see you next week then, hopefully with some good news!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I hope so too. Get some rest, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
