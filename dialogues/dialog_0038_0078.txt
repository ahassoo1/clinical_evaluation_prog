DOCTOR: Good morning, Aeisha. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. I’m hoping you can help me feel like myself again. I’ve been feeling quite low energy and just…not quite right. I suppose I’m looking for a sort of…reset, or a jumpstart, to my health, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely does make sense, Aeisha. Feeling “stuck” and low energy is frustrating. We can definitely work on getting you feeling more like yourself again. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It didn’t happen all at once, you see. It’s been…gradual. Perhaps six months ago, maybe a little longer, I started noticing I was tiring more easily. Little things, like climbing the stairs, or even just a long day at work, would leave me completely drained. And it’s gotten…worse steadily since then, I think. Not a sudden drop, just…a slow fade.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slow fade over six months. That’s helpful to know. And what sort of work do you do, Aeisha?
PATIENT: I’m a molder, shaper, and caster – mostly with clay and things like that. It’s quite physical, actually, lots of handwork and standing. We create decorative pieces, mostly for gardens and homes. It’s… rewarding work, but it can be demanding on the body, naturally.
DOCTOR: Right, so a physically demanding job. And have you noticed this fatigue impacting your work at all?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. I used to be able to work for hours without needing a break, but now… I have to stop much more often. My hands ache more quickly, and it’s harder to concentrate. I've started making more mistakes, too, which is frustrating. It’s… it's worrying, honestly. I enjoy my work very much, and I don't want to have to slow down or stop altogether.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Aeisha. That sounds really tough. Okay, let’s try to get a clearer picture. Besides the fatigue and hand aches, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My sleep hasn’t been the best, I suppose. I don’t have trouble falling asleep, but I wake up several times during the night. And I don’t feel very rested when I wake up, even if I’ve slept for a full eight hours. It’s… unsettling. And I’ve been a little more…forgetful lately, I think. Not anything major, just…misplacing things, or forgetting appointments. It’s not like I’m losing my mind, but it’s definitely not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, disrupted sleep and some increased forgetfulness. That’s good information. And how’s your appetite been?
PATIENT: That's…a little tricky. It hasn't changed drastically, but I haven't been enjoying food as much lately. I still eat, because I know I need to, but it feels…bland. Things just don't taste as good as they used to. And I find I'm not craving much of anything, either. It's not that I'm losing weight, or anything, just…a general lack of interest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your mood?
PATIENT: That's a difficult question. I wouldn’t say I’m sad, exactly. More…flat, I suppose. Less enthusiasm for things I used to enjoy. It's hard to explain. I still spend time with my husband, and we talk, but… I don’t feel as connected as I used to. I just feel…distant, sometimes. It’s worrying, because we’ve always been very close.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aeisha. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you're experiencing a number of changes that are definitely impacting your quality of life, and I appreciate you being so open about it. Before we move on, just to be thorough, have you had any fever, unexplained weight loss, or any muscle aches or joint pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I haven't lost any weight, as I mentioned. The aches are mostly in my hands, from the work, I think. Not throughout my whole body, just…where I use my hands a lot. No joint pain, either. I'm quite certain of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you’re being treated for?
PATIENT: Not really. I’m on Medicare, as I get older, naturally. I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that’s it, really. Otherwise, I’ve been quite healthy, all my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension and a cholecystectomy ten years ago. Do you take any other medications besides those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one for the blood pressure. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. I believe in…natural remedies, when possible, of course, but I understand sometimes medication is necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No allergies at all, as far as I know. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My husband always jokes that I could eat anything and be fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit complicated. My mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father had heart problems. They both lived a good long life, though, despite those conditions. And I have a sister who has arthritis, but that’s about it, as far as I know. Nothing major on either side, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes, heart problems, and arthritis. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ve been married to my husband, Ricardo, for thirty years. We don’t have any children. I enjoy spending time with him, of course. I enjoy gardening, as you might imagine, given my work. And I like to cook, when I have the energy. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. And I try to stay active, when I can, but… it’s been harder lately, as you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know, Aeisha. So, thirty years of marriage, enjoying gardening and cooking, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and trying to stay active. Right. Well, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think might be relevant that we haven't covered?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! Work stress, perhaps. It’s been a little more demanding lately, with deadlines and custom orders. I try not to let it bother me, but… it does add to the overall feeling of being overwhelmed, I suppose. And the clay dust, naturally. I try to wear a mask, but sometimes I forget, or it’s just… inconvenient. It can’t be good for my lungs, naturally, but I haven’t had any serious problems, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased work stress and potential clay dust exposure. Thank you for mentioning that, Aeisha. That’s good to know. Right. Well, with all that information, I think it would be helpful to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Okay, your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs sound clear, though I do hear some subtle diminished breath sounds, especially at the bases. This could be related to the clay dust exposure, or it could be something else. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly so. Next, I'll check your pulse and temperature. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6. Now, let's take a look at your throat, ears, and nose. Everything looks clear here. Finally, I'm going to check your reflexes and muscle strength in your arms and legs. Your reflexes are normal, and your muscle strength is good in all extremities. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems generally normal, but the slightly diminished breath sounds and elevated blood pressure are things we'll want to keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That was…thorough. I appreciate you taking the time. The diminished breath sounds don’t surprise me, with the clay dust, but… what does this all mean? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you asked. Based on everything you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing a combination of factors. The fatigue, sleep disturbances, forgetfulness, and flat mood could be related to a number of things, including stress, and potentially mild depression. The diminished breath sounds could be from the clay dust exposure, and the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we’ll want to monitor. It’s unlikely to be anything serious at this point, but we need to rule out a few things. I'd like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels , and a complete blood count to rule out anemia. We should also do a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and rule out any inflammation or infection. Do that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…very sensible, Doctor. Blood work and a chest X-ray. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary. It’s…a relief to know you’re taking it seriously. And… what about the stress? And the…flat mood? Is there anything I can do for that while we wait for the test results? I don’t want to rely on medication, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can certainly address the stress and mood while we wait for the test results. Medication isn’t always necessary, and often lifestyle changes can make a big difference. I recommend trying some stress-reduction techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga. Regular exercise, even a short walk each day, can also be very helpful. And it’s important to make sure you’re getting enough sleep and eating a healthy diet. We could also explore some talk therapy options. A therapist could help you develop coping mechanisms for stress and address any underlying emotional issues. Would you be interested in learning more about those options?
PATIENT: Yes, please. All of those sound…appealing, actually. Deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga… I used to enjoy yoga, but I haven’t done it in years. And talk therapy… I’ve always been a little hesitant, but… perhaps it’s time. Could you recommend a good therapist? Someone who specializes in stress and mood disorders? And… how long does it typically take to see results with those techniques?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I have a list of excellent therapists in the area who specialize in stress and mood disorders. Let me see… Dr. Eleanor Vance is very highly regarded. She uses cognitive behavioral therapy, which is very effective for managing stress and improving mood. And Dr. Mark Olsen is another good option. He specializes in mindfulness-based therapy, which can help you develop coping mechanisms for stress and anxiety. I can give you their contact information and you can schedule a consultation to see if they’re a good fit for you. As for how long it takes to see results, it varies from person to person. Generally, it takes a few weeks to start noticing some improvement with therapy and lifestyle changes. It’s important to be patient and consistent with your efforts. It's not a quick fix, but with dedication, you can definitely start feeling better. For the blood work and chest X-ray, I'll send an order to the lab. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and develop a more tailored treatment plan. Does that sound like a good plan, Aeisha?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… excellent, Doctor. Dr. Vance and Dr. Olsen – I’ll look into them both. And I understand it takes time and effort. I’m willing to do what it takes to feel like myself again. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your time and your patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aeisha. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I'm here for you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'll have the lab orders sent over electronically, and I’ll give you the contact information for both therapists. And please, take care of yourself. If you don’t mind, I’ll make a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the test results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks from today would be perfect. That gives me time to get the tests done and… perhaps start some of the exercises. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel… much better already, just knowing we have a plan. Goodbye, Doctor Auelua.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aeisha. I'm glad to hear that. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in two weeks. .
