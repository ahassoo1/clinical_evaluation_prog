DOCTOR: Hi Teretha, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, one of the family medicine doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Morenomartinez. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… tingling. It’s mostly in my hands and feet, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now, and I figured I should probably get it checked out. I’m Teretha Uzarski, by the way.
DOCTOR: Nice to meet you too, Teretha. Okay, tingling in your hands and feet… and when you say “a little while,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… three, maybe four months now? It comes and goes, it’s not constant. Some days I barely notice it, and others… well, others it’s a bit bothersome. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… feels like pins and needles. And sometimes, it feels a little numb. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Comes and goes for about three or four months, tingling and numbness… okay. And is it both hands and both feet, or just one of each?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Both hands and both feet. It seems to be worse on my feet, though. Especially in the evenings, after I’ve been on my route all day. You know, delivering the mail. It’s a lot of walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse with activity, especially after a long day of walking. That’s good to know. Have you noticed it spreading anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s stayed in my hands and feet. I haven’t noticed it going up my arms or legs, or anything like that. I was getting a little worried, that’s why I came. It just… felt off. And it’s not getting better, you know? Still the same as when it started.
DOCTOR: Right, staying localized is good. And it hasn’t improved at all over the last few months. Okay. Let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. I mean, I get tired, but that’s just from the job, you know? I’m 63, and delivering mail is hard work. Sometimes my ankles swell a little at the end of the day, but I figured that was just from being on my feet so much. Nothing else, really. No weakness, no pain anywhere else, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no weakness, no pain, just the fatigue and occasional ankle swelling. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise. And I had a gallbladder taken out years ago, but that was… a long time ago. Other than that, not really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know? I don't think anything serious. I was widowed five years ago, and my husband took care of most of the doctor visits when we were married. I don’t keep up with things like that very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure controlled with diet and exercise, gallbladder removal years ago. And you’re widowed, so your husband managed most of your medical care previously. I understand it can be hard to keep track of everything. Do you know when the gallbladder was removed, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… let me think. Probably… twenty years ago? Maybe a little more? It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember dates very well. It was before my husband got sick. I just remember being in the hospital for a few days and then feeling a lot better after that. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Twenty years ago for the gallbladder removal. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I don’t take any medications regularly. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it when I started eating better and walking more. I try to avoid pills if I can, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and not currently on any medications. Good. And are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother had… arthritis, I think. Bad arthritis in her hands. And my father… he had heart trouble. He had a heart attack when he was fairly young. I don't know much beyond that, to be honest. We weren't very close. He was always… distant. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis and heart trouble. That’s good to know. Now, before we do a quick exam, let me ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink in… well, probably since my husband passed away. Didn’t really care for it much even before that. And definitely no drugs. Just a plain old lady, really! I just like to garden and walk my dog. Is that okay? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Teretha. You're not rambling, and that’s all very helpful information. That sounds like a lovely lifestyle. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. Can you please sit on the examination table, and we'll start with your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, I can do that. I hope I'm not too much trouble, Doctor. It's just… I get nervous at the doctor's office.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Teretha. You're not trouble at all. I understand. We'll just take a quick look. Okay. Pulses are a little diminished, but present in both feet. Some decreased sensation to light touch in your toes, mostly in both feet. Reflexes are a little diminished as well, but not drastically. I’m not seeing any significant swelling or redness. Now, let's check your hands. Can you hold your hands out for me, palms up?
PATIENT: Alright, here they are. They’ve been a little shaky lately, to be honest. Just from… getting older, I suppose. I used to be able to knit all sorts of things. Now it's a bit difficult. I hope everything is alright, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Pulses are good in both wrists. Strength is good – you’re gripping firmly. Sensation is a little diminished in your fingertips, similar to your feet. No significant swelling or redness. Okay. It sounds like we're dealing with some peripheral neuropathy – some nerve damage causing the tingling and numbness. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s causing that neuropathy, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out things like diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… neuropathy? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad? Blood work… alright, if you think it’s necessary. I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t like feeling… uncertain. What kind of blood work are we talking about? Is it a lot? I’m not a fan of needles, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, but it’s also very treatable, Teretha. And many things can cause it. That’s why the blood work is so important. It helps us pinpoint the cause. As for the amount, it's a pretty standard panel - we'll check your blood sugar, vitamin B12 levels, thyroid function, and a few other things. It's probably about eight or ten vials of blood, which will be taken at the lab. It's not a huge amount, and the phlebotomists there are very skilled. I’ll write you a requisition. The lab is just down the hall, and they're used to people being nervous about needles. They'll do their best to make you comfortable. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Eight or ten vials… that sounds like a lot. But alright, if you think it’s best. I suppose I can manage. Just… please make sure they’re gentle. And what happens after the blood work? How long will it take to get the results? And then what? Will I need more tests? I just… I’m a bit overwhelmed, Doctor. My husband always handled these things. I'm sorry for rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Teretha. It's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. And I'm happy to explain everything. The results usually take about three to five business days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Depending on the results, we might need to do further testing – perhaps a nerve conduction study, which measures how quickly signals travel through your nerves, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let’s just focus on getting the blood work done. I’ll write you a requisition, and I'll also give you a sheet with instructions about fasting beforehand. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Fasting… oh dear. How long do I have to fast? I usually have a cup of tea and a little toast in the morning. Will that be alright? And will the lab call me to schedule the appointment? I don’t have a lot of energy for making phone calls, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently. You’re very kind.
DOCTOR: You'll need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks – water is okay. A cup of tea would unfortunately break the fast. And yes, the lab will call you to schedule the appointment. They're very good about helping people with scheduling. Here's the sheet with the lab's phone number and a few tips for preparing for the blood draw. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Morenomartinez. You’ve been very helpful and kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I'll go and get the blood work done as soon as possible. I just hope it's not something too serious. I think… I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teretha. I'm glad I could help. Don’t worry too much, we’ll get to the bottom of this. And if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up, don’t hesitate to call the office. You can reach us at 555-123-4567. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
