DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now. I don’t really have time for this, if you don’t mind. Just want to know what it is and get something for it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Tammie. We’ll get to the bottom of it. “A little while now” – can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… I don't know. A week? Maybe more. It comes and goes. It’s not… debilitating, you understand. Just annoying. And I have things to do. Is that alright? I really don’t keep track of dates very well. My husband… he always remembered things. Now…it’s just… difficult.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Tammie. No need to worry about precise dates. A week or so gives me a good starting point. And it's understandable that things are difficult right now. You mentioned it comes and goes – is it constant pain, or does it flare up at certain times?
PATIENT: It’s just… a soreness, mostly. When I talk too much, it gets worse. And when it’s dry. You know, like if I haven’t had enough water. It’s not… a sharp pain, if that makes sense. More like… rough. Like sandpaper. Honestly, I don’t see what a doctor can do about sandpaper.
DOCTOR: That's a very descriptive way to put it, Tammie – “rough, like sandpaper.” I appreciate that. It helps me understand what you're experiencing. Dryness definitely plays a role in throat discomfort. Let's explore this a bit more. Aside from talking and dryness, are there any other things that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Well… dust. Definitely dust. I work with, you know, things. Separating them. Filtering. It’s a dusty job. And sometimes… sometimes when it’s cold. A cold draft. Honestly, I think it’s just part of the job. You can’t expect to work with… things… without getting a little bit of dust in your throat. It’s common sense. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: Yes, Tammie, we are. So, a sore throat that’s worse with talking, dryness, dust, and cold drafts. That gives us a lot to work with. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I just have a sore throat. I haven’t been… ill. No fever, no cough, no… anything. I told you, it's just annoying. Are you going to ask me about my toes now? Honestly. Some doctors just try to find things that aren’t there.
DOCTOR: No toes, Tammie, I promise. I'm just trying to get a complete picture. It’s important to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing? Not really. It’s a little… uncomfortable sometimes with very dry things, like crackers. But I avoid crackers. They’re bad for you anyway. I mostly drink water. And tea. Does that make sense? I don't want to waste your time. I have a schedule.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Tammie. So, no significant difficulty swallowing, just a little discomfort with very dry foods. And you've mentioned being careful with your diet. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, Doctor, I barely remember what I had for breakfast. My husband took care of all that. I… I don’t have any medical conditions, not that I know of. I’ve always been… robust. A strong constitution, you understand. I work hard. I don’t sit around and complain. Is that good enough? I’d really like to get this over with.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Tammie. We can work with that. Do you happen to know if you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Definitely not. I've never had an allergy in my life. I'm a very… practical person. I wouldn't be allergic to anything. People are too sensitive these days, always claiming allergies. Honestly. If something doesn't agree with you, just don't eat it! Is there anything else? I have an appointment… soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you. Now, I'd like to take a quick look at your throat, if that's alright with you. It will only take a moment. It will help me get a better idea of what's going on.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to look at it? After all this questioning? Fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect to find anything. It’s just a sore throat. A little bit of roughness. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Just… be quick about it, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Tammie. I will be as quick as possible. Alright, open wide, please. Hmm. I see some mild redness in the back of your throat. Your tonsils don't appear to be enlarged, and there's no visible pus or debris. Your uvula is normal. It appears your mucous membranes are slightly dry. It does look a bit irritated, as you described. And the dryness is certainly contributing. It is possible it is some viral pharyngitis, or simply irritation from the dust and dryness at work. I'm going to listen to your lungs just to be sure. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Viral… what now? Honestly, Doctor, you’re using big words again. Just tell me what it is, and what I need to do to make it go away. I don’t need a lecture on… viruses. And my lungs are fine. Perfectly fine. I work hard, remember? I don’t sit around… I don’t get sick. Just get on with it. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, deep breath in… and out… Your lungs are clear, Tammie. That’s good. It seems likely that this is just irritation causing your sore throat, as I suspected. Viral pharyngitis is also possible, but without a fever or other symptoms, it’s less likely. For now, I recommend plenty of fluids – water is best. Avoid dry foods, and try to minimize exposure to dust as much as possible. Lozenges or throat sprays can also help soothe the irritation. I’m going to recommend a humidifier for your home, to keep the air moist. And if it doesn't improve in a week, or if you develop a fever, difficulty swallowing, or shortness of breath, please come back immediately.
PATIENT: Humidifier? More things to buy. Honestly, Doctor. So, it’s just… dryness? I could have told you that. Water, avoid dust… very helpful. Is there anything I can take? A pill, perhaps? I don’t have time for all these… preventative measures. Just something to make it go away quickly. And will this cost me a fortune? I have a very tight schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. Yes, it sounds like it's primarily irritation. We can certainly discuss some over-the-counter options to help manage the symptoms. I can recommend a throat lozenge containing benzocaine or phenol to numb the throat. Also, an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with discomfort. Those are relatively inexpensive options. The humidifier would be an additional cost, but it can help prevent future irritation. I'll write down the names of the lozenges and pain relievers for you. If your symptoms worsen, or don’t improve after a week, please come back. We can discuss further options then. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I think that's all. Just… dryness. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate you listening, but I could have told you all of this myself. I have an appointment… soon. And I really must be going. Thank you… I think. I hope this… dryness… goes away quickly. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tammie. I’m glad I could help, even if it confirmed what you already suspected. Please don’t hesitate to come back if your symptoms worsen. And I hope you have a good day, despite the… dryness. It was nice to meet you. .
