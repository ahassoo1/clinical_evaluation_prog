DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. I need a letter… confirming I’m able to fly. It’s for an airline, really. A bit of a hassle, honestly, but they require it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. An airline requires a letter confirming your fitness to fly. No problem, we can certainly look into that. To do that properly, I'll need to gather a bit of information from you. First, is there anything specific the airline is concerned about?
PATIENT: Not that they told me, specifically. It’s just… a general requirement after a… well, after my husband passed away unexpectedly a few months ago. They sent a form with a list of things doctors need to sign off on, mostly about my general health and… stability. It felt a bit invasive, but I need to get to my sister. She lives overseas.
DOCTOR: I see. That makes sense, and I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. It's understandable they'd have some requirements given the circumstances, and getting to your sister sounds important. So, it sounds like it's a fairly broad check-up request, then. Let’s start with your general health. Have you been feeling generally well since… since your husband passed?
PATIENT: Generally, yes. It’s been… difficult, obviously. A lot of grief, a lot of adjusting. But physically? No major problems. I've been a little more tired than usual, and my appetite wasn't great for a while, but that’s improving. No new illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I do have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, and thank you for sharing that. Grief is physically exhausting, so that tiredness is completely understandable. It’s helpful to know your appetite is improving, too. And yes, knowing you have Medicare is useful. Let's just run through some basics to be thorough. Have you had any recent changes in medications?
PATIENT: No, no changes at all. I just take a daily multivitamin, that's it. I haven’t needed anything else for years. Honestly, I’m quite healthy. My husband always said I was too stubborn to get sick.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And that’s a lovely thing to say about your husband. Okay, just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else – foods, environmental things, anything like that?
PATIENT: No allergies at all. Not a single one. I can eat anything, breathe anywhere… no problems. I sometimes wish something was allergic to me, just for a change. It’s a bit of a running joke with my friends.
DOCTOR: Well, that certainly makes things simpler! Now, let's quickly go through your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never. I’ve always been very lucky with my health, really. I used to run a lot, even, though I haven’t been as active since… well. But no chronic illnesses, no major injuries, nothing that requires ongoing treatment. Just the usual colds and flu, like everyone gets. I’m 33, by the way, in case that’s useful.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And yes, 33 is useful to know, thank you. Now, just one more section before we do a quick physical exam. What about family history?
PATIENT: Okay. My mother has high cholesterol, she’s managing it with diet and exercise, thankfully. My father was healthy as a horse until he passed away in an accident when I was a teenager. No heart problems, no diabetes, no cancer in either of them, as far as I know. My sister is perfectly healthy too, as far as I’m aware. We don’t really talk about medical things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So, no significant family history of chronic illness that we need to be concerned about. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to make sure everything looks good. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and do a basic check of your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I just want to get this letter and see my sister. The sooner we get it done, the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let’s get started. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Blood pressure is 120/80, which is excellent. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Everything seems to be in good working order. Overall, you appear to be in good health. Just one last thing, have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I think I lost a couple of pounds initially, just from… not eating much. But it's pretty much back to normal now. I weigh about 131, if that helps. I’m 176 tall, by the way. Sometimes I forget people don't know these things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's helpful. So, no significant weight changes. Alright, Kiante, everything looks good. Based on my examination, you appear to be in good health and fit to fly. I'm happy to write a letter confirming this for the airline. I'll draft it up now, outlining my findings and stating my professional opinion. It will take just a few minutes. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and I really appreciate it. I just want to get the letter, if that’s alright. I'm not really a worrier, and I trust your judgement. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could help. Alright, here we go… Here you are. It summarizes my findings and confirms your fitness to fly. Please keep this with you when you travel. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Perfect! Thank you so much. This is exactly what I needed. No, nothing else at all. You've been wonderful. I really appreciate your time and kindness, Doctor. I’ll be going now, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I'm happy to have helped, and I wish you a safe and peaceful trip to see your sister. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Take care now.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye.
