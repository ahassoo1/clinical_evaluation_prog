DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s August 2nd, 2025. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is the name. Look, I don’t usually do doctors, you understand. Waste of time, mostly. But the army… they want me to get checked out first. Some exam. Said I needed a form signed. That’s it, really. Just the form.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Hartness. It sounds like this is a requirement for continued service. We’re happy to help facilitate that. To complete the form accurately, I’ll need to ask you a few questions, as if I were conducting a standard medical evaluation. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Standard evaluation… sounds… thorough. Fine, fine. Get on with it. But don’t expect poetry. I just… put things together. Engines, machines, that sort of thing. Not bodies. And don’t ask me about feelings. Pointless.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. A simple, straightforward assessment is all we’ll do. No poetry required, and feelings are not on the agenda. Let's begin with your current health. Could you describe any specific symptoms or issues you’re experiencing at the moment?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Issues? What kind of questions are these? I work. I lift things. Sometimes my back aches. That's it. Old age, I guess. Fifty-one years of… practical work. It’s not a sickness, it’s… wear and tear. Like a good engine that's been run hard. You fix it, you keep going.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to clarify that it’s more of a chronic discomfort related to your profession rather than a sudden, acute injury. When you say it aches, can you describe the sensation?
PATIENT: Sensation? Look, it hurts. It’s a dull ache, alright? Like someone’s been… pressing on it all day. Gets worse when I bend over, naturally. I don’t need a fancy description. It’s a back. It hurts when you use it. It's common sense, really. You wouldn’t ask an engine if it feels anything, would you?
DOCTOR: You are right to point out the logical nature of the discomfort, Mr. Hartness. I apologize if my line of questioning seems unnecessary. However, characterizing the pain helps me rule out other potential causes. Is the pain localized to one specific area of your back, or does it radiate to other parts of your body, such as your legs or arms?
PATIENT: Radiate? Now you’re just making things up. It’s in my back. The lower back. Usually. Sometimes it goes up a bit, but it stays in the back. It doesn’t… shoot down my legs or anything dramatic like that. Honestly, I just ignore it. And then I take a painkiller if it gets really bad. But that’s rare. I don't go around complaining.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Hartness. That's very helpful. You mentioned taking a painkiller occasionally. What type of painkiller do you typically use, and how often would you say you take it in a month?
PATIENT: Oh, you know. Whatever’s at the pharmacy. Those little white pills. Ibuprofen, maybe? Something like that. I don’t keep track. When it flares up, I take a couple. Maybe… four or five times a month? It varies. Depends on how much lifting I’ve done, if the weather's bad… things like that. It’s not a regular thing, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand. Intermittent use as needed. Now, aside from the back pain, have you experienced any other health issues recently?
PATIENT: Health issues? No. I mean, I get a cold now and then, like anyone else. Nothing serious. And I used to get heartburn, but I stopped eating those spicy sausages my wife makes. Solved that problem. Otherwise… no. I don’t sit around worrying about my health. Waste of a perfectly good day.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Hartness. In terms of past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? No. Never. I’ve always been… strong. Healthy. Doctors never liked me much, to be honest. Always telling me to slow down, eat less salt… ridiculous. I’ve always been able to handle myself. My father was the same. Lived to eighty, working on cars until the very end. Good genes, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear about your family history, Mr. Hartness. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Hospitalized? Once. When I was a boy. Broke my arm falling out of a tree. That was it. Simple break, they put a cast on it. Healed fine. Haven’t been near a hospital since. I avoid them like the plague, if you want the truth. Full of germs and… people complaining.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Hartness. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… coffee. Lots of coffee. Gets me going in the morning. And sometimes a beer with dinner, if my wife lets me. That’s it. I don’t believe in all those pills and potions. Just common sense and hard work. That’s what keeps a man healthy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hartness. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had one. Not to dust, not to pollen, not to anything. I can eat whatever’s put in front of me. Another reason I don't trust doctors, honestly. Always asking about allergies. Seems like everyone’s allergic to something these days. Makes a man think they’re trying to find something wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness, that completes the medical history portion. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, focusing on your back and overall musculoskeletal system. This will simply involve checking your range of motion, reflexes, and assessing for any tenderness or pain. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Physical examination… alright, fine. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day. But don’t expect any fancy contortions. I'm a mechanic, not a gymnast. And be gentle, alright? I need these hands for work.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. I will be as gentle as possible and focus on a practical assessment relevant to your concerns. Please lie down on your back on the examination table. I’m going to gently feel along your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Do you feel any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ouch! There! Right there. A little to the left. That’s always been a bit… sensitive. Been that way for years. Probably pulled something lifting a gearbox, ages ago. Feels a bit stiff sometimes. But it's nothing. I can still work. Just… feels a bit tender if you press on it hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for letting me know. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. Could you please bend forward and touch your toes, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: There. Like that. Not exactly touching, alright? My back… isn't what it used to be. And don’t expect any graceful movements. I’m a bit rusty. It feels a bit tight, to be honest. A little ache. But I can do it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hartness. Now, could you please bend backward slightly?
PATIENT: No. No, that’s enough. Feels… wrong. Like something’s going to snap. I don’t bend backwards. Never have. Not a good idea. It’s just… not natural.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. That’s perfectly alright. No need to push yourself. I’m going to check your reflexes now. Please sit on the edge of the table, and I'll gently tap on your knees with this small hammer. Your reflexes are normal bilaterally. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Based on the history and brief physical examination, it appears you have some chronic lower back discomfort likely related to your profession. There is tenderness in the lumbar region, but no signs of any acute injury or neurological deficits. Your heart and lungs sound normal.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Is it bad? Do I need… pills? Because I told you, I don't like pills. And I need my hands. I'm a mechanic. I can't be laid up in bed.
DOCTOR: It means, Mr. Hartness, that your condition seems to be a chronic strain rather than a serious medical problem. There’s no indication for immediate concern or bed rest. It's likely a muscular issue aggravated by repetitive lifting and physical activity. Regarding pills, we don’t necessarily need to resort to medication. However, to manage the discomfort, I can recommend a few things. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can be helpful when you’re experiencing pain, but we should limit their long-term use. More importantly, focusing on proper lifting techniques and incorporating regular stretching and strengthening exercises can significantly improve your back health. I can also provide you with a referral to a physical therapist who can develop a personalized exercise program tailored to your needs. Would you be interested in a referral?
PATIENT: Physical therapist… exercises… sounds like a lot of fuss. But… if it means I can keep working, maybe. As long as it doesn’t take up too much time. I don’t have time for fancy routines. Just need something simple, alright? And no pushing me too hard. I know my own limits. And if it doesn’t work, I’m not going back.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. I will write a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in musculoskeletal issues. I will also note your preferences for a simple, practical program and your desire to avoid excessive strain. They will assess your condition and develop a plan that is appropriate for your needs and limitations. In the meantime, please continue to be mindful of your lifting techniques and avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. If the pain worsens significantly, or if you experience any new symptoms, such as numbness or weakness in your legs, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s it. Just… get this form signed, so I can get back to work. It's been a waste of time, if you want the truth, but if the army needs a signature, they need a signature. And hopefully, this physical therapist won’t be too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. Here is the completed form. I've documented your physical examination findings and overall health status. I wish you all the best in your continued service. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns in the future. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Hartness. .
