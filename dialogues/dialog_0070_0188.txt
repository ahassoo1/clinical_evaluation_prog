DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Secondi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, okay. So, my pee… it’s orange. I noticed it a few days ago. It’s a little strange. Not painful, just… orange.
DOCTOR: I understand. Orange urine is certainly something we should investigate. And you said you’ve noticed this for a few days now?
PATIENT: Yes, about three days. Maybe four. I drink a lot of water, usually. So I thought it would go away, but it hasn't. It’s… the same orange color. Like, a bright orange. Not dark.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to clarify, you haven't noticed any pain or burning with urination, correct?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the color. And… I feel normal, if that makes sense. No fever, no hurting. Just… worried about the orange pee. It’s a little scary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Secondi. It's good that you're not experiencing any pain or other symptoms. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. Now, besides the color change, have you noticed any changes in how you're urinating – like frequency, urgency, or any difficulty starting or stopping?
PATIENT: No, sir. Everything feels… normal there. Same as always, if you know what I mean. I go about the same amount of times, and nothing hurts when I start or finish. Just the color is different. I haven’t changed anything I eat or drink, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, let's go over a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as liver problems, kidney issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, to be honest. I go to the dentist every six months, and I had a check-up with my regular doctor last year, and everything was good. He didn’t find anything wrong. I don’t take any medicine, either. Just vitamins, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And what about any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, sir. Never had any. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but they just put it in a cast. Nothing… serious, like cutting me open or anything. I was maybe seven or eight years old. It healed fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… my father, he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother, she had some problems with her… cholesterol, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I don't remember exactly. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. No one in my family has… kidney problems or anything like that, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about your social history, Mr. Secondi?
PATIENT: What do you mean, "social history"? Like… what I do for fun? I work, mostly. I'm an engineering technician. I like to watch football, sometimes. I'm married, and my wife and I… we don’t drink a lot of alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. We don’t smoke. Does that… count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is exactly what I meant. Thank you for sharing that. Just confirming, no smoking, limited alcohol consumption, and you are employed as an engineering technician. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, sir. Nothing at all. I can eat anything. I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife is the one with allergies sometimes, but not me. She’s allergic to cats, I think. But I’m fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to check your abdomen and, of course, do a urine test to see what's causing the color change. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's wrong. Listening to my heart and lungs is no problem, and the pee test… okay, I can do that. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat on the examination table, we’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. I will need you to take a few deep breaths for me. Then we'll collect a urine sample. I’ll give you a sterile cup and instructions. It's a very straightforward process. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Now, if you could step behind the screen for a moment to collect the urine sample when you're ready. I'll leave the room for privacy. Just knock when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Okay, sir. Sounds good. I’ll go do that now. Just let me know if you need anything.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Secondi. I’ll be right outside when you are finished.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m finished, Doctor. It’s… in the cup.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Secondi. I'm going to send this off to the lab for a urinalysis. It will give us a more detailed look at what's going on in your urine. It usually takes about an hour or two to get the results back. While we wait, do you have any other symptoms or concerns you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, sir. That’s everything, I think. Just hoping it’s nothing too bad. I feel okay, like I said. I just don’t want it to be something serious. Waiting is the hard part, I guess. An hour or two… okay. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Secondi. I understand your concern. It's good that you're feeling otherwise well. We will proceed cautiously. I will review the results as soon as they become available and will let you know what we find. In the meantime, please stay well-hydrated and try not to worry too much. The lab has received the sample, so we should have results shortly. I will have my nurse check in with you in about an hour to see how you're doing and provide updates. Do you have any questions for me before I step out?
PATIENT: No, sir. I think I’m good. Thank you again, Doctor. An hour… okay. I’ll just… sit here, I guess. And wait. I appreciate you looking into this for me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Secondi. Please don’t hesitate to let me or my nurse know if you feel any changes in your condition. We'll do our best to get you answers as quickly as possible. .
