DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, doctor. Hum. Well, they told me to come. Said I need to be checked 'cause of the work. Long time I been workin’ in that mine, you know? Not feelin’ nothin’ bad, though. Just… they say check.
DOCTOR: Right, yes… occupational health follow-up. I see. So, just to clarify, you’re not experiencing any specific symptoms at the moment?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I just… work. Dig, move rocks, come home. Eat. Sleep. Repeat. No… pain. No coughin’. No dizzy spells. Nothin’ like that. Why you askin’ about symptoms? Is somethin’ wrong with the mine?
DOCTOR: No, no, nothing wrong with the mine that I’m aware of. It's just standard procedure, Mr. Bigger. We need to get a baseline of your health, given your profession. Long-term exposure to dust and… well, the environment can sometimes cause issues down the line. Just routine. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me roughly how long you’ve been working in the mine?
PATIENT: Humph. Routine. Always routine. Long time. Very long time. Let me see… I started when I was a young man. Maybe… fifty years? More than fifty, I think. Fifty-two years, maybe? Lost track after a while. It's just… work. Always been workin’ in that mine. My father worked there, and his father before him.
DOCTOR: Fifty-two years… that is a significant period of exposure. Do you recall if any safety measures were consistently used during your time there?
PATIENT: Safety measures? You mean… like what? We had… hats. Hard hats, you know? And boots. Always boots. And… they sometimes gave us… cloth to cover our mouths. Not always, though. Sometimes the dust was too much for the cloth. They said it was just… dust. Part of the job. Not much else. We just… got on with it. You askin’ if we complained? Maybe some did, but… what good would it do? The work had to be done.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Hard hats, boots, occasional cloth masks… Okay. And have you ever noticed any changes in your breathing over the years?
PATIENT: Changes in breathin'? Hmm. Well, gettin' old, you know? Breathin' gets harder. That's just… old age. Not much breathin’ like a young man anymore. But… nothin' bad. Sometimes a little wheezing in the cold, maybe. But I get cold easy now, you know? Always been a cold man. Not sure if it’s the mine, or just… me. What kind of changes are you lookin’ for? I don't understand.
DOCTOR: I'm trying to determine if you've experienced any persistent cough, shortness of breath even with minimal exertion, or any chest tightness. It sounds like you’ve had some wheezing, which we should investigate further. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—things like asthma, bronchitis, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No! Never. Strong heart, I have. Always been strong. Asthma? No. Never had the asthma. Bronchitis… I had a bad cough once, maybe twenty years ago? But it went away. Just a normal cough, you know? Like when you get a cold. Took some medicine, and it went away. Doctor told me it was just a cold. Hum. No serious problems. I don't waste doctors' time. Only come when they tell me to come.
DOCTOR: Alright. No history of asthma, bronchitis, or heart problems. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… No. Never had nothin’ cut open. Not me. Maybe… when I was a little boy, I fell and broke my arm? But that was a long time ago. They just… put it in a cast. No cuttin’. No surgery. Just a cast. And that was in Nigeria, a long, long time ago. Not here.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Humph. Medications? No. I don't like pills. Make you feel weak. Maybe… sometimes I take a little something for my joints when they bother me? But it's just… a cream. You rub it on. Not pills. And I only use it when they really hurt. Not every day. Just when needed.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. I eat everything. Goat meat, yam, plantain… everything. Never had a problem. Maybe… sometimes a little itchy when a mosquito bites me? But that's just a mosquito bite! Not an allergy. I'm a strong man. Don't get allergies. Hum. Never had nothin' swell up or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Now, before we move on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just listening to your lungs, checking your heart rate and blood pressure. Routine, as I said. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Hmph. Listenin' to my lungs? What for? I told you, I'm fine. But… alright. If you have to. I don't trust these newfangled machines, but… if you say so. Just make it quick, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just a quick listen. Please sit here and take a deep breath in and out for me when I ask. Take a deep breath… and exhale… again… and exhale… Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. And your pulse is a bit fast, 88 beats per minute. Lungs sound… slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally, with some faint crackles at the bases. These findings are not necessarily alarming, but warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Diminished breath sounds? Crackles? What does that mean? Is somethin' wrong with my lungs? You said it wasn't alarming, but you're lookin' worried. Is it the mine? I knew I shouldn't have come. Just gonna hear bad news now, aren't I? What kinda investigation? More machines? More pokin' and proddin'? Tell me straight, doctor. What's wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, please try not to worry. Diminished breath sounds and crackles can be caused by a number of things, and it doesn't automatically mean it's something serious. Given your long history of working in the mine, it's possible these findings are related to dust exposure. I would like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test—that's a simple breathing test—to get a clearer picture of what's going on. The X-ray will show us if there are any changes in your lungs, and the breathing test will assess how well your lungs are functioning. These are standard tests, and they're relatively quick and painless. It’s important to rule out anything serious, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, which can be common in individuals with long-term dust exposure. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: COPD? Chronic... what-now? Dust exposure? You mean… the mine? So, it is the mine! I knew it! Always told me it was nothin', just dust. Now you're tellin' me it's somethin' serious. X-ray? Breathin' test? More machines… alright. Fine. Do what you have to do. But I don't want no surprises, doctor. Tell me straight what you find. And if it’s the mine, I want to know who’s gonna pay for all this! I been workin’ in that mine my whole life… this is their responsibility.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bigger. We will proceed with the chest X-ray and pulmonary function test. I will also document your concerns regarding potential compensation for work-related illness. The results will help us determine the best course of action. The X-ray can be done here at the clinic, and we can schedule the pulmonary function test for tomorrow. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for an inhaler to help with any potential shortness of breath. It’s a bronchodilator, which will open up your airways. Use it as needed. I will also give you a referral to a pulmonologist—a lung specialist—for a consultation once we have the test results. They can provide more specialized care if needed. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Inhaler? A broncho… what-now? More medicine? I don't like medicine, doctor. But… alright. If you think it will help. Write it down. And this lung specialist… are they gonna poke and prod me more? I’m gettin’ too old for all this. So, X-ray today, breathin’ test tomorrow, specialist… later? And you’re gonna help me with this… payin’ for it? ‘Cause I ain't payin’ for nothin’. This is their fault. They knew the mine was dusty. Always knew. Write all that down, doctor. Don't forget.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Here are the prescriptions for the inhaler, the order for the chest X-ray, and the referral to the pulmonologist. I've also included information about worker's compensation and resources to help you file a claim. The X-ray technician will explain the procedure, but it involves standing in front of a machine for a few seconds while an image of your lungs is taken. It's painless and non-invasive. The pulmonologist will review your test results and discuss the best course of action with you. I understand your concerns about compensation, and I will document everything thoroughly in your chart. We can also discuss this further once we have the test results. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Humph. A lot of papers. Worker's compensation… I'll have to get my daughter to help me with that. She’s good with those things. This lung specialist… what’s their name? And where are they located? I don’t want to be travelin’ all over. And… will this inhaler make me sleepy? I need to be awake, you know? Got things to do. Can I still eat my goat meat? Don't want no medicine messin' with my appetite.
DOCTOR: The pulmonologist I’m referring you to is Dr. Anya Sharma, located at Suburban General Hospital, about fifteen minutes from here. Here's her contact information and directions. The inhaler is a short-acting bronchodilator, meaning it should not cause any significant drowsiness. It's very targeted in its effect. And no, it should not affect your appetite, so you can continue to enjoy your goat meat. I’ve also included a handout explaining the procedure for the pulmonary function test. It will tell you what to expect and how to prepare. Is there anything else I can clarify for you today, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Anya Sharma… okay. Suburban General… I know where that is. Fifteen minutes… alright. And no sleepy? Good. And goat meat is safe? Very good. Humph. I think… that’s all. A lot of information. I’m an old man, doctor. My brain gets tired easy. I'll get my daughter to read all these papers. Thank you. I guess. I still don’t like all these machines, but… you seem like a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bigger. I understand it's a lot to take in. If you have any questions or concerns after speaking with your daughter, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to help. Please schedule the chest X-ray at your earliest convenience. And remember, take care of yourself. I'll see you back here after you've had the tests completed. Have a good day, Mr. Bigger.
PATIENT: Alright. I will. Thank you, doctor. .
