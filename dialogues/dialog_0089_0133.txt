DOCTOR: Hi Melvenia, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I need some papers signed, actually. Some health forms. I don't really understand all the fuss, but they said I needed a doctor to verify them. It's for… well, it doesn't really matter what it's for. Just need them signed and notarized, if that's alright. I'd like to get this over with quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Forms to be completed. No problem at all. I can certainly help with that. Just to be thorough – even though you’d like to keep it quick – could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. General health… Well, I’m 76, so things aren’t perfect, you know? I get a little tired easier these days. My knees bother me when it rains, and my eyesight isn't what it used to be. I try to eat okay, mostly Mexican food, of course! But nothing major, Doctor. No big illnesses or anything. Is that what you need to know? I really don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. So, fatigue, some knee pain with weather changes, and some vision decline – that gives me a starting point. Do you have any trouble with your breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? Not really. Not that I've noticed, anyway. Sometimes I get a little winded climbing stairs, but that's probably just the age, you know? And maybe the weight. I’m… tall, so it’s a bit harder. I haven’t had any coughing or wheezing or anything like that. Honestly, I’m pretty lucky, considering. I just want these forms signed so I can be on my way. Are we getting closer to that?
DOCTOR: Okay, no breathing problems reported. And you're tall - I see that. 189cm, according to my notes. And your weight is listed as 110lbs... That’s quite a bit underweight for your height. Has your weight changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh! You have my measurements? That’s… thorough. And yes, you’re right. I am thin. I’ve always been a bit on the slender side, but I guess I’ve lost a little weight recently. I haven’t been eating as much, to be honest. Not a big appetite these days. But it’s not like I’m wasting away or anything, Doctor. I just... don't feel hungry all the time. Does that matter for these forms? I'm starting to get a little worried this is going to be a long visit.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Melvenia. Weight loss, even if it's not drastic, is something we need to look into. It can be a sign of underlying issues. Before we get back to the forms, let’s quickly go through a little bit more of your health history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now we're getting into complicated stuff. Honestly, Doctor, I've seen doctors on and off over the years, but I don't really remember being diagnosed with anything serious. Maybe a touch of arthritis in my knees, but that's just what old people get, right? I don't have diabetes, I don't think. And my blood pressure… I’ve had it checked sometimes, and it was usually okay. I’m really not good at remembering these things. It was a long time ago, and I don’t keep track. I'm single, never had kids, so no one to remind me. Can we please just get back to the forms? I just need them signed and notarized.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical diagnoses recalled. We’ll make a note of that. And it's perfectly alright if you don't remember everything; that’s why I’m here to help. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Hmm. Yes, actually. A long time ago, when I was younger, I had my appendix out. And… oh! And I had a hysterectomy. That was… a long time ago too. Before I got married, actually. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else. Are we getting closer to the signing now? I'm starting to feel a bit anxious, all these questions. I really just need this done, quickly, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and hysterectomy noted. Okay, and just a few more quick questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings – have any major medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tough one. My parents are both gone now, and I didn't have any siblings. My mother… she had some problems with her heart, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t remember exactly what. She died when I was pretty young. And my father… he was a healthy man, mostly. Worked hard all his life. That’s all I really remember, honestly. This is a lot to think about, Doctor. Can we please get to the forms now? I'm really not feeling well thinking about all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with heart problems noted. Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No medications. Never really been one for taking pills. And allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just the desert air. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. Truly. Look, Doctor, I really appreciate you asking all these questions, but I'm starting to feel quite overwhelmed. I just need those forms signed and notarized. Is that possible? Please? I want to get home.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, no known allergies. I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed, Melvenia. I apologize for the long list of questions, but it's important to get a complete picture of your health, even if it’s just for verifying these forms. Before I sign them, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to be sure everything is okay. It will be very quick - just checking your heart, lungs, and blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A physical exam? Now? After all these questions? Honestly, Doctor, I really didn’t come here for a physical. I just need the forms signed. I’m a very private person, and I’m not comfortable with being poked and prodded. I thought this was going to be a quick in-and-out thing. Can’t you just sign them? It’s just a formality, right? I really don’t want to take up any more of your time, or mine. I'm starting to feel faint. Please, Doctor. Just the forms.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Melvenia. I truly apologize if I've made you feel uncomfortable. You're right, it shouldn't be a stressful experience. Given your concerns and desire to keep this brief, and considering you haven’t reported any acute or concerning symptoms, I can proceed with signing the forms without a full physical exam. However, I do want to quickly check your blood pressure, just as a baseline. It's a simple, non-invasive test and can give me a little reassurance. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just the blood pressure. But only the blood pressure. And quickly, please. I’m really not feeling well. And please, no more questions after that. Just sign the forms and let me go home. I just want this over with. I really do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia. Just a quick check. Please relax your arm, and I’ll inflate the cuff. Okay. Your blood pressure is a little on the low side, at 90 over 60. That, combined with your reported weight loss and fatigue, does give me some cause for concern. While I can sign the forms as requested, I strongly recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment for some further investigation. Perhaps some blood work to check for any underlying issues. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Low blood pressure? What does that mean? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. I just needed some papers signed, and now you're telling me something's wrong with me? I don't want more tests. I don't have insurance, and I can't afford all that. And frankly, I don’t want to know if something’s wrong. Just…sign the forms. Please. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide what I want to do with my health. I'm starting to feel very anxious. Just sign them and let me go. I’m going to be sick. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Melvenia. You're right. It’s your decision. I will sign the forms as requested. However, I want to be absolutely clear: I strongly advise you to consider a follow-up appointment. Your low blood pressure and weight loss are concerning, and ignoring them could have serious consequences. I can provide you with information on local clinics that offer reduced-cost care. Here you are. I've also written down some information on local resources. Please, take care of yourself. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as dizziness, weakness, or shortness of breath – please seek medical attention immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. Just… thank you. I’m going home now. .
