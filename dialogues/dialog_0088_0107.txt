DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, my heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not always. It’s… hard to explain. It just flutters. That's why the paper said… Atrial Flutter, I think?
DOCTOR: Okay, “funny” and “fluttering” are good starting points. And you saw something on paper about Atrial Flutter?
PATIENT: Yes. The other doctor… he gave me a paper after some tests. Lots of numbers… I don’t understand numbers very well. He just said… “follow up with heart doctor”. That's you, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm a family medicine doctor, and I can certainly help get things sorted out. We can review those test results together, and I can explain them in a way that's easier to understand. Don’t worry about the numbers right now. Let me pull up your chart... Ah, here we are. Philipp Puder, August 2nd, 2025. It looks like you had an EKG and some blood work done on July 15th. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about when this fluttering started and what makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Okay, good. July 15th… yes, that was the day. Um… when it started… I think maybe a few months before that? It’s hard to say exactly. It doesn't happen all the time. When I get… stressed, maybe? Or after I eat something heavy. But sometimes it happens when I’m just… sitting. It's strange. It doesn’t feel painful, just… uncomfortable. And makes me worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a few months before July 15th, intermittent fluttering sensation, potentially related to stress or large meals, but sometimes happens at rest. No pain, just discomfort and worry. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a little… short of breath? Not bad, just like I can't get a full breath. And… maybe a little dizzy? But that doesn't happen every time. It’s… hard to tell if that's from the heart, or just… me. My wife says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath and occasional dizziness along with the fluttering. We need to consider both. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, never. I’m usually… healthy. I work with the machines at the factory, so I’m always moving. Not much sitting. No problems, really, until this heart thing. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. But I don't know much about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical diagnoses, active job, family history of hypertension. And you’re 35 years old, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, 35. August is my birthday, but not yet this year. Still 35 for a few weeks. Is that important? The age, I mean?
DOCTOR: It can be. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. My wife, she takes some for her… arthritis, I think. But I don’t take anything. Just water, usually. And sometimes… tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. My wife makes a lot of spicy food… sometimes too spicy, but I eat it anyway. Never had a problem with anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never tried it. I drink… sometimes a little tea, like I said. And sometimes with my wife, we have a small glass of wine with dinner. Very small. No drugs. Never. I need to be awake for work.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, just a few more questions before we do a quick physical exam. Can you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s… okay, I guess. My wife does most of the cooking. Rice, chicken, vegetables… sometimes lamb. We try to eat healthy, but she likes to make special foods sometimes… like samosas, and things. I eat what she makes. I work hard, I need to eat. I don't really watch what I eat, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, varied diet, primarily rice, chicken, and vegetables, some heavier dishes occasionally. It sounds like a fairly normal diet. Now, let’s do a quick exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… try not to make it too long, okay? I need to get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/92. Your heart rate is 88 and regular, but I am hearing a slightly irregular rhythm. Your lungs are clear. Your pulse is a little strong. Now, just a quick palpation of your thyroid… feels normal. Okay. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it does sound like we need to investigate this further. I’m seeing some irregularities that warrant more attention. The EKG from July 15th showed evidence of atrial flutter, which explains the fluttering sensation you’ve described. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Atrial… flutter? Is that… bad? Is it serious? I thought it was just my heart being silly. Will I need… surgery? Or pills? My wife will be very worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take a deep breath. Atrial flutter isn’t necessarily immediately life-threatening, but it can lead to more serious complications if left untreated, like stroke or heart failure. We need to figure out what’s causing it and how best to manage it. Surgery isn’t usually the first step. I want to order some additional tests: a repeat EKG, a 24-hour Holter monitor to get a better picture of your heart rhythm over time, and some blood work to check your thyroid function and electrolytes. These results will help us determine the best course of action. I also want to refer you to a cardiologist for a consultation. Would you be able to schedule that?
PATIENT: Okay… more tests. And a… cardiologist? That sounds… serious. I don't know any cardiologists. My wife can schedule it, I guess. She's better with things like that. How long will it take to get the results? And… what if they are bad? Will I have to stop working?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take things one step at a time. It is a lot of information, I understand. The tests will take a few days to process – probably about a week. We’ll schedule the cardiologist appointment as soon as possible, and they’ll be able to review everything and give you a more detailed plan. It’s unlikely you’ll need to stop working right away. Many people with atrial flutter continue to work normally with appropriate management. We'll discuss all the options once we have the results. For now, I want you to try to reduce stress as much as possible. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. And, if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… reduce stress. That’s… hard. But I will try. No caffeine, no alcohol. And go to the hospital if I feel bad. My wife will be happy to hear that part. Okay. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I hope… I hope everything is okay. When will my wife get the papers for the tests?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. I understand your concerns, and we'll work through this together. My nurse will print out the lab orders and referral information for the cardiologist right now. She’ll also give you a sheet explaining the Holter monitor and how to wear it. She should have it ready for you before you leave. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re just gathering information at this point. Do you have any final questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I will let my wife take care of the papers. I hope to see you again… with good news.
DOCTOR: Okay. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Puder. I hope to see you soon as well. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
