DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I’m Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh... travel, I think? My wife... she wanted me to get some... things... before we go. She planned it all. I don’t remember much, to be honest. It’s been… a hard time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're preparing for a trip and your wife is doing most of the planning. And you mentioned it’s been a hard time… is that related to why you're here today, or is that something separate?
PATIENT: Separate. Mostly. She... she passed, a few months back. Before the trip, she booked it. Said I needed to get away. I just… need to get what she said. Shots, maybe? I don’t really know what she wanted, exactly. She always handled this stuff. It's… a lot.
DOCTOR: I am so very sorry to hear about your wife, Odell. That’s a tremendous loss, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed right now, especially with trying to manage a trip she planned. It’s good of you to come in to get things sorted. So, she mentioned "shots"—likely vaccinations for travel. Do you happen to know where you’re travelling to?
PATIENT: Hmm… somewhere warm. Lots of… trees? She liked nature shows. I think it was… Southeast Asia? Maybe Thailand? She watched a lot of documentaries about Thailand. It's all a bit fuzzy, sorry. I didn't pay much attention. She did all the research.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize at all. It’s perfectly alright. Grieving takes a lot of energy, and it's common to have trouble focusing. Thailand sounds right, given her interest in nature shows. Let me quickly check the recommended vaccinations and health precautions for Thailand. Just one moment. Okay… for Thailand, depending on the region and length of stay, we typically recommend Hepatitis A and Typhoid, and possibly Japanese Encephalitis and Rabies. Tetanus is also important to be up-to-date on. Before we decide what you need, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past… medical? I haven't really been to the doctor much. I mostly just... worked. Aircraft stuff. You know, building things. Never got sick much, not serious anyway. Maybe a cold sometimes. No… nothing major. I don’t think. My wife always took care of all that paperwork, too. She liked keeping things organized. Sorry, I'm not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s okay, Odell. It sounds like you’ve been generally healthy, which is good. And it's completely understandable that you’re not sure about medical details. We can figure this out. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never been in the hospital. No surgeries. Just… bumps and bruises from work sometimes. Nothing a bandage couldn't fix. Honestly, I think she worried more about me than I did. She said I was too stubborn to take care of myself. She's right, probably. She always was.
DOCTOR: It sounds like she was a very caring person. Alright, and what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… I don’t have much family left. My parents passed a long time ago. And… she was everything, really. No brothers or sisters. Just… her. She had a cousin, I think, but we didn't see them much. I don't know… it’s just been… quiet, lately. Very quiet.
DOCTOR: I’m truly sorry for your loss, Odell. It sounds like she was a very important person in your life. Now, just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? I don't think so. Nothing I've ever noticed. I eat pretty much anything. She always made sure I ate enough, though. Sometimes she'd try to get me to eat things with… spices. I didn't always like those. But I didn't tell her. She'd get upset. I don’t remember anything major. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Never have. I always figured… if you weren't sick, you didn’t need them. She used to take something for her… headaches sometimes. But I didn’t take anything. Just… coffee to stay awake at work. Does that count? It's probably not a medicine.
DOCTOR: No, coffee doesn't count! Okay, so no current medications, no allergies, and generally good health. That's a good starting point. Let's just do a quick check of your vital signs, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure looks good – 128 over 76. Pulse is a little elevated at 82, which is understandable given the stress you’ve been under. We’ll also listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No pain. Except… sometimes in my head. Just… remembering things. She always said I worried too much. It makes my head ache. But it’s not a real pain, I guess. Just… tired. Very tired. And… sad. Is that a pain? It feels like a pain, sometimes.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly difficult, Odell. And yes, what you’re describing absolutely can feel like pain – emotional pain is very real. It's completely normal to be feeling this way after such a significant loss. Given your upcoming trip to Thailand, and considering your recent loss and feeling of fatigue, I'm going to recommend a few things. First, we'll get you up to date on your routine vaccinations – Tetanus booster is likely due. I'd also recommend Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations as a precaution. We can discuss Japanese Encephalitis and Rabies if you plan on spending a lot of time in rural areas. Second, let's run some basic bloodwork to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues contributing to your fatigue. It’s good to have a baseline. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yeah. That… sounds good. Whatever she would have wanted. Shots… bloodwork… just… to get it done. I just want to… get through this. Get to Thailand, I guess. She planned it all. She’d be mad if I didn’t go. So… yes. Do what you think is best. I don’t really know anything about all this, sorry.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Odell. And don’t apologize – it’s perfectly alright not to know all the details. I’m here to help. Okay, so we’ll start with the vaccinations. We have them available today, and it will take about half an hour. Then, I’ll have the nurse draw some blood for the routine tests. We should have the results back in a few days. While we’re waiting for those results, and given how you’re feeling emotionally, I’m also going to recommend some resources for grief support. There are several excellent organizations that can provide counseling and support groups. Would you be open to me giving you some information about those?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. Grief… support. She… she would have wanted me to. I… I guess it couldn’t hurt. I just… don't know where to start. Everything feels so… empty. So… yes. Please. Give me the information. Whatever she would have done, I'll try to do. I just… miss her. A lot. Sorry. Is that okay to say?
DOCTOR: It's absolutely okay to say, Odell. It’s more than okay – it’s completely natural, and it’s a testament to how much you loved her. There's no shame in missing her, and it’s important to allow yourself to grieve. Here’s some information on several local organizations. They offer both individual and group counseling, and they can provide a safe space for you to process your emotions. There are also several online resources listed here, if that feels more comfortable. Now, let's get started with the vaccinations. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the shots. We’ll discuss the potential side effects and what to expect afterward. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… do what you need to do. I trust you. She would have trusted you. I just… want to get through this. Get to Thailand… and… remember her. Thank you. Sorry for being so… useless.
DOCTOR: You are not useless, Odell. You're doing the best you can under incredibly difficult circumstances, and that's more than enough. I'm here to support you every step of the way. The nurse will be right in. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns at any time. We’ll take things one step at a time.
