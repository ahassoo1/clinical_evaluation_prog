DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Press. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m here regarding a matter with my work. They’ve recently implemented a new rule about wearing masks and other protective gear, and… well, it’s causing some difficulties for me. I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Right. An exemption. And what sort of difficulties are you experiencing, exactly?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It isn't that I can't wear them, Doctor. It’s more… a feeling. A very strong feeling of being… restricted. It brings on a sort of… unease, a tightness in my chest. I work with folks, you see, providing support… and it's important for them to see my face, to feel a connection. The mask… it feels like it gets in the way of that. I’ve never felt this way before, this rule is new. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: A “feeling of restriction.” And this causes… what specific symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s not like a cough or a fever. It's more… a building anxiety. My heart rate increases, and I find it hard to focus. It makes me feel… disconnected, almost lightheaded. It doesn't happen immediately, it takes a little while of wearing the mask, and then it just… builds. It’s unsettling, to say the least. I don't want to be ineffective when I'm helping people, and I worry it will affect my ability to do my job properly.
DOCTOR: So, anxiety triggered by wearing a mask, with symptoms of increased heart rate and lightheadedness. And you’ve never experienced this before this new workplace policy?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Never before. I've worn masks when needed - dentist, occasional cold - and it was never a problem. This is… specific to this situation, and it's only been since the policy was put in place. It's… perplexing, even to me. I should add, I’ve always been quite healthy, and I don’t have any known anxieties or heart conditions. I’m a generally calm person, you see.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, your chart doesn’t indicate any prior history of anxiety or cardiac issues. Do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I've been very fortunate in that regard. I’ve always taken care of myself - good diet, regular exercise, plenty of rest. That's why this is so… surprising. I don't take any medications, and I don't have any allergies. I’m not sure what could be causing this reaction. Perhaps it’s something related to the type of mask they’re requiring? It’s a fairly tight-fitting N95, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: Right. An N95. And you're certain this is not simply a matter of…discomfort with the new policy, or a reluctance to adhere to workplace rules?
PATIENT: Doctor, I understand your skepticism, truly. And I assure you, it’s not about disobedience or a lack of respect for rules. I’ve always been a team player, and I appreciate the need for safety precautions. But this is… a genuine physical and emotional reaction. I’ve tried to push through it, to just get used to it, but it only gets worse. It impacts my ability to focus, to connect with the folks I’m assisting, and frankly, it’s quite frightening. It’s not a matter of wanting to avoid the mask, it’s a matter of being able to effectively do my job while wearing it. It feels… constricting, almost like I can't breathe properly, even though I know logically I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen saturation, and assess your overall respiratory function. Then we’ll see what, if anything, is physically present. It's important to rule out any underlying medical causes before we consider other possibilities.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I’m ready whenever you are. I do appreciate you taking the time to listen and consider my concerns.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just have a seat here. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out. Good. Your heart sounds regular, rate is within normal limits. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Oxygen saturation is 98%, which is excellent. Breathing appears normal, no signs of distress. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’m trying to relax, as you instructed. I do feel a bit… anxious just thinking about the mask, I must admit. But I’m doing my best to remain calm. I’m glad to hear my heart and lungs sound alright, though. I suppose it is strange that a mask would cause such a reaction if everything is physically normal. Just let me know if you need me to do anything different.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/80, slightly elevated but not concerning. Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. Physically, everything appears normal. Your vital signs are within acceptable limits, and there are no obvious signs of respiratory or cardiac issues. This leads me to believe we’re dealing with a psychological component. While I can document your concerns, I’m not qualified to provide a medical exemption based solely on anxiety. I would recommend a consultation with a mental health professional, perhaps a therapist or psychologist, to explore these feelings further and determine the best course of action. They can provide a proper evaluation and, if warranted, a letter supporting an exemption.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. That… is what I feared, to be honest. While I appreciate you ruling out any physical causes, I knew it was likely something… internal. A consultation with a mental health professional… yes, that seems a sensible course of action. I hadn't considered that, but it’s a good suggestion. It’s… a bit embarrassing, to be frank. I’ve always prided myself on being a strong, resilient person. But I suppose everyone has their limits. Could you perhaps provide me with a referral to someone in the area? Someone who might understand this sort of… reaction?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me see… Dr. Eleanor Vance is a psychologist specializing in anxiety and stress management, and she has an office about twenty miles from here. She takes Medicare. Here you go. This has her contact information and a brief summary of your concerns. I’ll also document our conversation in your chart, including my physical findings and my recommendation for mental health evaluation. I’m also going to write a note recommending that your workplace consider accommodations, if possible, while you're undergoing evaluation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor Press. Dr. Vance sounds promising, and I appreciate you providing the referral. A note about accommodations… that would be incredibly helpful. I hadn't even thought to ask. No, I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time, your patience, and your understanding. I truly appreciate it. It feels… better to have a plan, even if it’s not the answer I was hoping for. I will schedule an appointment with Dr. Vance as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Very good. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. And if you experience any worsening symptoms – chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe anxiety – please don't hesitate to go to the emergency room. Here’s a copy of your visit summary for your records. Have a good day, Mr. Knabenshue. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Press. I will keep that in mind. And I will certainly reach out if anything changes. You have a good day as well. .
