DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just so, so tired all the time. It’s been… a while now. Honestly, I can’t even remember exactly when it started. A long while.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant tiredness can be very disruptive. And it's not uncommon for the exact onset to be difficult to pinpoint. “A long while” is okay – we'll try to get a better sense of things. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I’m exhausted all day, every day. Some days are better. But… I just don’t have the energy I used to. Things feel… heavy. Even getting out of bed is hard sometimes. And it doesn’t go away with rest, not really. I just… feel worn out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not constant, but it's a persistent lack of energy, and rest doesn't fully resolve it. You mentioned things feel "heavy" – can you elaborate on that feeling?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Like… my limbs are tired, even when I haven’t done anything. And… I feel foggy, in my head. Not sick, exactly, just… slow. Like trying to think through water. It’s frustrating, honestly. I used to be so sharp.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very frustrating, Ms. Licano. A feeling of heaviness in your limbs, and a sense of mental fogginess... those are helpful details. Let's try to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this tiredness and fogginess?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Oh! Sometimes my muscles ache, a little. Not terrible, but… just achy. And… I’ve been a bit more forgetful lately, I think. Though, at my age… who isn’t?
DOCTOR: It's good you're noticing these things. Muscle aches and increased forgetfulness are worth noting, absolutely. And it's perfectly reasonable to consider changes with age, but we want to make sure there isn't something else contributing. Ms. Licano, do you have any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… not great, I suppose. I don’t really feel hungry, much of the time. And I think I’ve lost a little weight. Not a lot, but my clothes feel… looser. I haven’t really been keeping track, to be honest. Things just… slipped my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss. That’s important information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… my husband, God rest his soul, he always took care of all that. I… I know I see the doctor for check-ups, and I have Medicare, of course. But I don’t really remember any big illnesses. Nothing major. I’m… I’m sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. Don't apologize at all. We can often get information from your records. And it’s not uncommon for details to be difficult to recall. I can access your EHR here to see your past medical history. Okay, I see here you have a history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. You also have some documented osteoarthritis, primarily in your knees. Is that consistent with what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the knees! They bother me sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And the… the high blood pressure, yes. I take a pill for that. I think it’s a water pill. The other one… the cholesterol, maybe? I really don’t pay much attention. My husband always handled the medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. We'll get a complete medication list shortly. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don’t think so. Nothing I’ve ever been particularly bothered by. Maybe a little bit of hay fever in the spring, but nothing serious. No rashes, no trouble breathing… not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s a tough one. My mother… she had some sort of heart trouble, I think. And my father, he… he wasn’t very healthy towards the end. Lots of aches and pains. Cancer, maybe? I honestly can’t recall. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Ms. Licano. It’s common for those details to be hazy. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t drink, either. Not much of a drinker, never have been. And… definitely no drugs. I’m a church lady, Doctor!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Licano. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on, and maybe get some energy back. I’m tired of being tired.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Let’s start with your vital signs. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/92, pulse is 78, respiratory rate is 16, and temperature is 98.6. That blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and muscle strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Gait is stable, no significant balance issues noted. Skin is warm and dry, mucous membranes are slightly pale. Okay, Ms. Licano, based on the exam, I don't find any obvious acute abnormalities. Your pallor is a little concerning, though. I'd like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll get those ordered right away. I'm going to order a Complete Blood Count to check for anemia or infection, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to assess your kidney and liver function and electrolytes, a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone to rule out thyroid issues, and a Vitamin D level, as low levels can cause fatigue. The lab will call with the results as soon as they're available, usually within a couple of days. In the meantime, I’d like you to try to get as much rest as possible. Also, stay well hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. Licano?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I’m just… tired. That’s all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Licano. We'll get to the bottom of this. We’ll review the lab results as soon as they come in and discuss the next steps. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here’s a lab requisition for your blood work. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good afternoon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
