DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the foggiest idea why I'm here, precisely. Something about not being able to… see or hear properly, I believe my daughter explained. It’s all rather unsettling, and frankly, a waste of my time. I have patients waiting, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. I see here a note from your daughter regarding some changes in your vision and hearing. It's good she brought you in – even if it feels like a waste of time, it’s always best to check these things out. “Not being able to see or hear properly” is pretty broad, though. Can you tell me a bit more specifically what's been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. Things just… aren’t as clear as they used to be, I suppose. And sounds… muffled. Like someone put cotton in my ears. It happened rather suddenly, though I couldn’t pinpoint a date, if that’s what you’re asking. I simply woke up one morning, and things were…diminished. Really, it’s most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, "diminished" is helpful. Sudden onset is important too. So, both vision and hearing affected at roughly the same time?
PATIENT: I believe so, yes. Though, truthfully, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it once was. It’s possible the hearing went first. Or the sight. Honestly, it’s all rather… pedestrian. I deal with life-and-death situations all day, and I’m being bothered with… this. Is there a quick test we can do?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. We can definitely do some quick tests. First, let’s focus on the vision. Have you noticed any loss of vision in either eye, or is it just general blurriness in both?
PATIENT: Blurriness, Doctor, definitely blurriness. It’s not as if I’ve gone completely blind. Though, my daughter made a rather alarming comment about glaucoma, I recall. Is that what this is? Honestly, I’ve never had much patience for… eye problems. It’s such a delicate field.
DOCTOR: Glaucoma is a possibility we'll need to rule out, yes, but it's too early to say. Your daughter is right to be concerned, it’s good she’s looking out for you. Let’s do a quick visual acuity test – just reading some letters on a chart. Then we can check your peripheral vision. Can you read the top line of this chart for me?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But do hurry, Doctor. …Is this a joke? I can barely make out the shapes, let alone letters. Honestly, this is quite… substandard. It's hardly a professional chart, is it? I suppose I can see something, but it's terribly faint. I really think your lighting is poor.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That confirms some vision impairment. Let’s switch gears and talk about your hearing. Do you notice the muffled sound in both ears, or is it worse in one?
PATIENT: Both, I believe. Though, truthfully, Doctor, everything sounds rather…distant. Like someone is speaking from another room. I’ve never had particularly sensitive hearing, I must confess. All those screaming children over the years… one tends to tune things out. It’s a survival mechanism, really. Is this some sort of age-related…deterioration? I do hate to ask, but is this permanent?
DOCTOR: Age-related hearing loss is common, yes, but we need to determine the cause and extent of yours. A quick hearing test, or audiometry, will give us a clearer picture. It's a simple, painless test where you'll wear headphones and respond to tones. Would you be willing to do that now?
PATIENT: Oh, another test? Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to suspect this is a complete waste of time. I have patients depending on me! But… fine. Get it over with. Just please, be quick about it. I haven't got all day, you know. And do try to explain it concisely. I haven't the patience for lengthy instructions.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll be right here in the sound booth. You’ll wear these headphones, and I'll play tones at different frequencies and volumes. When you hear a tone, just press this button. It's as simple as that. I'll be right outside, monitoring the results. I'll explain everything clearly afterward, I promise. Just focus on the tones, and press the button when you hear something. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Press the button when I hear a tone. Honestly, it sounds remarkably simple. Are you quite certain this will yield any useful information? Get on with it, Doctor. I trust you know what you’re doing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie, that's enough for now. How did that feel?
PATIENT: Frankly, Doctor, it was rather tedious. All those beeps… Honestly, I barely heard a thing. Though, perhaps that’s the point. Is it over now? I’m quite certain I've failed spectacularly. Do tell me what this proves, if anything. And please, be brief.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie. The results show a moderate to severe hearing loss in both ears. It's not just a matter of age, unfortunately. We need to investigate the cause further. Have you ever had any exposure to loud noises, or any history of ear infections or head trauma?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, Doctor, where do I even begin? Decades spent in operating rooms, the constant beeping of machines… And screaming children, naturally. As for ear infections, I suppose I had a few as a child, but nothing particularly memorable. Head trauma… well, there was that incident with the falling equipment in medical school, but that was ages ago. Honestly, I barely recall it. It hardly seems relevant, does it? I suspect it’s simply the accumulation of… life. A rather unpleasant side effect, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: It could be a combination of factors. Given your history, we need to rule out noise-induced hearing loss, but other causes are possible. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a tympanometry test – it assesses the function of your middle ear – and possibly an MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, more tests? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like a laboratory specimen! An MRI… Is that absolutely necessary? I do have a rather…claustrophobic tendency, you see. And frankly, the whole process is terribly inconvenient. I simply don’t have the time for all this. Is there not a simpler solution? Perhaps some…ear drops? I’ve heard those can be quite effective.
DOCTOR: Ear drops might provide some temporary relief, but they won't address the underlying cause of the hearing loss. An MRI is recommended to rule out any serious issues, like a tumor or nerve damage. We can discuss options to manage your claustrophobia if you decide to proceed – a mild sedative or an open MRI, for example. However, skipping the MRI could mean missing a potentially serious condition. It's important to get a clear diagnosis so we can determine the best course of treatment. Would you be willing to consider the MRI, knowing we can address your concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. But I insist on the mild sedative. And I expect the entire process to be as quick and efficient as possible. I haven't got all day, you know. And I expect a detailed explanation of everything afterward. I do not appreciate being kept in the dark. Just get it over with. This is most inconvenient.
