DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Brum, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Mitchell Brum. That is me. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Batara, you said?
DOCTOR: Pinky Batara. Yes. And you can call me Doctor Batara, if you please. Now, Mr. Brum, you're 90 years young – quite a milestone. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: A headache, Doctor. In the back of my head. It started… oh, maybe three days ago? Not a bad one, at first. Just a little ache. But it’s been getting… bigger, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache. Three days ago, starting as a little ache and now… bigger. Can you describe "bigger"?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not like a pounding, you understand? More like… a weight. A heavy weight sitting right there. And it feels… steady. Not coming and going so much. Just there. It makes it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, a steady weight at the base of your skull, interfering with sleep. And has anything made it worse?
PATIENT: Now that you ask… yes. When I bend over, it gets worse. Like when I was trying to fix the little garden hose yesterday. And… when I get excited, talking with my grandson, it feels… tighter. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Brum. It does. So, bending over and excitement seem to aggravate it. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with this headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. No fever, I don’t think. And no… blurry vision. Not dizzy, either. Oh! Wait. Sometimes… my hands feel a little… tingly. Not always, though. Mostly in the evenings. Like pins and needles. A little. It doesn’t hurt, just… feels funny.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no blurry vision, no dizziness. Tingling in the hands, mostly in the evenings. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not like this. I get little aches sometimes, you know, when the weather changes. But this… this is different. It’s been a long time since I had a headache that lasted this long. And the tingling… that's new, too.
DOCTOR: Right. A different headache, and new tingling. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well… my wife, bless her soul, she always worried about my blood pressure. The doctor said it ran a little high sometimes, a long time ago. But he never gave me pills or anything. Just told me to watch my salt. And… I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. They fixed it, though. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing serious. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Hmm. History of slightly elevated blood pressure, and a broken wrist. And have you had any surgeries besides your wrist?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the wrist. Nothing else. I always tried to stay out of the hospital if I could. Not a fan of doctors, you see. But I figured I better come when this headache didn’t go away. My grandson, he was worried. He’s a good boy.
DOCTOR: I see. A good grandson encourages sensible decisions. Now, Mr. Brum, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Not a single pill. I don’t like taking medicine if I can avoid it. Always figured my body knows best. Maybe I was wrong this time, though. This headache… it’s making me think.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. And do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve eaten everything my wife put in front of me for sixty years, and she liked to try new things! No rashes, no trouble breathing. Nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty sturdy, you see. But like I said, this headache… it's different. It's got me worried.
DOCTOR: Very well. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed, let me ask about your family history. Have any of your close relatives—parents, siblings, children—had similar headaches, or any neurological conditions like stroke or dementia?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother, she had terrible headaches sometimes. Real bad ones. She would lie down in a dark room for hours. But I don't know if they were like this. More like… pounding, she said. And my older brother, he had a stroke a few years back, near the end. He didn't talk much about it afterwards. That’s about all I know. My wife’s family… they were all pretty healthy, I think. Mostly farmers, strong folks.
DOCTOR: Okay. A mother with headaches – different type, it sounds like – and a brother with a stroke. We're getting a clearer picture. Now, a few lifestyle questions, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life, Doctor. My wife, she couldn't stand the smell. Always said it was a waste of good money. And I always agreed with her. She was a smart woman. I do enjoy a little rum sometimes, though. A small glass with dinner. Helps me sleep. But not every night.
DOCTOR: A small rum with dinner occasionally. That’s good to know. And how much alcohol would you say you consume in a typical week?
PATIENT: Oh, not much, Doctor. Maybe two or three small glasses a week. Nothing more. I'm not a big drinker. I prefer a good cup of coffee, to be honest. It keeps me going. And my grandson, he always brings me a nice, strong cup when he visits.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you work, or have you retired?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm retired now, Doctor. Been retired for… oh, twenty years, maybe more. I used to work on the railroad. Rail yard work. Dinkey operator, hostler… lots of different things. Heavy work. But my hands aren't what they used to be. That was a long time ago, though. Now I mostly just tend my little garden and spend time with my grandson.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, do you have any questions for me before I proceed with a physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes. That sounds… good. I guess my question is… what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm just an old man, but I still like to know what's going on in my body. Is it my blood pressure? Or something else? I don't want to worry my grandson, you see. He worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: It’s good you ask. It’s difficult to say definitively without an examination, Mr. Brum. Given your age and history of slightly elevated blood pressure, that’s certainly something we need to investigate. The tingling in your hands, and the fact that bending over makes the headache worse, also raises some concerns that warrant further investigation. We will check your blood pressure, neurological function, and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. It doesn't necessarily mean it's something serious, but it’s best to rule things out. We’ll start with a basic examination, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. That sounds… sensible. Rule things out. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. And… if you need me to do anything, just tell me. I’ll try my best. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could sit up straight for me, please. I’m going to start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. It may be a little cold. Just breathe normally.
