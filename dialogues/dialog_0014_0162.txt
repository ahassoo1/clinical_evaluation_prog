DOCTOR: Well, hello. Lawton Kristofik, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Look, doc, I got things to do, so if we could just… get this over with, that’d be great. It’s my stomach, okay? Bloated. Really bloated. Feels like I ate a watermelon, even when I haven’t.
DOCTOR: Right. Bloated. And how long has this been going on, Lawton?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t really keep track of that kinda thing. A while. Weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. It’s just… annoying. Like wearing a too-tight belt all the time, you know? I haven’t been sleeping well because of it either. Look, is it something serious? ‘Cause I really don’t have time for… problems.
DOCTOR: "Problems," right. Well, everything could be a problem, couldn't it?
PATIENT: See? That’s what I mean. Just… tell me if it’s something I need to worry about, or if it’s just… one of those things. I’m a pile driver operator, I don't sit around worrying about my insides. It feels like gas, mostly, but… it doesn't always go away. And it's uncomfortable, alright? Like, really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, discomfort and bloating. Any nausea or vomiting with this, Lawton?
PATIENT: Nah, no throwing up. Not even close. Just… full. And gassy. Really, really gassy. Look, I eat normal stuff, you know? Burgers, fries, the occasional steak. I'm not eating anything weird. It’s not like I'm suddenly allergic to… food. Is this gonna involve a lot of tests? ‘Cause I really don’t do well in hospitals.
DOCTOR: Hospitals are for sick people, Lawton. We're just trying to figure out what's going on. Okay, no nausea, no vomiting…any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean? I… go to the bathroom when I need to, okay? Look, I’m not gonna get into the details of my… bathroom habits with you. Is this something you ask everyone? This is ridiculous. It's just bloating! Is it stress? Maybe it's stress. I lost my wife a couple years back, maybe that’s it.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly cause… issues. But we still need to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Seriously? No! Of course not! I would know if there was blood. Look, I’m a practical man, doc. I deal with heavy machinery all day, I'm not delicate. I wouldn't miss something like blood. This is just… gas, probably. Maybe I ate something bad last week, I don't know. Can’t you just give me something for it? Something to settle my stomach?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's just do a quick exam, okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick. And don’t poke around too much, alright? I got a job to do. Honestly, I don’t understand what this is even for. I just need something to make the bloating stop. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Lie down on your back, please. I'll listen to your abdomen. And try to relax, Lawton. Just breathe normally. Sounds… a bit hyperactive. Definitely some gurgling. And it seems… somewhat distended. I can feel some tenderness in the lower abdomen, but nothing alarming. A little bit of tympany as well. Definitely gas.
PATIENT: Tympany? What’s that even mean? Look, doc, you’re talking in circles. Is it serious or not? I need a straight answer. All this… listening and poking and… tympany... I don’t have time for medical jargon. If it’s not serious, can I just go? And if it is serious… what do I need to do? Don't tell me I need surgery, alright? I can’t afford to be out of work.
DOCTOR: It's not likely to be surgery, Lawton. Tympany just means there’s a lot of gas in your intestines. It's consistent with what you're describing. It could be something as simple as dietary changes or stress, like you mentioned. But, given your history… and the fact that it's been going on for weeks… I want to rule out some other possibilities. We’ll do a quick blood test just to check for inflammation and rule out any underlying issues. And I’m going to order a stool sample to check for any infections. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Blood test and a stool sample? Seriously? Look, I really don’t like this. I’m a perfectly healthy man, I just got a bloated stomach! Can't you just give me some pills or something? I don’t want to go poking around with samples and tests. This is ridiculous. My wife would've told me to just tough it out. She hated doctors. I don’t see why I need all this… fuss.
DOCTOR: Lawton, with all due respect, "toughing it out" isn't always the best approach. And while your wife’s preference is noted, we are trying to be proactive here. These tests will help us rule out anything serious, and then we can discuss appropriate management. It’s basic medical procedure. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood, and give you a container for the stool sample. Once we have the results, we’ll talk about it again. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding carbonated beverages and… anything else that seems to exacerbate the bloating. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. Carbonated drinks? I drink coffee, alright? Black coffee. That’s it. Look, I’m a busy man. Don’t expect me to sit around waiting for results. I’ll call if I get… worse. Just… where’s this nurse? I gotta get back to work. .
