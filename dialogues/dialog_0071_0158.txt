DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it's a bit of a…fuss, really. Something about a letter? For a pet, I think. My niece, she said I needed something from a doctor. I can't rightly recall all the details, she handles most of that sort of thing. It’s probably for that…dog. Yes, a dog. A big one.
DOCTOR: Right, a letter for the dog. Hmm. That is unusual, though not unheard of these days, with travel requirements and all. Your niece said you needed something from me specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. She said something about needing a doctor's…approval? Or a statement, maybe? That the dog is…sound. Healthy enough to…well, I don’t know what exactly, to be honest. She was very insistent it had to be you. Said you were…reliable. I just wish she'd explained it better. It’s all a bit of a bother, really. I don’t see why a dog needs a doctor’s note.
DOCTOR: Well, "reliable" is good to hear! It sounds like your niece is arranging something that requires veterinary documentation, and for some reason, she prefers I provide it. I'm happy to help, though I confess my expertise is more…human-focused. Let’s try to piece this together. Do you know where your niece is sending this documentation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's the part I really don't know. She just said something about…overseas? Europe, I think. Possibly France? She's always going on trips, that girl. Always fancy places. Honestly, I just let her handle all these things. I'm not good with paperwork and…foreign rules, or whatever they are. It's probably for that…Pierre, I think the dog's name is. A rather large poodle. A bit much, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right, Pierre the poodle, traveling to France. Okay. Let me see… Ah, here we are. It seems your niece contacted the clinic requesting a health certificate for Pierre, specifically for international travel. They need proof of a recent examination and vaccinations. So, it is a legitimate request. It's good she’s thinking ahead. Now, Deloris, have you brought Pierre with you today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Are you joking? That dog sheds everywhere! And he's…well, a bit rambunctious. My niece has him right now. She said I just needed to come here and…confirm things. Tell you I was in good health, so the dog could travel in good conscience, or something like that. Honestly, it all seems a bit ridiculous. I haven’t even seen Pierre in weeks. But if that’s what she needs…
DOCTOR: Right, so the health certificate is primarily for Pierre, but your niece needs a statement from you regarding your own health…that’s… unusual. I believe I recall her mentioning something about a legal requirement…something about ensuring the animal isn't bringing any communicable diseases into the country. It’s a bit of a precaution. It sounds like a rather thorough process. Now, let’s focus on you. Are you currently experiencing any health issues or have any ongoing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, nothing major, if that’s what you mean. My knees ache a bit, if I stand for too long. And I get…a little forgetful sometimes, as you can probably tell. But honestly, that's just getting old, isn't it? Nothing a good cup of tea can’t fix. I’m generally…fine. I had a bit of a cough last winter, but it cleared up. My niece worries too much, really. She's always asking about my…vitamins and check-ups. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Aching knees and some forgetfulness, understandable at any age. And a cough last winter. Alright. Just to be thorough, and to ensure we have everything for this certificate, do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I take…something for my knees, yes. A little white pill. My niece sorts it out, so I don't pay much attention to the name. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take one of those…nighttime things. The red ones. Again, she gets them for me. Honestly, I couldn’t tell you what they’re called. It's all a bit of a blur. She’s very organised, my niece. I rely on her for all these things. Do I need to know the names? It feels like too much fuss.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful, Deloris, to have the names of those medications for the certificate, just to ensure there are no interactions or contraindications. It’s standard procedure, you see. Do you perhaps have the bottles with you?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, no bottles. I never carry those things around. My niece keeps them at her place, with all the other…medicines and…things. Honestly, I wouldn’t even know where to begin looking for them. Maybe you should just ask her? She's got everything organised, you see. She probably has a list of everything I take. It would be much easier, wouldn’t it? It’s all a bit…overwhelming, trying to remember these things. I’m starting to get a headache. Perhaps a cup of tea would help.
DOCTOR: Alright, Deloris. I understand it’s a bit overwhelming. We can certainly contact your niece to get that information. It’s best to be accurate, you see, for the sake of the certificate. While we wait for her response, let’s do a quick physical examination, just to get a general overview of your health. Nothing extensive, just a blood pressure check, listen to your heart and lungs, and a brief look at your knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh…well, alright. I suppose that’s…reasonable. As long as it doesn’t take too long. My knees aren't particularly fond of being…examined. And please, don’t ask me to remember any dates or anything. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Just…a quick check, you said? I hope it doesn't involve too much…bending.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just a quick check, I promise. Minimal bending required. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, if you don’t mind, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. And now, just a quick look at your knees... Can you bend them a little for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s…uncomfortable. They feel a bit…stiff. Like they’re full of…sandpaper. I haven’t been doing much walking lately. Too much rain, you see. And that reminds me, my niece said something about needing a tetanus shot for Pierre…something about travelling to France. Honestly, it's all very confusing. Is that something I need, or is it for the dog? I keep getting them mixed up.
DOCTOR: Right, knees feel stiff, some discomfort on bending. And the tetanus shot for Pierre. It's good you brought that up. The tetanus shot is for Pierre, definitely. It’s a requirement for international travel. Now, back to you. Are you experiencing any pain in your knees when you're resting, or is it only when you move?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s mostly when I move, you see. When I stand up, or walk, or…bend them, like I just did. When I’m sitting, it’s generally alright. Although sometimes, if I sit for too long, they get a bit…achey. It's a dull ache, not a sharp pain. More like…a constant reminder they’re there. Honestly, I try not to think about them too much. It just makes them hurt more. Is all this…important for the certificate? I’m starting to worry I’m wasting your time. It all seems so silly. A letter for a dog…
DOCTOR: No, you're not wasting my time, Deloris. It's important to have a complete picture, even for a certificate. We're just documenting your overall health. The aches are likely due to some mild osteoarthritis, common at your age. Now, have you noticed any swelling or redness around your knees?
PATIENT: Hmm…no, no swelling that I can see. And no redness either. They just feel…stiff, and achey, like I said. Sometimes they feel a little warm, but that could just be…the weather, you see. It’s been quite warm lately. And I do tend to get a bit flushed easily. Honestly, I think it’s just…old age creeping up on me. All these little aches and pains. Is there anything…you can do about it? A cream, perhaps? Or a pill? I don't want to become completely immobile, you see. I still like to…potter about in the garden, when the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: There are certainly things we can do. A topical cream could help with the aches, and we could discuss some gentle exercises to improve your range of motion. We can also talk about over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. As for exercises, I'd recommend consulting with a physical therapist. They can create a program tailored to your specific needs. Now, while we wait for your niece to get back to us about the medications, is there anything else you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: Oh…a physical therapist, you say? That sounds…frightening. All that stretching and…movement. Honestly, I’m not very good with…vigorous activity. But a cream sounds nice. Yes, a cream would be good. And…well, sometimes I forget things. Like names, and dates, and…where I put my glasses. It's quite embarrassing, you see. Is there anything…you can do about that? A pill for my memory, perhaps? I don’t want to become completely…lost in my own thoughts. My niece worries about that too.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned about memory lapses, Deloris. And it's good you're addressing it. There are several things that can contribute to memory problems, including stress, medication side effects, and underlying medical conditions. It’s important to rule those out first. We can start with a simple cognitive assessment, a brief set of questions to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. If we identify any concerns, we can then discuss potential causes and treatment options. We wouldn’t jump to medication right away. There are also several lifestyle changes that can help improve memory, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and mental stimulation. Let’s see if we can reach your niece now. Perhaps she has the medication names readily available?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A cognitive assessment sounds…daunting. But if you think it’s necessary…Yes, let’s try to reach my niece. She’s usually very prompt. She’s a very organised girl, you see. Always thinking ahead. I’m sure she has a list of everything I take. Perhaps she even has a schedule for my pills. Honestly, I rely on her for everything these days. I just hope this whole process doesn’t take too long. I’m starting to feel rather…frazzled. And I do need to get home for my tea. It gets cold rather quickly, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Deloris. Let’s just see if we can get this sorted quickly. Hopefully, your niece will answer right away. While I’m on the phone, perhaps you can just relax for a moment. Hello, is this [Niece's Name]?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. She always answers promptly, that girl. Always on top of things. I do hope she remembers the names of my pills. Honestly, it's all so much trouble for a letter for a dog. I never thought it would be so complicated. Perhaps I should just have stayed home and had my tea. It's getting cold, you know. Yes, very cold. And I do need to check on my garden. The roses might be drooping. Yes, drooping. That's a terrible thing. I do hope she answers soon.
DOCTOR: ... Yes, I understand... Yes, she's right here with me... Ah, excellent. You have the list?
PATIENT: Oh, good. She has the list? Wonderful. I do hope they're the correct names. She sometimes gets things mixed up, you see. Always rushing about, doing so many things at once. But she's a good girl, my niece. Very thoughtful. Yes, I’m sure the list is accurate. Mostly. Yes, go ahead, read them. I’m listening. Very carefully. I wouldn't want to miss anything. It’s important, you see. Very important. For the dog. Yes, the dog.
DOCTOR: Alright, Deloris. Your niece provided a list of your medications. You take Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure, and Melatonin 3mg at night for sleep. And she also mentioned you occasionally take Ibuprofen 200mg for aches and pains, as needed. Is that all correct?
PATIENT: Hmm…Lisinopril…yes, that sounds right. For my blood pressure. And Melatonin…yes, for sleep. That’s correct. And Ibuprofen…yes, for my aches and pains. As needed, you see. When they get too bad. Yes, that’s everything. That’s the complete list. My niece is very thorough, you see. Always making sure I have everything I need. Oh, and she also mentioned something about a Vitamin D supplement, but she wasn't sure of the dosage. It's a small white pill, she said. But that's not very helpful, is it? Yes, a small white pill. Honestly, I take so many pills, it's hard to keep track. But yes, that's everything. I think. Hopefully. Is that enough for the certificate?
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful, Deloris. With the medication list, your recent examination findings, and the cognitive assessment we just discussed, I believe I have enough information to complete the health certificate for your niece. Now, regarding the cognitive assessment…it’s just a simple questionnaire to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. It helps me get a baseline understanding of your cognitive function, and identify any potential areas of concern. Would you mind answering a few questions?
PATIENT: Oh, another questionnaire? Honestly, I’m not very good at questionnaires. I always get confused. And I forget things, you see. It’s a terrible thing. But alright, I suppose I can try. If it’s necessary. But please, be patient with me. And don’t mind if I get things wrong. I do try my best. But my memory isn't what it used to be. And I get distracted easily. Yes, very easily. What sort of questions are they? Are they difficult? I do hope they’re not too complicated. Honestly, I just want to get this certificate sorted and get home for my tea. It’s probably cold by now.
DOCTOR: They are very simple questions, Deloris. Nothing complicated at all. Just a few questions about your memory and orientation. We'll start with something easy. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Today’s date…? Let me think… Is it still July? No, no, my niece said it was August… August…? Oh, goodness. I always forget the numbers. Is it the 1st? No, no… Wait. Is it the 2nd? Yes, I think it’s the 2nd. August 2nd, is it? Yes, I believe so. Yes, August 2nd. Is that correct? I do hope I’m right. My niece would be very disappointed if I got it wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are absolutely correct. Today is August 2nd. Very good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. What city…? Let me think… Is it… London? No, no, that’s where my niece went on holiday. Is it…Paris? No, no, that's on her list of places to visit. Oh, goodness. This is difficult. It’s a small town, isn’t it? With lots of trees… and… farms? Oh, I don't know. Is it… Springville? No, that’s not right. Is it…Riverton? Oh, goodness, I’m terrible at geography. Is this a test? Is that what this is? Oh, I just can’t remember. It’s right on the tip of my tongue…
DOCTOR: It's alright, Deloris. Don't worry about it. It's not a test. This town is called Havenwood. It's okay to not remember. Let's try a simpler question. Do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The year…? Let me think… Is it… 2020? No, no, that was the year with the…trouble. Is it…2022? No, no, that's when my niece went to…Italy. Oh, dear. This is very difficult. Is it…2024? No, no. Is it…2025? Yes! Yes, I think it’s 2025. Yes, 2025. Is that correct? Please say it’s correct. I’m trying so hard. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s just… fading away.
DOCTOR: Yes, Deloris, you are absolutely correct. It is 2025. You're doing very well. Now, let's move on to the next question. Do you remember what animal you came to see me about today?
PATIENT: Oh…an animal…? Let me think… Did I bring my cat? No, I don’t have a cat. Did I bring a bird? No, birds are too messy. Oh, dear… Was it a… a rabbit? No, no, rabbits are too… jumpy. Oh, goodness, I’m terrible at remembering things. Was it… a hamster? No, no, hamsters are too… small. Oh… Was it… Was it… a dog? Yes! Yes, I think it was a dog! It was a dog! Yes, a big dog! Is that right? Please say it’s right. This is so confusing. My niece said something about a health certificate… for a dog! Yes, a dog!
DOCTOR: Yes, Deloris, you are absolutely right! It was a dog. You’ve done very well. Now, based on your examination, your medication list, and this brief assessment, I can confidently complete the health certificate for Pierre, your niece’s dog. It states that you are of sound health, and there are no contraindications to his international travel. Here you go. This is the health certificate. Please give this to your niece. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh… a certificate! Yes, that’s what my niece wanted. For Pierre, the dog. It's very… official-looking. A lot of words. I can't read very well, you see. But it says I'm… sound? That's good, isn't it? No, I don't think there's anything else. Just… getting home for my tea. It’s probably very cold by now. And the roses… I need to check on the roses. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. And very kind. Yes, very kind. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Deloris. It was my pleasure. Please, take care of yourself, and enjoy your tea. And do check on those roses! .
