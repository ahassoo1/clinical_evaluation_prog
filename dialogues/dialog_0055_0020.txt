DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to my practice. I am Dr. Eaddy. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. I… I am here for this… telehealth visit? The lady on the phone said something about checking how I am doing. It is for my health, yes? I am not feeling bad, bad, just… old, maybe.
DOCTOR: A telehealth visit… yes, I see a note here about a follow-up. Though we are meeting in person today, Ms. Benites. Perhaps there was a miscommunication. Regardless, “feeling old” is a rather vague symptom. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh! In person… yes, that is right. My apologies, Doctor. I forget things easily now. It is… hard to explain. My joints, they ache, especially when the weather is… wet. And I tire quickly. Even simple things, like walking to the store… it takes a lot out of me. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, that is a much clearer picture. Aches and fatigue… and you mentioned this is worsened by the weather?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. When it rains, or when it is very cold… it is much worse. Like someone is pushing little needles into my knees and hips. And my hands… they are stiff in the mornings. It takes a long time to get them moving. I do try to keep busy, you know? I like to work on cars… but even that is becoming difficult.
DOCTOR: I see. So, joint pain, particularly in the knees and hips, aggravated by weather changes. Stiffness in the mornings, impacting your ability to perform activities you enjoy… like working on cars. Do you notice any swelling in these joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… sometimes, yes. Not always, but when it is very bad, my knuckles are… puffy. And my ankles, sometimes, after a long day. I don't think much of it, I just put my feet up. I have had this… ache for many years, you see. It comes and goes. Is this something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Intermittent joint pain for many years, with periods of swelling in the knuckles and ankles. Now, have you noticed any redness or warmth in these joints along with the pain and swelling?
PATIENT: Redness… I don't think so. Warmth… maybe a little? It is hard to say, Doctor. I have poor circulation in my feet, the doctor told me years ago. They always feel cold. It is difficult to know what is normal and what is… not. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Benites. Poor circulation complicates things, certainly. Now, let's move on to other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, fatigue outside of the muscle aches, or any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I know of. I take my temperature sometimes, when I feel a chill, but it is always normal. And no weight loss. If anything, I have gained a little weight, since my husband… passed. I do not have a very big appetite, but I enjoy my cooking, perhaps too much. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Ms. Benites. It helps to build a complete picture. Now, have you noticed any pain or stiffness in other joints besides your knees, hips, and hands?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes, my neck is stiff. Especially in the mornings. And my lower back… it aches sometimes after I have been bending over, working on a car. But I always thought that was just my age. I am not a young woman, you know. Perhaps it is just… wear and tear.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, or any autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh, my! That is a lot of big words, Doctor. I have… high blood pressure, the doctor told me. And my cholesterol is a little high. I take pills for both. And, like I said, poor circulation. My husband… he had diabetes. But I do not have that, the doctor tested me. I do not remember any… other names of sicknesses. Is arthritis something bad?
DOCTOR: Arthritis is a common condition involving inflammation of the joints, Ms. Benites. There are many different types. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. And I broke my wrist when I was a young woman, I fell off a horse. But that was a long time ago. I haven't been in the hospital since. My husband… he was in the hospital a lot towards the end. But I have been mostly healthy, all my life. I try to stay active, you know? Even if it is just puttering around in my garage.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – and a wrist fracture in the past. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any family members who have experienced arthritis, autoimmune diseases, or other joint problems?
PATIENT: My mother… she had arthritis in her hands. Very bad, towards the end of her life. She could hardly close her fists. And my sister… she has something with her bones, the doctor said it was osteoporosis. She broke her hip last year. But that is all I can think of, really. We are not a very… sickly family, generally.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of arthritis in your mother and osteoporosis in your sister. Now, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor! Never. I do not smoke. My husband… he smoked for many years, but he quit a long time ago. And I do not drink alcohol. I used to have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped after my husband… passed. And I certainly do not use any… recreational drugs. I am a very respectable woman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. And I have not ever had a bad reaction to any medicines. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I take penicillin, but it is not very bad. My husband… he was allergic to bee stings. But I am fine, thankfully. I have always been very lucky, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites. Now, you mentioned you are currently taking medication for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Could you please tell me the names and dosages of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is difficult. I have so many pills… Let me see… The little white one… is for the blood pressure. The doctor said it is… Lisinopril. Ten milligrams. And the yellow one… is for the cholesterol. Atorvastatin… twenty milligrams. I take them every morning with my breakfast. I hope that is correct, Doctor. I sometimes get them mixed up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 10mg and Atorvastatin 20mg daily. Now, Ms. Benites, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. Just a quick assessment of your joints, your range of motion, and some basic neurological checks. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. My old bones are not what they used to be, you know. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please sit on the table for me. First, I'm going to gently palpate your knees and hips to assess for tenderness or swelling. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Hmm… there is a slight tenderness here on the medial side of your right knee. And a little warmth as well. And a similar finding on the left, though slightly less pronounced. Now, your hips... There's some discomfort with range of motion here, particularly with internal rotation. And your hands… there’s some slight swelling in the metacarpophalangeal joints - the large knuckles - and limited range of motion. I'm also noting some mild crepitus – a grinding sensation – with movement in both hands.
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, that is tender. Especially when you press there on the inside of my right knee. And yes, my hands feel… stiff. It is worse in the mornings, like you said. I have to make a fist several times before I can do anything. Crepitus… is that bad, Doctor? It sounds… scary. It is just like my old bones are rubbing together. I suppose that is to be expected, at my age. But it is good to know you are checking, Doctor. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Crepitus isn’t necessarily indicative of anything serious, Ms. Benites, but it’s important to note. Now, I'm going to assess your reflexes and muscle strength in your legs and arms. Please relax, and I'll just do a few simple tests. Your reflexes are within normal limits, and your muscle strength is adequate, though slightly diminished in your hands. Now, I am noting some mild swelling in your ankles as well. Do you experience any pain or discomfort in your ankles?
PATIENT: Oh! My ankles… yes, they do swell sometimes. Especially at the end of the day, or if it is very hot. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but they feel… heavy. It is just like the blood is pooling there, you know? The doctor said something about poor circulation before. I usually put my feet up, and it helps. Is that enough, Doctor? Should I be doing something else?
DOCTOR: Putting your feet up is a good start, Ms. Benites. Based on the physical examination and your medical history, it appears you are experiencing symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis, possibly complicated by some mild edema—swelling—in your ankles due to poor circulation. Now, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a C-reactive protein test to assess for inflammation. I would also recommend X-rays of your knees and hands to evaluate the extent of joint damage. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh my. So many tests… It sounds… serious, Doctor. But if you think it is best… yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment. I just hope it is not too expensive. I am on a fixed income, you see. I do have Medicare, though. Will that cover everything? I just want to know what is going on with my old bones, and what I can do to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Benites. Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, though there may be some co-pays or deductibles depending on your specific plan. The office staff will assist you with navigating the billing process. Now, while we await the results of these tests, I recommend continuing to put your feet up when possible, engaging in low-impact exercises like walking or swimming to maintain joint flexibility, and consider using over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed. We can also discuss the possibility of physical therapy once we have a clearer picture of your condition. Would you like me to write you a prescription for an over-the-counter pain reliever?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. A prescription would be very helpful. I forget what I have in my medicine cabinet sometimes, you know. And yes, I do try to stay active, but it is getting harder. Walking is nice, when the weather is good. I do not swim, though. I never learned. Physical therapy… that sounds good. If it can help me get back to working on cars, that would be wonderful. I miss puttering around in my garage. It keeps me busy, you see. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites. Here is a prescription for ibuprofen 200mg, to be taken as needed for pain, up to three times daily. Please remember to take it with food to avoid stomach upset. I will also have the office staff schedule you for a follow-up appointment once the test results are available. We can then discuss the results in detail and develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, severe pain, or difficulty breathing, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you so much for your time and your kindness. I feel much better knowing what is going on, and having a plan. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old woman's aches and pains. I will be sure to call if anything changes. And I will see you at the follow-up appointment. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Benites. It was my pleasure. Remember, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And don't worry about mentioning your aches and pains; they are important. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
