DOCTOR: Right. Jaylyne Dhanoa, 27 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Sink. It's this ringing in my ears. It’s been happening for a bit now, and it’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ears… tinnitus, then. And how long exactly is “a bit”?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe three or four weeks now? It started quiet, just after a concert, but it hasn't gone away. It's gotten louder, especially when it's quiet.
DOCTOR: A concert, you say. And was it… a particularly loud concert?
PATIENT: Yeah, it was pretty loud. One of those big dance music ones, you know? Bass was really pumping. I was right up near the speakers, I think that was a mistake now looking back.
DOCTOR: Right. Exposure to loud noise. Not surprising. And is it constant, this ringing?
PATIENT: No, not always. Sometimes it’s quiet, like I barely notice it. But other times… especially at night when I’m trying to sleep… it’s really loud and high-pitched. It keeps me awake.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any hearing loss at all?
PATIENT: Hearing loss? Not that I've noticed, no. Everything sounds normal, just… with this ringing on top of it. I haven't really tested it or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your ears. And while I’m doing that, could you tell me if you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I had a bit of a cold last year, but that’s it. Oh, and I’m divorced, if that matters?
DOCTOR: A cold… and your marital status is… noted. Let me just finish this examination. Hmm. Tympanic membranes look normal. No signs of infection. But we’ll need to do a proper hearing test to be certain.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. A hearing test. Is it… painful or anything? I get a bit nervous with things like that.
DOCTOR: No, it's not painful. You’ll just be wearing headphones and listening for beeps. It's a simple procedure. I'll have the audiologist come in and do that now. While you wait, any allergies to medications we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. None that I know of, anyway. I just take the usual stuff when I’m sick, like paracetamol. I’m really hoping this isn’t something serious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: We’ll find out. The audiologist will be with you shortly. Let’s not jump to conclusions. I'll just get this referral sent through. Don't worry too much, these things happen. The audiologist will explain the results and discuss management options. They're much better equipped to deal with this than I am.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted, you know? It's really frustrating. I’ll just… wait here then?
DOCTOR: Yes. Just wait here. The audiologist will call you. Next patient…
PATIENT: Right. Okay. Thanks again.
