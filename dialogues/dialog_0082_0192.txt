DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I’m here for this… exam. Military thing. Gotta get it done. Don’t really see the point, but my wife said I needed to, so here I am. Waste of a good Saturday, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, a military exam. Yes, I understand. It’s good you’re taking care of it. Though I appreciate your time is valuable. We'll get through this as efficiently as we can. Just to clarify, is this for a routine check-up related to continued service, or is there something specific they’ve asked us to look at?
PATIENT: Specific? No. Just… the whole thing. They want to know if I'm… fit enough. I haven’t been in the army or anything. Always been a mechanic, fixing things. Not being fixed. So, I don't know what they need checked, to be honest. Seems silly to ask me. They should just look at my work record. That should tell ya everything. I’m good with machines, always have been. Strong hands, good eyes. That’s what matters.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. Sometimes these exams can feel a bit… broad. It’s true, a strong work history tells a lot. But the exam is just a standard process to ensure everything is functioning as it should. We’ll just run through a few basic checks. It shouldn’t take too long. Let's start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Well… I broke my arm when I was a kid. Fell out of a tree. Nothing serious, they just put it in a cast. And I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone else. Nothing fancy. No hospitals, no big operations. Just… normal stuff. I’ve always been careful, you know? Don't go doing anything stupid. Mostly just work and fixing things. That’s it. I don’t understand why they need to know all this anyway. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: No, it won't take all day, Mr. Hartness, I promise. We're just gathering information. Knowing about past injuries, even something like a broken arm, can be helpful. It gives us a baseline. Okay, good. No major illnesses or surgeries. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family? What about 'em? My wife’s perfectly healthy, thankfully. Always nagging me to eat more vegetables, but otherwise alright. My mother… she had some aches and pains when she got old, but that was a long time ago. And my father… he died when I was young. Heart trouble, I think. Not much else to say about that, really. It was a long time ago. Look, is this family history stuff important? It feels… private. I don’t see what it has to do with me joining… whatever this is.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about privacy, Mr. Hartness. It is personal information. But family history can sometimes reveal predispositions to certain conditions, which might be helpful to know. We're not looking for anything specific, just trying to get a complete picture. Knowing your father had heart trouble is good information to have, thank you. Alright. Let’s talk about you a little more. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. Never had 'em. I eat whatever’s put in front of me, mostly. Unless it's those fancy foreign foods. Can’t stand that stuff. But allergies… no. Nothing. I’ve always been a robust Swede, you know? Tough as nails. Seriously, I don't think I’ve ever even had a rash. My wife tries to get me to use fancy hand creams after working on the engines, says my skin looks dry, but I just ignore her. They make my hands slippery. What, are we checking for rashes now? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, we're not specifically checking for rashes, Mr. Hartness. Just confirming you don't have any known allergies. It’s a standard question. So, no allergies at all. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all that stuff. Let the body heal itself. That’s what I always say. My wife, she takes something for her… blood pressure, I think. All those little pills. But me? Nothing. I might take an aspirin if I have a really bad headache, but that's it. And even then, it's rare. I just power through it. Makes you tougher, you know? This is a waste of time. Are we getting anywhere with this or what? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. That's good. I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. We are getting somewhere, just gathering information. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic visual assessment. It won't take long. Perhaps while I do that, you could tell me a little bit about your typical day?
PATIENT: Fine, get it over with. Heart and lungs… whatever. My heart’s strong, always has been. Works hard all day. Typical day? I wake up, have coffee with my wife, then I go to the shop. Work on engines. Fix things. All day. Customers bring 'em in, I fix 'em, they pay me. Sometimes it’s cars, sometimes it’s boats, sometimes it’s… other things. I eat lunch at the shop, usually a sandwich. Then I work some more. Come home, have dinner with my wife, watch TV, go to bed. Not exactly a thrilling life, but it pays the bills. It’s honest work. What are you listening for? Is my heart too fast? This is all very intrusive, you know.
DOCTOR: No, your heart sounds perfectly normal, Mr. Hartness. A regular rhythm, good rate. Just routine. Lungs sound clear as well. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on that. Your hands are strong, as you said. Some wear and tear, expected with your line of work. Do you experience any pain in your hands or wrists?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. After a long day, they get a little stiff. But it's nothing. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. I’ve got calluses, of course. Comes with the job. Used to get cuts and scrapes all the time, but I'm careful now. Mostly just stiff hands. My wife keeps nagging me to use that cream, says it'll help. But it makes everything slippery, can't grip the wrenches properly. I need to be able to feel what I'm doing, you know? This is all… pointless. I'm a mechanic, not a… a weakling who needs hand cream. Are we done soon? I'm getting a bit restless. And frankly, I’ve got better things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Hartness. We’ll note the stiffness in your hands. It’s good you’re careful with injuries. Alright. Just a few more quick questions. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never touched the stuff. My father smoked, and he died young. Heart trouble, remember? My wife tried to get me to try that… vaping stuff, said it was safer, but I wouldn’t even consider it. Makes you smell awful, and it’s a waste of money. No, absolutely not. Clean living, that’s what I believe in. Well, mostly. I do enjoy a good beer now and then, but that’s about it. What are you getting at? Are you implying something? I’m perfectly healthy for my age, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: No, not implying anything, Mr. Hartness. Just gathering information. So, no smoking or tobacco use. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Like I said, I enjoy a beer now and then. A couple on a Saturday night, maybe. Sometimes one with dinner. But I don’t drink to excess, never have. I’m not a… a lush. Social drinker, that's what I am. My wife and I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. But nothing crazy. It helps me relax after a long day in the shop. It doesn't interfere with my work, I assure you. I'm perfectly capable. What's this all for anyway? Is this going to affect whether I can… do this military thing? This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, moderate alcohol consumption. Thank you. Now, let's talk about your sleeping habits. Do you have any trouble falling asleep or staying asleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Usually, I sleep like a log. After a long day working on engines, I’m out before my head hits the pillow. Sometimes, if I’m worried about something – a particularly difficult repair, or a demanding customer – I might lie awake for a bit. But usually, I sleep just fine. My wife snores a bit, but I’m used to it. It’s just background noise. Nothing to worry about. Honestly, I sleep better than most people I know. What are you trying to find out? Are you going to ask me about my… bathroom habits next? This is ridiculous. I’m a mechanic, not a… a medical specimen.
DOCTOR: No, no bathroom habits, Mr. Hartness. I apologize if I’m asking a lot of questions. It's just part of the exam process. Alright, so generally good sleep. Now, one final question. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in weight? Not really. I’ve always been… solid. I’m a big guy, always have been. I might have put on a few pounds since I got married, my wife’s a good cook. But nothing drastic. My clothes still fit. I’m not… obese, or anything. My wife keeps nagging me to eat more vegetables, says I need to watch my figure, but I ignore her. I need my energy for working on engines. It’s honest work, you know? This is all… pointless. I’m a mechanic, not a… model. Are we done yet? I’ve got things to do. And frankly, I’m starting to get annoyed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Thank you for your patience and honesty. That completes the initial exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief physical assessment, everything appears to be within normal limits. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you could benefit from some weight management, but there are no immediate concerns. I recommend continuing your current lifestyle, but focusing on incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your diet and trying to reduce stress. To be thorough, I'd like to order a basic blood panel and a urine analysis just to get a more complete picture. It’s standard procedure, and it will give us a better baseline. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood panel? Urine analysis? More tests? Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. I’ve already told you everything you need to know. I’m a mechanic, not a… a guinea pig. I don’t like needles, and I certainly don’t want to be giving up samples of… well, you know. I’m perfectly healthy, as I’ve already said. I’m wasting my time here. Are you going to let me do this military thing or not? This is ridiculous. I’m a perfectly capable man. I don’t need more tests. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. This is a waste of a perfectly good Saturday. I want to speak to your supervisor. This is… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration. The blood panel and urine analysis are standard procedures, and they're not meant to imply anything is wrong. It's simply due diligence. However, I respect your wishes. We can proceed without them. Based on the information you’ve provided and the physical assessment, I can clear you for the military exam. However, I strongly recommend you monitor your blood pressure and consider making some lifestyle changes to improve your overall health. I can provide you with some resources on diet and stress management. Are you comfortable with proceeding in this manner?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. I don't want any more tests. I don't want any more lectures about vegetables or stress. Just… sign the papers or whatever you need to do, and let me get on with my life. I've wasted enough time here already. Resources? No, thank you. I know what I'm doing. I'm a mechanic, not an invalid. Just… let me go. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of my time. And I'm going to need a very large beer to recover from this ordeal. So just… get it done. Please. I've got better things to do than sit here listening to lectures about my health. This is… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I understand. I’m completing the clearance forms now. Here you go. Just sign at the bottom. Excellent. I will submit these forms to the appropriate department. You should receive confirmation within a few business days. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Hartness. I wish you all the best. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Even if you just need someone to talk to. Have a good day. And enjoy that beer.
