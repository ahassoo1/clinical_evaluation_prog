DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is my back. It is… painful. I wish to be quick, if that is alright. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Quick” is fine, though a thorough understanding is always best, naturally. Can you tell me a bit more about this back pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It started… three weeks ago, I believe. I was putting up a fence – my work – and I lifted a heavy post. A very heavy one. It felt like something… shifted. Not broken, I don't think broken, but… wrong. It hurts when I bend over. And when I stand for too long. It’s a dull ache, mostly. Though sometimes it is sharp. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Three weeks ago, lifting a heavy post… a shifting sensation. Dull ache, with occasional sharp pains, worsened by bending and prolonged standing. And you're a worker, physically active, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes. Fence erection. It is… hard work. I have been doing it a long time. Before my husband… passed. I need to be able to do it. It is how I earn my living. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: It matters for billing, certainly, and helps me understand your overall health picture. Let's focus on this pain. You mentioned it started after lifting. Is the pain localized to one specific area of your back, or does it radiate anywhere – down your legs, for example?
PATIENT: It is… mostly in my lower back. Right in the middle. Sometimes it goes a little to the left, but not down my legs. No, not down my legs. I can feel it when I try to lift things, even light things. It’s… frustrating. I am not usually one to complain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lower back, central, occasionally to the left, not radiating down the legs. Pain with lifting, even light objects. Frustrating, you say. I understand. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate this pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now… maybe a six? It is not constant, but when I move certain ways, it flares up. It is a six when I think about lifting a post, even a small one. It is lower when I am sitting still. A four, perhaps. Does that make sense? I don't often deal with numbers.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Reihner. A fluctuating pain, six when anticipating lifting, four while seated. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this back pain?
PATIENT: No. No numbness. No tingling. No weakness in my legs. I can walk just fine. I have slept alright, though I do wake up a few times. I am a light sleeper, always have been. I don’t think those things are related, though. Just… old age.
DOCTOR: “Old age,” you say. Well, 42 is hardly old, Ms. Reihner. No numbness, tingling, or weakness – that’s good. Now, regarding your medical history, have you ever had any back problems before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I mean… aches and pains from working, of course. Every worker has those. But never anything like this. Never needed to see a doctor for my back before. My husband… he had problems with his knees. But not me. I try to stay strong.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior back problems, just typical work-related aches. And your husband had knee issues. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. No medications. Just vitamins. A multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, when it is very cold, I take something for my joints. But not regularly. Nothing prescribed.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, just a multivitamin and occasional joint relief. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Not that I know of. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. My mother always said I was a strong child. I think she was right. Can we… get this over with? I do not mean to be rude, Doctor. But I have fences to build.
DOCTOR: No, no rudeness detected, Ms. Reihner. I simply want a complete picture. Alright. No allergies. Now, let’s do a quick physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll be palpating your back, checking your range of motion, and doing a few neurological tests. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… acceptable. As long as it is quick. I can lie down. But please be gentle. It hurts when you push on it.
DOCTOR: Of course. Gentle is precisely what I intend. Lie on your stomach, please. I’ll start by palpating your lower back. Tell me if anything is particularly tender. Okay… a bit of tenderness right here, and here… as expected. Now, I’m going to ask you to gently lift each leg, one at a time, while lying flat. Just tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort with that.
PATIENT: Alright. Lifting my legs… It’s okay… a little uncomfortable… but not bad. This side… hurts a little more. Right here. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. Can I sit up now?
DOCTOR: Alright. More discomfort on the left side during leg lift. Dull ache with that maneuver. Yes, you may sit up slowly. Now, I’m going to ask you to bend forward and touch your toes, if you are able. Just go as far as you comfortably can. Don't force anything, Ms. Reihner. Just let me see your range of motion.
PATIENT: It… hurts. I can’t reach my toes. Not anymore. It’s… stiff. I used to be able to reach my toes. But not now. It feels… tight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited range of motion, difficulty reaching toes, reports tightness. Okay, Ms. Reihner, that’s sufficient for now. Based on your history and the physical examination, it appears you have a muscle strain in your lower back, likely aggravated by the heavy lifting. It doesn’t appear to be anything more serious, such as a disc herniation or nerve compression, but we can’t rule those out completely without further testing if symptoms worsen or don’t improve. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A muscle strain… That is… good, I suppose. But it hurts. What does that mean? What do I do? And how long will it take to heal? I have work to do, Doctor. I need to know. No tests, you say? Is that safe?
DOCTOR: A muscle strain simply means you’ve overstretched or torn the muscles in your lower back. The good news is, most muscle strains heal with conservative treatment – rest, ice, over-the-counter pain relievers, and physical therapy. As for “safe,” without tests, we are relying on your clinical presentation. The absence of neurological symptoms – no numbness, tingling, or weakness – is reassuring. However, if your pain worsens, radiates down your legs, or you develop any new symptoms, we would absolutely consider imaging, such as an X-ray or MRI, to rule out more serious issues. For now, I recommend the following: rest for a few days, avoiding heavy lifting; apply ice to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day; and take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the label. Do you have any allergies to NSAIDs?
PATIENT: No. No allergies to… NSAIDs. I do not think so. I’ve taken ibuprofen before, when my knees hurt. It helped a little. Can I still work? Light work, perhaps? I can’t just… stop. My livelihood depends on it. But I don't want to make it worse. What if it doesn’t heal?
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen is fine. As for work, avoiding heavy lifting is crucial. Light work – tasks that don’t strain your back – is permissible, but listen to your body. If your pain increases, stop immediately. Pushing through it could prolong your recovery. “What if it doesn’t heal?
PATIENT: That is my worry, Doctor. I have to be realistic. I am not… young. It takes me longer to heal. What is the worst-case scenario? I need to know. And what about… physical therapy? What does that involve? Will it hurt? I don’t want to be in even more pain. And how long will this take? A week? A month? I have bills to pay.
DOCTOR: Ms. Reihner, I understand your concerns. It’s prudent to be realistic. The worst-case scenario, though unlikely given your presentation, would be a chronic back condition requiring more intensive treatment, such as injections or even surgery. But, again, that's not what I expect. Physical therapy involves exercises to strengthen your back muscles, improve your flexibility, and teach you proper lifting techniques. It can be uncomfortable initially, but a good therapist will tailor the exercises to your pain level and progress gradually. It shouldn’t be excruciating. As for how long it will take, that varies. Most muscle strains improve within two to six weeks with conservative treatment. We can reassess in a week or two to monitor your progress. If you’re not improving, we can consider further investigation or referral to a specialist. I’m going to prescribe you a course of ibuprofen and write you a referral for physical therapy. I’ll also provide you with a handout outlining proper lifting techniques. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds acceptable. Ibuprofen, physical therapy, and… lifting instructions. A week or two, you say. I will try to follow your instructions. And if it doesn’t get better, I can come back? I suppose that will have to be enough, for now. Thank you, Doctor. I wish you a good day. I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You can come back if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within two weeks. We will reassess at that time. And you as well, Ms. Reihner. Be careful, listen to your body, and remember to prioritize your health. Here is your prescription and the referral for physical therapy. Have a good day. .
