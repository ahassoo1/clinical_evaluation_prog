DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my speech, I think. It’s been a bit off, you see. Not as clear as it usually is, and… honestly, I can’t quite place when it started, exactly. It just feels…slurred, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Slurred speech... alright. And is this a constant thing, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. Some days I don’t even notice it, really. Others… others people have mentioned it. It’s not all the time, that’s for sure. Though, thinking about it… it might be worse when I’m tired, perhaps? I work a lot, you see. Construction… it’s demanding work.
DOCTOR: Construction... yes, physically demanding. And you said others have mentioned it. Can you recall when they first pointed it out, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a tricky one. It wasn’t recently, I don’t think. Maybe… a few months ago? It could have been around the time of my cousin’s wedding, I believe. It was… July, maybe? Everything feels a little blurry when I try to pinpoint dates, truthfully. It wasn’t anything dramatic, just a “Are you alright, you sound a little funny?” type of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the speech, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… Let me see… Not that I’ve actively noticed, no. My balance feels alright, I suppose. I haven't fallen or anything. And I haven’t been having any… headaches or anything like that, either. Just the speech. Though, I do get quite tired, as I said. Is that… a change? I always work hard, but lately it’s been… more draining.
DOCTOR: Fatigue can certainly be a symptom. Let’s do a quick examination, if you don’t mind. I’d like to check your reflexes, coordination, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just standard things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just follow my finger with your eyes, please. And no need to worry, it won’t be long. Follow my finger... just keep your head still. Good... and now look to your left... and to your right. Now, can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm following it. This is fine. There. Is that alright? It feels… normal, to me. I haven't felt any weakness or anything, honestly. It's all a little strange.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes seem normal, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Everything appears to be within normal limits, physically. Now, do you have any allergies that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of, no. I’ve never really had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I eat… well, I eat most things, truthfully. Jamaican food, naturally, but also… everything, really. I haven’t had any trouble with hives or… swelling or anything like that. Not that I remember, anyway. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not on any medication at all. Never have been, truthfully. I try to stay healthy, you see. Just… a lot of hard work and good food. That's it, really. My wife… she makes sure I eat properly. Does that answer your question? I'm a bit forgetful sometimes, so if I'm missing something, please do let me know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Swaby, given your age and the intermittent nature of your symptoms, and the lack of any clear findings on physical exam… it’s difficult to pinpoint the cause. It could be related to stress and fatigue from your work, or… …it could be something neurological. I’m going to order an MRI of your brain, just to rule anything serious out. It’s better to be safe.
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh. That… sounds rather serious, Doctor. Is it something to be worried about? I mean, I just thought it was… tiredness, maybe. I work long hours, you see. Are you saying… it could be something bad? I… I hope it’s not too much trouble. My wife… she'll be worried, naturally.
DOCTOR: It’s important not to jump to conclusions, Ms. Swaby. An MRI is simply a diagnostic tool. It will allow us to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your brain. Most likely, it will be nothing. However, given the speech changes, it’s prudent to investigate further. I'm going to refer you to a neurologist, Dr. Chen, who specializes in these types of issues. He will review the MRI results and advise you on the best course of action. Here's the referral form. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. He’s a very good doctor, you’re in good hands.
PATIENT: Dr. Chen… alright. Thank you, Doctor. It’s… a lot to take in, honestly. I just hope it's nothing serious. I have a lot of work, you see, and my wife… she relies on me. Is there anything… anything I should be aware of before the MRI? And how long will it take to get an appointment with Dr. Chen, approximately? I… I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything.
DOCTOR: The MRI itself is a painless procedure. You’ll lie inside a scanner, and it will take about 30-45 minutes. It's important to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, even some types of clothing. Dr. Chen’s office will give you specific instructions. As for the appointment, it may take a week or two to get in, given his schedule. I’ll have his office expedite it as much as possible, given your concerns. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as you can. And if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe headaches, weakness, difficulty walking – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. No metal, rest, and if anything gets worse, emergency room. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it very much. It’s… a relief to have some direction, even if it is a bit worrying. I'll make sure to contact Dr. Chen’s office as soon as possible. I think… I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Sham. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Swaby. Don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions. I hope everything turns out alright. .
