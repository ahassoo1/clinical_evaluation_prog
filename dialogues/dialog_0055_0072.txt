DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Please, have a seat. I am Dr. EADDY. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. Um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I've been… forgetting things. Not huge things, usually, but enough to worry me. It's been happening for a few months now, I think.
DOCTOR: “A bit embarrassing,” you say. I assure you, Ms. Heidenthal, memory concerns are quite common, and there is no need for embarrassment. “A few months,” you mentioned. Can you elaborate on what kind of things you're forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not like… major life events. More like… where I put my keys, or why I walked into a room. Sometimes I struggle to remember names, even of people I’ve met a few times. And… this is silly, but I had to write down what day it was yesterday. It just… didn’t come to me.
DOCTOR: Keys, reasons for being in a room, names… and the day of the week. I see. And has this been a gradual worsening, or did it seem to come on suddenly?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I think… gradual. It started with just misplacing things more often, and then it kind of… added on from there. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started getting noticeable, but definitely not overnight. It feels like it's been slowly getting a little worse each month, maybe?
DOCTOR: “Slowly getting worse each month,” you say. Alright. And is this memory difficulty impacting your daily life in any significant way?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s… frustrating. I work as a dentist, and I need to remember details about my patients, treatment plans… things like that. I haven’t messed anything up yet, but I’m definitely having to double-check my notes more than I used to. And I'm worried it will affect my work. It's also just… annoying, you know? Forgetting simple things. It makes me feel… less like myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Heidenthal. It is perfectly reasonable to be worried when your cognitive function begins to affect your professional and personal life. Let’s move on to a more detailed history. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these memory issues?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Not really, I don’t think. I haven’t been feeling more confused or anything. No changes in my vision, no headaches… I sleep okay, I guess. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I just figured that was from working long hours. Oh! And sometimes I feel a little… clumsy, like I almost trip over things, but that doesn't happen often. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: “A little clumsy” is noted. While not necessarily indicative of a specific issue, it's good to have a complete picture. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that’s it. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothing like that. I'm generally pretty healthy, to be honest. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can, but it’s hard with my schedule. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Maybe once or twice a month. That's it, really. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: No, that is helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about family history. Are there any instances of memory loss or neurological conditions – such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease – in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… she got very confused towards the end of her life. I don't know exactly what was wrong with her, but my mother always said it was “something with her brain.” She died a long time ago, so we didn’t really have a proper diagnosis. My father’s side of the family, I don’t know much about. He wasn’t very close to them.
DOCTOR: “Something with her brain,” you say. That is… relevant. While not a definitive indicator, it's important to consider. Now, to complete the picture, could you briefly describe your typical social lifestyle?
PATIENT: Um… okay. I live alone. I work a lot, as I mentioned. I see my colleagues sometimes, for lunch or after work. I don’t have a huge social circle, to be honest. I used to have more friends, but people move away, life gets in the way… I try to stay in touch with my mother, we talk on the phone a few times a week. I enjoy reading and going for walks when I have the time. It's not very exciting, I guess. I don't really go out much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. That provides a good overview. Now, I’d like to perform a brief neurological examination to assess your cognitive function further. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on, if that's possible. I'm a little nervous, but… let's do it.
DOCTOR: Very good. It’s a simple assessment, nothing to be concerned about. I’m going to ask you a few questions and have you perform a few simple tasks. Please, follow my instructions to the best of your ability. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh… um… today is… August 2nd. 2025. Is that right? I think it's 2025. I had to think about that one for a second.
DOCTOR: That is correct, August 2nd, 2025. Now, can you tell me where we are today?
PATIENT: We're... in your office. At the doctor's office. I think it's a clinic, in the city? It's very nice, actually. Clean.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Please try to remember them, as I will ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I want you to count backwards from 100 by sevens. Please begin when you are ready.
PATIENT: Um… okay. 100… 93… 86… 79… 72… 65… 58… 51… 44… 37… 30… 23… 16… 9… 2… Uh… I’m losing track.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Heidenthal. No need to strain yourself. Now, can you tell me what year the United States declared its independence?
PATIENT: Oh… gosh. That’s… a tough one. Was it… 1776? I think it was 1776. I remember learning it in school, but it’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: That is correct. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Now, I will ask you to draw a clock face, showing all twelve numbers, and set the time to ten minutes after eleven. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. A clock face, with all the numbers, and the time at eleven ten.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. That is all I need for the initial assessment. Now, let's discuss what we've found. Your responses on the cognitive assessment were slightly below average for your age, particularly with the serial seven calculations and the clock drawing. The diminished reflexes are also something to note. However, it’s important to remember that this is just one snapshot in time. Based on these preliminary findings, I suspect a degree of mild cognitive impairment. However, it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions. We need to conduct further testing to rule out other potential causes. I would like to order a comprehensive blood panel, including a thyroid function test and vitamin B12 levels. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to assess for any structural abnormalities. What are your thoughts on proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Oh… wow. Mild cognitive impairment… That sounds… scary. An MRI? That sounds… serious. But… I guess if we need to find out what's going on, we should do whatever it takes. Yes, I want to know what's happening. I'm a little worried about the tests, but… yes, let's do them. I just want to figure out what's going on with my memory, and hopefully, it's nothing too serious. What’s involved with the blood panel and the MRI? Will they be painful?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Heidenthal. It is perfectly natural to feel worried when faced with these possibilities. Let me assure you, the blood panel is a relatively simple procedure. We will just need a small sample of blood from your arm. There will be a brief pinch, but it is generally not painful. As for the MRI, it is a non-invasive imaging technique. You will lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it will take images of your brain. It can be a little noisy, and you will need to remain very still for about 30-45 minutes. You will be given earplugs to help with the noise, and we will provide you with clear instructions beforehand. There is no radiation involved, and it is generally well-tolerated. Once we have the results of these tests, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. It is important to remember that mild cognitive impairment does not necessarily mean that you will develop dementia. There are many possible causes, and some are treatable. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and staying mentally active. Do you have any immediate questions or concerns before we proceed with ordering the tests?
PATIENT: No, that makes sense. I think I understand. No radiation is good. And you said it doesn't automatically mean dementia. That's… reassuring. I guess I'm mostly worried about what the results will be, and what happens if it is something serious. But you're right, we need to find out first. Okay, let's do the tests. Can you give me the paperwork, or whatever I need to schedule them? And… how long does it usually take to get the results back?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Heidenthal. Here is the lab requisition form for the blood panel, and this document contains information about the MRI facility and instructions for scheduling your appointment. The MRI center will likely contact you to arrange a convenient time. As for the results, the blood panel typically takes 2-3 business days to come back. The MRI results may take a little longer, around 5-7 business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. Once I have both sets of results, I will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as confusion, difficulty speaking, or changes in your vision, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions about the forms or the process?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I'm still a little worried, but I feel better knowing we're taking steps to figure things out. I'll schedule the tests as soon as I can. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime, besides what you mentioned? Anything to help my memory, or anything to avoid?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Heidenthal. While we await the results, maintaining a consistent routine can be beneficial. Try to stick to a regular sleep schedule, eat a balanced diet, and engage in activities that challenge your mind, such as reading, puzzles, or learning a new skill. Social interaction is also important, so make an effort to stay connected with friends and family. In terms of what to avoid, excessive alcohol consumption and smoking can negatively impact cognitive function. Also, try to manage stress levels, as chronic stress can exacerbate memory problems. Finally, be mindful of any medications you are taking, as some can have cognitive side effects. If you notice any changes in your memory or cognitive function after starting a new medication, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. It's important to remember that these are just general recommendations, and we will tailor a specific plan to your needs once we have the results of the tests. In the meantime, don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor EADDY. You've really put my mind at ease. I'll get those tests scheduled right away. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment once the results are available. You have a good day as well, and please take care.
