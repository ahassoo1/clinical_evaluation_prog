DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, it’s about some… paperwork. My grandson, he’s trying to get his wife settled here, you see. She’s from… well, not from around here. And they need to show proof of certain… shots, I believe. For the visa. I’m a bit lost on what exactly is required, to be honest. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Paperwork. Right. People and their paperwork. Honestly, it’s often more trouble than actual medicine these days. So, you need me to verify vaccination records for your grandson’s wife?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that's right. I'm afraid I'm not very good with these things. He asked me to come since… well, since I’m the only one who can handle the driving and such. And I figured a doctor’s note would carry some weight. She has some records, but I don’t know what they need to be exactly, or if they’re even the right ones. It’s for… immigration, is that right? The forms mentioned that.
DOCTOR: Immigration paperwork. Of course. Well, it’s not my usual practice to sort through visa requirements, but… alright. Let’s start with what records do you have?
PATIENT: Here they are, Doctor. Mostly papers from… a clinic over in Guatemala, I think. Her name is Elena Ramirez, by the way. She speaks some English, but not much. They have dates and… some stamps. I just don’t know what it all means. I hope this is enough. I brought everything her husband said was important.
DOCTOR: Right. Elena Ramirez. Spanish… lovely. I’ll need a translator if I’m to be sure of anything here. Do you have any idea what vaccinations these claim to be?
PATIENT: Honestly, no, ma'am. Her husband said something about… measles, and maybe tetanus? He wasn’t very clear. He just told me to bring everything to a doctor, and you were recommended. I apologize for the trouble. I don't want to waste your time. It's just… he's very anxious to get her settled, and I want to help where I can. It’s a long story, about how they met… but it doesn’t matter, really.
DOCTOR: Look, I’m a family physician, not a document verification service. These records are… inadequate. I can’t simply guess what vaccinations she’s had. It's irresponsible. What I can do is recommend she get a full panel of titers done to determine her immunity levels. That’s the only way to be certain. It’ll involve some blood work, naturally. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Titers? Blood work? Oh dear. I… I don't know, Doctor. That sounds… expensive. And complicated. Her husband, he’s a carpenter. They don’t have much money saved. Would that show… everything? Like, would that satisfy the immigration people? I just don’t want to get their hopes up if it’s not going to work. Is there… no other way? I’m so sorry to ask so many questions. I just… I’m a bit lost, you see.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Skarbek, I understand you're worried about costs. But I’m not going to sign off on something without proper documentation. It’s a liability for me, and it won't help your grandson's wife if the paperwork is rejected. Titers are the proper way to determine immunity. Anything else would be speculation. I can write a referral to a lab that offers a sliding scale based on income. It won’t be free, but it might be more manageable. Do you want the referral, or not?
PATIENT: A sliding scale… yes, that would be… helpful. Very helpful. If you think that’s the best way, then yes, please. A referral would be wonderful. I just… I didn't realize it would be so difficult. I suppose I should have asked more questions beforehand. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind to try and help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here you go. This lab, they'll be able to explain the costs and the process. Tell them I sent you, and they’ll know what to do. They'll draw the blood and send the results back to me, and then we can discuss what, if any, vaccinations she needs. Now, while we’re waiting for those results, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I don't think so. Just… this is enough for now. Thank you again for your patience. And for the referral. I really appreciate it. I should probably let you get back to your other patients. I hope I haven’t taken up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, then. You’re welcome. Just make sure they send the results to my office promptly. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions… though I can’t promise I’ll have all the answers regarding immigration paperwork. Have a good day, Mr. Skarbek.
PATIENT: .
