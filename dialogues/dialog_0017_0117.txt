DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I am Dr. Blim. So, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, it’s this cough. Been coughin’ up… stuff. Red stuff. Not good. I smoke, you see. Been a long time, though. Not as much as before. I just want to get this over with, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: A cough, you say. And…red sputum. Yes, well, smoking is rarely alright, Mr. Reyno. Thirty years experience tells me that. “Not as much as before” is hardly a medical assessment. Now, let’s be precise. How long have you had this cough, and how frequently are you coughing up this…red material?
PATIENT: Thirty years… feels like longer, to be honest. The cough... a few weeks, maybe? Hard to say. And the red… not every time. Just sometimes. When I really cough hard. It scares me, that’s what it does. I don’t… I don't know how often exactly. A few times a week, maybe? I really can't remember. Things aren't so clear these days.
DOCTOR: "Not so clear these days," indeed. Right. A few weeks, intermittent red sputum… That’s… unhelpful. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get tired easy, I guess. Always have, but maybe more so lately. And… my chest feels kinda tight sometimes. Like somethin’ heavy’s sittin’ on it. No fever, I don’t think. Or… maybe a little? Hard to tell. I don't really check. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Everything is "important," Mr. Reyno. Fatigue and chest tightness… Yes, those are relevant. Is the chest tightness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I cough. And when I’m… tryin’ to do things. Like, walkin’ up a hill. Or carryin’ somethin’ heavy. It doesn’t bother me all the time. I just… slow down. Figure it’s just gettin’ old. Is that bad? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: “Just getting old” is a diagnosis many patients seem fond of, Mr. Reyno. However, it rarely explains physiological changes. And yes, it can be serious. Alright. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that you mention it… my belt has been a little looser. Not a lot. But… yeah. I haven’t really been eatin’ much, either. Not hungry, I guess. Everything just tastes… off. I don’t know if that’s connected. Everything’s connected these days. Makes my head spin.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno, I need to listen to your lungs more closely, then I’ll check your blood pressure and oxygen levels. Please take a deep breath in and out… and again. Decreased breath sounds bilaterally, with coarse crackles in the lower lobes… Not ideal. Now, let's move on to blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Deep breath… like this? . Blood pressure… fine by me. Whatever you need. Just… hurry, if you don’t mind. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated – 148 over 92. And your oxygen saturation is 91%. Below optimal, frankly. Now, I'm going to need you to describe your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. Years ago… when I was a kid, I had the measles, real bad. Spent a week in the hospital then. And… I broke my arm once, fallin’ off a horse. That's about it, I think. No other serious stuff. Nothin’ that I remember. Does that count? I don’t see much of a doctor. Never have.
DOCTOR: Measles as a child, broken arm… satisfactory, though hardly comprehensive. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Never had any surgeries. No. Just… the arm, in a cast. They didn't cut me open or anything. Just wrapped it up tight. That's all. I don't like doctors, never have. Too much pokin' and proddin'.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mom passed a long time ago. Cancer. My dad… I haven’t seen him in years. He moved away. Had some trouble, I think. No brothers or sisters. Just me. Not much of a family, really. Why do you need to know all this? Is somethin’ bad wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, a thorough medical history is essential for proper diagnosis and treatment. Your mother’s cancer is relevant. What kind of cancer did she have, if you recall?
PATIENT: Uh… lung cancer, I think. Yeah, that’s it. Lung cancer. She smoked, too. Always did. Bad habit. She coughed a lot at the end. Just like me… Is that… is that why you’re askin’ all these questions? Because of the cough?
DOCTOR: Your family history, combined with your smoking history, symptoms, and examination findings… are concerning. Now, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Nothing. I don't like pills. Never have. Just… aspirin, sometimes, for a headache. But not often. I try to avoid the doctor and all that stuff. Makes me feel worse, usually. Is it bad? You think it's really bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, I am not going to downplay this. Your symptoms, history, and examination suggest the strong possibility of a serious respiratory condition. We need to order a chest X-ray immediately. And I would also like to order a complete blood count and a sputum culture. I'm writing up the orders now. And frankly, I would strongly recommend a referral to a pulmonologist.
PATIENT: X-ray… sputum… pulmono… what was that last one? Look, doc, is it cancer? Is that what you're gonna tell me? Because if it is, I don't… I don't know what I'm gonna do. Just tell me straight. No need for all the tests if that's what it is. It runs in the family… I knew it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without the results of the necessary investigations. To suggest a diagnosis without proper workup would be irresponsible and unethical. However, given your history, a malignancy is a possibility. That is why these tests are crucial. I will order the X-ray and blood work immediately. As for the pulmonologist, he is a specialist who can further evaluate your condition and determine the best course of action. Now, do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… not that I know of. I told you, I don’t take any medication. Never have. Maybe… I got a rash once, when I was a kid, from poison ivy. But that’s not a… a medicine allergy. Is there anything else I should tell you? This is all… a lot. I just want to go home. It feels like… a bad dream.
DOCTOR: Very well. No known medication allergies. I will have the radiology department contact you to schedule the X-ray. The lab will draw blood before you leave today. I will review the results as soon as they become available. And I strongly urge you to schedule an appointment with a pulmonologist. Here is a referral form, and a list of specialists in the area. I will also have my nurse provide you with detailed discharge instructions. Now, do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Questions… uh… no, I guess not. Not right now. I’m… kinda numb. Just tell me… how long will the tests take? And… will I feel sick? Is it gonna hurt? I really don’t do well with… with pain. I just want this to be over with.
DOCTOR: The X-ray will take approximately ten to fifteen minutes. The blood draw will be quick – a brief pinch, nothing more. As for discomfort, you may experience slight fatigue after the blood draw. And frankly, Mr. Reyno, worrying about a slight pinch is hardly the priority at this moment. We need to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. The nurse will escort you to the lab. If you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – severe chest pain, difficulty breathing – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I understand. Emergency room… right. Thank you, doc. I… I guess I’ll go now. I just… hope it’s not bad. .
DOCTOR: Very well. .
