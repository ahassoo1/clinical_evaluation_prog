DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Weichers. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Well... I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me a little, so I thought I should come get it checked. It is not a lot, but... enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Weichers. I understand. Coughing up blood – even a small amount – is definitely something we need to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um... it started maybe three days ago? It wasn’t with every cough, just sometimes. And it’s… bright red. Not dark, like old blood. It happens more when I first wake up, I think. I have been trying to remember if anything made it worse, but… I don't really know. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Bright red blood is certainly notable, and the fact that it’s more prominent in the mornings gives us a clue. Three days ago is recent, so that's good you came in promptly. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… a dry cough, mostly. Not much phlegm. When there is phlegm, it is clear. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. More… tickly? Especially in my chest. It wakes me up sometimes, like I said, because I have to cough. And then… sometimes the blood comes with it. Is it bad that I don’t know how much blood? It is not a lot, I promise. Just… enough to see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough with clear phlegm, and the blood is only sometimes present. The tickling sensation in your chest is also useful information. It’s alright that you don’t have an exact measurement; any visible blood warrants investigation. Let’s move on to some other questions, if that's okay. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. No fever, no. I have not felt warm or anything. And no chills, either. Night sweats… hmm. I do sleep with a blanket, because it gets a little cool at night, but I don't think I sweat more than usual. I wake up sometimes a little damp, but I always do. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And no, just wanting to rule out the excessive sweating. So, no recent weight loss, shortness of breath, or chest pain with breathing?
PATIENT: No weight loss. I… I have not been weighing myself, but my clothes still fit. No shortness of breath, either. I walk every morning, and I haven’t had trouble. And no, no chest pain. It doesn’t hurt to breathe, just… the tickle. Sometimes it feels tight, but not painful. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Weichers, thank you for clarifying. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like asthma, COPD, or any heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I… I was very healthy, until my husband passed away. It has been about two years now. He had some heart trouble, but I did not. I do take medicine for my blood pressure, but that is all. The doctor said it went up after… after he passed. Other than that, I have not been sick much. Just the usual colds, I think.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been very difficult. And thank you for letting me know about your blood pressure medication. Do you know the name and dosage of that medication?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. It is… Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. Every morning. I have been taking it for about a year and a half now. The doctor checked it last time, and said it was good. Is that important? Could that be causing the blood?
DOCTOR: That is important, thank you. Lisinopril can, rarely, cause a cough as a side effect, but it usually isn't associated with blood. Still, it’s good to be aware of. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband… he was allergic to shellfish, but I am not. I haven’t had any trouble with medicine either. I did have a shot for the flu last year, and I was fine. I don’t think I have any allergies. Really. I’m very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good. And have you had any previous surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu shot?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And nothing else. I had all my babies, of course, but that was… a long time ago. Otherwise, I have been very healthy. I really have. I… I don’t want to worry you, Doctor. I just wanted to get it checked. It scared me, but maybe it is nothing?
DOCTOR: You're not worrying me at all, Ms. Weichers, and I appreciate you sharing all of this information. It's good you came in to get it checked, and we'll work through this. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband smoked for a little while when he was younger, but I never have. And I don’t drink very much. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, if I’m feeling like it. I try to eat healthy, and I walk every morning, like I said. I don’t go to bars or anything like that. Mostly, I just stay home and read.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, just to finish up the history portion, do you have any family history of lung problems, tuberculosis, or bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had… she had a bad cough when she was old. The doctor said it was just from smoking, though. She smoked her whole life. And my father… he had high blood pressure, like me. I don’t think anyone else had lung problems. Or… bleeding problems. My grandfather died of a heart attack, I think. But no lung trouble. I don’t really know much about my family history, to be honest. My mother didn’t talk about it much. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That’s alright. It’s not bad at all; it's common for family history to be incomplete. Okay, Ms. Weichers, thank you for answering all of those questions. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's okay. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I am ready. I just want to know what is going on, so I can stop worrying. Thank you for taking the time. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but that’s not unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Take some nice, deep breaths for me… in and out. Okay. Breathing sounds are a little diminished on the left side, but I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Your heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. Now, open your mouth for me… ah. Your throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. No swollen lymph nodes. Now, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a sputum sample to help determine the cause of the bleeding. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. An X-ray and a… a sputum sample. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Will the X-ray tell us what is wrong? And… how do I do the sputum sample? I am not sure I understand.
DOCTOR: The X-ray will give us a good look at your lungs to rule out any obvious problems like pneumonia, tumors, or other structural abnormalities. It won’t tell us everything, but it’s a good starting point. As for the sputum sample, it’s a way to collect a sample of the mucus from your lungs. The lab can test it for infection, blood, and abnormal cells. The nurse will give you a sterile container and instructions, but basically, you'll need to cough deeply into the container to bring up a sample of your mucus. It's best to do it first thing in the morning, before you eat or drink anything. Do you have any concerns about collecting the sample?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. An X-ray and a… mucus sample. First thing in the morning. I think I can do that. I am a little worried about coughing it up, though. What if I can’t? I don’t cough up much normally. Will that be a problem? And… will the X-ray hurt? I am a little claustrophobic, I think. I don’t like small spaces.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable concern, Ms. Weichers. Many people have trouble bringing up a good sputum sample. If you can’t get enough on the first try, we can use a saline nebulizer – it helps loosen the mucus in your lungs to make it easier to cough up. The nurse can assist you with that. And the X-ray doesn't hurt at all. You'll stand or sit in front of a machine, and a brief burst of radiation will create an image of your lungs. It’s very quick, and you won’t feel anything. As for the claustrophobia, we can absolutely accommodate that. The technician can position you in a more open position, and you can close your eyes during the procedure. We can even take breaks if you need them. We want to make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. Does that help alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help a lot, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it all so clearly. The nebulizer and the open position… that makes me feel much better. I think I can manage it. If I get anxious, I will just close my eyes. And the nurse will help me with the sample. So… what happens after the X-ray and the sample? Will I know right away what is wrong? And… is it something serious? I am trying not to worry, but it is hard.
DOCTOR: I understand it's hard not to worry, Ms. Weichers. Once the X-ray is taken, the radiologist will review the images and send me a report, usually within 24-48 hours. The lab results from the sputum sample will take a little longer, usually 2-3 days. I will call you as soon as I have the results and discuss them with you in detail. It’s too early to say definitively whether it’s something serious, as we haven’t had the results yet. Coughing up blood can be caused by a variety of things, from a minor infection to something more significant. We need to rule out the more serious possibilities first. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. And if you cough up a significant amount of blood, more than a few teaspoons, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. 24-48 hours for the X-ray, and a few days for the sample. I will watch for new symptoms, and go to the emergency room if I cough up a lot of blood. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for making me feel less anxious. I will wait for your call. Is there anything else I should do or know before I leave?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I’m glad I could help ease your anxiety. For now, just try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid smoking or exposure to irritants, and take it easy. The nurse will give you written instructions regarding the sputum sample and the follow-up appointment. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You have answered everything so well. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I will wait for your call. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. It was a pleasure meeting you. You have a good day as well, and please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
