DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh... well, my chest hurts. Not all the time, but... it hurts. Like, in my breast. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not sure why.
DOCTOR: I see. Chest pain can be concerning, so it’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “a little while,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe two, three weeks? Something like that. It comes and goes. Some days I don't feel it at all. Other days... it's just kinda achey, you know? Not sharp, not too bad. Just… there. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. An achey discomfort that comes and goes. And you said it's in your breast – is it in one breast specifically, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, I think. Yeah, definitely the left one. Sometimes it feels like it's kinda in my armpit too, but mostly the breast. It doesn’t feel like a lump or anything, if that matters. Just...sore.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. No noticeable lump, just soreness in the left breast and sometimes extending into the armpit. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse – any particular activities, or times of day?
PATIENT: Not really, no. It doesn't seem to be worse when I’m working… I do roofing, so it’s pretty physical work, but it doesn’t get worse during work. And not after either. I guess...maybe sometimes when I lay down? Not always, though. It’s kinda random. Sorry, I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing just fine, Mr. Bulaong. It’s often difficult to describe these things. So, it’s an achey discomfort in your left breast and armpit, sometimes worse when lying down, but not consistently, and it doesn't seem related to your physically demanding work. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the chest pain – things like a cough, fever, weight loss, or any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No cough, no fever, I haven't lost any weight. My skin feels normal, I think. Everything else is… okay. Just this breast thing. And I’m a little worried, to be honest. I don't know anyone who... well, you know. A man having breast pain. It feels weird.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Bulaong. It is unusual for men to experience breast pain, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be worried. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Just to get a clearer picture, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Uh... not really. Nothing major. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that's it. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I’m usually pretty healthy. My wife keeps telling me I work too much, though! She says I need to slow down.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No significant medical history. And no surgeries, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Just the broken arm when I was little, and they just put a cast on it. Nothing else. I'm not a fan of doctors or hospitals, if that makes sense. That’s why I waited a bit to come in.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Many people feel that way. Okay, and what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... family? My parents are both… gone now. And I don't have any brothers or sisters. My wife's family is healthy, as far as I know. No one ever talked about… breast problems, or anything like that. She has some cousins, but I don't see them much.
DOCTOR: I see. No family history of breast issues that you’re aware of. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife gives me stuff for colds sometimes, and I haven't ever had a reaction. I don’t take anything regularly, except… sometimes ibuprofen if my back hurts from work. That's it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies and ibuprofen as needed for back pain. Thank you for that information, Mr. Bulaong. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you don’t mind. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll examine your chest and lymph nodes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just... try to be quick, okay? I got a job to get back to. But I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bulaong. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay. I’m listening to your heart and lungs now – everything sounds clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel around your chest and armpit. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. I do feel a slight tenderness in the area just below your nipple on your left breast, and a few small, but not significantly enlarged, lymph nodes in your left armpit. There's no palpable mass that I can identify at this time. Your skin looks normal as well. No redness or visible changes.
PATIENT: Okay. That doesn't sound too bad, does it? The tenderness… yeah, that’s where it hurts. It’s good you didn’t find anything hard. I was worried about that. What does that mean though? Is it… serious? Should I be worried? I gotta get back to work, you know. I got a roof to finish.
DOCTOR: It’s good that there’s no palpable mass, you’re right. The tenderness and slightly enlarged lymph nodes could be due to a few different things. It could be a benign muscle strain, inflammation of the cartilage in the chest wall, or even something called gynecomastia, which is enlargement of breast tissue in men – it’s not always serious and can be caused by hormonal changes. However, to be thorough, and to rule out anything more concerning, I'd like to order a few tests. Specifically, I’d like to do a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a mammogram to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A mammogram? For me? I thought those were for women… Look, Doctor, I really gotta get back to work. Is a mammogram really necessary? I don't want to spend a whole lot of money on tests if it’s just… a muscle thing. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe just some ibuprofen and see if it gets better? I really don’t like hospitals or tests. My wife is gonna be mad if I spend a lot of money on this. And the roof… it won't finish itself.
DOCTOR: You’re right to question that, Mr. Bulaong. Mammograms are primarily used for women, but they can sometimes be helpful in men to investigate breast pain, even though it's less common. I understand your concern about cost and spending time on tests, and I want to be mindful of that. Given your reluctance and the fact that you haven’t had any other concerning symptoms, we could try a course of ibuprofen and monitor it for a couple of weeks. However, I want to be completely upfront with you. Because of the slight tenderness and enlarged lymph nodes, there is a small possibility that something more serious could be going on. To be absolutely safe, I strongly recommend the mammogram. It’s the best way to get a definitive answer and put your mind at ease. It’s a relatively quick procedure, and we can discuss financial assistance options if cost is a significant concern. If it comes back clear, then we can attribute it to a muscle issue, and you can get back to work with peace of mind. I would also like to refer you to a general surgeon for a consultation, just in case the mammogram does reveal something that needs further investigation. Would you be open to those options?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. You make a good point. I don’t want anything serious. And my wife will kill me if I ignore something. She’s always saying I need to take care of myself. A mammogram… and a surgeon? That sounds… scary. But I guess if it’ll make sure everything is okay, I should do it. Financial assistance… yeah, that would be good. I don’t have a lot of extra money. So, mammogram and surgeon. Is there anything else? How long will it take to get the mammogram scheduled? And what about the surgeon… when would I see them? I really need to get back to work soon, you know. I have deadlines.
DOCTOR: That’s a very responsible decision, Mr. Bulaong. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to make the process as smooth and efficient as possible. We can schedule the mammogram for tomorrow morning at the imaging center across the street – it should take about 30-45 minutes. They’ll likely contact you to discuss insurance and any potential costs. We can also explore options for financial assistance if needed, and I’ll have my office staff help you with that. Regarding the surgeon, I'm referring you to Dr. Ramirez – he’s an excellent surgeon with a lot of experience. His office will contact you within the next few business days to schedule an appointment. It may take a week or two to get in, but we can advocate for an earlier appointment if needed. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a stronger anti-inflammatory medication than ibuprofen, just to help manage your pain while you wait for the tests and appointments. I’ll also give you a referral slip for the surgeon and information about the imaging center. I want to reiterate that this is a precautionary measure. The vast majority of breast pain in men is not serious. But it's important to rule out anything more concerning, and I want you to have peace of mind. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Prescription, mammogram tomorrow, and see a surgeon in a week or two. Financial assistance… okay. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I still don’t like it, but I’m glad I came in. I guess I should go… my wife is expecting me. And that roof isn’t gonna finish itself. Thank you, Doctor Abady. I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bulaong. I'm glad I could help, and I understand your reluctance. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns at any point. We’ll follow up with you after the mammogram results are available. Get back to work safely and take care of yourself. And give my best to your wife. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day. .
