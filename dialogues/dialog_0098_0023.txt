DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… my chest… it hurts a little. Not all the time, but sometimes. It's… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Hurts a little” is a good starting point. Can you tell me more about that pain?
PATIENT: It’s… like a ache, you know? Not sharp. More like… when you use your muscles too much. It’s mostly on this side. I do a lot of climbing on roofs for work, so maybe that? I don’t know. It just started a few weeks ago.
DOCTOR: A few weeks ago… and it’s related to the climbing, you think?
PATIENT: Maybe. It feels worse after a long day on the roof. But sometimes it hurts even when I’m just… sitting. Not a lot but… enough to notice. My wife, she said I should come see someone. She gets worried.
DOCTOR: That’s good of her to encourage you to come in. It's always best to get these things checked out. So, it’s an ache, mostly on the left side, sometimes after work, but occasionally even when resting. Has anything specific made it worse, like a particular movement or time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't think so. It doesn’t feel worse with any movement. Maybe… when it’s hot? But it's been hot every day, so I don’t really know. I'm not sure. I don’t think I’ve noticed anything special. It's just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Like… what do you mean? Anything else? No fever, no cough. No lumps or anything. Just the ache. My wife said she didn’t notice anything different either. She checks things like that sometimes. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: No, no, it's good you're able to tell me everything. Just trying to get a complete picture. Let's go through a few things systematically. Have you had any shortness of breath, nausea, or dizziness along with this pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. No dizziness either. I get a little… tired after work, but that’s normal. Nausea… no. I haven’t thrown up or anything. Just the ache. It's… weird. I don't feel sick sick, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past… medical history? Uh… not much. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. Maybe ten years ago for a check-up. Nothing serious. No big problems. Just… normal stuff. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed. My wife says I need to be better about checking things.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had one. I'm pretty careful on the roof, you know? Don't want to end up needing one. My wife would be very mad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Uh… my mom is still alive, she's okay. She has a little trouble with her knees, but nothing major. My dad… he passed away a few years ago. He had… heart problems, I think. But that was a long time ago. He didn't really take care of himself.
DOCTOR: Heart problems… okay. And do you know what kind of heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. My wife mostly dealt with that when he was sick. I was working a lot. She said something about… a weak heart, maybe? And… high blood pressure? I don't know. She said it was complicated. I'm not good with medical stuff. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. It's good you told me what you do remember. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched it. I drink sometimes… a beer with dinner, maybe on the weekend. Not a lot. And no drugs. I work hard, I don’t need any of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Just asking. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… sometimes, my wife gives me something for my back when it hurts from climbing. But it’s just… like a rub-on stuff. Not pills. She gets it at the store. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is good to know everything, thank you. Alright, Mr. Bulaong, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your chest for any tenderness. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Sure. Whatever you need to do. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back on the exam table. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now I'm going to gently feel around your chest to check for any tenderness. Tell me if anything feels particularly sore. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No… not really. It's… hard to say. It's just… a dull ache, like I said. It’s… a little sore here. But it’s not sharp. It’s… hard to explain. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. It's helpful to know exactly where you're feeling the discomfort. It doesn't feel like there's any swelling or masses. I'd also like to check your blood pressure and pulse, if that's alright. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90, and your pulse is 78 and regular.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad? My wife always tells me I worry too much. Is it… because of the climbing? Or… something else?
DOCTOR: It's slightly elevated, yes, but not drastically so. It can fluctuate depending on various factors, like stress or activity. We'll need to monitor it. Given your family history of heart problems and your father's blood pressure, it's something we should pay attention to. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. This will help us check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and rule out any inflammation. Also, I recommend getting an EKG done. That will check the electrical activity of your heart and ensure everything is functioning normally. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… a what? EKG? Is it… serious? My wife said something about heart tests before, but I didn’t want to worry her. Are you saying something is wrong?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Bulaong. It’s good you're asking questions. An EKG – that stands for electrocardiogram – is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't involve any needles or anything invasive. It helps us see if there are any irregularities. The blood tests will give us a broader picture of your overall health. We’re not necessarily saying something is wrong. However, given your family history and the elevated blood pressure, these tests are a precaution. They will help us rule out any potential problems and give us a better understanding of what’s causing your chest discomfort. It's better to be safe and get it checked out. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… a precaution. That’s… good, right? So, blood tests and the… EKG thing. Where do I go for those? And… how long will it take? My wife, she’s working… I don’t want to worry her.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. I'm going to give you a requisition form for the blood tests and a referral to the lab down the street, at 123 Main Street. They're open until 5 PM today. The EKG can be done at the cardiology clinic across the street. Here's the referral. They’ll schedule you for an appointment. The blood tests should only take about 15-20 minutes, and the EKG will likely take around 30 minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and create a plan to address your concerns. I'll have the nurse call you in a few days to schedule a follow-up appointment. To be on the safe side, I’m also going to give you a prescription for a low-dose aspirin to start taking daily. It can help prevent blood clots and reduce your risk of heart problems. However, please read the instructions carefully and let me know if you have any allergies or other medical conditions. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Aspirin… daily? I don’t like taking pills. And what if something is wrong? My wife… she’s going to be so worried. Is it… serious? Like, will I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bulaong. It’s natural to feel anxious when you’re facing uncertainty. The aspirin is a preventative measure, a low dose that can offer some protection. We’re not saying there’s necessarily a problem, but it’s a good precaution to take. Regarding surgery, it’s far too early to talk about that. We haven't even received the test results yet. We need to gather more information before we can make any conclusions. It’s important to remember that we’re taking these steps to rule things out, not to confirm a diagnosis. The vast majority of people with chest discomfort don’t require surgery. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a plan that’s right for you. Let’s focus on getting the tests done first, and then we can discuss the results and what they mean. If the tests reveal any concerns, we’ll refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. But let’s not jump to conclusions until we have more information. In the meantime, if you experience any severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting, please go to the emergency room immediately. But for now, let’s focus on getting these tests done and taking things one step at a time. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. Emergency room… I'll remember that. So, blood tests and EKG. And the aspirin. Can… can my wife come with me for the tests? I think I’ll need her.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bulaong. Having your wife with you is a great idea. Support from loved ones is always helpful. She's welcome to come with you to both the blood tests and the EKG. Here's a list of instructions for both tests, and a number for the lab if you have any questions. I’ll also have the nurse send a copy of these instructions to your wife’s email, if you provide it. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… you’ve been very helpful. I was really scared. I hope… I hope everything is okay. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I understand your fear, and I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Remember, we’re taking these steps to get a clear picture of what’s going on, and we’ll work together to create a plan that’s right for you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns after the tests. And remember, if you experience any severe symptoms, go to the emergency room immediately. I wish you and your wife all the best. Take care, Mr. Bulaong.
