DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's... it's been a little trouble with my water. I have a hard time gettin' it all out, you see. Like it just... stays in there. It’s been happenin' for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty with complete bladder emptying, you say. And this has been occurring for approximately one month?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds right. A month, maybe a little longer. It’s not… constant, not every time. But often enough it's bothersome. I have to… push a little. And sometimes I still feel like there's some left.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you do manage to empty your bladder, do you experience any pain or discomfort during urination?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It’s not painful, exactly. More like… a strain. Like I have to work at it. And like I said, not always. Some times it’s fine, no trouble at all. It just... feels incomplete, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. Strain, and a sensation of incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any changes in the stream itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… stream? Hmm. Let me think. Not that I’ve noticed, no. It seems… normal when it comes out. Not weak, not too strong. Just… hard to start sometimes, maybe? I have to wait a bit before it comes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Difficulty initiating the stream, strain, and incomplete emptying. Do you experience any urgency – a sudden, compelling need to urinate – or frequency, needing to go more often than usual?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn't say more often. No, not really. And not a sudden need, no. It’s not like I have to rush. It just… takes a bit to get goin'. It's hard to explain. It's not a rush, it's more… a wait.
DOCTOR: A delay in initiation, then. And no urgency or increased frequency. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, sir. No fever, no chills. And my belly… no, no pain there. Everything feels normal, other than… this water trouble. It hasn't been makin' me sick, or nothin'. Just bothersome, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright. No systemic symptoms. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have a primary care physician, and if so, do you mind if I request records from them?
PATIENT: I… I don't really have a doctor, sir. Not anymore. My wife… she always took care of things like that. She passed a few years back, and I haven’t really… gotten around to findin' one since. So, no, no records to request, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my blood pressure checked a few times, it was a little high sometimes, but they never gave me anythin’ for it. And… I had some trouble with my knees when I was younger, workin' all those years. But that’s it, really. Nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, history of knee problems. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No sir, no surgeries. Never needed any. Just the knees botherin' me from time to time. Mostly when the weather gets cold. I mostly just take it easy now, don’t do too much liftin’ or bendin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries. And now, regarding your family history… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – prostate issues, bladder problems, kidney disease, diabetes, things of that nature?
PATIENT: Well… my father, he had some trouble with his water when he got older. I don’t know exactly what, my mother didn’t talk much about it. Just that he had to get up a lot at night, if I remember right. And… my brother had some trouble with his sugar, I think. Diabetes, maybe? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Father with possible bladder issues, brother with diabetes. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink. Not anymore, anyway. Used to have a little beer with dinner sometimes, but that was a long time ago. And no, no drugs.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, no alcohol, no drug use. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not a one. Just some liniment for my knees when they’re botherin' me. But that's it. Nothin' regularly.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to perform a brief physical examination now, Mr. Hilber, if you don't mind. We’ll start with your abdomen and then a quick neurological assessment. Following that, I'd like to examine you externally and, if you’re amenable, I will perform a digital rectal exam. This will allow me to assess your prostate, which can often contribute to urinary symptoms. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Well, that don’t sound too pleasant, Doctor. Is it… is it necessary? I'm not sure I understand why you need to… do that.
DOCTOR: It is a standard part of the evaluation for urinary issues, Mr. Hilber. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, and its size and condition can often explain the symptoms you're experiencing. It's a necessary step to rule out potential causes and determine the appropriate course of action. I assure you, it is a quick and relatively painless procedure, though it may be uncomfortable. We can, of course, proceed without it, but it would significantly limit my ability to accurately assess your condition. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t like it, but… I suppose if it's necessary. I just… I don't much care for doctors pokin’ around in there, if you understand. But if you say it’s important, I guess I’ll let you. Just… be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table, face up. I’ll need you to bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the table. I'll begin with auscultation of your abdomen, then proceed with palpation and percussion. After that, we'll proceed with the rectal exam. Please inform me if you experience any discomfort during the examination. I'm listening for bowel sounds now, Mr. Hilber.
PATIENT: Alright… I’m lyin’ down. Just let me know what you’re doin’, Doctor. It'll help me relax.
DOCTOR: I am now palpating your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. No acute tenderness noted. Your abdomen is soft and non-distended. Tympanic to percussion throughout, indicating no fluid accumulation. Now, if you could please bend your knees and take a deep breath… We will now proceed with the digital rectal exam. It will be quick, as I mentioned. Please relax your muscles as much as possible.
PATIENT: Alright… tryin’ to relax. It's not easy, but… tryin’. Just… hurry, please. This is makin' me nervous.
DOCTOR: The prostate is enlarged, moderately firm, and slightly asymmetrical. There is no obvious tenderness to palpation. I have completed the exam, Mr. Hilber. The prostate feels enlarged, which is consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. However, the asymmetry warrants further investigation to rule out other possibilities. We'll need to obtain a urine sample for analysis, and I recommend a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test. A PSA test can help us assess your risk of prostate cancer. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Enlarged? What does that mean? Is it… is it bad? And cancer? You said cancer… that’s what I’m most afraid of. So a urine sample and… a blood test?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, an enlarged prostate is very common as men age. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. However, it can cause the urinary symptoms you're experiencing. The PSA test is simply a screening tool to help us assess your risk. A high PSA level doesn't automatically mean you have cancer, it just means we may need to consider further testing, such as a biopsy, to determine the cause. Let's not jump to conclusions. We'll start with the urine sample and blood test, and then discuss the results. I'll provide you with a requisition for both tests. The lab is located down the hall, and they can assist you with obtaining the samples. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So… not automatically cancer. Just… a test to see. Alright. I understand. A urine sample and a blood test. Down the hall, you said? And they'll help me? I… I hope it doesn’t take too long. And… what if the test is bad? What happens then?
DOCTOR: The lab technicians will guide you through the process. It shouldn't take more than fifteen to twenty minutes. As for what happens if the results are concerning, we'll discuss the options. If the PSA level is elevated, we may recommend further imaging, such as an MRI, or a biopsy to obtain a tissue sample for analysis. If cancer is detected, we’ll refer you to a urologist, a specialist in urinary health, who will discuss treatment options with you. However, let's focus on obtaining the tests first. Worrying prematurely will only cause unnecessary anxiety. I'll write you a referral to the lab and a requisition for the tests. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks to discuss the results. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Alright. Two weeks. A follow-up appointment. And… see a specialist if needed. That sounds… alright. I guess that's all I can do. Thank you, Doctor. For explainin' things. Here.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Hilber. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Remember to fast for eight hours before the blood test. And please try to remain calm and avoid unnecessary stress. I’ll see you in two weeks. Have a good day, Mr. Hilber.
PATIENT: .
