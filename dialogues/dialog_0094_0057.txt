DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I… well, I have cancer. It’s… it’s been a hard time.
DOCTOR: I understand. That must be incredibly difficult to process and cope with. Thank you for sharing that with me. To help me understand what’s been going on, and how I can best support you, could you tell me a little more about what’s been happening?
PATIENT: It was… my husband, he passed away last year. And then, a few months ago, I started feeling really tired all the time. Just… exhausted. And then I found a lump. That’s when I went to my regular doctor, and they sent me here. They said… cancer. I don’t really know what kind.
DOCTOR: I am so very sorry to hear about your husband. Losing someone you love is a profound pain, and to be facing this alongside that… it’s a lot. It’s perfectly alright if you’re feeling overwhelmed. You said you found a lump. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It’s… on my left side. Not very big, at first. Maybe the size of a bean? But it's gotten bigger. And… it hurts sometimes. Not all the time, but when I touch it. It feels… hard. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Chellsea. It's very helpful to know it’s on your left side, and that it’s grown and causes pain when touched. Describing it as hard is also useful information. Do you recall what your regular doctor told you about any initial tests or imaging that were done?
PATIENT: They… they did a mammogram. And a biopsy. They said… something about cells. Not good cells. And they said it was cancer, but didn't explain much. They just said I needed to see a specialist. That's why I'm here. I don't really understand all the medical words.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you were given very little information, and that's frustrating when you're already dealing with so much. Don't worry about the medical words – that’s what I'm here for. We'll go over everything slowly, and I’ll explain things as clearly as I can. Do you happen to have any reports from the mammogram or biopsy with you today?
PATIENT: I… I think so. Here. I brought everything they gave me. It’s… a lot of papers. I didn’t really look at them closely.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Chellsea. This is very helpful. Okay, it looks like the biopsy confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma. That means the cancer started in the milk ducts of the breast and has spread to surrounding tissue. The mammogram report shows a suspicious mass in the upper outer quadrant of your left breast. I know this is a lot to take in. Before we go any further, are you comfortable if I perform a physical exam of your breast and surrounding areas?
PATIENT: Um… yes. Okay. If you think it’s… necessary. But… please explain what you’re doing as you go? I don't want to be surprised.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything step-by-step. First, I’m just going to visually inspect your breasts, looking for any changes in size, shape, or skin texture. Then, I’ll gently feel for any lumps or abnormalities. I’ll also check your lymph nodes under your armpits and around your collarbone. It might be a little uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, Chellsea, if you could please lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’m going to start by having you lift your arms above your head. Okay, I can feel a firm, irregular mass in the upper outer quadrant of your left breast, consistent with the findings on the mammogram. It's approximately 2 centimeters in size. There's some tenderness to palpation. Now, I'm going to check your lymph nodes. I feel some slight enlargement of the lymph nodes under your left armpit. They are also a bit tender. Okay, Chellsea. That completes the physical exam. Everything I felt is consistent with the reports we have, but further testing will be needed to determine the stage of the cancer and the best course of treatment.
PATIENT: Okay. That… sounds like a lot. Stage? What does that mean? And… what kind of testing? I’m scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be scared, Chellsea. This is a lot to process. Let's take it one step at a time. "Stage" refers to how far the cancer has spread. It's determined by the size of the tumor, whether it's spread to nearby lymph nodes, and whether it's spread to other parts of the body. We'll need to do some further imaging – likely a CT scan and a bone scan – to get a clearer picture of the extent of the disease. We may also recommend an MRI of the breast. These scans will help us determine the best course of treatment, which could include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. It sounds overwhelming, but we'll talk through all the options and make a plan together. Do you have any questions about that right now?
PATIENT: CT scan… bone scan… MRI… It just… all the words. I don't know what any of that means. Will it hurt? Will it make me sick? And… what if it’s already… everywhere? I’m sorry. I’m just… really scared.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be scared, Chellsea. It’s absolutely okay. And you are not alone in feeling this way. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed by all the medical terms and what they mean. Let’s break it down. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your internal organs. An MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves. They both help us see if the cancer has spread beyond the breast. They aren’t usually painful, but you might need an IV for contrast dye, which can sometimes cause a warm sensation. As for whether it’s “everywhere,” that’s exactly what these scans will help us determine. We need to gather more information before we can know the extent of the disease. It's important to remember that even if the cancer has spread, there are still treatment options available. We’ll discuss those options thoroughly once we have the results of the scans. I want to assure you that we’ll be with you every step of the way. We have a wonderful team of oncology nurses, social workers, and other specialists who can provide support and guidance. We’ll answer all your questions and help you navigate this process. Do you want to talk about some of your concerns right now, or would you like to focus on scheduling the scans?
PATIENT: Scheduling… maybe. If we have to do it, then we have to do it. But… what about my hair? I’ve heard… chemo makes your hair fall out. That sounds awful. I don’t want to lose my hair.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Chellsea. Losing your hair can be a very distressing side effect of chemotherapy, and it's perfectly normal to be worried about it. Whether or not you lose your hair depends on the specific chemotherapy drugs used, the dosage, and how your body responds. Some types of chemo are more likely to cause hair loss than others. There are things we can do to minimize hair loss, such as using a cooling cap during treatment, which can help constrict blood vessels in the scalp. We can also talk about wigs, scarves, and other head coverings if hair loss does occur. It's also important to remember that hair always grows back. It may take some time, and the texture might be different at first, but it will grow back. Before we decide on a treatment plan, we'll discuss all the potential side effects and how to manage them. We'll also explore all your options to ensure you feel comfortable and informed. Let's get these scans scheduled. Do you have a preference for where you'd like to have them done?
PATIENT: I… I don’t know. Anywhere is fine. Just… the sooner it’s done, the sooner we know, right? I guess… let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: You're right, Chellsea. Getting the scans done will give us the information we need to move forward. I’m going to write you a referral to the imaging center here at St. Luke’s Hospital. They have excellent facilities and experienced technicians. Here you go. This referral includes the orders for a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as a bone scan. The receptionist will help you schedule the appointments when you check out. They usually can get you in within a few days. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. I have a nurse who is available to answer your calls and provide support. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… explained a lot. I appreciate it. I guess I’ll go talk to the receptionist now. .
