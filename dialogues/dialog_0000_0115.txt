DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Durig, please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, yes. Thank you, Doctor... Batara, was it? It's about my coloring, really. I seem to be…yellowing. It’s rather unsettling, and my niece insisted I come see someone. She said it could be my liver, but honestly, I don’t recall much about…well, anything these days.
DOCTOR: Yellowing, you say. Right. And how long have you noticed this…yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s…difficult. A few weeks, perhaps? It came on gradually, I believe. I really can't be certain. Time… it slips away, you know? I do have some trouble with my… insides, sometimes. A general unwell feeling, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: "General unwell feeling" is…vague, Mrs. Durig. Is this unwell feeling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, definitely. Some days I feel…almost alright. Other days, just very tired, and a bit queasy. Not sick, precisely, just…not right. And the yellowing seems worse on the bad days, naturally. I’ve also… lost my appetite, I think. Or maybe I just don’t have one. It’s all so…confusing.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… stool? Goodness. Well… I suppose it's been… paler than usual. Yes. I hadn't really… connected it to everything else. It’s… difficult to discuss, naturally.
DOCTOR: Right. Pale stools, yellowing… and loss of appetite. Do you experience any pain, Mrs. Durig?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. Discomfort, sometimes, a dull ache under my ribs on the right side, but it’s… fleeting. It doesn’t keep me up at night or anything. More of a… nagging feeling. And, truthfully, I've been feeling very fatigued. More than usual, even for my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a tricky question. I had something with my liver, I believe, years and years ago. Hepatitis, perhaps? It was a very long time ago, and I don’t recall the details. I was quite young, and it wasn’t…severe, as I remember it. Mostly just bed rest. And… something about my gallbladder, I think. They may have removed it, but honestly, Doctor, my memory is just… gone.
DOCTOR: Right. Hepatitis, possible gallbladder removal… and when was this, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a very long time ago. Perhaps in the 1970s? Or maybe the early 80s. It feels like a lifetime ago. I was living in… well, never mind where. It’s not important. I’ve lived a lot of places. I just… don’t recall specific dates, you see.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mrs. Durig?
PATIENT: No, no medications. I haven't taken anything regularly in years. Perhaps an occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing prescribed, nothing ongoing. I try to avoid them if possible. They always make me feel… foggy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical examination. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll also feel your stomach. This will help me get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to know what's wrong, if you can find out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Now, let’s try this side… Hmm. A little tenderness here, on the right side. And your liver feels… enlarged. Not dramatically, but noticeable. I also detect some fluid retention in your abdomen. Your bowel sounds are a bit diminished. It’s… not alarming, but it’s something to note. I'll need to order some blood work, including a liver function panel, and possibly an ultrasound of your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood work and an ultrasound. Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad”, Mrs. Durig. It’s simply…necessary. Your symptoms, combined with my initial examination, suggest a possible issue with your liver and gallbladder. The blood work will give us a clearer picture of your liver function, and the ultrasound will allow us to visualize your liver and gallbladder. It's better to be thorough, understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Thorough. That’s good. I… I don't have insurance, Doctor. Will this be very expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you see.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, medical tests are expensive. We’ll do our best to work with you. There may be some assistance programs available, and the lab does offer a discount for self-pay patients. I’ll have the receptionist look into options for you. But realistically, Mrs. Durig, these tests are essential to determine the cause of your symptoms, and we need to proceed. Now, I’m going to write you a requisition for the blood work and the ultrasound. The lab and imaging center are both located near the clinic. Do you have any questions about where to go or how to schedule the appointments?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. The receptionist will help me, you said? That’s good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… being thorough. And for looking into the cost. I suppose I should just… get it over with, then. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: For now, Mrs. Durig, just try to rest. And eat something, even if you don’t have much of an appetite. Small, frequent meals are best. Avoid alcohol, and any fatty or fried foods. Once we have the results of the blood work and ultrasound, we can discuss a more comprehensive plan. And, frankly, try not to worry. It’s unlikely to be anything… dramatic. Though, I must say, ignoring these symptoms for this long wasn't wise. Now, go and schedule those tests. The receptionist is waiting. .
