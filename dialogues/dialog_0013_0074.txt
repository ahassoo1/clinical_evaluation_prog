DOCTOR: Hi Venna, it’s so nice to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Chriselda. It’s nice to meet you too. My blood pressure’s been actin’ up, that’s why I’m here. Doctor said I oughta get it checked regular-like. Don't rightly remember his name anymore, though. Been a spell since I saw him.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good you’re getting it checked regularly. It is important. And don't worry about the doctor's name – that happens! We’ll get your blood pressure sorted out today. I see here you're 90 years young and a member of the Cherokee Nation – wonderful! And I have your height and weight recorded as 190 and 85, is that still accurate?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Tall for an old woman, I always been. And the weight… well, it fluctuates a bit, but that sounds about right. I bake a lot, you see. Good bread needs good ingredients!
DOCTOR: That's wonderful! There’s nothing wrong with enjoying good food. Baking is a lovely hobby. Okay, so let’s talk about this blood pressure. Has anything changed recently that might be affecting it?
PATIENT: Not that I can rightly recall. Same old routine. Wake up, feed the chickens, bake a bit, maybe visit with Martha next door… Nothing different. I do get a little tired easier these days, but that’s just bein’ old, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you mentioned a little more tiredness lately – is that a new thing, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: It’s been gradual, I suppose. Started slow, just not havin' the energy for a second batch of biscuits like I used to. Now, sometimes I gotta sit a spell after just walkin' to the garden. Do you think that’s got somethin’ to do with the blood pressure? I don’t rightly understand all that medical talk.
DOCTOR: It could be related, yes. Fatigue is a common symptom when blood pressure isn’t quite right. It’s good you’re noticing these changes. Let's take a look at your blood pressure now, and we can talk through the results. I’ll explain everything as clearly as I can. Alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good, dear. Just… don't wrap it too tight, now. My arm ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. I'm just going to inflate this cuff, and it will feel a bit snug. Deep breaths, okay?
PATIENT: Deep breaths… alright. Feels a bit tight, but I reckon that’s just how it is. Hurry up and get it over with, will ya? Not fond of feelin' restricted.
DOCTOR: Alright, all done. Your blood pressure is reading 162/98. That's a bit elevated, Venna. Now, just so you know, a normal reading is generally considered to be around 120/80. We'll need to discuss this and figure out the best way to manage it. Do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking anything?
PATIENT: Hmm, 162… that don’t sound good, does it? No allergies, thankfully. And no, I ain't takin' nothin' right now. Never been much for pills, if I can help it. Always figured a good cup of chamomile tea was better for what ails ya.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for natural remedies, and chamomile tea is lovely! But sometimes, with blood pressure this elevated, we need a little extra help. Let’s see… I don't see any previous blood pressure medications listed here. Have you ever been told you have high blood pressure before this recent doctor's visit you mentioned?
PATIENT: Well now… that’s a good question. Old Doctor Henderson, he mumbled a lot. Think he said somethin’ about it bein’ a little high a few years back, but he just told me to watch my salt and not worry too much. Salt's good for bakin’, you know! But I can't rightly recall if he gave me a name for it, or a pill or anything. Might have just been the mumblin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It sounds like it might have been mentioned before, but not actively managed. Given your reading today, and your history, I think we need to start some treatment to get your blood pressure under control. We'll start with a low dose medication, and monitor it closely. Now, before we talk about medication options, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, things like that. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. I s'pose if you think it's necessary. Low dose sounds better than a high dose, that’s for sure. Go ahead then. Just be gentle with my old bones, will ya? They creak enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now… it’s a little fast, but regular. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Checking your reflexes now… a little diminished, which is common at your age, but nothing concerning. Pulses are good and strong in all extremities. Alright, everything sounds relatively normal aside from the slightly elevated heart rate and diminished reflexes, which are expected. But that blood pressure needs to be addressed.
PATIENT: So, what kinda pill are you thinkin’ about givin’ me? And will it make me tired? I got biscuits to bake, you know. Can't be sleepin’ all day.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question! We have a few options. A common starting medication is a low dose of a thiazide diuretic, sometimes called a “water pill.” It helps your body get rid of extra salt and water, which lowers blood pressure. Or, we could consider a low dose of an ACE inhibitor. Both medications can sometimes cause a little fatigue, especially when you first start, but it usually subsides after a week or two. We'll start with the lowest effective dose and see how you tolerate it. We can always adjust it if needed. Does either of those sound particularly concerning to you?
PATIENT: Water pill… sounds awful. Makes me think I'll be runnin’ to the bathroom all day. And I already got arthritis in my hands, can't be grippin' nothin' too tight. ACE inhibitor… what's that even do? Is it one of them fancy newfangled pills with a million side effects? I just want somethin’ simple, if that’s possible. Can’t a body just eat a little less salt and be done with it?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. You’re right to ask questions and want something simple. Eating less salt is helpful, but unfortunately, it’s often not enough to control blood pressure, especially as we get older. ACE inhibitors aren't “fancy” – they’ve been around for a while now and are very effective. They work by relaxing your blood vessels, making it easier for your heart to pump. Common side effects can include a dry cough or dizziness, but not everyone experiences them. Given your concerns, and wanting to start simple, perhaps we could try a very low dose of amlodipine. It’s a calcium channel blocker, and it tends to be well-tolerated with fewer side effects than some of the other options. It also doesn't typically cause frequent urination. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: Amlodipine… that sounds… less scary. Doesn’t make me gotta run to the bathroom, you say? And won't give me a dry cough? Alright, I s’pose I can try that. But if I start feelin’ awful, or can’t sleep, or my hands get too shaky, I’m stoppin’ it right then and there. Deal?
DOCTOR: Deal. Absolutely. Your comfort and well-being are the most important thing. If you experience any side effects, we’ll stop the medication immediately and explore other options. Okay, I’m prescribing a low dose of amlodipine, 2.5mg once daily. I’ll also send a prescription to your pharmacy for a blood pressure cuff so you can monitor your levels at home. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your blood pressure and see how you’re tolerating the medication. In the meantime, please call the office if you have any concerns at all. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. And I will call if I feel awful. Just one thing. Will this mess with my bakin’? Some recipes are mighty precise, you know. Can't be addin’ a pinch too much or not enough.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Venna! A low dose of amlodipine shouldn’t affect your baking at all. It doesn't typically cause any mental side effects or changes in coordination. But if you do notice anything unusual, please let me know. Alright. Here's your follow-up appointment card. And remember, call the office with any concerns. It was lovely meeting you today, Venna. I'm confident we can get your blood pressure under control. .
