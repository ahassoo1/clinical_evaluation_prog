DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Um, well, I’m here for a clearance, I believe. For… surgery. Cosmetic surgery. It’s all a bit… hazy, to be honest. My husband… he arranged most of it. I just need to make sure I’m healthy enough to go through with it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-operative clearance for cosmetic surgery. That’s perfectly reasonable. It's good you’re getting checked out beforehand. Let’s start with some details then. Could you tell me what type of surgery you’re scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a good question. I really don’t recall the specifics. Something to do with… my face, I think? He mentioned… lifting? And maybe something around my eyes? It was a while ago now, and… well, grief does things to a person's memory, you know? I apologize for being so vague. I truly do. It was a full package, I believe, but the details… they escape me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mackenzi. Grief does have a way of doing that. No need to apologize at all. We can still proceed. Do you recall when the surgery is scheduled?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I have a calendar somewhere… Ah, here we are. August 15th. Yes, that’s it. August 15th. At the City Clinic, downtown. Though… I don't remember who the surgeon is, specifically. Again, terribly sorry. My husband took care of all the appointments and such.
DOCTOR: Okay, August 15th at City Clinic. That gives us a little time. Let's focus on getting a good understanding of your overall health. First, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, I haven't been seriously ill in… years. Just the usual colds and flu. I had chickenpox as a child, of course. And… oh! I had my appendix removed when I was sixteen. Other than that… I honestly can’t recall anything significant. I used to see a doctor regularly, but it’s been… a long time since my husband passed. I just haven't had the energy, I suppose. Do you want me to try and remember anything more specific? Perhaps if you asked about… medications? I don’t take any regularly, but…
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major illnesses besides the appendix removal. And you haven’t been seeing a doctor regularly recently. Let's talk about medications. You said you don’t take anything regularly. Have you ever had any allergic reactions to any medications – even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Allergic reactions… hmm. That’s a tricky one. I don’t think so. I once had a bit of a rash after taking some… pink pills for a headache? Years ago. But it wasn’t severe. I just stopped taking them. And… oh! I remember being a little itchy after taking penicillin as a child, but my mother said it was probably just a coincidence. So… nothing serious, really. No anaphylactic shock or anything like that. I’m fairly sure. It was a long time ago, you see. It’s difficult to recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible mild rash with pink pills for a headache and some mild itching with penicillin as a child. We’ll make a note of those potential sensitivities. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s another area where my memory is… cloudy. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think? And she had some problems with her knees as she got older, arthritis maybe? My father… he was a very healthy man. He lived to be eighty-five, but he did have… something to do with his heart, near the end. It wasn’t sudden, but… he was tired a lot. My grandparents… I honestly don't recall much about their health. We didn't see them very often. I apologize for being so unhelpful. I wish I could provide more details. It’s just… all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mackenzi. You’re providing what you can, and that’s perfectly fine. High blood pressure in your mother and some heart issues in your father. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. And recreational drugs… well, that’s simply not something I’ve ever been interested in. I lead a very quiet life. I spend most of my time gardening, or… well, I used to spend time with my husband. Now, it's mostly just the garden. So, no, nothing like that. I assure you.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mackenzi. Alright, let’s get some basic measurements. I'm going to check your height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. I… I hope I’m not too heavy. I haven't weighed myself in ages. But please, go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s step onto the scale. Okay, Mackenzi. Your height is 155 centimeters, your weight is 93 kilograms, your blood pressure is 135 over 85, your pulse is 82, and your temperature is 36.8. Your BMI is 38.8, which falls into the obese category. Blood pressure is slightly elevated. We’ll need to discuss that a little further. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we should monitor. Would you mind if I listened to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh dear… obese, you say? Well, I haven't been as active since… since my husband passed. And I do enjoy my food, I confess. The blood pressure… that is concerning, isn’t it? Yes, of course, please listen to my heart and lungs. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to be sure I’m healthy enough for this surgery. And I appreciate you being so thorough.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. It's subtle, but it could indicate some fluid buildup. It’s possible this is related to your slightly elevated blood pressure or just a mild congestion. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work to get a better picture of what’s going on. The blood work will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… crackles? That doesn’t sound good, does it? Fluid buildup… I haven’t been coughing or anything, though. I just… feel tired a lot. Blood work and an X-ray… yes, of course. Whatever you need. I want to understand what’s happening. Is it… serious? Will it affect the surgery? I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. I apologize. I just… I really wanted this surgery. It was my husband’s idea, you see. He thought it would… help me.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to feel overwhelmed, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious when you're facing medical uncertainty. The crackles are mild, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. It could be a number of things – a mild infection, some fluid retention, or even just a bit of congestion. That’s why we need to run these tests. As for affecting the surgery, it’s too early to say. We need to see the results of the tests first. I’m going to order the X-ray and blood work now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood, and we’ll schedule the X-ray for you. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, just in case the X-ray requires it?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… I don't think so. I've never had an X-ray with dye before, to my knowledge. No, I don't believe I have any allergies to anything, actually. I’m usually very good about avoiding things I’m allergic to. I’m just… a bit forgetful sometimes, I'm afraid. But no, no known allergies to contrast dye. And thank you, Doctor. For being so patient. It’s just… it’s a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly alright to be forgetful, and it’s good you haven’t had any reactions before. We’ll be careful to ask again before administering any dye. Alright, the nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. After that, we’ll schedule the X-ray. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever… yes, I understand. I will. I’ll be very careful. And I’ll contact you immediately if anything changes. Thank you again, Doctor Bacy. You’ve been very kind. I… I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse now?
DOCTOR: Yes, just wait here, and the nurse will be in shortly. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions in the meantime. Take care, Mackenzi.
