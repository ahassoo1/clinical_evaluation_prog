DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the nurse. This… this diarrhea. It won’t stop. I’ve tried everything. And honestly, I don’t have all day to sit here and rehash it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. The nurse did mention the diarrhea. I apologize for any repetition, I just like to get a full picture myself. “Everything” is a bit vague though, if you don’t mind me asking a few questions. When did this start, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. It was… maybe a week ago? A little over? I don't keep a calendar tracking my… bathroom habits, Doctor. It started after I ate some salmon. Though I eat salmon all the time and this has never happened before. It's just… persistently awful. I’ve been taking those over-the-counter things, but they do absolutely nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, after eating salmon. And the over-the-counter medications haven’t provided any relief. I see. Has it been consistently diarrhea for the whole week, or has it come and gone?
PATIENT: Consistently. Pretty much. Maybe one or two brief moments where it… lessened, but it always comes roaring back. It’s disruptive, to say the least. I have things to do, you know. I can’t just be running to the bathroom all day. And it's embarrassing to even talk about.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s disruptive and unpleasant to discuss. Thank you for sharing this with me. Besides the disruption, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Like what? I’m exhausted, if that wasn’t obvious. And… well, I’ve been a bit dehydrated, I guess. I’m trying to drink water, but it feels like it goes right through me. Honestly, I’m just weak and tired of dealing with this. Is that helpful enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Woodring. Exhaustion and dehydration are definitely concerning. Now, have you experienced any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No fever. A little nauseous sometimes, but I haven't actually thrown up. And… my stomach feels off. Kind of crampy, but not like, debilitating pain. Just… unsettled. Is this really necessary? I mean, I told the nurse all of this. Are you just… double-checking?
DOCTOR: I apologize again for the repetition. It's standard procedure to gather a complete history, even if the nurse has already collected some information. It helps me ensure I don't miss anything. Okay, no fever, occasional nausea, and mild abdominal cramping. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – anything you're being treated for regularly?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I was perfectly healthy until this… this mess started. My husband… he passed away a few years back, but I haven't been sick. I don't take any regular medications, either. Just those things I bought for my stomach, which clearly aren't working. Can we please get to the point? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No pre-existing conditions, no regular medications. I understand your frustration and want to get this resolved as quickly as possible. Now, have there been any changes in your diet recently, aside from the salmon?
PATIENT: No. I eat the same things. Mostly fish, honestly. And vegetables. I try to eat healthy. Look, I live a pretty simple life. I don't go out to fancy restaurants or try a bunch of new foods. This isn't some complicated mystery. I ate salmon, and now I have unending diarrhea. What else do you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Just one more quick question regarding your family history. Are there any instances of chronic digestive issues – like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis – in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. No! My family… we're Tlingit. We eat what the land provides. We're strong people. We don't sit around worrying about… bowel issues! I doubt anyone in my family has ever even heard of Crohn’s disease. This is ridiculous. Are you suspecting I have some rare illness? I just want this to stop! Can we please just get to the tests or whatever it is you're going to do?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, Ms. Woodring. I’m not suspecting anything, I’m simply trying to gather all the necessary information to help determine the cause of your diarrhea. It's important to rule out any underlying factors. Given your history, and the persistent nature of the symptoms, I’d like to conduct a physical examination and order a stool sample analysis to look for any potential infections or parasites. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do, and this is wasting my entire day. Just… please be quick. And try not to ask me any more ridiculous questions. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as quick and efficient as possible. First, I’ll listen to your abdomen, and then I'll palpate it gently to check for any tenderness. Please lie down on the examination table, if you don't mind. I’m listening now… and gently pressing here… Does this cause any pain?
