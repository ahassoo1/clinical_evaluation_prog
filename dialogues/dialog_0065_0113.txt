DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Duplichan, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom business. Too much of it, if you catch my drift. It's just... inconvenient, really. A man's got things to do, you know? Not sit around all day. It’s been going on for… oh, I don’t rightly know how long. A while, anyway.
DOCTOR: Right. “Too much of it.” Can you be a bit more specific, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Specific… now there's a word. Let me think. Well, it feels like I’m going all the time. Not a stream, mind you, more like… little bits. Several times an hour, easily. And sometimes… sometimes I have to go, right away. Can't even finish a thought without feeling the urge. It’s disruptive, is what I'm saying. Used to be able to hold it, you know? A man needs to be in control of his own bladder.
DOCTOR: Okay. So increased frequency and urgency… and a feeling of not being able to fully empty your bladder, perhaps?
PATIENT: Emptying… hmm. Now that you mention it, maybe not completely. Just a little dribble sometimes after I think I’m done. Nothing major, but enough to be… bothersome. Always have to check, you see? And then, of course, the going so often… it’s just not dignified. I haven't had any pain, though, if that matters. Not a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. And no pain at all?
PATIENT: No, not a lick. None. Just the constant need to go. And like I said, the little dribbles. It’s… well, it’s getting old, Doctor. A man gets to my age, you expect a few aches and pains, sure. But this… this is just… irritating. I used to have a good constitution, you know. Farm work’ll keep you strong.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes… now what kind of changes are we talkin’ about? It’s… pee, Doctor. What’s there to change? It's yellow, generally. Sometimes a little darker, depending on what I’ve been drinkin’. I haven't seen any blood or anything like that. And no, it doesn't smell any different than usual. Although, to be honest, I don't go sniffin' my own… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. And have you had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not a touch of it. Chills, either. Although it's been a bit cool in the mornings lately, but that's just the weather. Nausea… no. I had a bit of indigestion after Mabel's apple pie last week, but that’s Mabel. Always puts too much cinnamon in everything. Vomiting? Heavens no. I haven't been sick to my stomach in… oh, decades, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. I take a little something for my joints, arthritis, you know. Doc gave it to me a few years back. Can't recall the name right off. Little white pill. And sometimes I take a couple of aspirin if my knees are botherin' me something fierce. That's about it, I think. Oh! And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter. Mabel says I don't get enough sun.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Now that's a good question. Let me see... Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not ever. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy if I'm out in the weeds too much, but that's just the poison ivy, I expect. I stay away from those darn plants as much as I can, though. Mabel gets real upset if I track it in the house.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam now. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll check your abdomen, and I'll need to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hold on now. A… a what exam? You want me to… lie down? And… and check my prostate? Well, I never! What for? I told you I just have to go to the bathroom too much. Is that what happens when a man gets old? A lot of poking and prodding? I don’t think I’m comfortable with that, Doctor. Not at all comfortable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your hesitation. However, a digital rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating urinary symptoms in men. It allows me to feel the size and texture of your prostate gland, which can help determine if it's enlarged or if there are any other abnormalities that might be causing your frequent urination. It’s a relatively quick procedure, and it’s often necessary to rule out more serious conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia or, less commonly, prostate cancer. I assure you, I will be as gentle and professional as possible. It’s important for me to gather all the information I can to make an accurate diagnosis and recommend the best course of treatment. If you're still uncomfortable, we can discuss alternative approaches, but I strongly advise against dismissing this important step in your evaluation. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Alternative approaches…? Well, I suppose… I suppose you could just give me something for it? A pill, maybe? I don’t need you… feeling anything. I’m a private man, Doctor. Always have been. And frankly, this whole thing sounds… undignified. I came here because I have to go to the bathroom too much, not to be… examined. I’ve lived a long life, and I haven't had any trouble with my… prostate before now. Maybe it’s just old age. Maybe I just need to drink less coffee.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your concerns, and I respect your wishes. However, simply treating the symptoms without understanding the cause can be misleading and potentially harmful. There are several possible causes for your frequent urination, and without a proper evaluation, we can't rule out more serious conditions. While I won’t force you to undergo any procedure you’re not comfortable with, I strongly advise against dismissing the possibility of a more thorough examination. Given your reluctance, we can start with a urine analysis and a blood test to check your kidney function and screen for infection. This will give us some initial information, but it won’t be as definitive as a digital rectal exam and potential imaging. If the results of these tests are concerning, I would strongly recommend reconsidering the exam. Would you be willing to proceed with the urine analysis and blood test for now?
PATIENT: Well… a urine analysis and a blood test… that sounds reasonable. Less… invasive, you understand. As long as you're not sticking anything… anywhere. And if those tests don't show anything… then I’d like to just leave it at that. No poking, no prodding. Just… some pills, maybe? To help me sleep through the night, at least.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Segretto. We'll proceed with the urine analysis and blood test. A nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood and collect a urine sample. I'll review the results as soon as they’re available and contact you to discuss them further. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, pain in your back or side, or difficulty urinating, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ things. And… try not to keep me waitin’ too long for the results, will ya? It's just… bothersome, havin' to worry about it. I reckon that's all for now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. We'll get the results to you as quickly as possible. Thank you for coming in today. Please let the nurse know if you have any questions before you leave. Have a good day. .
