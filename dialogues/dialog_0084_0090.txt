DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Honestly, it’s a bit difficult to explain. My… well, my husband and I were discussing some… changes I might like to make. And now… now I’m here for a check-up before, um, before going ahead with it. I believe it's called a clearance? For surgery? It's all been a little… overwhelming since he passed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mackenzi. It is a lot to take in, and it's perfectly alright if things feel overwhelming. You’re right, it sounds like you’re requesting a pre-operative clearance. And I apologize for your loss – I see a note in your chart regarding your husband’s passing. That must be incredibly difficult. So, to be clear, you're considering elective surgery?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Elective. That sounds… correct. It’s… a bit personal, and honestly, I don’t recall all the specifics we discussed. My husband did most of the research, and I… I was mostly just agreeing with him, I think. He had such good ideas. Is it alright if I’m a little vague? I feel terrible about not remembering details, but my memory hasn't been the same since… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly understandable. Grief affects everyone differently, and memory issues are common. We can definitely work through this without getting bogged down in specifics you don’t recall right now. Let’s start with the general type of surgery. Do you know what kind of surgery it is?
PATIENT: Um… I believe it had something to do with… appearance? He said it would help with… confidence? Something about reshaping… parts of me? Oh dear. I’m so sorry. It was… a tummy tuck and… something with the breasts, I think? He showed me pictures, but… I mostly remember how happy he seemed about it all. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mackenzi. Thank you for sharing that. So, a tummy tuck – abdominoplasty – and breast augmentation, or possibly a breast lift, or both?
PATIENT: Yes, I think that sounds right. Both, perhaps? He definitely mentioned wanting to… restore things. He used that word, "restore." It’s just… everything feels so fuzzy. I apologize for being so unhelpful. I feel like I should be able to recall these things, but… it’s like trying to remember a dream. He handled all the appointments and the details. I just… trusted him. Is it okay if you ask me about my health history instead? Maybe that will be easier.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay, Mackenzi. You haven’t been unhelpful at all. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and have memory gaps, especially after a loss. Trusting your husband is understandable, and we can absolutely focus on your health history. Let’s start with your medical conditions. Do you have any current health problems, like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I don’t think so. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it was just temporary, during a particularly stressful time. It went back down with… with diet and exercise, I think. And I sometimes get… migraines. Not often, but they can be quite severe when they come on. Other than that… no, I believe I’m generally quite healthy. I try to eat well and stay active. I do gardening, you know. That’s good exercise. Oh! And I had chickenpox as a child. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mackenzi, that’s good to know. So, a history of temporary high blood pressure, migraines, and chickenpox. We’ll make a note of those. Do you take any medications regularly – even over-the-counter medications or vitamins?
PATIENT: Let me think… Sometimes I take ibuprofen for the migraines, when they're really bad. But not regularly. And… oh! I take a multivitamin. Just a standard one, you know, for general health. I started taking it after my husband passed; he always said it was important to look after myself. I think he bought it for me. He was very… thoughtful. Other than that, no, nothing else. I don't really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen as needed for migraines and a daily multivitamin. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I eat a pretty varied diet, and I've never had any trouble with food allergies. And… he always checked about allergies before giving me anything, even a simple cough drop. He was very careful. No, I don't believe I have any allergies. I’m quite lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let’s talk about past surgeries. Have you ever had any surgical procedures before?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I think. And… oh! I had a wisdom tooth removed, years ago. That was quite unpleasant, I remember. Other than that… no, I don't believe so. I’ve never had any major surgery, not before now. I always avoided it if possible. He always said I was too… delicate for surgery. He was very protective.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and wisdom tooth extraction. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. My family… isn’t very close. I don’t really know much about their medical history. My mother passed away when I was young, and I didn’t have much contact with my father. And I… I didn't keep in touch with my siblings. I'm sorry. I wish I could tell you more, but… I just don't know. He… he always handled those things, too. He did all the research, kept track of everything. I feel terrible about being so useless.
DOCTOR: Mackenzi, you're not being useless at all. It's perfectly understandable that you don't have that information, given your family situation. We can work around it. Don't feel bad about it. Okay. Let's move on. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I don’t smoke, and I very rarely drink alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, perhaps. And… no, absolutely not recreational drugs. I’ve never been interested in those things. My husband… he didn’t approve. He was very… health-conscious, as you can tell. He always said those things were bad for you. I agree with him, of course. They just aren’t good for your body.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, no smoking, very rare alcohol consumption, and no recreational drugs. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your current activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, I’m quite active, actually. I spend most of my days gardening. It’s my passion, you see. I have a large garden, and it requires a lot of work – digging, planting, weeding, watering… it keeps me very busy. I also enjoy walking, and I try to get out for a long walk most days. It’s good for the soul, you know. And… well, it helps me feel close to him. He loved gardening, too. We used to work on it together.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mackenzi. Gardening sounds very fulfilling. And it's good to hear you're staying active. Okay, so you’re generally quite active with gardening and walking. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline before the surgery. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please be gentle. I haven't had a proper medical exam in… well, a long time. He always took care of those things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mackenzi. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your height and weight. And then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a basic neurological exam. If you could just step over here, please. Okay, you’re 5’0” and 180 pounds. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is everything alright? My heart… sometimes it feels a little… fluttery when I’m nervous. He always said it was just anxiety, but…
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, although I do hear a slight murmur. It's likely benign, but we'll note it. Your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Could you lie flat on your back with your knees bent?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is something wrong? It sometimes feels a little… tender here, especially after I've been gardening. I thought it was just muscle strain. He always said I overdid it. He was very… protective of me. I’m sorry if I’m being difficult. I just… I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Mackenzi. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious. I'm just checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. I do feel some slight tenderness in your lower abdomen, as you mentioned. It's likely muscle strain, as you suspect, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Now, let’s do a quick neurological exam. Could you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is everything alright? I sometimes feel a little… dizzy. It’s probably just the nerves. He always said I get anxious easily. He was very… reassuring. I’m sorry if I’m taking up your time. I just… I don’t want anything to go wrong with the surgery.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal, and your strength seems good. You’re not taking up my time at all, Mackenzi. I want to make sure we have a complete picture of your health before proceeding. Okay. Based on this brief exam, everything seems generally okay. The tenderness in your abdomen is likely muscular, and the murmur is something we’ll keep an eye on. However, given your history of dizziness and the slight tenderness, I'd like to order a few blood tests just to rule out anything else. And I recommend an EKG to further evaluate the heart murmur. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests and an EKG… yes, that sounds… sensible. He always said it was better to be safe than sorry. He was very… thorough. Just… please let me know if anything is seriously wrong. I trust your judgment implicitly. I just… I want to be sure everything is okay before I… before I go through with this. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… or any questions you have for me? I feel like I’m forgetting something…
DOCTOR: You're not forgetting anything, Mackenzi. And you've been very helpful. I will order the blood tests and EKG right now. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine if the surgery is safe to proceed with. I do have one last question. You mentioned your husband handled most of the arrangements for this surgery. Is there anyone else who is aware of the procedure and can provide support to you during the recovery process?
PATIENT: No… no, there isn’t. He… he was everything. He arranged everything, planned everything… I don’t… I don’t have anyone else to… to help me. I thought… I thought I could handle it. He always said I was strong. But… now… now I’m not so sure. Is that… is that alright? Or do I need to… do I need to cancel everything? I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Mackenzi, you are not a burden. And you don’t need to cancel anything just yet. It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed, especially after a loss. We can absolutely work through this together. I have a social worker on staff who specializes in grief support and post-surgical care. She can help you with arranging transportation, meals, and other practical needs during your recovery. Would you like me to connect you with her?
PATIENT: Oh… would I? Yes, please. That would be… that would be wonderful. I… I don’t know what I would do without some help. He always… he always knew what to do. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much. You’ve… you’ve been very kind. Just… please let me know when I can expect to hear from the social worker. And… and thank you again. I feel a little… less alone now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. I'm glad I could help. I'll have the social worker contact you within 24 hours. I’ll also send over a summary of our discussion and the lab orders to your chart. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Alright. I think that’s everything for today. Get some rest, and remember, you’re not alone in this.
