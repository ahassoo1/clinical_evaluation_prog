DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s good to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Doctor…Neppl, you said? Look, I ain’t got all day. Just need somethin’ signed, that’s all. Some…procedure. A fella told me I need your okay before I…do it. It’s cosmetic. That’s what he said. Don't rightly remember all the details, to be honest. Just wanna get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you need a form signed for a cosmetic procedure. While I'm happy to review anything needing my signature, as your physician, it’s important for me to understand the details of this procedure to ensure it’s appropriate and safe for you. Could you tell me anything you do recall about it?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don’t remember! It’s…somethin’ with my face. A lift, maybe? Or…tightenin’? Some young man was talkin’ fast about makin’ me look…younger. I handle towers, you see. Radio stuff. Cellular. It’s…complicated. And I ain’t got the memory I used to. Just need the paper signed, Doc. Is that so hard? I don't have time for a whole life story.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop, and I apologize if I’m taking up your time. However, signing a form for a procedure without understanding its specifics would be irresponsible on my part, and potentially unsafe for you. Even with cosmetic procedures, there are risks and considerations. To help me assess the situation, perhaps we can start with a few basic questions. Do you recall the name of the individual who discussed this procedure with you, or the name of the facility where it would be performed?
PATIENT: Facility? Goodness gracious. No, I don’t. It was…a strip mall, I think. Near the donut shop. A small place. Fancy name, I suppose, but I don’t recall it. The man…tall fella. Slicked-back hair. Salesman type. He talked about…results. That's all I remember, really. Look, I’m a practical man. I fix things. Towers, radios, you name it. I don’t need a whole interrogation about a little…touch-up. Just sign the paper, Doc. Is there a fee for this consultation?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Honcoop. The lack of specific details concerning the procedure and the practitioner is concerning. Performing a procedure at an unknown facility, with an unnamed individual, carries significant risks. Before we proceed further, I need to understand your current health status. Could you please tell me about any medical conditions you have, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Oh, heavens. I'm 64 years old, Doc. What don't I have? A little arthritis, maybe. Back acts up sometimes from climbin’ those towers. But nothin' serious. Never been a sickly man. I work hard, that's all. I told you, I fix things. I don’t sit around coddlin’ myself. Look, are you gonna sign the paper or not? I got a schedule to keep. And frankly, I’m beginnin’ to feel a little…insulted by all these questions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, however, dismissing potential health concerns is not advisable. Even seemingly minor conditions can impact the safety and outcome of a procedure. I am obligated to ensure your well-being, and I cannot ethically sign a form without a reasonable understanding of your medical history. Let's try a different approach. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Medications? Doc, you think I’m some kinda…invalid? I take a multi-vitamin, maybe. Every now and then. When I remember. That’s it. And honestly, I’m beginnin’ to wonder if I shouldn't just find another doctor. One who understands that I’m a busy man and doesn’t need a full examination for a simple…cosmetic touch-up. This is ridiculous. You’re wastin’ my time, and frankly, it's unprofessional. I need that paper signed today.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but it’s my professional responsibility to prioritize your safety. Based on what you've told me—or, rather, haven't told me—regarding the procedure and your health, I am unable to sign the form at this time. Given the lack of information and your reluctance to provide details, I strongly recommend you consult with a specialist—a board-certified plastic surgeon—who can thoroughly assess your situation and determine if the procedure is appropriate for you. I can provide you with a referral, if you wish. Furthermore, I would like to note that proceeding with an unknown procedure at an unverified facility carries significant risks, and I would strongly advise against it. Do you have any questions about obtaining a referral to a qualified plastic surgeon?
PATIENT: A referral? Are you serious? I came here for a simple signature, and you’re tryin’ to send me to some fancy-pants surgeon? This is…unbelievable. I don’t need a surgeon, I need a doctor who understands common sense. You're clearly not that doctor. Forget it. Forget the referral, forget the questions, forget everything. I'm leavin'. And frankly, I think I'll be findin' another general practitioner as well. This has been a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Honcoop. I understand your decision. However, I must reiterate my concerns regarding proceeding with an unknown procedure without proper assessment and verification. Please, be cautious, and prioritize your health and safety. I wish you well.
