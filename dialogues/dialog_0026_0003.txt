DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome. My name is Dr. Latisia Finco. It's nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, don’t expect a long story. It’s this…shaking. Hands mostly. Been happenin’ for…a while now, I guess. Honestly, I just want somethin’ to stop it. It’s embarrassing, ya know? Makes it hard to…well, never mind. Just fix it, alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Baide. I understand. It’s certainly frustrating when something interferes with your daily life like that. We'll do our best to figure out what’s going on. So, the shaking…you said your hands mostly?
PATIENT: Yeah, hands. Though sometimes I feel it in my leg, just a little twitch. Not as bad. It’s mostly when I’m tryin’ to…do somethin’. Like holdin’ a glass, or…well, it doesn’t matter what. Just happens. And it’s gotten worse recently, I think. Or maybe I just noticed it more. Honestly, I don't pay attention to these things.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like it's more noticeable when you’re actively using your hands, and it’s been gradually increasing. That's helpful to know. Now, to get a better understanding, could you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What am I supposed to say? It…shakes. Like this. It's not like I'm havin' a full-blown earthquake, ya know? Just…unsteady. Annoyin’. And it’s worse when I’m stressed, I suppose. Though everything stresses me out these days. Look, is there a pill for this? I don’t have time for a lot of tests and questions. I used to be a producer, important stuff, and I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mr. Baide. It sounds like a tremor, and you’re right to ask about options to help. It’s good you mention stress makes it worse – that gives us a clue. Before we jump to medications, though, it’s important to get a clearer picture of what might be causing it, so we can choose the best approach. Could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly? I've lived a long life. Seen a lot, done a lot. Doctors… I've had doctors. Can't remember all of 'em, or what they said. I had a good doctor once, years ago, but he…well, he retired. And my wife…she took care of all the paperwork. I'm a bit lost without her, to be honest. I got the usual aches and pains for an old man, but nothin' serious. No major surgeries. And I'm on Medicare, if that matters. Is this gonna take much longer?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember everything. We can work with what you do recall. Medicare is helpful information, thank you. It sounds like you haven’t had any major surgeries or serious illnesses, which is good. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? No, I don’t bother with that nonsense. I take somethin’ for…blood pressure, I think? A little white pill. And somethin’ for my arthritis, sometimes, when it flares up. But that’s it. Honestly, I try to take as little as possible. I don't trust those pharmaceuticals. They just wanna keep you sick so they can sell you more pills. My wife used to manage all of it, and I really don't keep track. Are we gettin’ anywhere with this? It feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation with medications, Mr. Baide. We’ll certainly discuss all options and ensure you’re comfortable with any treatment plan. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? My mother…lived to be a good age, I think. Had a lot of kids. And my father…he was a strong man, worked hard. I had a brother, I think. He…went to America. Never really kept in touch. I don’t know nothin’ about any diseases they had. Honestly, we didn’t talk about that sort of thing. Is this important? It feels like you're fishin’ for somethin’ here. Just tell me if there's a pill to stop the shakin’, alright?
DOCTOR: It's alright if you don't have a lot of details, Mr. Baide. Sometimes family history isn’t readily available. We’ll move on. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What’s there to tell ya? I used to be busy, important meetings, travelin' all over. Now…I mostly sit around. Watch TV. Read the paper. I don’t do much exercisin’, if that's what you’re askin’. And I used to drink a little wine with dinner, but not so much anymore. It's a boring life, to be honest. And I don't need a lecture about it. I just want this shakin’ to stop. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Mr. Baide. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think... No, not really. Sometimes I feel a bit…tired. But that’s just bein’ old, I suppose. And my memory isn’t what it used to be. But you already know that, don't ya? I haven't got any fancy symptoms, alright? Just the shakin’. It's the shakin’ that’s botherin' me. It makes me look weak. And I hate lookin' weak.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. You're primarily concerned with the shaking and feeling weak. It’s good to know what’s bothering you most. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
