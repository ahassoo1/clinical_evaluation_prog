DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. Even though I’m using the machine every night, like I’m supposed to. It’s just… I still feel tired during the day. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. I used to take a nice afternoon nap, but even that doesn’t seem to help much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Daytime sleepiness, despite consistent CPAP use. And the naps aren't providing the usual relief. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of this. First, how long have you been experiencing this increased daytime sleepiness despite using the machine?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… oh, probably about three months now, maybe a little longer. At first, I thought it was just a bad spell, you know? But it hasn’t really gone away. I started noticing it more when the weather got warmer, if that makes any sense. Not sure if it does, but that’s when it really started bothering me.
DOCTOR: Three months, worsening with warmer weather… interesting. Okay, and when you say “using the machine,” can you tell me roughly how many hours per night are you actually having it on?
PATIENT: Oh, almost every night, Doctor. I try not to miss a night. I usually have it on for… well, I’d say about seven, maybe eight hours. Sometimes a little less if I have to get up for something, but I always put it back on as soon as I can. I check the little screen on it every morning, and it usually says six and a half hours at the very least. I make sure it’s sealed tight too, I’ve had to adjust the mask a few times to get a good fit.
DOCTOR: So, consistently six to eight hours of use, ensuring a proper mask seal. That’s good. And do you feel like the machine is effective while you’re using it?
PATIENT: Well… that's a good question. I feel like it is. I don’t wake up gasping for air anymore, like I used to before I got the machine. And my wife – well, my ex-wife, now – she always said I snored terribly, and she hasn’t complained about that in ages. So, I guess it’s doing something. But it’s not giving me the energy I used to have, you know? I still feel… sluggish, even after a full night's sleep. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Paske. It’s helpful to know it’s addressing the snoring and apnea symptoms, but not fully resolving the fatigue. Let's review some other things that could be contributing. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. I’ve put on a few pounds this year, I’m afraid. Not a lot, but enough to notice in my clothes. It's been hard to get out and walk as much with this tiredness, and… well, I enjoy my food. I'm around 92 kilograms now, I think. The doctor told me a while back I was a little heavier than I should be, but not dangerously so.
DOCTOR: Ninety-two kilograms… and a recent weight gain. Alright. And besides the weight gain and the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. I’ve been a bit more irritable, I suppose. My daughter says I’m less patient than I used to be. And I've noticed I’m a little… forgetful, maybe? Nothing major, just little things. Like where I put my keys, or what I was going to say mid-sentence. But that could just be old age, I suppose. I am 83, after all.
DOCTOR: Increased irritability, some forgetfulness… We’ll keep those in mind. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have a little bit of high blood pressure, nothing too bad. The doctor has me on a small pill for that, I take it every morning. And my knees are a bit creaky, arthritis, you know? It flares up sometimes, especially in cold weather. Oh, and I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered from that fully. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I’ve always been lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and arthritis in the knees. History of pneumonia, but fully recovered. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Let me see... no, not really. Just the blood pressure pill. Sometimes I take a little something for my knees when they’re really bothering me, an over-the-counter pain reliever, ibuprofen, I think it is. But that’s it, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Paske. I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. This will just help me get a more complete picture of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm used to doctor's visits, unfortunately. Hopefully we can figure out what's causing all this tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Okay. Your thyroid feels normal to palpation. Everything seems relatively stable on physical exam, though your blood pressure is a bit higher than ideal. Do you know what your typical blood pressure readings are at home, if you check it?
PATIENT: You know, that's a good question. My daughter has a machine at home, she checks hers all the time. I've used it a few times when she’s not looking, and it's usually around the same, maybe a little lower sometimes. I don’t check it regularly, though. I just assumed it was okay as long as I was taking the pill. I should probably be more diligent about that, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, so consistently elevated blood pressure, even at home. And we've got the daytime sleepiness despite CPAP, weight gain, irritability, forgetfulness, and a history of pneumonia. Given everything you’ve told me, it’s possible your sleepiness is multifactorial. The weight gain can contribute to sleep apnea, and the elevated blood pressure could be playing a role as well. I want to order a few blood tests to rule out any underlying causes for the fatigue – a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. Also, let’s get a repeat sleep study to assess your CPAP settings and ensure it's still optimized. Do you have any objections to those tests?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Sounds sensible to me. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to get those tests done. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? A repeat sleep study… that sounds a bit uncomfortable, but if it helps, I’m willing. When can I get these tests done?
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. I'll write you a referral for the blood tests and the sleep study. You can schedule those at your convenience. The lab is just down the hall, and the sleep study center is located at St. Jude’s Hospital. Here are the referrals. I also want you to continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. And I recommend starting a gentle exercise program, if you're able, and focusing on a healthy diet. Even small changes can make a difference. I’ll review the results as soon as they're available and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That all sounds very thorough. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I appreciate your help. I'll go ahead and schedule those tests now, and I'll try to get started on some walking. It's just hard when you're so tired all the time. But I'll do my best. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. You’re very welcome. Remember, small steps are key. Don’t push yourself too hard. We’ll figure this out. If anything changes or worsens before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Have a good day.
