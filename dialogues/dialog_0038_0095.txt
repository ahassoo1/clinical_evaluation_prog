DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get on with it. I woke up yesterday and…well, I can’t hear out of my left ear. And my face…it feels sort of droopy on that side. It’s quite alarming, really. Not that you’d understand, seeing as you're…young.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping… that is concerning, and you're right to come in right away. It's good you did. “Not a lot of time” is fine, we’ll be efficient, but I need to ask a few questions to get a better understanding of what’s going on. First, when you say you woke up yesterday, was the hearing loss sudden – like, completely gone all at once?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. One moment I was… perfectly fine, the next…nothing. Like someone flipped a switch. It wasn’t gradual, it wasn’t muffled – gone. I tried everything, you know? Blowing my nose, shaking my head… utterly useless. Honestly, it’s quite inconvenient. I have… responsibilities.
DOCTOR: Okay, sudden onset is definitely important information. And you noticed the facial drooping at the same time as the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Yes. Practically simultaneously. I was brushing my teeth and… well, that’s when I noticed it. My mouth just… wouldn’t cooperate on the left side. And now it feels… weak. Like I’m trying to smile, but it’s just… off. It’s quite distressing, actually. I expect you’ve seen this before though, haven't you? It can’t be that unusual.
DOCTOR: Yes, I have seen cases like this before. It sounds like we need to rule out a few things. It’s good you noticed it right away. Let's take a look. I see here your height and weight, and that you're currently uninsured. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Uninsured is hardly a selling point, doctor. Allergies? No. None that I’m aware of. I eat everything. I travel extensively. If I had allergies, I’d know about it, wouldn’t I? Honestly, I don’t have time for these basic questions. Is this going to take long? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and I apologize if these questions seem basic. It's just standard procedure to make sure I have a complete picture of your health. It helps me ensure I'm making the best decisions for your care. Right, no known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I don’t need medication. I eat well, I exercise… I certainly don’t rely on pills for every little ailment. I find that preventative care is far more effective. And frankly, I’m a bit insulted you’d even ask. Now, can we please get to the reason I’m here? My ear, doctor. My face.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. I apologize again. It's not my intention to insult you. I just need to cover all the bases. No medications. Right, let’s take a look at your ear. This will just take a moment. Could you please sit forward a bit?
PATIENT: Just get on with it. Honestly. This is rather… undignified. I’ve seen better examination rooms, I must say. And please, be gentle. I don’t appreciate having things poked around in my ear.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m seeing some… decreased movement on the left side of your face. Your left ear canal appears clear, but there's some… slight drooping of the corner of your mouth. When I ask you to smile, it doesn't lift as much on the left side. And closing your eyes… there’s a little difficulty with complete closure on that side as well. I’m concerned about possible Bell's palsy. It’s a condition that causes sudden weakness in the facial muscles. Though, we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any past medical history I should be aware of – like a stroke, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological conditions? Good heavens, no. I am a radiologist! I diagnose those things, I don’t have them. Stroke? Absolutely not. I keep myself in excellent health, as I’ve already stated. I’ve never had any serious illnesses. I’ve had the occasional cold, naturally, but nothing that required medical intervention. Really, doctor, this is quite frustrating. You're asking me about things a person would know if they had them! Is this Bell’s Palsy… serious? Can it be fixed? And quickly, if you please. I have a very important engagement this evening.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. Bell's palsy isn't usually life-threatening, but it can be concerning and disruptive. In many cases, it resolves on its own within a few weeks or months, but sometimes it doesn't fully recover. To be certain it’s Bell’s Palsy and rule out other, more serious causes—like a stroke or tumor—I would ideally recommend an MRI scan of your brain. However, given your current situation, and the fact that we're seeing a classic presentation, we could begin treatment with a course of corticosteroids – Prednisone – and an antiviral medication, like Valacyclovir. The sooner we start, the better the chances of a full recovery. But without an MRI, there is a small risk we could be overlooking something else. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: MRI? That sounds expensive. And time-consuming. I haven’t got time for “tests.” If this Bell’s Palsy is the most likely culprit, and this medication has a good chance of fixing it… then let’s proceed with that. Quickly. I do not have the luxury of waiting around for definitive diagnoses. I have patients of my own who require my attention. Frankly, doctor, I expect you to be efficient. Are these medications widely available? And how quickly can I expect to see results? I’m simply not one for prolonged suffering.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. We can proceed with the Prednisone and Valacyclovir. I will write you a prescription for both. Prednisone is a steroid, so it's important to take it exactly as prescribed and complete the full course, even if you start feeling better. It can have some side effects, like mood changes and difficulty sleeping, but these are usually temporary. Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication and is generally well-tolerated. It's difficult to say exactly how quickly you'll see results. Some people start to improve within a few days, others take a week or two. The sooner you start the medication, the better. I would like to see you back in one week to assess your progress. Here are your prescriptions. I’m also going to give you a handout with more information about Bell’s Palsy and what to expect. If your symptoms worsen at any time – if you experience severe pain, difficulty breathing, or changes in your vision – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Good heavens. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Yes, I understand. I am a doctor, after all, I'm hardly ignorant of emergency protocols. Look, I appreciate you… expediting this process. I really must be going. I have a very important appointment. Thank you for your time, doctor. And please, no further unnecessary questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re very welcome, Stephane. I hope you recover quickly. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. .
