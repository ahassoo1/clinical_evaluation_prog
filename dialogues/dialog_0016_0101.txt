DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start us off, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Popova is fine, everyone calls me Popova. Well, it's this headache I've been having. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been botherin' me for a little bit now. Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Popova, good to meet you too. A headache at the back of the head, coming and going… alright. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like a throbbing pain, more of a dull ache, really. Sometimes it feels like pressure, like somethin’s tight back there. It usually starts in the afternoon, after I've been on my feet all day at the salon. I do a lot of filing, you know, with the nails. And painting. Lots of bendin’ over too. It don't usually last too long, maybe an hour or two. But it’s…persistent, if you know what I mean. It keeps comin' back.
DOCTOR: I do know what you mean—a recurring headache can be very frustrating. And filing and painting nails all day does sound physically demanding, bending over and focusing like that. So, it sounds like it’s worse in the afternoon, after activity…and it’s a dull ache or pressure, not a sharp throbbing?
PATIENT: Exactly! Not throbbing, definitely not. More like…someone’s sittin' on the back of my head, gently, but you still feel it. And it's not like it stops me from doin’ things, I can still work. But it’s there, naggin’ at me. It’s just…tiresome, really. Been happenin' for maybe three weeks now, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Three weeks… okay. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, layin' down helps. If I can just rest for a bit, close my eyes, it usually eases up. And a nice cup of chamomile tea, that seems to calm things down a bit too. But it always comes back, especially if I get busy at the salon. My wife, bless her heart, she rubs my neck sometimes, and that’s nice too, but it's only temporary relief.
DOCTOR: Alright, so rest, chamomile tea, and your wife's neck rubs provide some relief, but it's not a lasting fix. And it’s definitely linked to being busy at work. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this something new?
PATIENT: This is new, Doctor. Never really had headaches botherin' me like this before. I used to get the occasional tension headache, you know, if I was stressed, but nothin’ like this. This feels different. It's more… localized. Right at the base of my skull. And it don't really come on with stress, it's more… physical, if that makes sense. Like my muscles are tired.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Localized at the base of the skull, and feels more related to physical activity… okay. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it... sometimes my vision gets a little blurry after a particularly long day. Just a little bit, nothin’ drastic. And I've been feelin’ a bit tired lately, more tired than usual. But I’m 87, Doctor, so a bit of tiredness comes with the territory, you know? I don't know if that’s related or just…old age.
DOCTOR: That's a fair point. A little tiredness does come with age! But it's good you mentioned both the blurry vision and the fatigue. Just to be thorough, have you had any changes in your hearing, any numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, or any difficulty with your balance?
PATIENT: No, no changes to my hearing, thankfully. Balance is still good, steady as a rock. And no numbness or weakness in my arms or legs, no sir. I can still do a good job with the manicure tools, I assure you! Everything still workin’ as it should, just a bit slower, maybe.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Popova. A steady hand is essential for your work! Alright, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been under control with medication for a long time now. Doctor Ellis, he used to look after me, but he retired a while back. I'm still takin' the pills he prescribed, every mornin'. Other than that, not much. I've been lucky, really. Always been a healthy eater, lots of fruits and vegetables, thanks to my wife. No diabetes, no major illnesses. Just…the usual aches and pains of gettin' old.
DOCTOR: Alright, so managed hypertension, thanks to Dr. Ellis. And you've been taking medication for it consistently. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think... hmm. No major surgeries, not that I recall. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, back in Jamaica, but that was a long time ago. And I had a cataract removed from one eye about ten years ago. That went well, thankfully. Vision's still good in that eye, just a little bit weaker than the other one. But nothing else, no sir. No broken bones, no nothin’. Pretty lucky, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal long ago, and a cataract surgery ten years ago. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she lived a long life, but she had arthritis bad towards the end. And my father, he had heart trouble. It run in his family, I think. My wife’s mother, she had high blood pressure too, just like me. But other than that, not much I can recall. No history of brain problems or nothin’ like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and high blood pressure in your wife’s mother. And you said no history of neurological problems. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never been allergic to nothin’. I can eat whatever my wife puts in front of me, and I take my medication every day without any problems. No rashes, no swelling, no nothin’. Pretty good, eh?
DOCTOR: Very good. And just to be clear, you are currently taking medication for high blood pressure, prescribed by Dr. Ellis?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. One pill every morning, like clockwork. Been takin’ it for years now. Keeps things nice and stable, usually. Haven't had any trouble with it, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a quick check of your blood pressure, pulse, and a look in your ears and eyes, and I’ll do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Go ahead. I trust your judgement. Always been a believer in listenin’ to the doctors, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 140/85 on your right arm and 142/88 on your left. A little bit elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Now let me just take a quick look in your ears… Ears look clear, no sign of infection. And let's just check your vision quickly... Vision is slightly reduced in your left eye, as you mentioned, but generally good. Now, I’m going to check some of your reflexes… Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. And finally, I’ll just check your coordination… Coordination is good, no noticeable deficits. Everything seems generally normal on the neurological exam, Popova.
PATIENT: Well, that weren't too bad, Doctor. Thank you for takin' your time. So, what do you think it is? Just old age catchin' up with me, or somethin' more serious? I’m not worried, you know, but I like to know what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Well, Popova, everything seems generally okay, and your neurological exam was normal, which is very encouraging. However, given your headache, blurry vision, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I think we need to investigate a little further. It's unlikely to be "just old age," though it's certainly a factor! My primary concern is a possible tension headache, potentially exacerbated by your work and slightly elevated blood pressure. However, to rule out other causes, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to get a CBC to check for any underlying infection or anemia?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If it'll put my mind at ease, I’m happy to get whatever tests you think is necessary. A CBC, you say? No problem. What else were you thinkin’? I trust your judgement, remember.
DOCTOR: Excellent. In addition to the CBC, I’d like to order a Basic Metabolic Panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes. And, to rule out any issues with your thyroid, which can sometimes cause headaches, I'd like a TSH test. Finally, given your history of high blood pressure and the slightly elevated reading today, I’d like to have you wear a blood pressure monitor for 24 hours to get a more accurate picture of your blood pressure fluctuations throughout the day. Do these tests sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds very thorough. Wearin’ a monitor, gettin’ some blood work… no problem at all. A BMP and a TSH, you say? I’ll write it down so I don't forget. You know, my wife always tells me I forget things! So, when will I get these tests done? And how long will it take to get the results back?
DOCTOR: That's good, writing things down is always a smart idea. We can get the blood work done right here in the lab, first thing tomorrow morning. It usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back, and we’ll call you as soon as they’re available. I’ll also have the nurse fit you with a 24-hour blood pressure monitor before you leave today. You’ll wear it for a full 24 hours and then return it to the clinic tomorrow afternoon. In the meantime, continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. And try to get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That sounds like a good plan, Doctor. Plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and take my pills… I can manage that. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just one little thing… will these tests tell me if I need to worry about somethin’ serious? I’m not lookin’ for a scare, just want to know what’s goin’ on in this old head of mine.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly valid question, Popova. These tests are primarily to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your headache. Things like infection, kidney problems, or thyroid issues. If those tests come back normal, it's very likely that your headache is simply a tension headache, possibly aggravated by your work and slightly elevated blood pressure. However, if anything does show up on the tests, we’ll discuss it in detail and determine the best course of action. We’ll take things one step at a time. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if your headache gets significantly worse, you experience any new symptoms – like fever, weakness, or vision changes – or if you’re just feeling anxious or concerned. Now, the nurse will be in shortly to fit you with the blood pressure monitor and give you instructions on how to wear it. Do you have any other concerns before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything. Thank you for bein' so thorough and explainin' things so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease, and that’s worth a lot. I’ll get the monitor, get some rest, and take my pills. Tell the nurse thank you for me too. She’ll have to explain how to wear the thing, I’m not very good with gadgets!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Popova. I'm glad I could help. And don't worry about the monitor—the nurse is excellent at explaining things. I’ll see you tomorrow when you return it. Please let us know if anything changes before then. Have a good rest of your day, and take care. .
