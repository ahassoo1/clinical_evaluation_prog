DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi, so tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good day to you, Doctor… Burlingham, is it? It is… the words. They are… difficult. Not gone, you understand, but… they hide sometimes. Like trying to catch smoke. It makes talking… frustrating. I apologize if I seem… unclear.
DOCTOR: Right. "Difficult words," you say. Frustrating, yes, I can imagine. So, this isn't a new thing, then?
PATIENT: No, no. Not… sudden. It has been… a while now. Months, I think. Perhaps longer. Time… it moves, does it not? My wife… she noticed first, I believe. She… she would help me. But… well, she is gone now. It is harder to… remember exactly when it began, with everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it’s been progressing over time. Can you give me an example of what you mean by "hiding?
PATIENT: Yes, yes… an example. Hmm. It is… if I want to say… the thing one uses to cut the grass… it is not on the tip of my tongue. I know what it is. I can… picture it, even. But the word… it escapes me. Sometimes it comes back quickly, but other times… I have to… describe it. "The green machine," I might say. Or "the thing that makes the lawn short." It is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Right. So you're able to work around the words, but it's difficult to retrieve them directly. Do you find this happens more with certain kinds of words?
PATIENT: Certain kinds… hmm. That is a good question. I do not… I have not really thought about it. Perhaps… the common things? The everyday things? Like… furniture. Or… tools. The proper names… those are also difficult. People’s names. Even… my neighbor's name sometimes. It is… very annoying. It is not that I do not know them, it is simply… finding the correct sound.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the words, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My memory… is not what it once was, of course. But that could simply be my age, yes? And… sometimes I feel a little… tired. Not sick tired, but… worn. Like a machine that has been running for a long time. I do not… stumble or fall, or have headaches, or anything like that. I am… mostly just tired and… frustrated with the words.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, fatigue and memory issues are common at your age, as you say. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. The medical history. I… I have seen many doctors over the years. I had… the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, for a time. They gave me pills for that. And… a problem with my heart, a long time ago. They put in a… a little wire, to help it. And… I had the flu, several times, of course. Nothing serious, I do not think. My wife… she kept track of all of that. It is… difficult for me to remember the details.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll need to get those details clarified. Let me pull up your records here… Ah, yes. It says here you were diagnosed with hypertension in 2010, treated with lisinopril. And a coronary artery stent placed in 2015. Are you still taking those medications?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. The pills. I… I believe so. I take a small white pill every morning. And a yellow one. But… sometimes I forget. My wife… she would remind me. Now, I try to remember. But… sometimes I take two, sometimes none. It is… difficult to keep track.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, inconsistent medication dosing can certainly cause problems. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I do not… I do not believe so. I have taken many medications over the years, and… nothing has caused a rash, or… difficulty breathing. Perhaps… a little stomach upset sometimes, but nothing serious. My wife… she always asked me that question. I do not think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we move on, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. It won't be anything unpleasant.
PATIENT: A physical exam? Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I… I trust your judgment. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief neurological assessment. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Deep breath… in… and out… Is that… alright? I do not… I do not know much about these things.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated at 88. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Alright, now I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arm... and let it just hang. Good. Now the other side. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Now, just a quick neurological assessment. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t move your head.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Follow your finger… There… there it goes… and now… that way… Is that… alright? I hope I am not… making a mess of it.
DOCTOR: Eye movements are full and intact bilaterally. No nystagmus noted. Alright. Everything appears normal so far. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing age-related cognitive decline, possibly with some contribution from inconsistent medication adherence. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels, vitamin B12, and a complete metabolic panel. I also want to schedule an MRI of your brain to get a better look at what's going on.
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood work? Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. It is… a little overwhelming, I must admit. But I want to… understand what is happening. Will the MRI… will it hurt? And the blood work… will it take long? I do not… I do not like needles, you understand.
DOCTOR: The MRI won't hurt at all. You'll just lie inside a machine while it takes pictures. It’s a little noisy, but you can close your eyes and relax. As for the blood work, it will only take a few minutes, and yes, there will be a needle, but it's quick. We'll get it done here in the clinic. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work, and we’ll schedule the MRI for next week. I’ll also have my nurse give you a list of things to avoid before the MRI, like metal objects. In the meantime, please try to be consistent with your medications, even if you have to set an alarm to remind you. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Yes, perhaps. What… what if the MRI shows something… bad? And… what if it doesn’t show anything? Will we still… know what is happening? And… is there anything I can do… to help my memory, while we wait? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Well, if the MRI shows something, we'll discuss the findings and come up with a treatment plan. It doesn't necessarily mean it's "bad," it just means we have more information. And if it doesn't show anything, that's helpful too – it means we can rule out certain causes and focus on other possibilities. As for your memory, there are a few things you can try. Stay mentally active – do puzzles, read, write. Regular exercise is important, and a healthy diet. And try to get enough sleep. But honestly, Mr. Gyamfi, it’s likely just age-related changes. We'll know more once we have the results of the tests. I’m not going to promise miracles, but we’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that is… all. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… very patient. I will… I will try to remember everything you said. And I will… I will schedule the MRI. Thank you again.
