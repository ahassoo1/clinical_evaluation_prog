DOCTOR: Hi Venna, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Just call me Venna, please. It's my blood pressure, I reckon. Been a little high lately, the nurse told me when I had my check-up at the senior center. She said I ought to get it looked at proper. Don't bother me too much, usually, but she was worried enough to send me over here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna, that's perfectly fine. Blood pressure's good to check out, definitely. And it's good you came in when the nurse suggested it. So, when did the nurse first mention it being a bit high?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was… oh, maybe a month or so ago now? July, I believe. I go to the center every Tuesday for the luncheon, and they do checks then. It wasn't terribly high, but she said to keep an eye on it and come see a doctor if it didn't settle down. It hasn't, so here I am. I don't remember the exact number, if that matters. Old age, you know!
DOCTOR: Yes, a month ago… alright. And you said it hasn’t really settled down since then?
PATIENT: No, sir. Seems to be about the same, maybe a tad higher some days. I try to rest when I feel a bit… funny, you know? A little lightheaded. But it still worries me. I don’t want to end up like my sister, always in and out of the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Venna. It's good you're paying attention to these things. Feeling lightheaded is definitely something we want to look into. Just to get a better picture, have you been noticing the lightheadedness at any particular time of day, or after doing anything specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really a particular time. Seems to happen when I'm busy, mostly. Like when I'm bakin', or tryin’ to get things done around the house. I run a small bakery, you see, mostly pies and cakes for the locals. Keeps me busy, but sometimes I get to rushin' and then… whoosh. Just a little dizzy spell. Doesn't last long, usually. But it's enough to make me stop and sit down.
DOCTOR: So, it seems to be connected to activity, that’s helpful. And you’ve been bakin’… how long have you been running the bakery, Venna?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. My husband and I started it about… fifty years ago, I reckon. He passed away ten years back, and I've been keepin’ it goin’ ever since. It's hard work, but I enjoy it. Folks depend on my pies, you know? Keeps me young, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Venna. It sounds like a real labor of love. Fifty years… that’s quite a legacy. Alright, let’s get a better read on your blood pressure now, and then we can do a quick listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a full picture. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just get it over with, I want to get back to my bakin’ as soon as I can! Not that I'm in a hurry or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm for me, Venna. It’ll only take a moment. Okay, your blood pressure is… 158 over 92. That is a bit elevated, as the nurse mentioned. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just take some nice, deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Alright, deep breaths… It's a little hard to breathe sometimes, since the weather got so hot, but I ain't been to the doctor about it. Just thought it was my age, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I do hear a little bit of wheezing. That could explain the slight difficulty breathing, especially with the heat. It's good you mentioned that. Lungs sound a little congested as well. Now, just to be thorough, I'm going to check your reflexes and maybe take a look in your ears. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Do whatever you need to do. I just want to know what's goin’ on, and how to get back to bakin' pies! I ain't been feelin' my best lately, but I figured it was just old age catchin' up with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a look. Ears look clear, thankfully. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Okay, Venna. Based on what we’ve talked about and the exam, it sounds like we're dealing with a few things. Your blood pressure is definitely elevated, and the slight wheezing and congestion in your lungs could be related to some mild asthma or COPD, especially with the heat and humidity. The feeling of lightheadedness could be a combination of the blood pressure and potentially some mild dehydration. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Asthma… COPD… I never been told I had asthma. My husband… he had trouble breathin’ sometimes, but I never thought… I just thought I was gettin' old! Dehydration, though… that makes sense. I do forget to drink enough water sometimes, with all the bakin'. So, what does that mean? What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: It's common for these things to develop gradually, especially if you've never had any prior diagnoses. So, here’s what I recommend. First, we need to get a better look at those lungs. I’d like to order a chest X-ray, just to rule out anything serious and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Also, I want to do a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying issues. As for the blood pressure, I want to start you on a low dose of a medication called Lisinopril. It's a common blood pressure medication that should help bring those numbers down. And, very importantly, we need to focus on hydration. Aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: X-ray… blood test… medication… That sounds like a lot, Doctor. I suppose it’s better to know what’s goin’ on, though. Eight glasses of water… I can manage that. I got a nice big pitcher in the kitchen. And the medication… is it hard to take? Will it make me feel sick? I got pies to bake, you know!
DOCTOR: I understand it feels like a lot, Venna, but we’re just being thorough. Lisinopril is generally very well-tolerated. Some people experience a mild cough, but it's usually not severe. We'll start with a low dose and see how you do. If you experience any side effects, we can always adjust or change the medication. As for the X-ray and blood test, I'll give you a referral to the lab down the street. They're very efficient. And don’t worry about the pies! We’re going to get you feeling better so you can get back to bakin' in no time. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and see how you’re doing. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds alright. So, I just go to the lab, and then come back here in two weeks? Is there anything I need to do before I go to the lab? Like, should I stop takin' any of my vitamins, or… I try to keep track, but I ain’t as sharp as I used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s right, just go to the lab, and we’ll see you in two weeks. As for vitamins, it's best to hold off on any vitamins or supplements for 24 hours before the blood test, as they can sometimes interfere with the results. And please, bring a list of all your medications, including any over-the-counter pills or creams you might be using. It’s okay if you don’t have it ready now, just bring it to the follow-up appointment. Here’s the referral for the lab. They're at 123 Main Street. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: 123 Main Street… yes, I know where that is. No, I don't think so, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I’m still a little worried, but I trust you. Thank you for takin' the time to listen to me. I appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I best get home and start drinkin’ some water! And maybe bake a pie... to calm my nerves.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venna. It was my pleasure. And a pie sounds like an excellent idea! Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get you feeling back to your best in no time. Have a good day, Venna.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
