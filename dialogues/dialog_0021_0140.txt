DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s… unpleasant. A bit embarrassing, frankly. I don't usually bother doctors with… this. It’s in my mouth. A white coating. I assumed it would just… go away on its own.
DOCTOR: A white coating, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… milk curdled, but inside my mouth. And it makes it difficult to eat. Especially anything… flavorful. It’s quite bothersome, and my wife insisted I come. She’s rather dramatic, you see. Honestly, I doubt it’s anything serious. Probably just something I ate.
DOCTOR: Wives. Always worrying. Alright. So, this coating… is it everywhere in your mouth?
PATIENT: No, no, not everywhere. Good heavens, no. Mostly on the tongue. And… the back of my throat, a little. It’s not… widespread. I maintain a reasonable level of hygiene, you know. It’s simply… a patch. A bothersome patch. I really don't have time for this, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this “patch” been bothering you, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… a week, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. It started subtly, and I ignored it. I assumed it was… temporary. As I said, I don't usually find it necessary to consult a physician over minor inconveniences. It’s just… not a good use of my time.
DOCTOR: And has anything made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Not that I’ve noticed. I haven’t tried anything, specifically. I simply… continue my normal routine. Eating, drinking… though I’ve been avoiding particularly spicy foods, naturally. Doesn't seem to affect it either way. Really, it’s quite perplexing. I suspect it’s stress, perhaps. My business has been… demanding lately. Though a bit of white coating hardly warrants a doctor’s visit.
DOCTOR: Well, let’s have a look then, shall we?
PATIENT: Must you? It’s… rather close quarters. I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. But please, be quick about it. I have appointments to attend to.
DOCTOR: Open wide, Mr. Schieber. And try to relax. Hmm. Yes… there is a white coating on your tongue, as you described. It’s… somewhat patchy, and extends a bit onto the back of your throat. Doesn’t appear to be any open sores or bleeding, which is… good. It does look a bit inflamed, though. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or difficulty swallowing besides the discomfort with flavorful foods?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. A slight annoyance, that’s all. As for fever… preposterous. I’m a robust individual. And difficulty swallowing? No. Simply a… reduced enjoyment of certain cuisines. Honestly, this is all rather unnecessary. I assure you, I’m not on my deathbed. Perhaps a strong mouthwash is all I require.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any recent changes in your diet, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet? No! Why on earth would I change my diet? I have… established preferences. I enjoy a balanced… a refined palate. This has nothing to do with my dietary choices, I assure you. It’s… it's a temporary ailment, I’m certain. A fleeting inconvenience. I simply hoped for a quick diagnosis and a swift return to my schedule.
DOCTOR: Well, based on what you've told me, it could be a simple case of oral thrush, or a mild fungal infection. But it's also possible it’s a form of geographic tongue, or even just irritation. I'd like to be certain. Have you ever had a scraping done in your mouth before?
PATIENT: A scraping? Are you suggesting you intend to scrape something from my mouth? Absolutely not. That sounds… barbaric. I have never had anything scraped from my mouth, and I have no intention of starting now. This is becoming quite unreasonable. Honestly, I’m beginning to question the necessity of this entire consultation. Perhaps I should seek a second opinion.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No scraping. But to rule out anything more serious, I'm going to order some blood work. Just a standard complete blood count. It will help me determine if there is an underlying issue. And I'm going to recommend a prescription for an antifungal mouthwash. Use it twice daily for a week. If it doesn’t improve, then we’ll talk about more invasive tests. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… fine. Though I fail to see the necessity. And an antifungal mouthwash… very well. But I expect a swift improvement. And if it doesn’t work, I'm not subjecting myself to any… "invasive tests." I have a business to run, you see. This is all incredibly inconvenient. Just… write the prescription, please. And tell me where to go for this blood work.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The prescription is for nystatin oral suspension. Rinse with it twice daily after meals for seven days. And here’s the lab order for Quest Diagnostics. There are several locations nearby. If it doesn’t improve after a week, then contact my office and we’ll discuss further options. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. This… suffice it to say, I hope this resolves the matter quickly. I have a reputation to maintain, and I do not have time for lingering ailments. Thank you… I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Mr. Schieber. And try to relax.
