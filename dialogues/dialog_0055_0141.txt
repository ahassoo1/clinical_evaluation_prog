DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I am Dr. Eaddy. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Brendan. It's… well, it's this itching. Everywhere, really. Been going on for a couple weeks now, and it's driving me a bit mad. Not terrible, but constant. It’s just… irritating.
DOCTOR: "Irritating," yes. I understand. Itching, you say, for approximately two weeks, and it's generalized...all over your body?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Arms, legs, back… even my scalp. It doesn’t look like anything, Doctor, which is what’s so frustrating. No rash, no bumps, nothing. Just…itch. Sometimes worse at night, maybe? Hard to say, honestly. I sleep pretty soundly, usually.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No visible skin changes. And the itching is intermittent, perhaps more pronounced nocturnally... though you don't always notice. We must rule out several possibilities, of course. Have you recently started any new laundry detergents, soaps, lotions—anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, nothing new recently. I've been using the same stuff for… oh, years, probably. I stick with what works, you know? Old man habits, I guess. It's not a new fabric softener or anything like that, though. I’ve always been pretty careful about allergies, too. My wife… well, she had a lot of them, so I learned to read labels.
DOCTOR: “Careful,” you say. Very good. And are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: Just Medicare stuff, Doctor. For blood pressure, mostly. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a little Vitamin D in the winter, that's it. Nothing new started around the time the itching did, I don’t think. I take everything pretty regularly. My routine is…well, it's how I keep things together these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the Lisinopril and a seasonal Vitamin D supplement. Quite sensible. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the itching, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: No, not really. That's what's so weird about it. No fever, no fatigue, no weight loss… appetite’s normal. I sleep alright. It just…is. Drives my wife crazy when I start worrying about things that don’t have obvious causes, she used to say.
DOCTOR: "Obvious causes," yes. Indeed. Well, Mr. Ferneding, given your history and the absence of accompanying symptoms, it is difficult to pinpoint the source at this juncture. Let’s perform a quick physical examination to further assess your condition. We'll start with a visual inspection of your skin, then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your lymph nodes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Honestly, I just want to get some relief. It's not…agonizing, but it's enough to keep me up at night sometimes, thinking about what it could be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. Your skin appears unremarkable; no rash, excoriations, or other lesions are present. Auscultation of your heart and lungs reveals normal sounds. Palpation of your lymph nodes is within normal limits; no palpable enlargement or tenderness detected.
PATIENT: Good. Glad to hear it’s nothing obvious. My wife always said I was a worrier. She was probably right. So… what now, Doctor? Is it something serious? Or just… one of those things?
DOCTOR: “One of those things” is, unfortunately, a possibility, Mr. Ferneding. However, we cannot dismiss other potential causes without further investigation. Given the persistence of the itching and the absence of clear etiology, I would like to order some routine blood work. This will include a complete blood count, liver function tests, thyroid stimulating hormone, and a basic metabolic panel. These tests will help rule out underlying medical conditions that can sometimes manifest as pruritus – that is, itching. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. Blood work is fine. Anything to get to the bottom of it. I just… I don't want it to be something awful. My wife… well, she spent a lot of time in hospitals. I’d rather not repeat that. But if you think it’s needed, do it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ferneding. These tests are largely precautionary, and frequently reveal no significant abnormalities. We'll obtain the samples here in the clinic. I’ll also provide a topical corticosteroid cream – a mild potency one – to help alleviate the itching in the interim. Apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice daily. Once the results are available – typically within 3-5 business days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if the itching becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms—fever, weight loss, fatigue—please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything, Doctor. Blood work, cream for the itching, and a follow-up appointment. Sounds like a plan. Thank you. Honestly, just having someone look at it and say there's a plan makes me feel a bit better.
DOCTOR: You are welcome, Mr. Ferneding. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood samples. We'll contact you when the results are available to schedule your follow-up. Do try to get some rest, and utilize the topical cream as directed. And please, do not hesitate to contact the clinic if your condition changes in any way.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will. Thank you again. You have a good day.
