DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I haven’t been feeling myself lately. Just… down. I suppose that’s the best way to put it. I’d like to get this sorted, if I may. I don’t have time for… lingering.
DOCTOR: "Down," alright. That’s a good place to start. It’s good you’re getting it checked out – and I understand wanting to get to the bottom of things quickly. Can you tell me a little more about what “not feeling yourself” means?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s hard to say exactly. I just… don’t enjoy things anymore. Things I used to love. My work, for instance. I’ve been a lifeguard, ski patrol… various things, keeping people safe, for a long time. But lately, even that feels like a chore. And I sleep a lot. More than usual. And then I’m still tired. It’s… frustrating. I apologize for being vague. It’s all a bit of a muddle in my head.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Nani. It sounds like a muddle, and it’s perfectly alright to take your time figuring things out. Losing interest in things you used to enjoy and feeling tired… that's important information. So, this has been going on for a while now?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. I suppose… maybe six months or so? It started gradually. Just a little less enthusiasm here, a little more exhaustion there. I thought it was just… getting older, truthfully. You know, the body wears down. But it hasn't gotten better. It's just… continued. And now it’s starting to interfere with things. With my work. With seeing my friends. I didn't want to bother you with it, but… well, here I am.
DOCTOR: Six months… alright. And it’s good you came in. It's certainly worth looking into, even if it is just age. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight during this time?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I don't feel hungry at all. And other days I eat… too much, perhaps. Comfort eating, I suppose. And yes, I believe I’ve gained a little weight. Not a significant amount, but enough to notice in my uniform. I haven’t weighed myself recently, to be honest. It’s… not something I enjoy doing.
DOCTOR: Alright, fluctuating appetite and some weight gain. Thank you. Now, let’s talk a little about your sleep. You said you're sleeping more, but still tired. Are you having trouble falling asleep?
PATIENT: No, not particularly trouble falling asleep. I'm usually quite tired by the evening, so I drift off easily enough. The problem is… I don’t stay asleep. I wake up several times during the night. And then I have trouble getting back to sleep. It's not every night, but it’s frequent enough to be disruptive. And even when I do sleep for a long time, I wake up feeling… unrested. Like I haven't slept at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, so falling asleep isn’t the issue, it’s maintaining sleep and feeling unrefreshed afterwards. Okay. Now, this might be a bit personal, but have you noticed any changes in your mood besides just a lack of enjoyment?
PATIENT: Yes. Well, I wouldn’t say I’m… sad, exactly. More… irritable, perhaps? Easily frustrated. And I find myself worrying more. About… everything, really. Small things, large things. It's exhausting. My daughter keeps telling me I need to relax, but… it's difficult. I apologize if this is… tedious.
DOCTOR: Not tedious at all, Nani. This is all very helpful. Irritability and increased worry are important pieces of the puzzle. Have you experienced any physical symptoms along with these feelings?
PATIENT: Hmm. Physical symptoms… not really. I mean, I’m an older woman. I have the usual aches and pains. But nothing… different, specifically related to this feeling. Perhaps a little more… tired, overall. But that could be anything. I don’t know. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure. I’ve always been a practical woman. Strong. This… feeling unwell… it’s unusual for me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is quite a change for you, and it’s good you're recognizing that. Let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Then we can talk about some possible causes and next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly acceptable. Get it over with, if you will. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I have… commitments, you see. And I’d like to be functioning at my best.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could just sit here and relax, I’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 135 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Reflexes are… slightly diminished, which is not uncommon for someone your age, but we’ll keep an eye on that. Okay. Everything seems physically normal at the moment. Now, based on what you've told me, it sounds like we need to consider a few possibilities, including potential depression, anxiety, or even a vitamin deficiency. To be certain, I’d like to order some blood work. It will check your thyroid levels, vitamin D, B12, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work, yes. Get it done. The sooner we have some answers, the better. I’d prefer not to linger on this any longer than necessary. And… please, no complicated explanations. Just the results, if you will. I appreciate your efficiency, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. I’ll keep it straightforward. I'll have the lab draw the blood now, and the results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I’d like you to keep a simple journal—just jot down how you’re feeling each day, any activities you do, and how much sleep you’re getting. That can be helpful, even if it's just a few sentences. We'll review the results together when they come in, and then we'll discuss a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A journal… Very well. A journal. I suppose it can’t hurt. Keep track of my feelings… fine. As long as it doesn’t take up too much of my time. And please, Doctor, if the results show something… serious… don’t hesitate to be direct. I prefer honesty, however unpleasant. I have things to manage, you see. I can’t afford… delays.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nani. I’ll be direct and honest. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I'll have the lab technician come in now to draw your blood. They'll explain the process. Is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. Thank you for your… efficiency. Let's get this over with.
