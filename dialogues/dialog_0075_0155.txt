DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this… shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a bit now, I guess. Honestly, time gets away from me, you know? It's just… annoying, more than anything. I was hoping you could take a look.
DOCTOR: Annoying is a good way to put it, and it’s always good to get these things checked out. You said your hand… can you tell me a little more about the shaking?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it's not constant, you see? It comes and goes. Seems worse when I try to do something… like, holding a cup of coffee. Or… trying to write. That’s a real mess these days. It's like… a little flutter at first, then it gets bigger. I don’t know… it's hard to explain. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. Fluttering, getting worse with activity… that’s very helpful. And you mentioned it's been happening for “a bit now.” Could you try to recall roughly when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's the tricky part, isn't it? Time… it just slips away. Let me think… Maybe… six months ago? Or was it eight? Around the time of my… well, around the time I got rid of the old truck. Yes, I think it was after the truck. A blue Ford, lovely machine. But the shaking… started soon after that, I’m pretty sure. It wasn’t bad at first, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Right, after the truck. Six to eight months… okay. And has it been gradually getting worse since then, or has it been more sudden changes in the intensity of the shaking?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn't like bam, suddenly shaking all the time. More like… a slow build. You know? A little more noticeable each week, maybe. Now it’s just… frustrating. Makes simple things hard. I used to be able to fix anything around the house… plumbing, electrical… all of it. Now… not so much. It's hard to hold the tools steady, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when it impacts things you enjoy and are used to doing. Now, aside from your hand, have you noticed any shaking in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little… stiffness in my leg sometimes? But I thought that was just… old age, you know? I’m 79, after all. Things creak and groan a bit. I haven't really paid much attention to it. No, mostly just the hand. And it’s not like a whole-body tremble, thankfully. Just… this annoying flutter.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you experienced any other symptoms along with this shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Well, I get tired easier now, I suppose. But then again, I'm 79! What do you expect? I haven't really noticed anything else. No dizziness, no… falling, thankfully. Just… tired. And maybe a little… forgetful, but that's been happening for years. It's hard to keep track of things these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and some forgetfulness. Both common as we get older. Now, I'm going to ask you about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long list. Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, of course. And… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control with… pills. I don’t remember the name of them now. And… I think I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. Nothing major, though. I haven't really been to the doctor much in the last few years. I don’t like going, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy, high blood pressure that was controlled with medication, and pneumonia. And you said you haven’t been to the doctor much recently. Do you remember what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, I really don't. It was a little white pill, I think. Or maybe it was blue? Honestly, Doctor, it was years ago. I stopped taking it when I… well, when I moved. Yes, when I moved to this town. I think the doctor back then just… told me to stop. It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I don't really keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's understandable. We can look into that. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your appendix?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… no, I don't think so. Just the appendix when I was a boy. Nothing else. My wife, she had a hip replacement, but that wasn't me. No, just the appendix. I'm pretty sure. Unless… well, sometimes I get things mixed up. But I think it was just the appendix.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my father… he lived to be 85, I think. He was a farmer, strong as an ox. My mother… she passed away when I was young. I don’t really remember much about her health. As for… shaking or anything like that? No, not that I recall. My brother, he had some trouble with his heart, but that was later in life. Nothing like this hand trouble, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no history of shaking in the family. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, I think. Never had a problem with allergies. My wife was allergic to cats, but I don't have any allergies. No, I’m pretty lucky that way. Never had to worry about that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a little aspirin now and then for my knees, but that's it. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take one of those… what are they called? Melatonin? Yes, melatonin. But just sometimes. That’s all. Nothing regular. I try to avoid pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for that information. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. We'll check your reflexes, coordination, and just have a general look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. I have a few things I need to take care of this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. Let's get started. Please have a seat here on the examination table. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, can you please extend your arms in front of you?
PATIENT: Here you go. It’s probably worse now, with all the… anticipation. It always is. I try not to think about it, but it doesn’t really help, does it?
DOCTOR: I see. There is a noticeable tremor in your hands, especially when you extend them. It seems to be a resting tremor, which is… consistent with what you’ve described. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes in your legs. Please relax your legs while I gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, please try to touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger with your index finger. Let’s do that a few times.
PATIENT: It's… harder than it looks, Doctor. My coordination isn't what it used to be. I used to be able to do that in my sleep!
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a bit more challenging with the tremor, and some decline in coordination is expected with age. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back down, if you don't mind. Your abdomen sounds normal. Everything appears to be in order so far. Now, I'm going to check your gait, just to see how you walk. Would you mind walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Here we go… try not to fall, try not to fall… it’s not as easy as it used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Your gait is a little shuffling, and there’s some mild instability. It’s not significant, but it’s something we should consider. Alright, Mr. Jezik, thank you. That’s all for the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings, the most likely explanation for your symptoms is essential tremor. It’s a common neurological disorder that causes rhythmic shaking, typically in the hands, and it often gets worse with age. However, to rule out other possible causes, I would like to order some blood tests, including a thyroid panel and a complete blood count. We may also consider a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Essential tremor… well, that doesn't sound too bad, I suppose. As long as it’s not anything serious. Blood tests… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out, if you don’t mind. A neurologist, you say? Oh, bother. More appointments. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… please don't make it too complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. I'll keep it as simple as possible. The blood tests will help us rule out other conditions that can cause tremors, such as thyroid problems. And a neurologist is the specialist who can best evaluate and manage essential tremor if that’s what it turns out to be. I'm ordering the blood tests now. The lab results should be back in a few days. I’ll also get a referral to Dr. Novak, a neurologist I trust. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if the tremor becomes significantly worse or you experience any other symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… will this get worse? Will I… not be able to do things anymore? That’s what I really want to know. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Jezik. The progression of essential tremor varies greatly from person to person. Some people experience only mild symptoms that remain stable for years, while others experience a gradual worsening over time. It’s difficult to predict exactly how it will affect you. However, there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. These include medication, lifestyle modifications, and, in some cases, surgery. We'll work together to find the best approach for you. And it's important to remember that you're not alone in this. Many people live full and active lives with essential tremor. And we'll do everything we can to help you maintain your independence and quality of life. For now, I would suggest trying to use assistive devices if you find them helpful – things like larger utensils, adaptive tools for writing, or even weighted gloves. We can discuss these options further at your next appointment. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Weighted gloves… hmm. I might look into that. My hands get so tired. No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve been very patient with an old man. I appreciate it. I suppose I’ll just wait for the lab results and the call from the neurologist.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. It was my pleasure. And please, don't apologize for being an "old man." You're a valued patient, and I'm here to help in any way I can. I’ll have the lab results sent to you as soon as they’re available. And I’m confident that we can manage this together. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Panjoj. I best be going now. I have a few errands to run, and… well, I’m starting to forget what they are.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. Please take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And don’t worry about forgetting – it happens to the best of us! Have a good day, Mr. Jezik.
