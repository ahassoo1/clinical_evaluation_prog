DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, good morning to you too, Doc. Dashevsky, right? Well, it's my face and legs. They're... puffy. Been puffin' up for a bit now, I reckon. Not sure why they're puffin' up, though. Don't really keep track of things like that, to be honest. Just noticed it was gettin' worse, so figured I'd come in. It's a bit of a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your face and legs are puffy, and it's been getting progressively worse. That is a bother, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. When you say "a bit now," about how long have you noticed this puffiness?
PATIENT: Oh, geez... now you're askin' me to remember dates. That ain't my strong suit. Let's see... maybe a couple of weeks? Could be more, could be less. Time just kinda... goes. It was small at first, barely noticeable. Now, well, you can see it, can't ya? Not like I'm keepin' a calendar or nothin'. Just felt... different.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. A couple of weeks is a good starting point. And you’re right, it’s more important that you noticed a change. Has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm... not that I can recall. I've been doin' the usual. Workin' at the shop, fixin' things, comin' home, watchin' the telly. Maybe eatin' a bit more salt than I should? Old habits, ya know. But I doubt that's it. Never bothered me before, the salt. I don’t go doin' anything different. It just... happened. It’s probably somethin' serious, if you ask me. Always is, with things like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes to your routine, and you suspect it might be something serious. I appreciate you sharing that. It’s good to be aware of possibilities. Now, could you describe the puffiness a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's like... swollen, obviously. My cheeks are fuller, I suppose. And my ankles... they're right thick, like sausages. Press on 'em and it kinda leaves a dent. Not painful, not really. Just... uncomfortable. Makes my boots a bit tight, that's for sure. It's all kinda soft, squishy, if that makes sense. Not hard and hot or nothin'. Just... puffy. Like I said. Real puffy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Swollen cheeks and ankles that feel soft and leave a dent when you press on them. Not painful, just uncomfortable and making your boots tight. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the puffiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms... now you're really testin' my memory. Let me think... Well, I've been a bit tired lately. But I'm always a bit tired. Old age, ya know? And maybe... maybe I've been goin' to the bathroom a bit more often. But I drink a lot of coffee, so… could just be that. I haven’t felt sick or nothin’. No cough, no fever, no aches. Just the puffiness and the tiredness. It's probably nothin', really. Just old age settin' in.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness – which you already experience – and possibly needing to urinate more often. No fever, cough, or aches. Now, have you had any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions... Hmm. Let's see. My wife… bless her soul… she kept all the records. I haven’t looked at ‘em since… well, since she passed. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. And I broke my arm once, fallin' off a ladder. But nothin' serious. Never been a sickly man. Mostly just stubborn. She always said I was too stubborn to get sick. I’m sure there was somethin' else, but I honestly can’t recall. It was a long time ago. Not important, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child and a broken arm. Nothing major. And your wife handled the medical records. Did you have any surgeries other than your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: Surgeries... other than my tonsils? Nope. Not that I remember. I'd think I'd recall somethin' like that, wouldn’t I? She would have mentioned it. She was always one to remember everything. No, just the tonsils. When I was a little boy. That’s it. I’ve always steered clear of doctors, if I could. They always just poke and prod at ya. No need for it, usually. Unless somethin' breaks, that is. Or puffs up, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, just tonsils out as a child. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family... well, my brother, he lives up north. But we don't see much of each other anymore. He’s always been a bit…different. My mother… she died a long time ago. Father too. They both lived to a good age, as far as I know. No heart trouble, no nothin' like that. Mostly just… old age. They weren’t sickly, like I said. A few aches and pains here and there, but nothin' serious. She always worried about her cholesterol, though. I think. Honestly, I wasn’t payin' much attention. I was always busy fixin' things, not worryin' about cholesterol. Not a family of sickness, not us. Mostly just… stubborn. Like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your parents lived to a good age without major medical issues, and your brother lives up north. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or have you taken any recently?
PATIENT: Medications? No, sir. Never been one for pills. I don't like feelin' all… foggy. No medications. And recently? Nope. Not a one. I got a bottle of aspirin somewhere, for headaches, but I rarely use it. Just tough it out, usually. No need for fancy pills. They just make you feel worse, if you ask me. I tried ‘em once, a long time ago, and felt awful. Never touched ‘em since. No, no medications. None at all. Just… stubbornness. That’s my medication.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications currently or recently. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… well, she used to smoke a little bit, back when she was young. But I always hated the smell. Made my clothes stink. No, sir. Never smoked. Always said it was a foolish habit. Bad for your lungs, bad for your health. No need for it, not at all. Fresh air is good enough for me. Stubbornly good enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol... well, I might have a beer with dinner now and then. But just one. Maybe two, if it's a special occasion. Nothing fancy, just a light beer. Nothing to write home about, really. Never been a big drinker. Don't see the point, honestly. Makes you feel sluggish, and I got things to do. A little beer now and then, but nothing more. Stubbornly, only a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a beer or two occasionally. And finally, can you tell me a little about what you do for work?
PATIENT: Work? Well, I’m a welder, mostly. Or a solderer, or brazer, depends on the job. Fixin’ things, mostly. At the shop down the road. Been doin’ it for… oh, goodness, a long time. Since I was a young man. Standin’ on my feet all day, workin’ with metal. It keeps me busy, keeps my hands occupied. It's honest work, though. A bit of heat, a bit of sparks, but honest. And I’m good at it, if I do say so myself. Stubbornly good, that is. Though it’s a bit hard on the legs these days. Now that you mention it...
DOCTOR: Okay, a welder, mostly, standing on your feet all day. Right. Well, Mr. Miner, thank you for answering all those questions. It gives me a better picture of things. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your legs and ankles. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds... thorough. Fine, go ahead. Poke and prod away, Doc. Just try not to take too long, eh? My legs are gettin' a bit tired just sittin' here. But go ahead. I guess it’s better to know, even if it’s bad news. Stubbornly, better to know. Just be gentle, if you would. These old legs ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, Mr. Miner, I've completed the exam. I noticed some swelling in your legs and ankles – what we call pitting edema – and your pulses are a little weak in your feet. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, but your lungs sound good. Now, given your history and the exam findings, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing the swelling without some further testing. There are several possibilities. It could be related to your heart, kidneys, or veins. Given your age and the fact that the swelling is new, it’s important to rule out any serious underlying issues. I want to order a blood test and an EKG, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood test and an... EKG? Good heavens. Sounds... serious. But alright. If you think it’s necessary. Stubbornly, I guess it’s best to know, even if it’s bad news. But what exactly does it all mean? All these tests and… what are you lookin' for? My heart and kidneys? Never had any trouble with them before. What's an EKG even do? And how long will it take? I got things to do, ya know. Fixin’ things. But alright. Go ahead. If you think it’s necessary. Just explain it to me, slow and easy. I don’t understand all these fancy medical terms.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let me explain it as simply as I can. The blood test will check how well your kidneys are working, look for signs of infection, and check some other basic levels to give us a better overall picture of your health. An EKG – or electrocardiogram – is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us see if there are any problems with your heart rhythm or if there’s any damage to your heart muscle. It’s painless and doesn’t take long – just a few minutes. We’ll put some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs, and it’ll record the electrical activity. Given your symptoms and the swelling in your legs, we want to rule out heart failure, kidney problems, or problems with your veins. These are all possibilities, and the tests will help us determine what’s causing the swelling. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it’s important to investigate. The lab work should take a day or two to come back, and we can get the EKG results almost immediately. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Heart failure? Good heavens. That sounds… bad. Real bad. And kidney problems? My wife… she had some trouble with her kidneys near the end. Not a good thing, kidneys. So these tests are to see if I got heart failure or kidney problems? And… how long does it take to get the stickers on for the EKG? And will it hurt? I don't like needles, Doc. Never liked ‘em. And I got things to fix, ya know. Metal needs fixin’. I can’t be layin’ around gettin’ stickers on all day. So… you're sayin' it could be somethin' serious? That's what I figured. Everything always is, with things like this. Just my luck. Stubbornly, always somethin’. But alright. I'll get the stickers on. Just… explain it again, slow. And tell me about the needles. Are there needles involved?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take it one step at a time. You're right, the tests will help us determine if there's anything going on with your heart or kidneys. I understand that's worrying to hear, but it's important to remember that we don't know anything for sure yet. These are just possibilities that we need to rule out. And no, there are no needles involved in the EKG. It's completely painless. We simply attach small stickers – called electrodes – to your chest, arms, and legs. These stickers detect the electrical signals from your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all, and it only takes a few minutes to set up. As for the blood test, that does involve a small needle to draw some blood. But it's a quick pinch, and it's over before you know it. We have experienced phlebotomists who are very good at making it as comfortable as possible. We're not looking for the worst-case scenario here, Mr. Miner. We’re gathering information to figure out what's causing the swelling and make sure you get the best possible care. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: No needles for the EKG… that’s somethin', I suppose. A small pinch for the blood test… well, I hate needles, but… alright. If you say it’s quick. Just… get it over with, then. But what if it is somethin’ serious? Heart failure… that sounds real bad. What do they do for heart failure? And if it’s my kidneys… what then? I don’t want to end up in the hospital. I got things to fix, ya know. Metal needs fixin’. And I got a shop to run. And how long will I be here? I got a schedule, Doc. Metal doesn’t fix itself. Explain it to me like I’m a simple man. No fancy words. Just… what happens if it’s bad news? And how long will I be out of commission?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Miner, let's be honest. If the tests do show something serious, like heart failure or kidney problems, there are treatments available. For heart failure, treatments can include medications to help your heart pump better, changes to your diet – reducing salt and fluids – and sometimes, if it's severe, more advanced procedures. The goal is to manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. For kidney problems, treatments depend on the cause and severity. It could involve medications, dietary changes, or, in some cases, dialysis. I understand you're worried about being out of commission and not being able to run your shop. We would work with you to develop a treatment plan that minimizes disruption to your life as much as possible. We would also discuss any necessary accommodations or limitations. Now, as for how long you’ll be here, the EKG will only take about 10-15 minutes, and the blood draw will be another 10-15 minutes. We'll get the results back quickly, and we can discuss them with you right away. It’s important to remember that we don’t know anything for sure yet. These are just possibilities. The best thing we can do right now is get the tests done and see what they show. Then we can develop a plan together. Does that help clarify things a little?
PATIENT: Medications and changes to my diet… that doesn't sound good. I like my salt. And I'm stubborn, remember? Don't like changes. And dialysis? That sounds awful. So, you're sayin' there's a chance I could end up on medications, changin' my diet, or… worse? And I gotta sit around waitin' for test results? Alright. Fine. Do the tests. Get it over with. But I ain't promisin' I'll be happy about it. And I ain’t promisin’ I’ll take kindly to changes. Stubbornly, I ain’t promisin’ nothin’. Where do we start? Just… get it over with. But explain it to me again, slow. And tell me exactly what they're gonna do. I need to know what I’m gettin' into. And how long will it take? Metal is waitin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Miner. I understand your concerns, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as I can, step by step. First, we'll do the EKG. A technician will come in and place a few small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. They'll connect these stickers to a machine that records the electrical activity of your heart. You'll lie still for a few minutes while the machine does its work. It doesn't hurt at all, and it takes about 10-15 minutes. Then, we'll do the blood draw. A phlebotomist will clean a small area on your arm and insert a needle to draw a few vials of blood. You’ll feel a quick pinch, and it's usually over before you know it. It takes about 5-10 minutes. While we're waiting for the results, I'll explain what we're looking for and what the different results could mean. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I'll answer any questions you have along the way. The whole process should take about 30-45 minutes. After that, we'll have a better idea of what's going on and can discuss the next steps. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Stickers and a quick pinch… alright. 30-45 minutes… that ain’t too bad, I suppose. As long as I don’t have to lay around for hours. And you'll explain everything? No fancy words? Just… tell me what it all means, if it’s bad news? Alright. Fine. Let's get it over with. Bring on the stickers and the pinch. But I ain't promisin' I’ll be happy about it. And I want you to remember, I got things to fix. Metal is waitin’. Don't keep me long. And explain it to me like I’m a simple man. No fancy medical terms, alright? Lead the way. But hurry. Metal ain't gonna fix itself.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Miner. I’ll make sure everything is explained clearly, and we won't keep you any longer than necessary. If you'll follow me, the technician is ready to start the EKG. Just sit back, relax, and we’ll take care of everything. And please, don’t hesitate to ask any questions you have along the way. Let's get started. And don't worry, metal will still be there when you get back.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Lead the way. But if this keeps me from fixin’ metal, someone’s gonna hear about it. Stubbornly, someone is. Just get it over with, then. But hurry. Metal is waitin’.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Miner. I understand your frustration. We’ll move as quickly as we can. Here we are. The technician, Sarah, will get you set up. Sarah, this is Mr. Miner. He’s a little concerned about getting back to his work. Just relax in the chair, and Sarah will explain everything. I’ll be right outside if you need anything. Don't hesitate to call out if you’re uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Let's get it over with. But don't poke and prod too much. And hurry. Metal is waitin'. And explain it to me like I'm a simple man. No fancy medical terms. I got things to fix, ya know. Stubbornly, I got important work to do.
DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Miner, my name is Sarah. It’s nice to meet you. Dr. Dashevsky mentioned you're eager to get back to work, so we'll make this as quick and comfortable as possible. We're just going to attach a few small stickers to your chest, arms, and legs. These stickers don't hurt at all – they just detect the electrical signals from your heart. It's like taking a picture of your heart’s rhythm. It won't take long, maybe 5-10 minutes. You just need to lie still while the machine records your heart’s activity. And I'll explain everything as I go. No fancy medical terms, I promise. Just relax and try to breathe normally, and we’ll get it done in no time. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with. But don’t poke too much. And explain it to me like I’m a simple man. No fancy medical terms. Just tell me what it all means, if it’s bad news. And hurry. Metal is waitin’. I got important work to do. Stubbornly, I got things to fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to clean a small area of your skin with this wipe to make sure the stickers stick properly. It feels a little cold, but it won’t hurt. There we go. Just a few more. These stickers don't bother most people, but if you feel any discomfort, just let me know. Okay, all done! Now, I’m just going to start the machine. You don't need to do anything, just relax and breathe normally. It will take a few minutes to record your heart’s activity. You'll see some numbers and waves on the screen, but don't worry about those. I'm just looking for your heart’s rhythm. Dr. Dashevsky will be right back to take a look at the results. Just try to relax and think about something nice. And remember, I'm right here if you need anything. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. I got things to fix. Don’t poke too much. And hurry. I got important work to do. Just let me know when it's over. I got metal waitin’. Stubbornly, I got important work to do. And don’t poke too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Miner, we’re all done! Sarah, thank you. Everything looks pretty good, actually. Your heart rhythm is normal, and there are no signs of any major problems. So, that's one thing we can rule out. Now we just need to get the blood test results back to get a better picture of what's going on. You can get dressed now. And you can go back to your work, if you'd like. Just try to take it easy and let me know if you experience any new symptoms. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Normal? You mean… I ain’t dyin’? That’s a relief. So, just the blood test now? How long will that take? I got metal waitin’, remember? Alright. Just let me know when the blood test results are back. And I'm goin' back to work. I got things to fix. Stubbornly, I got important work to do. Just don't keep me waitin’ too long. And let me know if it's bad news. Explain it to me slow, alright? No fancy medical terms.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mr. Miner. Everything looks good with your heart. So that's one less thing to worry about. The blood test results should be back in a day or two. Our receptionist, Lisa, will call you as soon as they’re available. And don’t worry, I'll explain everything clearly when you get the results. No fancy medical terms, I promise. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your legs, please don’t hesitate to call us right away. Now, go back to your work and take it easy. And thank you for coming in today. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Miner. And I hope everything turns out alright. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. I'll be goin' now. And let me know when the blood test results are back. Don't keep me waitin' too long. And let me know if it’s bad news. Explain it to me slow, alright? No fancy medical terms. Bye bye.
