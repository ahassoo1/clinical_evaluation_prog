DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good day to you as well, Doctor Gorga. Well, it’s a bit of a…foolish matter, really. I’ve been attempting a new diet. A rather…enthusiastic one, I suppose one could say. And I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I, well, before I potentially do something…unwise. It’s all rather new-fangled, you see. Lots of talk on the internet.
DOCTOR: Internet diets, huh?
PATIENT: Indeed. A dreadful place for medical advice, I’m sure you’ll agree, but one can’t entirely avoid it these days. This one… it’s called the “Lunar Cycle Cleanse”. Apparently, it aligns with the phases of the moon for…optimal detoxification. Rather a lot of juice, and very little else. And specific timings for when one is allowed certain fruits. It’s… complicated. And frankly, exhausting.
DOCTOR: Exhausting, you say?
PATIENT: Quite. The timings, you see. One must consume only blueberries during the waning crescent, and absolutely no citrus fruits during the full moon. It's… demanding. And, I confess, I’ve been feeling rather lightheaded these past few days. It’s not precisely hunger, but… a lack of substance, if you follow. I’m a man who enjoys a good roast dinner, you see. This… is not that.
DOCTOR: Lightheadedness… alright. And how long have you been on this… Lunar Cycle Cleanse, exactly?
PATIENT: Just over a week, Doctor. Started on the new moon, the 26th of July. I thought a fresh start, you see. A bit of… self-improvement. Though, looking back, perhaps a sensible reduction in biscuits would have been more effective – and considerably less taxing. I do have a weakness for a good ginger nut, you understand.
DOCTOR: A week… alright. And besides the lightheadedness, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Well… my energy levels are rather low, as one might expect. And I’ve been… rather chilly. Not ill, precisely, just… perpetually a bit cold. My wife – my ex-wife, I should say – always said I ran a bit cold, but this is… exacerbated. And my digestion has become… irregular, shall we say. A polite way of putting it. It's not comfortable, Doctor. Not comfortable at all.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you taking any other medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Never been much of a one for pills, if I’m honest. And allergies… hmm. Dust, a bit. And I’m rather sensitive to the smell of lilies. Beyond that, I believe I’m perfectly sound. A slight aversion to overly dramatic house plants, perhaps, but I wouldn’t call that an allergy. I do have private insurance, should that be relevant. A rather comprehensive policy, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Well, I had my appendix removed in 1968. A rather unpleasant affair, but perfectly successful. And I broke my wrist skiing in Austria in ‘72. A badly healed fracture, to be sure, but it doesn't trouble me now. Aside from that… nothing significant, Doctor. I've always been a remarkably healthy chap, all things considered. A good constitution, my mother always said. Though, this diet… this diet is testing that constitution, I fear.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though I must confess, I haven’t weighed myself in quite some time. My ex-wife was rather insistent on regular weigh-ins. A bit…controlling, she was. Still, happy to oblige. Do let me know if it’s particularly alarming. I suspect the lack of roast dinners is having an effect.
DOCTOR: 148 pounds. And your height is listed as 187… alright. Blood pressure is 110 over 70. Pulse is 68, a little slow, but not concerning. Lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is a little tender, but no acute findings. Overall, you appear generally healthy, but slightly dehydrated.
PATIENT: Ah, well, that’s reassuring, in a way. Dehydrated, you say? Not surprising, I suppose, with all this juice. Though it is liquid, isn’t it? A rather perverse form of dehydration, one might think. It’s all terribly confusing, Doctor. Is it dangerous, this…slight tenderness? Should I be worried about my abdomen? I'm a bit of a worrier, I must admit. Especially when it comes to my insides.
DOCTOR: The tenderness is likely due to the restrictive nature of the diet, and the lack of fiber. It’s not immediately alarming, but it’s a sign that your body isn’t happy. We need to get you eating something more substantial. Given your age and the length of time you've been on this diet, I'd like to order some basic blood work. Just to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and rule out anything more serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Perfectly sensible, Doctor. Blood work sounds… prudent. I’m quite happy to have it done. Electrolytes, you say? I haven’t the faintest idea what an electrolyte is, but if it will reassure you, then proceed. The sooner we ascertain the damage this lunar nonsense has wrought, the better. And please, do tell me if it's something…serious. I rather dislike surprises, particularly internal ones.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll write you a requisition for the lab. They're just down the hall. It will take about an hour or so. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to stop the Lunar Cycle Cleanse immediately. And I'd recommend starting with small, easily digestible foods – things like broth-based soups, crackers, and cooked vegetables. Here's the requisition and some dietary guidelines. I’ll review the results when they come back, and we can discuss a more sustainable plan. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Perfectly agreeable, Doctor. Stop the cleanse… a relief, frankly. It was becoming rather… obsessive. And broth-based soups… a vast improvement on blueberries, I assure you. Crackers and vegetables… sensible. Extremely sensible. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease considerably. I shall follow your instructions to the letter. And I promise, no more internet diets. I believe I’ve learned my lesson. .
