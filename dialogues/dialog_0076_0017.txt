DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Bartok. Danny, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Danny Bartok. That is me. Though, honestly, I don't remember filling out all those papers. Lots of questions. Is this about the… the team? The tryout?
DOCTOR: The tryout?
PATIENT: Yes, the tryout. For… well, it was advertised down at the park. For older guys. You know, to keep us… active. Though, I'm not sure which team it was for, exactly. My ex-wife, she's the one who saw the flyer. I just… showed up. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, I’m a doctor. Internal Medicine. I don’t do… sports physicals. Or reminiscing about park flyers. What brought you to me today?
PATIENT: Now hold on a minute. Someone told me this is where I needed to come for the check-up. Said it was required before I could… participate. A younger man, at the park. He had a clipboard. I don't know why I'm here with you, but I was told to come. Medicare covers it, you see. Seems like a waste if I didn't use it.
DOCTOR: Medicare… Right. Well, someone clearly made a mistake routing you to me. I deal with… illnesses, Mr. Bartok. Not pre-participation screenings. Do you have any… actual medical problems?
PATIENT: Problems? Well… my knees ache sometimes. Especially after I… after I move around too much. And my back, it gets stiff. Old age, I suppose. Nothing a little liniment doesn't fix. I don't feel sick, if that's what you mean. Just… getting older. Is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Knees and back… Alright. Let's just get this over with. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis? Hmm… I don’t recall. My ex-wife… she always took care of the doctor stuff. She was very organized. I think she mentioned something about… inflammation once? But I don't know if that's the same thing. Honestly, doctor, I'm not good with remembering these names. It all sounds the same. Did they ask about my heart? I think I had something checked years ago, but I can’t say for certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Forget the names. Have you ever had chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain… not really. Sometimes a little… tightness. After I walk up the stairs. But it goes away if I rest. I used to be very active, you know. Played a lot of… something. Baseball, maybe? It was a long time ago. My memory isn't what it used to be. Is this important? Will it stop me from… from trying out?
DOCTOR: Tightness in the chest… How long has that been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. A while, I think. Maybe a few months? It comes and goes, like the weather. Not enough to bother me too much. I just figured it was… getting older. You know, things start to creak. Is this going to involve needles? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I need you to try to be more specific. A few months of chest tightness is not normal. Is it related to exertion?
PATIENT: Ex… exertion? You mean like… when I’m doing things? Yes! Yes, it’s when I’m doing things. Walking, climbing stairs, trying to… well, just moving around. It’s worse when I push myself. That's why I thought it was just being out of shape. But maybe I should have said something sooner? Does that change things? Does that mean I can’t try out? My ex-wife would be furious if I wasted a good tryout.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I’m going to need to do a quick examination. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. This is standard procedure, even if you think it’s just being out of shape. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. My ex-wife handled all that, too. She was very careful. I think she gave me something for… for hay fever once. But that was years ago. I suppose you can listen. But be gentle, doctor. And don't take too long. I have things to do, you know. And honestly, all this talk about hearts is making me a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Please, have a seat. I'll need you to remove your shirt. And try to relax. This is for your own good.
PATIENT: Remove my shirt? Oh, goodness. Well, I suppose I must. It's a bit chilly in here, you know. And I haven't had my coffee yet. But alright, alright. Just… try to be quick, doctor. This is rather embarrassing. Is there a private room for this, at least?
DOCTOR: Yes, the screen is for privacy. Please lie back on the examination table, and I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Slightly elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart. I’m hearing a slight murmur. Can you describe exactly when you experience this chest tightness?
PATIENT: A murmur? Is that bad? My ex-wife never mentioned a murmur. Chest tightness… well, it’s when I’m trying to do things. Walking, climbing stairs, swinging a… a bat, maybe? It feels like… a squeezing. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And it makes me breathe a little faster. It’s worst when I push myself, like I said. Sometimes, if I stop and rest, it goes away. Is this going to take much longer, doctor? I have… appointments. And I promised my ex-wife I’d pick something up for her. It’s very important.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Given your elevated blood pressure, the murmur, and the chest tightness with exertion, I’m concerned about possible angina. Mr. Bartok, I strongly recommend further testing. We need to rule out any underlying heart condition. I’m ordering an EKG and a stress test. And I suggest you refrain from any strenuous activity until we have the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Angina? A heart condition? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. A stress test? Is that where you make me run on a treadmill? I haven't run in years! And my ex-wife… she’ll be furious if I can’t try out. But… a heart condition… that is serious. Alright. Alright, I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. But will this take long? And will it affect my tryout? Please tell me it won't affect my tryout. I need to know. This is… very upsetting. And I'm starting to feel a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Let’s take things one step at a time. The EKG is quick and painless. The stress test will involve walking on a treadmill, but we can adjust the pace to your comfort level. We'll monitor your heart rhythm and blood pressure throughout the test. As for the tryout, it's best to wait until we have the results to determine if it’s safe for you to participate. We need to prioritize your health, Mr. Bartok. I'm going to write you a prescription for a low dose aspirin to start immediately. And I'm going to schedule you for the EKG and stress test tomorrow morning. I'll also send the results to your primary care physician for their review. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Aspirin? Tomorrow morning? Oh, goodness. This is all happening so fast. My ex-wife… she’ll want to know everything. And she’ll probably question your judgment. A low dose aspirin… what does that even do? Is it to thin my blood? I think I read something about that once. And she’ll want to know what happens in the stress test. Do I have to wear special clothes? And what if I can’t finish it? I get out of breath easily, you know. I… I think I need to sit down. This is very overwhelming. And… and will Medicare cover the stress test? I don’t want to get a big bill.
DOCTOR: I’ll have my nurse explain the details of the tests and Medicare coverage. She’ll also provide you with instructions on how to prepare. It’s important to follow these instructions carefully. And please, try to relax. We’re doing this to make sure you’re healthy, Mr. Bartok.
