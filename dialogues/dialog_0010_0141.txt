DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s August 2nd. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this itching. Everywhere, really. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit crazy. Not terrible, but just… constant. I hadn't really thought much of it at first, but it's not going away.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant itching for a few weeks. I understand. And you said “everywhere”?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Arms, legs, back… even my stomach. Not inside my stomach, thankfully! But all over my skin. It doesn't seem to be getting worse quickly, just… persistently there. It's not like a rash, really. Just… itchy skin.
DOCTOR: Alright, persistently itchy skin all over, no rash. That helps. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don't think so, not really. I mean, sometimes when I'm really busy at work it seems like I don't notice it as much, just because I'm distracted. But nothing specifically makes it better or worse that I can pinpoint. I've tried different lotions, you know, just regular stuff from the store. Doesn't seem to do a whole lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific triggers or relief with over-the-counter lotions. And you mentioned work... what do you do, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: I'm a dispatcher. Not police or anything like that, though. Mostly trucks, deliveries… that sort of thing. It keeps me pretty busy, to be honest. Lots of talking on the phone, coordinating routes… it’s alright. I've been doing it for… well, a long time now. Twenty years, I think. Maybe more.
DOCTOR: Twenty years… Okay. Any new detergents, soaps, or anything like that you've started using recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I’ve been using the same laundry detergent for… well, a very long time. And the same soap. Old habits, you know? I’m not one for changing things up much. I wish I could blame something simple like that, but I don’t think that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any recent travel?
PATIENT: No travel, Doctor. Haven't left the state in… oh, goodness, probably ten years. Not much reason to, really. Everything I need is right here. I used to travel a bit more, but… well, that was a long time ago. Before my wife passed.
DOCTOR: I see. I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Ferneding. Losing a spouse is never easy. Now, let's get back to this itching. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… a while ago now. As for other symptoms… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. No fever, no weight loss… no tiredness more than usual. My appetite is alright. It's just… the itching. That’s it. It doesn’t come and go in waves, it’s just… there. Constant, like I said. It’s more annoying than anything, to be honest. But it’s wearing me down a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, no associated symptoms—no fever, weight loss, fatigue. Just persistent itching. And you said it’s been going on for a few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks now. I’d say… maybe four or five? It started gradually, I don’t remember a specific day. Just… noticed it more and more, and then it became constant. I figured it might go away on its own, but it hasn't. It’s not painful, just… incredibly irritating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. I've had the usual itchy bug bites and things, but nothing like this. This isn't just a little spot, it’s all over. And it doesn’t look like anything, really. That’s what’s so strange about it. No bumps, no redness… just itchy skin. I’m usually pretty good at noticing things, being a dispatcher, you know? But this is… baffling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look at your skin. If you don’t mind, could you please roll up your sleeves and loosen your shirt a bit so I can get a better look at your back and torso?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem at all. Here you go, Doctor. Feel free to take a good look. It doesn’t look like much, I’m afraid. Just… normal skin, really. But itchy. Very itchy.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your skin appears normal in terms of color and texture. No visible rash, no hives, no excoriations… nothing obvious. It’s difficult to say without further investigation, but it doesn’t look like a typical allergic reaction or dermatological condition. Let me document this. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I don’t take any regular medications. I had penicillin as a kid, like everyone else, but I didn’t have a bad reaction. Other than that, nothing. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing much to speak of, thankfully. I had chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else. Had my vaccinations, of course. A few colds over the years, the usual things. But nothing serious. No heart problems, no diabetes, no arthritis… I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. My wife… she had some issues with her blood pressure towards the end, but that's about it. Nothing on my side, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother lived to be eighty-five, she died of… well, just old age, really. My father had some trouble with his knees later in life, but nothing major. I don’t think there’s any history of skin conditions or allergies on either side of the family. My wife’s family… they were all pretty healthy too, as far as I know. Mostly just the usual things – high blood pressure, a little arthritis… nothing that runs particularly strong in the family. We weren’t a family prone to illness, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's review. You're a 53-year-old male with no significant medical history, no allergies, and no strong family history of skin conditions. You've been experiencing constant itching for 4-5 weeks, with no visible rash or other associated symptoms. You've tried over-the-counter lotions without relief. Given the lack of obvious findings, I'd like to run a few blood tests just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Things like thyroid issues, liver problems, or even early signs of certain types of cancer can sometimes present with unexplained itching. We’ll check your complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. If it can rule things out, that's great. I just want to know what's causing this, you know? It’s not terrible, but it’s… persistent. Blood tests sound good. Where do we go from here?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse draw the blood samples right here in the office. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have those, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend an over-the-counter antihistamine, like cetirizine or loratadine. They may not completely eliminate the itching, but they could provide some temporary relief. And I'd also advise you to avoid any harsh soaps or detergents, and to keep your skin well-moisturized. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very sensible, Doctor. Antihistamine, avoid harsh soaps, moisturize… I can do all of that. Cetirizine… is that the Zyrtec? I think I’ve seen that on TV. Alright, let’s get the blood drawn then. And I’ll look for the Zyrtec at the store. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It’s reassuring to know we’re trying to figure it out.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Ferneding. Yes, cetirizine is the generic name for Zyrtec. I'll have the nurse come in now to draw the blood. She'll explain the process to you. Nurse, could you please come in and draw blood for Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I’ll just sit here and wait then.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will be in to see you shortly after the nurse is finished. Please let me know if you feel unwell at any point. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I will.
