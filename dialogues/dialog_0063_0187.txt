DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Concise, you say? Fine. My chest… feels funny. Like a bird flapping. And my head… pounds. Wife says my face is red. Blood pressure, she keeps saying. Always with the blood pressure. I take pills, you know. But still… feels bad. Just… want to know if I'm dying, okay?
DOCTOR: Right. A “funny” chest and a headache. And your wife is concerned about your blood pressure. You take pills… yes, I see here a prescription for amlodipine. How long have you been experiencing these… feelings, Mr. Sobkowicz?
PATIENT: Amlodi… what now? Doesn't matter. Long enough. Maybe… a week? Two? They come and go. When I get excited, maybe. Or… when I eat too much salt. My wife… she controls the salt. But sometimes… a little kimchi is good for the soul, you know? And it has salt.
DOCTOR: Kimchi, yes. I understand. So, these sensations in your chest… can you describe them more precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely? You want precise? It's like… thump-thump. Not a strong thump, mind you. Like a little fish flopping around in my chest. And sometimes… it feels like it skips a beat. Like the engine… sputter, then go again. You understand engine? Old man understands engine. Not so much these… new feelings.
DOCTOR: An irregular heartbeat, you’re saying. Palpitations. And it’s associated with activity or… kimchi consumption. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting spells accompanying these palpitations, Mr. Sobkowicz?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. I walk to the store. A little puffing, maybe, but I'm an old man. Dizziness… sometimes. When I stand up too fast. Happens to everyone. Fainting? No. Never faint. Too stubborn to faint.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a quick examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We will listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll check your blood pressure myself. Then, perhaps, we can determine if your wife’s concerns are… warranted. Do you have any allergies to medications, Mr. Sobkowicz?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. My wife worries too much. Always with the worries. Fine, fine. Examination. Hurry it up, please. I have things to do. Table… over there?
DOCTOR: Yes, that one. Please remove your shirt and lie flat. I haven’t all day, Mr. Sobkowicz.
PATIENT: Hmph. Always rushing. Fine. Don't need all the fuss. Just listen. Just tell me if I'm going to die, okay?
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly irregular, and I do detect a murmur. Your blood pressure is elevated, as your wife indicated. Lung sounds are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Given your age and these findings, I suspect you may have atrial fibrillation – an irregular heartbeat – and uncontrolled hypertension. However, we need to confirm this with an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to be certain.
PATIENT: Electro… what now? More tests? Just tell me if it’s bad, doctor. Is it the kimchi? Is it my wife’s worrying? Is it… the end? Just… give it to me straight. No fancy words.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, an EKG is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us determine the cause of the palpitations. It is not necessarily “the end,” but your symptoms are concerning. It's unlikely to be the kimchi directly, although excessive salt intake can exacerbate hypertension. We need to rule out more serious underlying causes. I am ordering an EKG and a basic blood panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. We will also need a more accurate blood pressure reading over the next 24 hours. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to limit your salt intake and continue taking your amlodipine as prescribed. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Limit salt… amlodipine… My wife handles the salt. She tells me when to take the pills. You want me to tell her? That won’t work. She’ll yell. Just… write it down. Write it all down. She reads everything I bring home. And hurry up. I have a baseball game to watch.
DOCTOR: Here. This summarizes the instructions: "Limit salt intake. Continue taking amlodipine as prescribed. Follow up next week." Take this to your wife. If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness at any point before your follow-up appointment, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room… Fine, fine. Chest pain, you say. I'll remember. Now, if you'll excuse me… Baseball game is starting soon. Waste of time, all this fuss. .
DOCTOR: Another one… difficult patient. Hopefully, his wife will manage his care adequately. .
