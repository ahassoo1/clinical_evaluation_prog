DOCTOR: Hi Ivette, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Dr. Rosanova, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. I’ve had them for… let me think… over two days now, I believe. It’s quite annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for over two days. That is annoying. Let's try to figure out what's going on. Can you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Well, they're… regular hiccups, I suppose. You know, that little jerk of the body, and then the hic sound. Not particularly painful, just… persistent. They come and go, but they haven't completely gone away for more than a few minutes at a time, if that makes sense. I tried holding my breath a few times, like my mother always told me, but that hasn’t helped at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, regular hiccups, no pain, and holding your breath isn’t doing the trick. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so. I was gardening yesterday, but I wasn’t doing anything strenuous. I had a glass of water with lunch, but I drink water all the time. Honestly, they just started. I was watching television, and then hic… and they’ve been with me ever since. I really can’t pinpoint anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright, no clear triggers. Have you had any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no stomach pain… just the hiccups. I might be a little tired, but honestly, who isn't these days? I haven’t noticed anything else unusual at all. I ate normally, went to the bathroom normally… everything feels pretty regular, except for the hic… you know. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms, just the persistent hiccups. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, just to be thorough. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing serious. I used to get migraines, but those have been much better lately. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed maybe fifteen years ago. Apart from that… no, I'm pretty healthy, generally. I don't take any regular medications, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, flu a few years back, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, and no current medications. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything, and I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications I've taken in the past. I've had a few vaccinations over the years, of course, but nothing significant. I do get bitten by mosquitoes a lot, but that’s hardly an allergy!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My family history... Well, my mother lived to be 92, but she had a bit of everything as she got older. Arthritis, mostly. My father died young, heart attack. My brother is fine, I think – he lives in Cairo, we don't speak often. No history of… anything really specific that I know of, to be honest. It wasn't something we talked about much. It's a big family, scattered all over!
DOCTOR: Okay, mother lived to 92 with arthritis, father died young of a heart attack, brother is healthy. Thanks for sharing that. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not! I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven’t had any alcohol in… oh, probably a year now. And definitely no drugs! I'm a fairly simple woman, Dr. Rosanova. Gardening, watching television, spending time with my grandchildren… that’s my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol rarely, no drugs. That's good to know. Now, before we do a quick exam, could you tell me your height and weight, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I'm… not very tall. About five feet, maybe a little less. And I've put on a bit of weight over the years, I suppose. Around 150 pounds, perhaps a little over. I haven’t weighed myself recently, to be honest. It's not something I dwell on.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly 5 feet tall and 150 pounds. Thanks. Let’s just have a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look in your throat. Then we can talk about what might be going on and what we can do about it. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Rosanova. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Your throat looks a little red, but nothing significant. No obvious signs of infection. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 80. I'm going to palpate your abdomen as well. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. It’s unlikely, but I want to rule out any immediate cause for concern. I'm going to order a basic blood test - complete blood count and a metabolic panel. That will help us see if there's anything going on with your electrolytes, kidney function, or if there’s any sign of inflammation. In the meantime, let’s try a few things at home.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood test… that sounds sensible. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. What sort of things can we try at home? I’m happy to try anything to get rid of these dreadful hiccups! I haven't had a peaceful moment in days. Is there anything I should be avoiding?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, avoid carbonated beverages for now. Try sipping water slowly, rather than drinking it quickly. And if you find yourself getting excited or stressed, try to take some slow, deep breaths. Sometimes, hiccups are triggered by things that irritate the diaphragm. I’d also suggest avoiding large meals. Small, frequent snacks might be better. If the hiccups persist for more than a week, or if you develop any other symptoms – like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain – please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. It’s unlikely, but we need to be prepared. The lab results should be back in a couple of days. I'll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they're available. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Dr. Rosanova. No carbonated drinks, sip water slowly, deep breaths… I can manage that. I'll definitely avoid large meals too. And I will come back immediately if anything else develops, don’t worry. Thank you so much for your time and for taking such good care of me. I feel much better knowing we’re doing something about this. Hopefully, the blood test will shed some light on things. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad I could help. The nurse will schedule your blood work before you leave. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and hopefully, we’ll get these hiccups sorted out quickly.
