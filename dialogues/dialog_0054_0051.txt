DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Dashevsky, was it? Yes, lovely name. Hmm… what brings me in… let me see. It’s… something about the blood. Yes, the blood. My son, he… well, he asked me to come. Something about needing to know my blood type. I don’t quite recall why, but it felt important. It’s a bit silly of me, isn’t it, forgetting these things?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Darl. Memory can be tricky as we get older, and it’s always good to get things checked out. Your son is right to be proactive. Knowing your blood type is important for several reasons, especially as we age. So, just to clarify, he’s concerned about you needing to know your blood type, and that’s what prompted the visit today?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, dear. He was… very insistent. A good boy, my son. Always looking after his old mother. He mentioned something about… emergencies? And… hospitals? Honestly, the details are a bit foggy. I just want to get this done so he doesn't worry so much. Is it… is it a painful thing, finding out my blood type? I’ve never had it done before, you see.
DOCTOR: No, it's not painful at all, Darl. It just involves a simple blood draw, like the ones you get when you have routine check-ups. It's very quick and generally well-tolerated. He's right to be thoughtful, and knowing your blood type can be very helpful in emergency situations. Before we proceed with the blood draw, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… manageable then. Good. A little prick, you say? I can handle a little prick. As for my health… well, I’m seventy-nine years young, if you hadn’t noticed! I’ve had a good life, mostly. A bit of arthritis in my hands, makes knitting a little difficult sometimes. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, hence the rather thick glasses. I mostly just… take things easy these days. Eat my vegetables, try to get a little sunshine. Nothing serious, really. I have private insurance, if that's important.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Darl. It's wonderful that you’re staying active and taking care of yourself. The arthritis and eyesight changes are common as we age, and it's helpful to know about them. And thank you for letting me know about your insurance. Now, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Doctor, my memory really isn’t what it used to be. My late husband, bless his soul, he always handled all the doctor’s visits and the paperwork. I… I think the doctor once mentioned my cholesterol was a little high, years ago. But I honestly don’t remember much beyond that. I haven’t been feeling particularly unwell, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Did I have… diabetes? No, I don’t think so. I do enjoy a little bit of sweet pastry now and then, but I try not to overdo it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Darl. We can certainly check your cholesterol levels today if you'd like. And it’s perfectly fine if you're not sure about past medical history – we can work with what you do remember, and the blood tests will give us a clearer picture. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries. Let me see… Oh! Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young woman. A very bad pain, that was! And… I think I was in the hospital once, a long time ago, when I broke my wrist. I was climbing a tree, can you believe it? A silly young thing, I was. Other than that… I don’t recall any major hospital stays. Nothing recent, certainly. It was all a very long time ago, you see. Do you need the dates? I doubt I could tell you them, even if I tried.
DOCTOR: No, the dates aren't essential right now, Darl. Just knowing that you had your appendix removed and broke your wrist is helpful. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a tricky one. My family… well, we weren't much for talking about illnesses. It wasn’t considered polite, you see. My mother… she died rather young, from… I believe it was a chest ailment. Pneumonia, perhaps? And my father… he lived a long life, but he had a weak heart, I think. My brother… he had some sort of trouble with his stomach, but I don’t know the specifics. It all happened a long time ago, and we didn't discuss these things. I wish I could be more helpful, dear, but my memory… it just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Darl. You’ve given me some valuable information, and it’s understandable that memories fade over time, especially regarding family history. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me see… I don't think so. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. I can eat just about anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. Although… I did have a bit of a rash once, after using a new soap. But that wasn’t a serious allergy, just a little irritation. And… no, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything significant. I’ve always been very careful about what I put into my body, you see. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Darl. And it’s always wise to be cautious. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… yes, actually. Just one. My doctor, a few years back, prescribed something for my arthritis. It’s a small white pill, I take it every morning with my breakfast. Oh dear, what was it called? It’s on the tip of my tongue… It’s something… with a “P”, I think. And… I also take a multivitamin sometimes, just to keep my strength up. But it’s not regular, you see. Just when I remember. And I do like a little bit of cod liver oil in the winter, for my bones. A bit old-fashioned, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Do you recall the name of the arthritis medication, even approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear, I’m truly sorry, dear. It’s just… gone. I remember the doctor explaining it, and telling me how many to take, but the name itself… it’s completely vanished. It started with a “P”, I’m almost certain of it, but beyond that… I’m afraid I’m drawing a blank. Perhaps my son knows? He usually handles my refills. It’s terribly embarrassing, isn't it, forgetting something so important? I truly apologize.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry about it at all, Darl. It’s completely understandable, and it’s not something to apologize for. We can look up your medications in our system using your name and date of birth, or your son can provide the information. Now, before we proceed with the blood draw, let's do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine, dear. A quick exam, you say? Yes, go ahead. I haven't had a proper check-up in… well, I can't quite remember when. A bit stiff, I am, you see. Mostly just from getting old. But I'm sure you've seen worse! Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but not overly concerning. Your pulse is 76, regular and steady. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs noted. Your lung sounds are clear bilaterally, with no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Do you experience any pain anywhere currently?
PATIENT: Oh, that doesn't sound too bad, does it? My heart’s still ticking, thankfully. No, I don’t experience any pain, not right now, anyway. A bit of stiffness in my hands sometimes, and my knees ache when it’s cold, but that’s just the arthritis, you see. Nothing sudden or severe, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old. I’m quite grateful I'm still able to move about, all things considered. Is that everything then, Doctor? Are we ready for the blood draw? I'm bracing myself now!
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits for your age and reported history. And yes, we are ready for the blood draw. It will just be a small prick, as you said. The nurse will be in shortly to take a sample. We’ll be checking a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and your cholesterol levels. It should only take a few minutes. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: Oh, good. A few minutes, you say? That doesn't sound too dreadful. No, I don't think so, dear. You've been very thorough, and you've answered all my questions, even the ones I didn't know I had! I’m just relieved to finally get this done, so my son can stop worrying. He means well, you see. Is there anything I should do to prepare, or anything I should expect afterwards? Will I be terribly weak, or bruised?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Darl. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. No, you shouldn't experience any significant weakness or bruising afterwards. Just a small bandage will be applied to the site of the blood draw. It's a good idea to drink plenty of fluids after the blood draw, and maybe have a small snack. If you feel a little lightheaded, just sit down for a few moments. The nurse will give you specific aftercare instructions. And you're right to mention your son – it’s good that he’s proactive about your health. I'll be reviewing the results as soon as they come in, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, dear. A follow-up appointment… yes, good. I like knowing you’re keeping an eye on things. Plenty of fluids and a snack… I can manage that! My son will be pleased to hear that everything is under control. Now, what was I saying? Oh dear, this memory… it’s quite unreliable, isn’t it? Never mind. I’m sure it will come back to me eventually. Thank you again, Doctor Dashevsky. You’ve been very kind and patient with an old woman like me. Now, I suppose I just wait for the nurse?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Darl. It was my pleasure. And don’t worry about your memory – it’s perfectly normal to experience some cognitive changes with age. Yes, just sit comfortably, and the nurse will be with you shortly. She will take excellent care of you. If you need anything at all, don't hesitate to ask. We'll get to the bottom of this, and everything will be alright.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. That’s very kind of you. I appreciate that. Alright then, I’ll just sit here and… wait patiently. And try to remember what I came for!
