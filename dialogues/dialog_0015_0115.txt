DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, goodness. It’s… well, it’s my skin, mostly. It’s gotten rather… yellow. And I believe the young man at the front desk mentioned something about my liver? It's all a bit of a blur, truthfully. I do apologize. I haven't been feeling quite myself lately.
DOCTOR: Yellowing of the skin… that is something we need to investigate. The receptionist likely mentioned possible liver involvement as a preliminary thought, but we shouldn’t jump to conclusions. “Not feeling yourself” is rather vague, Ms. Durig. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… yes, well. I’m tired, very tired. And… not hungry. Everything tastes… off. And I’ve been a bit confused, I think. Small things, mostly. Like forgetting where I put my spectacles. Though, that happens often, even when I am feeling well. It’s just… more frequent now. And a bit frightening, to be honest. I haven't had much energy to do much of anything.
DOCTOR: Right. Tiredness, loss of appetite, altered taste, and some confusion… and you say this has been increasing. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… rather personal, isn’t it? Well… the stool has been… pale. Very pale. And the urine… a bit darker than usual, I suppose. Though, I drink a lot of water, so it’s difficult to say for certain. Is that… bad? I truly don't recall ever having these symptoms before, and it has me quite worried.
DOCTOR: It’s necessary to ask these questions, Ms. Durig. These are all relevant symptoms. Pale stool and dark urine, along with the yellowing of your skin, certainly raise concerns. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My medical history… it’s rather long, I’m afraid. And my memory, as I’ve mentioned, isn’t what it used to be. I believe… I had a gallbladder removed many years ago. And a touch of arthritis, but nothing serious. I also had a bout of hepatitis when I was younger, traveling abroad. But that was decades ago! I don’t know if that’s relevant now. Everything feels so long ago. Is that hepatitis… could that be coming back?
DOCTOR: A cholecystectomy and a past case of hepatitis… alright. Do you recall which type of hepatitis you had, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Which type… I truly don’t recall. It was… a long time ago. I was traveling in… well, somewhere warm, I believe. It was a very unpleasant experience, I remember that. I was quite sick, had to stay in the hospital for a time. They said it was something I caught from the water, I think. But the specifics… they escape me. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful. It was… before computers, you see. Everything was paper then.
DOCTOR: It’s…unfortunate that we don’t have more specific information regarding your previous hepatitis infection. Given your symptoms, past medical history, and the yellowing of your skin, we need to run some tests to determine the cause. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a liver function test. We'll also need to check your bilirubin levels. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. I had a reaction to penicillin when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago. Nothing recent, thankfully. I do get a bit… drowsy with some medications, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I’m just trying to recall… Oh! I sometimes get a bit of an upset stomach with iron supplements. But other than that… I believe I’m alright. I do hope these tests aren't too unpleasant. I'm not very good with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: A history of a penicillin reaction and some mild stomach upset with iron… noted. The blood draw is relatively quick, Ms. Durig. And we’ll only take what’s necessary. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take a small dose of medication for my arthritis, something the doctor prescribed years ago. And I occasionally take a little something for my sleep, but only when I’m particularly restless. And… Oh! And I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. That’s about it, I believe. A small pill for the arthritis, a little something for sleep, and the vitamin D. Nothing else. I really try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. An arthritis medication, a sleep aid, and vitamin D… We’ll need the names of those medications, Ms. Durig. Precise names are crucial. And how often do you take each one?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. The names… yes. That’s where my memory fails me, I'm afraid. The arthritis medication is… a small white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And the sleep aid… it's a tiny blue one. I only take it when I can’t sleep, perhaps once or twice a week. The vitamin D… that’s a yellow capsule, I think. I take one every day with lunch. I really wish I could remember the proper names, but they just slip my mind. I apologize for the inconvenience. I do have a small pill organizer at home, perhaps I could look them up later? Would that be alright? I would feel terrible giving you the wrong information.
DOCTOR: It would be extremely helpful if you could bring the names of those medications with you on your next visit, Ms. Durig. Precise medication lists are essential for accurate medical care. For now, we’ll proceed with the blood tests. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly. After the results come back, we can discuss further steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, alright, I will certainly look them up. I apologize again for the trouble. Um… yes, I do have one question. Is… is this serious, Doctor? The yellowing, I mean. And the tiredness. Is it something… bad? I truly am worried. It's just… I've been feeling so unwell, and I don't want anything… permanent. I hope that doesn't sound silly. I'm probably just an old woman, worrying over nothing. But it does frighten me. .
DOCTOR: It is too early to determine the severity of your condition, Ms. Durig. The tests will provide the necessary information. While your symptoms are concerning, it does not necessarily indicate a permanent or life-threatening condition. However, it is important that we investigate this promptly. Do not speculate. We will discuss the results once they are available. The phlebotomist is ready for you now. Please follow them. .
