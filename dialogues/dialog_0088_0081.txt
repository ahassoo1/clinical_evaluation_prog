DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailia. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’m rather concerned. I’ve been… diminishing, shall we say. Losing weight despite eating quite normally, and I find myself terribly fatigued. And the night sweats are… most unpleasant. It’s all rather disruptive, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Losing weight unintentionally, fatigue, and night sweats… those are definitely things we need to look into. Let’s start with the weight loss. About how much weight have you lost, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Approximately seven kilograms, Doctor, over the last three months. It’s quite alarming, really. I maintain a very structured diet – plenty of dal and vegetables, lean protein – and I exercise regularly. It’s not as though I’ve simply stopped caring for myself. Quite the opposite, in fact. I assure you, it’s not a matter of poor lifestyle choices.
DOCTOR: Seven kilograms in three months… alright. And you said you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Three times weekly. Primarily yoga and brisk walking. I find it… grounding. And it has always been sufficient to maintain my physique. It's rather baffling, this weight loss, considering my dedication to a healthy regimen. I simply cannot fathom what could be amiss.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the weight loss, fatigue and night sweats, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. I have noticed a slight… persistent cough, though it’s not particularly severe. And, on occasion, a minor fever. Nothing debilitating, mind you, but… noticeable. Also, I find my appetite has diminished somewhat, despite my best efforts to eat regularly. It's rather inconvenient, to be perfectly honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a cough, occasional fever, and decreased appetite in addition to the weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats. Let’s talk about the cough for a moment. Is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: It is, predominantly, a dry cough, Doctor. Though, occasionally, I produce a small amount of… clear mucus. It's not discolored, if that is what you are asking. It is more of an irritation, really. A tickle in the throat that develops into a rather persistent cough. I've attempted various remedies – honey and ginger, warm tea – but to little avail.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you travelled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who has been ill?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven't left the Kathmandu Valley in over a year. And as for exposure to illness… well, my husband, Narayan, works in a rather busy market. He encounters many people daily, naturally. He did mention a colleague experiencing a rather nasty cold a few weeks ago, but he insists it was merely a common ailment. He's quite robust, my husband; rarely falls ill himself. I doubt it’s related, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. Such habits are… unrefined. I maintain a very disciplined lifestyle, as I’ve mentioned. Neither I nor my husband partake in those sorts of… indulgences. We prefer a quiet evening with a cup of chiya, perhaps a bit of traditional music. It’s far more conducive to a healthy existence, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Yes, I would agree. Let's go through some other questions. Any history of tuberculosis in your family?
PATIENT: That is a rather… direct question, Doctor. My paternal grandmother, many years ago, did succumb to a prolonged illness that I believe was tuberculosis, yes. However, that was decades ago, and on my mother’s side, there has been no such instance. It was, naturally, a great sadness for the family, but I had assumed it was… isolated. It’s hardly relevant to my current condition, is it?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Jailia. It's important for me to understand your family history. Okay. And what about any other significant medical conditions in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, my family is remarkably healthy, all things considered. My father had some minor issues with his blood pressure in his later years, managed with simple medication, but nothing of significant concern. My mother is still quite vigorous for her age, though she does complain of occasional arthritis. Beyond that… nothing particularly alarming. We are a rather hardy stock, I assure you. I find it rather perplexing that I should be experiencing these ailments, given our family’s history. It's simply…unprecedented.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on to allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am quite fortunate in that regard. I have never experienced an allergic reaction to anything. I can consume a wide variety of foods without issue and have never had a negative response to any medication I’ve been prescribed – which, thankfully, hasn’t been often. I maintain a strong constitution, you see. It's another reason why this current situation is so… distressing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a physical exam now. Could you please step onto the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though, if you don't mind my asking, what exactly are you hoping to ascertain from this examination? I find it most efficient to understand the purpose of each procedure beforehand. I’m not opposed, naturally, but I do appreciate a clear explanation. Is it merely a formality, or do you suspect a specific ailment?
DOCTOR: It’s not merely a formality, Jailia. Given your symptoms – the weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and cough – I need to listen to your lungs and heart, feel your lymph nodes, and check your abdomen. I'll also take your temperature. It’s a preliminary assessment to help me determine the potential cause and guide further testing if needed. Please lie down, and we'll begin with listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If it is necessary, then I shall comply. Though I must say, I find the entire process rather… intrusive. It’s not that I distrust your expertise, you understand, but I do value my personal space. Proceed when you are ready. And do be gentle, if you wouldn't mind.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not significantly. Your lungs sound…clear, but there's a slight wheezing on the left side, particularly when you exhale. Now, I'm going to gently feel your lymph nodes. Just relax your neck. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A wheeze, you say? That is… concerning. I have never experienced any difficulty breathing, so that is a new development. And the lymph nodes… yes, actually. There is a slight… sensitivity on the left side, near the collarbone. It’s not acutely painful, but it is noticeable. It’s rather unsettling, to be perfectly honest. Is it… serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay. A little tenderness in the lymph nodes isn’t automatically serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Just lie flat and relax. Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. On the left side, just below the ribs. It’s not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache. It’s been present intermittently for the past few weeks, but I dismissed it as indigestion. It appears I was mistaken. Is this… indicative of something grave, Doctor? You are beginning to alarm me.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concern, Jailia. The tenderness in your lymph nodes and abdomen, combined with your weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and cough… it does raise some red flags. It could be a number of things – an infection, inflammation, or something more serious. I want to order some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I'm ordering a complete blood count , a chest X-ray, and a sputum test to check for tuberculosis. Would you like me to explain those tests?
PATIENT: Tuberculosis? You suspect tuberculosis? My grandmother… it cannot be. Though, admittedly, the symptoms are remarkably similar. Yes, Doctor, please do explain the tests. I need to understand what is being done and why. The uncertainty is… deeply unsettling. And how long will these tests take? I have several commitments scheduled for next week, and I would prefer to minimize any disruption, if possible. I trust you will be as efficient as possible, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The CBC will give us information about your blood cells – looking for signs of infection or inflammation. The chest X-ray will allow us to see your lungs and heart more clearly, checking for any abnormalities. And the sputum test involves collecting a sample of your saliva to check for the presence of the tuberculosis bacteria. As for the timing, the blood test results usually come back within 24-48 hours. The chest X-ray results are typically available within a few hours. The sputum test will take a few days to process, as it requires culturing the bacteria, if present. I understand your concern about your commitments, Jailia. We’ll work as quickly as possible to get these results back to you. I'll have the nurse draw your blood and collect the sputum sample right away. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials that the nurse should be aware of before drawing your blood?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have no allergies whatsoever, thankfully. I have always been quite resilient. I trust the nurse is… experienced? I would prefer someone with a steady hand. And will I need to fast before the blood test? Or restrict my diet in any way? I do enjoy a good cup of chiya in the morning, and I wouldn't want to disrupt my routine unnecessarily. I assume there are certain… protocols I must adhere to, given the circumstances. Please enlighten me.
DOCTOR: The nurse is very experienced, Jailia, you're in good hands. And you do not need to fast before the blood test. You can eat and drink as normal. Regarding protocols, the nurse will explain the collection process for the sputum test. It involves coughing deeply into a sterile container three times in the morning, first thing, before you eat or brush your teeth. It's best if you can do it right here in the clinic, to ensure a proper sample. I’ll also give you a referral to a pulmonologist as a precaution, just in case the results indicate further investigation is needed. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A pulmonologist? You are… quite thorough, Doctor. Though, I confess, it is rather alarming. No, I believe I understand the process for the sputum test. Three deep coughs in the morning, before eating or drinking. And the blood test… no restrictions. It seems… straightforward enough. Though the implication, of course, is far from reassuring. Tell me, Doctor… honestly. What are you most concerned about, given my symptoms? I would prefer a candid assessment, however unpleasant it may be. I am a pragmatic woman; I can handle the truth, however difficult. Do not sugarcoat it, if you suspect something grave. I need to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Jailia, given your weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, cough, and now the tenderness in your lymph nodes and abdomen, my primary concern is ruling out tuberculosis. It’s the most likely explanation, given your grandmother’s history. However, we must also consider other possibilities, such as lymphoma, which is a type of cancer affecting the lymphatic system, or other infections. The tests will help us differentiate between these possibilities. It's important to remain calm and not jump to conclusions. We are taking all the necessary steps to get a clear diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we will be with you every step of the way. Do you have any family or friends who can support you during this time?
PATIENT: Lymphoma… you mention cancer. This is… deeply unsettling. My husband, Narayan, is… steadfast, yes. He will undoubtedly provide support. He is a practical man, and he will manage the logistics. However, he is… not one for emotional displays. He prefers action, not sympathy. I suppose I should inform him immediately. He will wish to be involved, naturally. And what… what is the next step, once the tests are complete? If… if it is something serious, what can be done? Is it… treatable? Please, Doctor, be frank. I need to know what I am facing, however difficult the reality may be. I trust your expertise, but I also need to be prepared for the worst.
DOCTOR: Once the tests are complete, we’ll discuss the results thoroughly. If it is tuberculosis, it is typically treated with a course of antibiotics for six to nine months. It’s a long treatment, but it is usually effective, especially if diagnosed and treated early. If it turns out to be lymphoma, the treatment options depend on the type and stage of the cancer. These can include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery. It’s a more complex situation, but there are many advances in cancer treatment, and many people achieve remission. I understand your fear and anxiety, Jailia. It’s natural to be worried about the unknown. I want to assure you that we will work together to develop the best possible plan, whatever the results may be. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood and explain the sputum collection process. Do you have any questions before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe I have asked everything I need to know, for now. Very well. I am ready. Let the tests begin. I trust your nurse will be… efficient. And please, Doctor, keep me informed. I prefer not to be left in the dark. I will rely on your expertise, and I will face whatever challenges lie ahead with… pragmatism, as I have always done. Inform Narayan. He will wish to be present for the results.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jailia. I will keep you and Narayan fully informed every step of the way. I'll let the nurse know you're ready. She'll be in shortly. “Nurse Sharma, could you please come to examination room three?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. Just relax, and we’ll get through this together. I’ll be right here if you need anything. .
