DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Piet. It’s Maribeth Vanderwiele. I’m here because… well, it’s my breathing. When I lie flat, it gets… difficult. It feels like something is pressing on my chest. I want to get this sorted out quickly, if we could.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Vanderwiele. Difficulty breathing when lying flat… that’s good information. And you want to get this figured out as quickly as possible, I understand. So, just to confirm, this only happens when you're lying down?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. When I'm sitting up, or even standing, I breathe just fine. It’s only when I try to lie down. It's been happening for… oh, about three weeks now, I believe. It's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Three weeks… alright. And is this a sudden onset, or did it come on gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn't a sudden thing. It started with just feeling a little… uncomfortable. Then it got worse and worse until it’s this… difficult breathing. It’s hard to explain, really. It’s not a pain, exactly. More… a pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure, not pain. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this pressure and difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. My ankles have been a bit swollen lately. Not terribly, but noticeable. And I get tired more easily, even just walking to the mailbox. But I assumed that was just… getting older. I don’t know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles and increased fatigue… okay. Those could be related. Let's take a look at those ankles. Could you please point to where you notice the most swelling?
PATIENT: Right here. It's mostly on the inside, and it’s worse at the end of the day. It goes down a little overnight, but it’s always there, even in the morning. I do try to keep my feet up when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see some swelling here. And it does feel like it pits when I press on it. Now, let's listen to your lungs and heart. Could you please take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Is that alright? I don't usually have trouble breathing now, like I said. Just when I lie down.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. Your breathing sounds clear right now, which is good. Your heart rate is a little on the faster side, but no murmurs or abnormal sounds that I detect at this moment. Now, can you tell me about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be twenty years ago. Other than that… I don’t recall anything major. I see Dr. Henderson for general checkups, but haven't been to him in about a year. Medicare covers everything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, controlled with medication, and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. And you haven't seen Dr. Henderson in about a year. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril. Twenty milligrams, once a day. And… let me see… sometimes I take Tylenol for aches and pains, but that’s it. Nothing regularly, except the Lisinopril. I’m very good about taking my pills, you know. It’s important.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I've never had any allergic reactions, thankfully. I eat everything, and I can take any medication without any trouble. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but that’s the only allergy in the family, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Given your symptoms – difficulty breathing when lying flat, swollen ankles, fatigue – and your history of controlled high blood pressure, it sounds like we need to investigate the possibility of congestive heart failure. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a BNP level, and an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity. We may also need to get a chest X-ray. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Congestive… heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood tests and an X-ray… yes, I suppose that’s necessary. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. Just… please explain everything clearly to me, if you don’t mind. I don’t understand much of this medical talk. And, how long will it take to get the results? I really would like to get this sorted out quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Vanderwiele. It can sound frightening, but it’s important to get a clear diagnosis so we can determine the best course of action. Congestive heart failure simply means your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should, which can cause fluid to build up in your body, leading to symptoms like shortness of breath and swollen ankles. The blood tests and X-ray will help us assess your heart function and rule out other possibilities. The lab work usually takes 24-48 hours, and the X-ray results are typically available within a few hours. Once we have those results, we can discuss them in detail and create a plan together. I'll have the nurse draw your blood and schedule the X-ray now. Then, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to review the results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours… I can manage that. And a follow-up appointment… yes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I hope it’s nothing too serious. Just get it sorted out quickly, please. I really do want to get back to my gardening.
