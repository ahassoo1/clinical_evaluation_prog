DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been getting harder to breathe, I suppose. Not suddenly, just… slowly. And my mouth feels very dry, and my eyes too. It’s quite uncomfortable, really. I don't… I don’t quite remember when it started, just that it's been going on for a bit now.
DOCTOR: "Slowly getting harder to breathe," you say. Hmm. And the dry mouth and eyes… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, I think. Some days are worse than others, certainly. But I find myself reaching for water quite a bit. And blinking… a lot. I don’t… I don’t recall a time when it wasn’t like this, honestly. It’s just… become normal, I suppose. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a relative term, Ms. Kobler. It's good you're bringing this to my attention now, regardless. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I… I’ve been rather tired lately. More so than usual, perhaps. And… sometimes my heart feels like it’s racing, but that doesn’t happen often. I… oh! And I have a cough, a very slight one. It's not productive, though. Just… dry. I’m… I’m sorry. I don’t seem to be very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It's alright. We'll get there. Tiredness, racing heart occasionally, and a dry cough… have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? I… I haven't really paid attention to my legs and feet, Doctor. I suppose I haven't noticed anything. I… I mostly wear boots, so it would be hard to tell, wouldn’t it? I walk a fair amount, and… my feet often ache, but I just thought that was from the walking. Is swelling… something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Okay. Boots can certainly obscure things. Swelling can be a sign of several things, so it's good we're discussing it. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical history… that’s… difficult. I was divorced a few years ago, and… things were rather chaotic then. I don’t recall seeing a doctor much during that time. Before that… I think I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. I don’t… I don’t believe I’ve ever been told I have anything specific. My… my mother had some heart trouble, I think, but I don’t know the details. I'm terribly sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Ms. Kobler. We'll do the best we can with what we have. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries or hospitalizations… no. Nothing that I recall. I… I broke my arm when I was a child, I think. But that was a long time ago, and it healed just fine. I’ve always been rather… healthy, I thought. Until… well, until recently, of course. I hope I’m not taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, you're not taking up my time. It's my job to gather this information. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there anyone else in your family with heart problems, or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had… something with his lungs, I think. He smoked a great deal. And… my aunt, she had diabetes, I believe. But beyond that… I’m not very close to my family, so I don’t know much about their medical history. I apologize. I wish I knew more. I feel terribly unhelpful. Perhaps my ex-husband would know more?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Kobler. We'll proceed with what we do know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… no. I don't take anything regularly. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take… ibuprofen, I think it is. But that’s it. I… I prefer to avoid medication if possible. I haven’t needed anything regularly before this, so I don’t have much experience with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I… I eat a lot of fish, being from the Aleutian Islands, and I’ve never had a problem with that, thankfully! I… I haven't really considered myself allergic to anything before, so I don’t think I have any. I hope that’s not… concerning?
DOCTOR: No, that’s good. Alright, Ms. Kobler. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I hope I’m not too heavy. I do enjoy a good meal.
DOCTOR: 144 pounds. And your height is 172 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. 172 centimeters. I haven’t measured myself in… quite some time, actually. It’s good to know these things, I suppose. Is everything alright? You seem… thoughtful.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Breathing sounds are a little diminished on both sides. I also detect a slight… irregularity in your heartbeat.
PATIENT: Irregular heartbeat…? Is that… bad? I… I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, as I mentioned. And sometimes a little… breathless, even when I’m not doing anything strenuous. Is that related? I’m starting to worry, Doctor. I really do apologize for being so unhelpful with my medical history. I… I just don't remember much.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Kobler. We'll figure this out. An irregular heartbeat can be caused by many things, some more serious than others. The diminished breathing sounds and your reported symptoms… suggest we need to investigate further. I want to order a few tests: a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an electrocardiogram – that's an EKG – to check your heart's electrical activity. And I'd like a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Tests… that sounds… thorough. An EKG… will it be painful? I… I’m not very good with medical procedures. And a chest X-ray… will I be exposed to… radiation? I apologize for all the questions. I’m just… a little nervous. I do trust your judgment, though, Doctor. You seem very… competent.
DOCTOR: It's alright to be nervous, Ms. Kobler. The EKG is completely painless. It involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. The chest X-ray does involve a small amount of radiation, but it's a very low dose and the benefits of diagnosing the cause of your symptoms outweigh the risks. I’ll send you to the lab and radiology department right away. They'll take care of everything. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and develop a plan. Do you have any questions about where to go or how the tests are performed?
PATIENT: No, I… I think I understand. Stickers and… a quick picture. The lab and radiology department… are they in this building? And… how long will it take to get the results? I… I have to admit, I’m rather worried about what they might find. This is all very… overwhelming. Perhaps my ex-husband would know if I should be worried? He used to be a… a fisherman. He knew a lot about the body, I think.
DOCTOR: The lab and radiology are both on the second floor. The receptionist will direct you. As for the results, it usually takes a few hours for the lab work, and the X-ray results can take a bit longer, maybe until the end of the day. We’ll review everything thoroughly when we have it all. While I understand your desire to seek information from others, I must strongly advise against relying on non-medical personnel for diagnostic advice. Your ex-husband's experience as a fisherman, while commendable, is unlikely to provide an accurate assessment of your condition. Let’s focus on obtaining and interpreting these tests before we jump to conclusions, shall we?
PATIENT: You are absolutely right, Doctor. I apologize. It’s just… I’m feeling rather lost and… I tend to ramble when I’m nervous. You’re very kind to be patient with me. Second floor… stickers… and wait for the results. I shall try to remain calm, and… not bother you with questions until after the tests. Perhaps a cup of tea would help?
