DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so I'll be brief. It’s… a problem in my mouth. It’s quite bothersome, really. It's a white coating, mostly on my tongue. I haven’t a clue what it is, and frankly, I don't have the patience to research it. I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A white coating on your tongue – how long has this been going on for, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know… a week? Perhaps a little longer. It's difficult to say. I don't pay much attention to such trivial things, to be honest. It wasn't an immediate concern until it started to… well, taste unpleasant. It’s quite distracting.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed in your routine recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Doctor, my routine is impeccable. It certainly hasn't changed. I eat well, I maintain a respectable hygiene… I assure you, this isn’t a matter of… carelessness. Perhaps it’s something I ate? Though I can’t imagine what. I only consume the finest ingredients.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Just trying to get a complete picture. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Do I look like the type? Absolutely not. I find such habits… barbaric. My wife would never allow it, either. It’s a perfectly respectable household. This is… frankly, an absurd question.
DOCTOR: Understood. And are you experiencing any other symptoms – any difficulty swallowing, pain in your mouth, or changes in your sense of taste besides the unpleasant taste with the coating?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… it is a bit more difficult to taste things, yes. Not that I eat anything particularly flavorful these days, but… it’s noticeable. And sometimes, a slight burning sensation, particularly after coffee. But I assure you, Doctor, I am not one to complain about minor discomforts. It’s simply… inconvenient. Is this getting us somewhere, or are we to continue this endless questioning?
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Mr. Schieber. Just trying to rule things out. Before we move on, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, or have taken recently?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I rarely require such things. A headache tablet now and then, perhaps. That's all. I pride myself on maintaining excellent health without relying on… pharmaceuticals. My wife handles all that, if there is anything to handle. I honestly couldn’t tell you the names of any medication I’ve ever taken. It’s beneath me. Are we finished yet? This is wasting valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to take a quick look inside your mouth. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be quick about it, Doctor. I have a rather important appointment later this afternoon. And please, try not to poke too much. It’s quite sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see a fairly extensive white coating on your tongue. It doesn’t appear to be scraping off easily, and there's no obvious redness or ulceration. Your gums look healthy. No swelling that I can see. It appears to be a coating covering most of the dorsal surface of the tongue. It doesn’t appear to be candidiasis, but we'll need to consider other possibilities.
PATIENT: See? I told you it was sensitive. So? What is it? Is it serious? I haven't a great deal of patience for vague pronouncements, Doctor. Just tell me what needs to be done to get rid of it. And quickly, if you please. I have a lunch meeting with important clients. This is most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. Based on what I’m seeing, it's most likely geographic tongue, or possibly oral lichen planus, but to be certain, I'd like to rule out other causes. A fungal infection, or even a vitamin deficiency. To do that, I’d like to order a simple oral swab to check for fungal presence, and a blood test to assess your vitamin levels, specifically B12 and iron. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? A swab? Doctor, are you quite serious? All of this for a bit of white coating on my tongue? My time is valuable, you know. I haven't got all day to be poked and prodded. Frankly, it sounds… excessive. Can’t you just prescribe something? An ointment, perhaps? I’m sure my wife has something suitable in the medicine cabinet. This is becoming rather ridiculous. .
