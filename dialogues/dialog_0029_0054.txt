DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Tati. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Cough... I got cough. Long time already. And... tired also. Very tired. Feels like... sick all the time, yeah? Sometimes nose... blocked, very blocked. Then runny. Happens a lot. I dunno... maybe sinus? My wife say sinus.
DOCTOR: Okay. A cough for a while now, fatigue, and a stuffy and runny nose. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for some time. Your wife thinks it might be a sinus issue – that's good she's paying attention. Let's try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. When you say “long time,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough... hmm... maybe six months? Or more? I dunno exactly. It comes and goes. Some days okay, some days very bad. I work... tire shop... very dusty. Maybe from dust? I forget when it really start. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or more, coming and going. And you work in a tire shop, so dust exposure is likely a factor. That's helpful to know. Forgetfulness is common, don't worry about it. So, when it is bad, what does the cough feel like?
PATIENT: Uh... when bad... it's like... wet cough. Got... stuff coming up. Yeah. And... hard to breathe sometimes. Especially at night. I gotta... sit up. Wife also complain I... loud when I cough. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a productive cough – meaning you're bringing up mucus – especially at night, and causing some difficulty breathing when lying down. And your wife has noticed it's loud. That's all good information. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches along with this?
PATIENT: Fever... not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I dunno if it's fever. Chills... not really. Body aches... sometimes. But I work hard, so maybe from work? I dunno... hard to say. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. No consistent fever or chills, occasional body aches that could be related to work. Let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss... uh... maybe a little? My wife say my pants a bit loose. But... I dunno if that's from sickness, or... something else. I eat okay. Not much change.
DOCTOR: Okay, some slight weight loss noted by your wife. That's good she's observant. Now, have you experienced any chest pain with the cough, or shortness of breath even when you aren't lying down?
PATIENT: Chest pain... not really pain, but... tight sometimes. Like someone sitting on my chest. Short of breath... a bit, when I climb stairs. But... I also not very fit, so maybe that? I dunno. Sorry, Doctor. I try to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest tightness and some shortness of breath with exertion. It’s good you're telling me everything, even if you're not sure if it's related. We'll figure it out. Let's switch gears a bit. Do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies... hmm... I dunno. Never really check. Sometimes... itchy skin. But... I think from mosquito. Not sure. My wife give me some cream... helps. I don't think I allergic to anything... seriously.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're not currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. No medications. Just... the cream for itchy skin. From wife. Sometimes panadol, for headache. But not often.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, just occasional Panadol for headaches and a cream from your wife for itchy skin. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, check your sinuses, and take your temperature. It won’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah... okay. Sounds okay. I dunno much about... lungs and heart. But... if you need, you do. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up straight and take some deep breaths for me… First, let's listen to your lungs. Okay. I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs, and some crackles. That suggests some inflammation or fluid buildup. Your heart sounds normal. Now, let's check your sinuses. Do you feel any tenderness when I press here, on your forehead and cheeks?
PATIENT: Yeah... a bit here. When you press... feel pressure. Not much pain, but... uncomfortable. Forehead... not so much. Just cheeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness in your cheeks, suggesting some sinus involvement. Your temperature is 99.3 Fahrenheit – a little elevated, but not significantly. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have bronchitis, possibly with a secondary sinus infection. The wheezing and crackles in your lungs, along with the chest tightness and sinus tenderness, point in that direction. However, given the length of time you’ve been experiencing these symptoms, and your slight weight loss, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious, like pneumonia or another underlying condition. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Okay... if you think so, Doctor. Sounds... scary. But... I trust you. I want to get better. I just... dunno much about X-ray. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious about an X-ray, but it’s very quick and painless. You’ll simply stand or sit in front of a machine that takes a picture of your lungs. There’s no discomfort involved. I'm also going to order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection and to get a better overall picture of your health. I’ll have the radiology department schedule you for both tests. They will likely be able to do them both today. After we get the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you drink plenty of fluids, get some rest, and avoid dusty environments as much as possible. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Plenty fluids... yeah, okay. Rest... hard when I work. Dusty... I try. Avoid is hard. But I will try harder. CBC... what is that? Is it... blood test? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Yes, a CBC is a blood test. It stands for Complete Blood Count. It’s a quick test where we take a small sample of your blood to check your red and white blood cell counts, which can help us identify any signs of infection or other problems. The needle prick is quick, and most people don't find it very painful, but you might feel a little pinch. We'll have a phlebotomist—a professional trained to draw blood—do it, and they'll be very gentle. It's very quick. Do you have insurance that we can bill for these tests?
PATIENT: No... no insurance. Sorry. I work... small shop. Not much money for insurance.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can discuss the costs with the lab and see if they offer a discount or a payment plan. We don't want cost to stand in the way of getting you the care you need. I'll write the orders for the X-ray and CBC, and the front desk staff will help you with scheduling and payment options. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah... understand. Emergency room... if bad. X-ray, blood test... scheduling. And talk to front desk about money. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tati. I understand, and we'll do our best to get you feeling better. We’ll get those tests done, and then we can discuss a plan to address your symptoms. Here are the orders for the X-ray and CBC. The front desk will get you scheduled. Don't hesitate to ask them any questions about the costs or scheduling. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No... I think that's all. Thank you again, Doctor. I'll go talk to front desk now.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re very welcome. Get well soon, Mr. Tati. .
