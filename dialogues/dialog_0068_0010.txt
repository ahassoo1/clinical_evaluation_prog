DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, mostly in my… I believe it’s my face, yes? It’s not terribly painful, just… noticeable. Honestly, I don’t recall exactly when it started, or what might have caused it. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. Swelling… face. And you’re unsure of the onset or any potential triggers. That’s alright, we can try to piece it together. Can you tell me where on your face is the swelling most prominent?
PATIENT: Hmm. It feels… mostly around my cheeks, I think? And perhaps a little in my jaw. It’s not… sharp swelling, more like… puffiness. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly, I’m afraid. It seems to be on both sides, equally, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Both cheeks, symmetrical… okay. Has this happened before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I… honestly, I don't believe so. My memory isn't what it used to be, so it’s possible, but I don’t recall experiencing this before. It feels new, if that makes sense. I apologize for being so… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Jahaad. These things happen. It's good you’re coming in to get it checked out. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the swelling?
PATIENT: Let me see… No fever, I don’t believe. No pain, as I mentioned. Hmm… I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual, perhaps? And… maybe a bit of a stuffy nose, but it's very mild. Nothing I would have normally considered worth mentioning, if that makes sense. I'm really trying to recall anything else, but it’s… difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright, mild fatigue, a touch of nasal congestion… and the facial swelling. Let’s just cover some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I believe I’m generally fine. I don't recall any significant allergies, no. I've never had a severe reaction to anything, that I'm aware of. I've had no issues with medications in the past, as far as I can remember. It’s really frustrating that I can’t be more precise!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I haven't been taking anything regularly. Occasionally, I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s infrequent. Otherwise, nothing at all. I try to stay away from medications when possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just want to take a look at the swelling and check a few things. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, proceed at your own pace. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could have a seat, please. I’m going to palpate your face and neck, just to assess the swelling and feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. I'll also listen to your lungs and take your blood pressure. So, tell me, is there any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain at all. Just… a bit of pressure, of course, but not uncomfortable. It doesn't feel particularly tender to the touch, at least not in any specific spot. It’s… just swollen. It feels a little warm, perhaps, but that could be my imagination.
DOCTOR: No significant tenderness, as you said. Neck feels… slightly enlarged lymph nodes, but not dramatically so. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80. Alright. The swelling is symmetrical, no acute pain or tenderness, slightly enlarged lymph nodes… It’s not immediately alarming, but we should run some tests to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. What kind of tests are you thinking of? And… is there anything I should be concerned about, or is this likely something minor?
DOCTOR: Well, it could be a number of things. A mild allergic reaction, a minor infection, or sometimes… it can be related to sinus issues. To be safe, I'd like to order a complete blood count – that will tell us if there's an infection present. I also want to rule out any thyroid issues, so a thyroid stimulating hormone test. And, just to be thorough, we’ll do a basic metabolic panel. As for concern… I don't want to alarm you, but facial swelling can be a sign of something more serious, which is why we’re running these tests. But it’s also very likely to be nothing serious. We'll know more once we have the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. If that’s what you recommend, then I’m happy to proceed with those tests. I understand you want to be thorough, and I appreciate that. I suppose… I’ll just have to wait for the results, then. How long will those take to come back? And… where will I receive them?
DOCTOR: Good. The lab work should take about 2-3 business days, typically. We'll call you with the results as soon as they’re available, or you can access them through the patient portal on our clinic website. We can provide you with instructions on how to set that up if you're not already familiar with it. In the meantime, try to avoid any known allergens. If the swelling worsens significantly, or if you develop any other symptoms like difficulty breathing or fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is very clear. Two to three business days for the results, and I can access them online or wait for a phone call. Avoid allergens, and go to the emergency room if anything changes. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel a little better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. Is there anything else I should be doing, or any questions you have for me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. And no, I think we’ve covered everything for now. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they’ll give you the necessary paperwork. Just try not to worry too much. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results.
