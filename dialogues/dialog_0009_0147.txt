DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been noticing a lump in my lower abdomen, and it’s been… well, concerning me enough to come in and get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand your concern. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It feels firm, not exactly painful, just… present. I noticed it maybe a month or so ago, and it doesn’t seem to be getting much bigger, but it hasn’t gone away either. It's about the size of a plum, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Alright, about the size of a plum, firm, and present for roughly a month, without significant change in size. And you haven't experienced any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, no pain, Doctor. It’s not tender to the touch at all. Just… a bit unsettling, you know? It doesn’t really bother me day-to-day, but I keep thinking about it. I’ve also not noticed any other changes, like with my bowel movements or anything like that.
DOCTOR: I completely understand why it's unsettling, even without pain. It's good that you haven't noticed any changes in your bowel movements, that's helpful to know. Have you experienced any other symptoms at all – like fever, weight loss, fatigue, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No fever, no weight loss, and my appetite is normal. I feel… well, as energetic as usual, I suppose. I haven’t been sleeping better than usual, but I wouldn’t say I’m particularly fatigued either. Just… normal, aside from the lump.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. It sounds like you're otherwise feeling well. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright with you. Have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Let me think… I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, quite a long time ago now. And I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but that was treated with antibiotics and I recovered fully. Other than that, nothing major, really. I've had the usual colds and flus, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in your teenage years and pneumonia a few years ago. And you recovered fully from the pneumonia. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication or food. I can eat pretty much anything without issue. My wife always jokes I have an iron stomach!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not taking any medications at all, Doctor. Nothing prescribed, and nothing over-the-counter. I try to stay away from those if I can, honestly. I prefer to let things heal naturally when possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes, but aside from that, nothing really stands out. No history of cancer that I’m aware of, on either side of the family. Both my parents are still alive, thankfully. They’re in their seventies now.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother with high blood pressure, your father with diabetes, and no known cancer history. That's helpful. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or engage in regular exercise?
PATIENT: I don’t smoke, Doctor, never have. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe a couple of times a week, but I wouldn’t say I drink heavily. And I try to stay active. I walk most days, and I enjoy gardening, which is quite physical, actually. I wouldn't say it's strenuous exercise, but it keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional wine, and regular activity with walking and gardening. That all sounds good. Okay, Amy. Thank you for all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I'll need to listen to your abdomen and palpate the area where you're feeling the lump. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment, and I want to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Amy. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently press on your abdomen to feel for the lump and assess its characteristics. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants. The lump is palpable, approximately the size you described – around a plum size. It feels firm, non-tender, and doesn't appear to be fixed to deeper tissues. There’s no guarding or rebound tenderness. It’s located in the left lower quadrant. I don’t feel any other masses. I'm also checking your lymph nodes in the groin. They are not enlarged.
PATIENT: That all sounds… reassuring, I suppose. It’s good to hear it’s not tender, and that you didn’t feel anything else. What do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it something I should be very worried about? I know you probably can’t give me a definite answer yet, but… a general idea would be helpful.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Amy, and it's good you're seeking information. Based on the exam, it's difficult to say definitively what it is without further investigation. However, the fact that it's firm, non-tender, and mobile is somewhat reassuring. Possible causes could include a lipoma – a benign fatty tumor – or a lymph node. It could also be a muscle knot or even a hernia, although the location doesn’t quite fit a typical hernia presentation. Less commonly, it could be something else, and that's why we need to investigate further. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will give us a detailed look at the area and help us determine the exact nature of the lump. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that’s what you recommend, then yes, absolutely. I’d rather know for sure, even if it’s not what I want to know. What’s involved with the scan? Do I need to do anything to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you’re comfortable with that plan. For the CT scan, you’ll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It's painless and takes only a few minutes. You will be exposed to a small amount of radiation, but the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks in this situation. To prepare, you will need to drink a contrast solution beforehand – it helps highlight the structures in your abdomen and pelvis. The solution can taste a little metallic, but it’s important to drink the entire amount to get a clear image. We’ll give you specific instructions when we schedule the scan – including when to stop eating and drinking beforehand. I’ll write the order for the CT scan now. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds perfectly alright. A metallic taste is a small price to pay, I think. And yes, please schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are in. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel much more at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease a bit. I’ll get the order sent to the radiology department, and the scheduling team will contact you to arrange the CT scan. In the meantime, if you experience any changes – like increased pain, fever, or noticeable growth of the lump – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've covered everything very thoroughly. Thank you again for your time and your clear explanations. I feel much better prepared now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could help. We’ll get those results to you as soon as they’re available. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day. .
