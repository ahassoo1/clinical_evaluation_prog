DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… hard to say exactly. I just haven't been feeling right. Mostly, I get sick to my stomach a lot. And I don't get hungry like I used to. I eat a little bit, and then I feel full right away. It’s been going on for a little while now, I reckon. Though, time… it kinda slips my mind these days.
DOCTOR: “A little while,” alright. And when you say ‘a lot,’ how often would you estimate you're feeling sick to your stomach?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… most days, I’d say. Not all day long, mind you. But several times a day, for sure. Sometimes it's just a queasy feeling, and sometimes… well, sometimes I actually throw up. It's not always throwing up, but it happens enough that I worry about it. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Several times a day… alright. And is there anything specific that seems to bring it on?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I don’t know if anything specific does. I used to be able to eat just about anything, but now… it doesn't seem to matter what it is. Soup, a sandwich, even just a little bit of fruit… sometimes it's okay, sometimes it isn't. I’ve tried to keep track, but… well, my memory isn't what it used to be. My daughter tries to help me remember, but she's busy. I mostly just try to eat something when I feel up to it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the nausea and loss of appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, I’ve been feeling a bit tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And… sometimes my stomach just hurts. Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. It comes and goes. And I… oh dear, this is hard to explain. Sometimes I feel… bloated, I guess you’d say. Like I’ve eaten too much, even when I haven’t. Now that I think about it, I have been losing weight too. But I wasn’t really paying much attention to that… I just haven't been very hungry.
DOCTOR: Losing weight… alright. And roughly, over what period of time would you say you’ve noticed this weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… hard to say. It feels like a few months, maybe? It’s not a dramatic amount, but my clothes are a little looser, and I just don’t feel as… substantial, I suppose. My daughter, bless her heart, she commented on it when she visited last month. She said I looked thinner, but I told her I was just eating lighter. Which I am, but… not because I want to. It’s just… hard to eat when your stomach feels so bad. I’m not sure if that helps… everything just feels… muddled, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen… standard things. It'll give me a better idea of what's going on. And then we can talk about some possible tests, if necessary. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. My stomach’s been awful sensitive lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, just breathe normally for me. In and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear… Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Does this feel sore anywhere?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, right there. That’s… a little tender. Not a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. And… a little lower down, on the right side too. It’s not terrible, but I can definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about over here, on the left side?
PATIENT: Not so much on the left. It's mostly on the right side that feels… off. Though, my whole stomach feels a bit swollen, even when it doesn’t hurt. It's just… uncomfortable. Like there’s something… pressing on me. I don’t know if that makes sense. Is it something serious, Doctor? I’m starting to get a bit scared.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. Based on what you’ve told me and the tenderness I’m feeling, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. It could be something relatively minor, like gastritis, but given the weight loss and nausea, we need to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and liver function tests. We’ll also need to do a stool sample to check for any infections. And I'd like to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that sounds like a lot of tests. But… if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, alright. I just want to know what’s going on. I don't like feeling like this. When can I get these tests done? And will they be very uncomfortable? I'm not very good with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. I understand your concerns. The blood work will require a few vials of blood, yes, but the phlebotomist is very skilled, and it shouldn't be too painful. The ultrasound is non-invasive – it just uses sound waves, no needles or anything like that. It might be a little cool on your skin, as they use gel, but it shouldn’t hurt at all. We can get the blood work done today at the lab downstairs. I'll write you a requisition. They’ll take the stool sample at home, and I’ll give you instructions on how to do that. The ultrasound can be scheduled for tomorrow morning. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds alright. Today for the blood work and tomorrow for the ultrasound. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. And… about the results? How long will it take to get them back? I suppose I’ll just be worrying in the meantime.
DOCTOR: It usually takes about 24-48 hours for the lab results to come back. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available. And I will schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results with you in detail. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, eat small, frequent meals, and avoid anything that seems to aggravate your stomach. If your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or bloody stools – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… please let me know what’s going on as soon as you can. I'm a bit scared, but I trust you, Doctor. Thank you for listening to me. I suppose I should go get that blood work done then?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns at all. My nurse is very good at answering questions. I’ll see you next week, Ms. Kelder. And try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
