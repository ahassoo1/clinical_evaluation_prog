DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Though, frankly, I wouldn't be here if I didn't feel it was…necessary. I'm dating someone, and I thought it prudent to get a check-up before things…progress. One simply doesn’t want unpleasant surprises, you understand.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Prudence is… admirable. So, you're seeking a general health assessment, with particular consideration to… sexual health, I presume?
PATIENT: Well, "sexual health" is putting it rather bluntly, Doctor. I simply want to ensure I am…compatible. And that he is, of course. It’s a matter of responsibility, really. One doesn’t want to be…burdened. And frankly, I expect a certain standard. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, and I’d like to know he does as well. Do you follow?
DOCTOR: Perfectly. A comprehensive assessment, then. To begin, could you describe your current health status?
PATIENT: Oh, it's quite good, actually. I'm very particular about my diet – mostly organic, lean proteins, lots of vegetables. I walk every morning, rain or shine, and I've never smoked or done any…illicit things. I have Medicare, of course, so I see a doctor regularly for the usual things – blood pressure is a bit high, but manageable, and my cholesterol is…acceptable. I take a daily vitamin. Really, I'm quite conscientious. What about him? Is there a way to…assess his lifestyle as well?
DOCTOR: We can certainly discuss options for assessing your partner's health. However, ethically, we require his consent for any examination or review of his medical history. Before we delve into that, let's focus on your medical background. You mentioned your blood pressure is somewhat elevated. Do you know what your most recent reading was, and are you currently taking any medication for that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, well, it was 138 over 85, I believe. Last month, at the optometrist. They always check it, you know. And no, I don't take medication. I prefer a holistic approach, you understand. I've been trying to manage it with diet and exercise, but it’s stubbornly resistant. It’s likely stress, to be honest. Dealing with…certain people can be quite taxing. Now, about him… surely there’s something you can do? A questionnaire, perhaps? A simple blood test? I wouldn't want to invest too much time and energy only to discover…discrepancies.
DOCTOR: A questionnaire regarding lifestyle habits is certainly possible, though it relies heavily on honest self-reporting. We can offer a standard blood panel to assess basic health markers, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. That would not, however, provide insight into… specific behaviors. Before we proceed with ordering any tests, let's review your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions other than the elevated blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, nothing chronic. I had a rather unpleasant bout of bronchitis a few years ago, but that cleared up completely. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, goodness, twenty years ago now. Other than that, perfectly healthy. I do have allergies, though – pollen, mostly. It’s dreadful in the spring. But really, I'm remarkably robust for my age. And, if I may say so, I take very good care of myself. This…situation warrants a thoroughness, wouldn’t you agree? I simply want to be certain. It’s not unreasonable, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Pandolfi, a thorough assessment is certainly prudent. You mentioned pollen allergies. Do you experience any other allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, just the pollen. It's quite manageable with an antihistamine, thankfully. Honestly, Doctor, I'm rather…uncomplicated. It's he I'm concerned about. Is there a way to discreetly inquire about his medical history? Perhaps a form he could fill out before…a more intimate acquaintance? I wouldn’t want to be…unprepared, you understand. It’s terribly awkward to discuss these things directly. A woman has a reputation to maintain, after all.
DOCTOR: We can provide a general health questionnaire that he could complete. However, it’s important to remember that the information provided will be self-reported and may not be entirely accurate. And ethically, we cannot compel him to disclose any information without his consent. Before we proceed with that, let’s discuss your family medical history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my mother had diabetes, quite severe, actually. She passed away when she was 78. And my father had heart disease – a rather nasty attack, very sudden. And my grandmother…she had some sort of cancer, I believe. It was a long time ago, and my mother didn’t discuss it much. So, yes, there's a bit of a predisposition, I suppose. That's why I'm so diligent about my health, you see. It’s all about preventative measures. Now, about this questionnaire… would it be possible to… tailor it? Perhaps include some questions about…lifestyle choices? And perhaps…screening for certain…infectious diseases? One must be cautious, after all.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can tailor the questionnaire to include questions about lifestyle choices and screening for common infectious diseases. However, please be aware that such inquiries may be sensitive, and he may be reluctant to answer. Now, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not! I find those things… vulgar, frankly. Never touched a cigarette in my life, and I have a very small glass of wine with dinner occasionally – a Chardonnay, mind you, nothing cheap. And recreational drugs? Good heavens, no! I maintain a very respectable lifestyle, as I’ve mentioned. I believe in moderation, self-discipline, and…proper conduct. It’s simply not in my nature. I'm surprised you even need to ask, Doctor. It’s rather…implying, isn’t it? Now, about this questionnaire… could we perhaps add a section about…sexual history? Just to be…thorough? It’s a matter of responsibility, you see. One must be certain.
DOCTOR: We can include a section regarding sexual history in the questionnaire, however, please understand this is a sensitive topic, and requires his full and informed consent. And it’s important to be aware that… the accuracy of self-reported information can be unreliable. Now, let’s move on to your current medications. Are you taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, as I mentioned earlier. And an occasional antihistamine for my pollen allergies. Nothing else. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible. I believe in boosting the immune system, maintaining a healthy diet, and…positive thinking. Honestly, Doctor, I'm remarkably low-maintenance. It’s he I'm concerned about. Is there any way to… discreetly verify his claims? Perhaps a blood test for…common pathogens? One can’t be too careful, you understand. It’s a matter of… protecting oneself. And, frankly, preserving one’s reputation.
DOCTOR: We can order a basic blood panel to screen for common pathogens, yes. However, please remember that a single blood test will not provide a comprehensive assessment of his health status. And ethically, we cannot conduct any tests without his knowledge and consent. Now, before we proceed with ordering any tests, let’s briefly discuss your physical activity levels. You mentioned you walk every morning. How long do you typically walk for, and at what intensity?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s a brisk walk, usually about 45 minutes to an hour. I try to maintain a good pace, you know, get my heart rate up. I live in a lovely neighborhood, very safe, and I enjoy the fresh air. It’s very invigorating. Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite active for my age. And I make sure to stretch afterward. It’s all about preventative measures, you see. Now, about this gentleman…is it possible to request a…full disclosure form? Perhaps with a section about…previous partners? One must be thorough, don’t you agree? It's simply responsible. And protecting oneself is paramount, wouldn't you say?
DOCTOR: A “full disclosure form,” as you describe it, is not standard medical practice. We cannot ethically request information about his previous partners without his explicit consent. However, we can discuss the importance of safe sexual practices and encourage open communication regarding sexual health. Now, let’s perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and palpating your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical examination is perfectly acceptable. Though, I must confess, I do have a rather low tolerance for cold stethoscopes. And I do hope your examination room is…sanitary. One can’t be too careful, you understand. And please, be gentle. I have sensitive skin. And perhaps you could explain everything as you go along? It's always reassuring to know what one is experiencing. Now, about this gentleman...if he were to accompany me for a check-up, would you be able to… discreetly assess his overall demeanor? Just a general impression, you know? To see if he appears… healthy and stable?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can certainly assess his overall demeanor during a consultation. However, please understand that this is not a formal psychological evaluation. I can observe his general appearance and behavior, but a comprehensive assessment would require a specialist referral. Now, if you’ll please lie back on the examination table, I’ll begin by checking your vital signs. I'll start with your blood pressure, and I assure you, I will warm the stethoscope first.
PATIENT: Very well. Do you have any hand sanitizer, Doctor? Just to be…certain. And please, do try to be quick. I have a rather busy schedule. Now, tell me… what sort of questions would you ask him? To get a… comprehensive understanding of his lifestyle and…previous activities? It’s all about preventative measures, you see. One must be thorough.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Regarding your partner, I would inquire about his medical history, including any chronic conditions, allergies, and medications he's currently taking. I would also ask about his lifestyle habits, such as his diet, exercise routine, alcohol and tobacco use, and recreational drug use. Regarding his sexual history, I would inquire about his number of previous partners, his safe sex practices, and any history of sexually transmitted infections. However, please understand that I cannot compel him to disclose any information without his consent, and I would respect his boundaries. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. It’s slightly elevated, as you mentioned.
PATIENT: Slightly elevated, yes. It’s likely the stress of…this situation. Honestly, Doctor, dealing with men can be quite taxing. Now, about this questionnaire… could you perhaps include a section on… emotional stability? And financial responsibility? Those are rather important factors, wouldn’t you agree? One must ensure a… secure future, you see. And I do hope he’s… vaccinated. It’s simply responsible. Now, if you don’t mind, perhaps we could expedite this process? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly include questions about emotional stability and financial responsibility in the questionnaire. And we can inquire about his vaccination status as well. However, please understand that this is not a routine part of a general health assessment. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Is there any tenderness or discomfort in this area?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. Though, I do have a rather sensitive stomach. It’s likely the stress, you see. Honestly, Doctor, men can be quite… demanding. Now, about this questionnaire…could you perhaps add a section on…family values? And career aspirations? One must ensure compatibility, you understand. And it's rather important that he have…ambition. Now, if you don’t mind, perhaps we could discuss the results of this examination? Is there anything…concerning? I do have a rather busy schedule, you see. And a luncheon appointment. It’s terribly important.
DOCTOR: The examination findings are unremarkable. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft and non-tender. The slightly elevated blood pressure is consistent with your previous readings, and likely related to stress, as you mentioned. We can certainly include questions about family values and career aspirations in the questionnaire. However, please understand that a questionnaire is only a starting point. A thorough assessment requires open communication and, ideally, a consultation with your partner. Before we conclude, do you have any other concerns or questions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I suppose that concludes everything. I trust you'll be able to prepare a… comprehensive questionnaire? One that covers all the necessary bases? And perhaps, if he agrees to a consultation, you could… discreetly assess his overall character? One must be cautious, you understand. And a woman has a reputation to maintain. And a luncheon appointment. It's terribly important. Now, if you'll excuse me… I believe I'm rather late. Perhaps we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results? But please, do expedite the process. And a comprehensive questionnaire. It's terribly important.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. We will expedite the questionnaire and schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as possible. Have a pleasant luncheon.
