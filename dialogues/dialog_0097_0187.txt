DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome in. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It's lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. My chest… it feels funny. Like… fluttering. And my head… always feels tight. The wife, she says my face is red too. I no like it. Just want quick fix, okay? I busy man.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand you're feeling some fluttering in your chest and tightness in your head, and your wife has noticed some redness in your face. You’d like to get this sorted out quickly, and I will absolutely do my best to help. First, let’s talk about this “funny” feeling in your chest. Can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Like… little birds. Flapping. Not pain, exactly. Just… annoying. And it come and go. Sometimes when I walk, sometimes just sitting. It scare wife. She make me come here. I tell you, I feel fine mostly. Just… old. Old men feel things. It not big deal.
DOCTOR: I understand. Little birds flapping, coming and going, sometimes with walking, sometimes at rest. And your wife is concerned, which I appreciate her looking out for you. It's good she brought you in. Even if it doesn’t feel like a “big deal” to you, it’s important to figure out why you’re feeling this, just to be sure. It could be a lot of things. Now, about this tightness in your head… is it a constant pressure, or does it come and go like the fluttering?
PATIENT: Come and go. Mostly when I angry. Or… when I worry. Business is hard, you know? Always someone trying to… take money. And wife… she worry too much. Makes my head hurt. It like… band tight around head. Not all the time. But enough. I take pills sometimes. The white ones. She gives them to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the head tightness comes and goes, often with stress or worry – business concerns and your wife's worries. It feels like a band around your head. And you take white pills your wife gives you when it bothers you. Do you know what those white pills are?
PATIENT: Hmph. No. She say “for pressure.” I no ask. I trust her. She… very good wife. Long time. I just… take them when she tells me. I no like medicine. Make me sleepy. But… she know best. I think. Business very important. Can't be sleepy.
DOCTOR: I understand, you trust your wife and take the pills she gives you for the pressure. It's good you have someone looking after you. It's always a good idea to know what you're taking, though, even if you trust the person giving it to you. I can look up your medication list in the computer here, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Look it up. But hurry. I got meeting this afternoon. Important people. Can't waste time with… paper. And computers. Just tell me if it's okay, or not okay. No need to explain everything. I no understand all the doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. It looks like you've been prescribed Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure. Those are both common medications for that. It's good you're taking something for it. Do you ever experience any dizziness when you stand up quickly?
PATIENT: Dizziness…? Sometimes. When I get up fast. Wife says I wobble like old tree. But… I always wobble. Old. What that have to do with… birds in chest? Just want to know if I okay. Can go back to work? Important things to do. .
DOCTOR: Okay, the wobbliness when you stand up is good information. It could be related to the medications, or something else. And I understand you’re eager to get back to work. Before I say anything about that, I'd like to just listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure quickly, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
