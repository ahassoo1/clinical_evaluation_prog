DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Uzarski. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Fourney, is it? Yes, well, it’s this tingling. It’s mostly in my hands and feet, you see. It’s been going on…oh, goodness, a few weeks now, I think. Hard to keep track these days, honestly. It’s not painful, exactly, just… annoying. Like pins and needles.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And just in your hands and feet?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Sometimes it creeps up my arms a little, but it’s not bad. And… now that I think about it, my toes feel a bit numb sometimes too. Not all the time, just…off and on. It’s worse when I’m…well, when I’ve been on my feet all day. You know, with the mail. It’s a lot of walking.
DOCTOR: You’re a mail carrier?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Been doing it…oh, almost thirty years now. Good job, usually. Keeps me moving, though maybe too much moving these days. My husband, God rest his soul, he used to worry about it. Said I’d wear myself to a frazzle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, walking that much can certainly do a number on your body. Let's try to get a better picture of this tingling and numbness. Have you noticed anything else going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been a little more tired lately, I suppose. But who isn’t, at my age? And… my balance feels a bit off sometimes. Nothing major, just… a little unsteady on my feet. It’s probably just the walking, too. I keep telling myself that. I don't want to bother you with things that are just old age.
DOCTOR: "Balance issues, fatigue – assess further." Okay. Now, have you had any injuries to your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Not that I can recall, anyway. Maybe a few scrapes and bruises over the years, you know, tripping on sidewalks or bumping into things… but nothing serious. Never broken a bone, never had to go to the hospital for anything like that. I’m a pretty careful person, usually. Though, I did twist my ankle a long time ago, maybe ten years back? But it healed up fine, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was… a while back. And the doctor told me my blood pressure is a little high, so I try to watch my salt. I take a little pill for it sometimes, when I remember. It’s… I’m not very good at remembering pills, to be honest. Other than that… not much. I used to have bad heartburn, but that’s calmed down on its own.
DOCTOR: “HTN, occasional compliance. Cholecystectomy – date unknown." Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no. I just… the little pills are white, I think. And small. The pharmacist… he knows. I go to Mr. Henderson’s pharmacy down on Elm Street. He's a good man, always reminds me when I forget. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t pay much attention to the names of things. I just take what they tell me to take.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll get that sorted out. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I used to be allergic to bees when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t been stung since I was… oh, maybe six or seven years old. I don’t think that counts, do you?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't count. Let's move on. Now, I need to do a quick physical exam. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just let me…steady myself a moment. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll step onto the table, please. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Not much response there. And now the other side. Hmm. Decreased reflexes bilaterally. Now, let's check your strength. Squeeze my hands as hard as you can. And now, push against my resistance… like you’re trying to push my hand down. Strength is… somewhat diminished in both extremities, but not significantly. Now, let me take a look at your feet. Skin is normal temperature, no edema. Sensation… Sensation is decreased to light touch in your toes and the outer edges of your feet. Let's check your balance again. Can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… I don’t like this… I feel a little wobbly. I think I’m going to fall. Yes, definitely wobbly. I told you I was unsteady. It’s worse when I close my eyes. Is something wrong, Doctor? I’m a little frightened now.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Just sit down, please. We'll take things slowly. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have some peripheral neuropathy—nerve damage in your hands and feet. The decreased reflexes, diminished sensation, and balance issues all point in that direction. It can be caused by a lot of things—diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, even certain medications. But it’s important to figure out the cause so we can treat it properly. I want to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. I also want to check for other possible causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… neuropathy? Nerve damage? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad? Will I… will I lose my legs? Blood tests… yes, that’s alright. Whatever you think is best. But… will it hurt? And… what if it is something bad? I need to keep working, you see. I have bills to pay.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Uzarski, let's not jump to conclusions. Neuropathy can be managed, often very effectively. We haven't even done the tests yet to know the cause. And most people do not lose their legs. It's rarely that severe. The blood tests will help us figure out what's going on, and from there we can discuss treatment options. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a thyroid panel. I'll also order a test to check for diabetes. The lab is just down the hall. They will draw some blood. It will be a little pinch, but it's quick. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A plan. I like that. A plan. Pinch… yes, I can handle a pinch. Just… please, let me know what’s going on. I don’t like being in the dark. And… what if it’s something expensive to fix? I don’t have much money, you see. Can you help me with that? With the costs, I mean. My husband… he always took care of things like that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, we'll address the financial aspect as well. I can't promise anything specific until we know what we’re dealing with, but our office does have some resources for patients who are struggling financially. We can look into assistance programs and payment plans. I'll have the medical assistant give you some information about that after your blood tests. Right now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. She’ll escort you down to the lab. Once the results are back—and it usually takes a few days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan—as you said. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that sounds acceptable. A few days… I can manage a few days. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… very patient with me. I appreciate it. I just… I want to keep working. I need to. It’s all I have left.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Uzarski. The medical assistant, Sarah, will be right in to take you to the lab. She's very good, and she’ll explain everything to you. And don’t worry, we’ll figure this out. Just try to relax, and we’ll take it one step at a time. I'll see you in a few days. .
