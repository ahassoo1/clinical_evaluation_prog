DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Well, it’s…family history, mostly. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she…it wasn’t good. Lots of…problems. My mom’s always been worried, and now she’s got me worried too. I just want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Preventative stuff, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very responsible of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of concern. Can you tell me a little more about the "problems" your grandmother experienced?
PATIENT: Ugh, it was a whole thing. Lots of…forgetfulness, mostly. And then she got really…weak. Couldn’t really take care of herself towards the end. My mom always said it was…something with the brain. She didn't really go into details, honestly. My mom's not a medical person, and frankly, I didn’t push it. It was just…sad. And now my mom keeps hinting I should get checked, just in case. Honestly, it’s a bit irritating, but here I am. I’m a perfectly healthy guy. Still, better safe than sorry, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. Forgetfulness and weakness… that certainly warrants a closer look, given the family history. It's good you’re here. When you say “forgetfulness,” can you give me some examples?
PATIENT: Well, it wasn't like…misplacing keys, you know? It was more…repeating herself. Asking the same questions over and over, even if you just answered them. And then…not recognizing people sometimes. Even family. It got pretty bad towards the end, honestly. Like she didn’t even know who my mom was a couple of times. It was awful. I didn’t see it a lot, because I was younger, but my mom talked about it. A lot. I mean, it's just... concerning, right? And I don’t want that happening to me. I have things to do. A career, you know? I don't have time for...that.
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely sounds concerning, and it’s good you’re taking it seriously. Repeating questions and not recognizing family are significant symptoms. It sounds like your mother is understandably worried about a possible inherited condition. Let's do a quick review of your own health history, just to get a baseline. Have you personally experienced any memory problems, difficulty concentrating, or changes in your thinking?
PATIENT: No, not really. Look, I’m an engineer. I deal with complex problems all day. My brain is fine. I haven't forgotten anything important, haven’t gotten lost or confused. I mean, maybe I forget where I put my phone sometimes, but who doesn’t? Honestly, I think my mom is just…overreacting. She worries about everything. But she insisted I get checked, and, well, here I am wasting my time. I have a grant proposal due next month, and this is taking up a whole morning. I’m perfectly healthy, I tell you. I eat reasonably well, I exercise, I sleep enough…it's probably just genetics being…genetics. A false alarm. I'm sure of it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Blain, and I appreciate you explaining your perspective. It’s good to hear you're not experiencing any current cognitive difficulties. However, given your family history, it’s important to rule out any potential concerns, even if you feel perfectly healthy. We'll do a brief examination and some basic cognitive screening tests. This won’t take long, and it will give us a clearer picture of your baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. I guess. But if it's just going to be a waste of time, I’m letting you know now. I have things to do. I’m a busy person. Just…get it over with, okay? I’m trusting you won’t keep me here all day. And please don’t ask me to draw a clock. I’ve seen those videos online. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I won’t keep you longer than necessary. And no clock drawing, I promise. Let's start with a few simple questions, then we'll do a brief physical exam. First, can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: It’s…August 2nd, 2025. Obviously. Are you serious with these questions? It’s written on the form I filled out. This is insulting. I am an engineer, not…incapacitated.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Blain. My apologies. I am simply following protocol. Let’s move on. Can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Look, this is… urban. I told the receptionist when I checked in. And I can see buildings out the window. Is this some kind of test to see if I’m…stupid? Because it’s not working. I’m perfectly aware of my surroundings. I'm an intelligent man. I design things. Complex things. This is a complete waste of my time. Frankly, I'm starting to get a little annoyed.
DOCTOR: Blain, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if these questions seem insulting. I assure you, that is not my intention. We are required to follow a standardized assessment process, even when a patient feels perfectly healthy. It’s simply to establish a baseline and rule out any potential concerns. However, given your clear distress and assertion of full cognitive function, I’m going to adjust our approach. Instead of continuing with these tests, let’s focus on a physical exam. We’ll check your vital signs, neurological function, and general health. Does that sound more acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds acceptable. Just…get on with it. The physical exam. I have a grant proposal to write, you know. I don't have all day to sit here being interrogated. And please, no more questions about the date or what city I'm in. It's ridiculous. Just…examine me. And be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your vital signs. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Please relax your arm for me. Your vitals are all within normal limits. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and another one. Everything sounds clear, and your reflexes are normal. Now, I'll do a quick neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. See? Perfectly fine. This is all a waste of time, honestly. Are you going to ask me to walk a straight line next? Because I'm not doing it. I’m an engineer, not a… suspect in a sobriety test. Just tell me I'm healthy and let me go. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: You’re doing very well, Blain. Your eye movements are excellent. And I understand your frustration. Based on the brief physical and neurological exam, there are no obvious concerns. However, given your family history of cognitive decline, I would still recommend a baseline cognitive assessment, preferably with a neuropsychologist. This would give us a more comprehensive understanding of your current cognitive function and allow us to monitor any potential changes over time. Would you be open to a referral for a neuropsychological evaluation?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve told you, I’m perfectly fine. I’m an engineer. I solve complex problems all day. My brain is functioning at peak efficiency. A neuropsychological evaluation is…insulting. It implies I have something wrong with me, and I don't. I’m wasting my time here already. I came for peace of mind, and all I’m getting is a patronizing examination and a suggestion that I'm somehow deficient. Look, I appreciate your time, but I think I’m done. Just…tell me I’m healthy, write a note saying I came for a family history check, and let me go. I have a grant proposal to finish. And honestly, I think I’m starting to feel a bit stressed out, which isn't helping my “peak efficiency,” now is it? So, please. Let's wrap this up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Blain. As you requested, I will document that you presented for a family history check related to potential cognitive decline, and that your physical and neurological exam were within normal limits. You expressed no current cognitive concerns and declined further neuropsychological evaluation. I understand your frustration and respect your decision. However, I strongly recommend you reconsider in the future, especially if you or your family notice any changes in your memory or cognitive function. Here is a copy of my notes for your records. Please contact the clinic if you have any questions. I wish you the best of luck with your grant proposal. .
