DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this… feeling full real quick when I eat. Doesn't matter what it is, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I've had a big meal, you know? It's been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling full very quickly, even with small amounts of food… and you said this has been happening for about a month?
PATIENT: Yeah, about a month. It’s… strange. I used to have a good appetite, always did. My wife, Elsie, she keeps saying I’m not eating enough now. And she's probably right, but it’s not like I want to feel stuffed, you know? It just… happens. It's not painful, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable, not painful… that’s good to know. And it’s not related to any particular food, you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I can tell. Fish, chicken, soup… doesn't matter. Elsie makes a lovely salmon chowder, and I can barely get a bowl down these days. Used to love it. And even something simple like toast… a couple of bites and I’m done. It’s just… everything.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you experienced any other changes alongside this, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been a little tired lately, but I'm eighty-eight, so… that could just be old age, right? Elsie says I've been a bit more quiet too, but she always says that when I don't talk about the weather enough. Not sure if that counts. No stomach pain, no… well, nothing else really.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, a little quieter… those are good things to mention. And no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Everything’s… regular, you could say. Just this full feeling. It’s really the only thing bothering me. It’s just… frustrating, not being able to enjoy my food like I used to. And Elsie worries. She’s a good woman, Elsie.
DOCTOR: It sounds quite frustrating indeed, Mr. Obarr, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, back in ’58, I think it was. And the doctor said I had high blood pressure a few years back, but he put me on some pills, and it seemed to sort itself out after a while, so I stopped taking them. Elsie always said I should go back, but I felt fine. Nothing major, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy in 1958, and high blood pressure that resolved with medication… and you stopped taking the medication when your blood pressure improved, is that correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. Felt good, stopped taking the pills. Elsie wasn’t happy, but… I felt fine! And I go to the dentist regular, if that counts. Had a filling last year. Didn’t enjoy that much. But good teeth, all things considered. My mother always said good teeth meant a long life.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the dental care, Mr. Obarr. And it’s helpful to know about the blood pressure. Now, do you take any medications currently, besides the occasional pain reliever perhaps?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing regular. Maybe a couple of aspirin if my knee’s acting up, but that’s it. And Elsie gives me vitamins, but I forget to take them half the time. She means well, she really does. But I mostly just stick to eating what I can, and trying to stay active. Though it’s getting harder these days, with this full feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, occasional aspirin, and vitamins you don’t always take. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Elsie always asks when we go to a new restaurant, but I always tell her, “No allergies, dear.” And I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to help my father with his bee hives when I was a boy, and never got stung too bad. Though I didn’t particularly like being near the bees, mind you. But no allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, Mr. Obarr, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Have any close family members—parents, siblings, children—had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father, he had a bit of trouble with his heart in his later years. Had to slow down a lot. And my mother, she had arthritis, bad in her hands. Couldn’t knit anymore, which was a shame, she made lovely sweaters. My sister, she's still alive, bless her, she's got diabetes, but she manages it okay with her pills. And my son… he’s healthy as a horse, thank goodness. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. Father with heart trouble, mother with arthritis, sister with diabetes, and son healthy. Now, Mr. Obarr, before we move on to a brief physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I used to be a fisherman, out on the ocean for weeks at a time. That was hard work, but good work. Now I’m retired, mostly just take it easy. I live with Elsie, like I said. We garden a bit, I read the newspaper, and I like to watch the baseball. The Blue Jays are having a good season, so that’s nice. Not much travel these days, too old for that. Mostly just stay close to home. I don't smoke, never have. And I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A nice red wine.
DOCTOR: Retired fisherman, live with Elsie, enjoy gardening, reading, and baseball… and a glass of red wine with dinner. That’s good to know. Now, Mr. Obarr, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold or anything. My skin's gotten a bit thin these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Obarr. I will make sure everything is comfortable. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. No tenderness to palpation, no obvious masses. Your abdomen is soft. I'm also noting your weight is 54 kilograms. All seems within normal limits, but given your symptoms, I'd like to order some blood work. Just to rule out any underlying causes for your early satiety. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps figure things out. Elsie will be pleased I’m getting checked out properly. She worries about me, you know. So yes, blood work is fine. What do I need to do? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, a fasting blood test would be best, Mr. Obarr. That means no food or drink, except water, for about eight to twelve hours before the test. I’ll give you a requisition form to take to the lab. It’s just down the hall, and they’re very good there. We’ll be checking your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and thyroid levels. These will help us get a better understanding of what might be causing your early fullness. Once the results are back – usually a few days – we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Eight to twelve hours… I can manage that. I'll make sure Elsie knows too, so she doesn't try to sneak me a biscuit. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, Doctor Pirl. I appreciate it. And thank you for being so kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It was my pleasure. And don’t worry about Elsie and the biscuits – a little indulgence is fine now and then. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Here’s my card. I’ll see you soon.
