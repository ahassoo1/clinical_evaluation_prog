DOCTOR: Good morning, Zoie. My name is Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Nice to meet you too. Um... what did you say your name was again? Beinborn? It's just… getting old, you know. Things slip. Anyway, I’m having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s hard to start, mostly. And it feels like I don’t get everything out, if you know what I mean. It’s been… a while now. A few weeks, maybe? Longer? I can’t really say for sure.
DOCTOR: Beinborn is correct, yes. And it's perfectly normal for things to slip as we get older, Zoie. Don’t worry about remembering. So, you’re experiencing difficulty starting urination, and it feels like you’re not completely emptying your bladder?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Emptying… yes. That's the word. Not empty. It’s… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly. Just… not right. And I have to… push a little. I don’t usually have to push. My husband, he says I’ve been going more often too, but I haven’t really been keeping track. He worries, you see. He always worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty starting, feeling incomplete emptying, needing to push, and your husband has noticed increased frequency. Has there been any change in the color or smell of your urine, or have you noticed any blood when you go?
PATIENT: Blood? No, no blood. I don't think so, anyway. I haven’t really… looked, if you get my meaning. I just go. And it looks… yellow. Always yellow. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I thought that was just from not drinking enough water. Old people don't drink enough water, you know. We forget. Smell… I don't know about the smell. It smells like… pee. Is that a silly answer? I'm sorry, I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Zoie. It's helpful to know what you haven't noticed, as well as what you have. Darker urine can be from dehydration, you’re right. Okay. And just to get a better picture, have you had any fever, chills, lower back pain, or any new abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I know of. I haven’t been feeling sick. Chills… sometimes I get a little cold, but that’s just the house. Old houses are drafty. And my back… well, my back always hurts a little. Just old age again. I don't think it's new pain, if that makes sense. Like, it's always been a bit achy. Abdominal… is that your tummy? No, no tummy pain. Just… everything feels a bit tired, if you know what I mean. Everything just feels… old.
DOCTOR: I understand, Zoie. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with some general discomfort. Alright, let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, but nothing serious. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I don’t think I am. I’ve been stung a few times and I was fine. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, that's all. The doctor gave it to me years ago. I can’t remember the name of it. Everything’s a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no known drug allergies, no food allergies, and you take a medication for your blood pressure but don’t recall the name. That’s alright, we can look that up in your records. And just to confirm, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… oh dear. That’s a hard one. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. And… I think I had a gallbladder taken out. Or was that my sister? Oh, this is so confusing. I had a baby, of course. Two babies, actually. Does that count as surgery? It felt like it at the time! I really can’t remember much beyond that. Everything is just… mixed up. My husband says I tell the same stories over and over.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable that it's difficult to remember details from so long ago, Zoie. We have your records here, so we can try to piece things together. It looks like you did have your tonsils removed as a child, and you had your gallbladder removed in 1988. No other surgeries listed. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother, she had… high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had a bad heart. He died young, poor man. My sister, she had… arthritis, I think. Her hands were always swollen. And my brother… he was healthy as a horse, always running around. No problems at all. I don't know much beyond that, really. We didn't talk about health much when I was growing up. It wasn't polite, you see. Just… didn’t talk about it. My husband knows more, I think. He remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of high blood pressure and heart issues in your family, and arthritis in your sister. That’s helpful to know. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… what does that mean? Like, do I have friends? Yes, I have a few friends. We used to play bingo together, but most of them have… well, they've gone to a better place. I mostly stay home now. My husband, he takes care of me. We watch TV and… well, that's about it. I used to be a nurse's aide, years and years ago. Worked at the hospital. But I’m retired now. I don’t go out much. It’s too much trouble, you see. Everything is too much trouble these days. Do you need to know more? I'm not a very exciting person.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfect, Zoie. Thank you. It's helpful to have a general understanding of your lifestyle. Okay, one final question for now. Have you been using any over-the-counter medications, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I take a little something for my aches and pains, sometimes. It's… ibuprofen, I think. The white pills. My husband gets it for me at the store. And I take a vitamin D pill, the doctor told me to. For my bones, you know. Old people need strong bones. That's about it, I think. I don’t really trust those herbal remedies. Too many strange things in them. I stick to what the doctor gives me, mostly. Do you need to know more? I’m probably forgetting something. Everything is a blur these days.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, Zoie. You’ve given me a lot of good information. Ibuprofen for aches and pains, and Vitamin D. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam? Yes, that's fine, dear. Just… be gentle, please. My bones aren't what they used to be. And don’t be surprised if I wince a little. Everything aches, you know. What are you going to do? Will it hurt? My husband always tells me to ask questions. He says I'm too trusting. He worries so much. Just… tell me what you're doing, okay? That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. I’ll explain everything as I go and be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness. And finally, I’ll do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… a lot. But if you’re going to do it, I suppose I should let you. Just… take your time, dear. And tell me what you’re doing, okay? I don’t like surprises. My husband says I’m a bit of a worrier myself. And… is this going to take long? I was hoping to have my tea this afternoon. He makes a lovely cup of tea, you know. But if you need to poke and prod, I suppose I can wait. Just… be gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. We'll take it slowly. First, I’m just wrapping this cuff around your arm to check your blood pressure. It will tighten for a moment, but it shouldn’t be painful. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that’s not uncommon, and we can discuss that later. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels tender or painful. I notice a little tenderness when I press here in your lower abdomen, but it doesn't seem to be anything severe. Finally, I’ll just check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems within normal limits so far, but I'd like to do a quick urine test to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A urine test? Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding. Well, if you think it’s necessary, I suppose I can do it. It’s just… I hate going to the bathroom on demand. It never works when I’m trying to. But if you need it, I’ll try. Just… tell me what I need to do. And where do I go? Will it be… embarrassing? My husband always says I worry too much. He’s probably right. Just… tell me. Please.
DOCTOR: It's not about poking and prodding, Zoie, just a simple sample. It won't be embarrassing at all. I'll give you a small cup and a private bathroom right here. You just need to collect a small amount of urine in the cup. There are instructions in the bathroom, and I can explain them again if you need me to. It's perfectly normal, and we do it all the time. I'll just step out so you have some privacy, and I'll be right outside when you're finished. Take your time, and don't worry about it.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A small cup, you say? I hope I can do it. It’s just… everything is so complicated these days. Well, I’ll try. Thank you, dear. You’re very patient with an old woman like me. Just… let me know if you need anything. And… where should I leave the cup when I’m finished? I don’t want to make a mess. My husband would be so upset. .
