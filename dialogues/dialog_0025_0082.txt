DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… travel? I need… something for travel. My wife and I… we were planning a trip. Well, were. Now it’s just me. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Travel, alright. And you said "were"?
PATIENT: Yeah. She… she passed. A while back. We booked the tickets before… everything. I still want to go. Feels important, you know? But… I don’t know what shots I need or anything. It’s… Thailand. We were going to Thailand.
DOCTOR: Thailand. Right. Well, that’s… a considerable distance. And depending on where in Thailand you’re going, the recommendations will vary. Let's start with the basics. Have you had any travel vaccinations before, Odell?
PATIENT: Vaccinations? I… I don't remember. Maybe? It was a long time ago. Before… before my wife got sick, maybe. I don’t really… keep track of things like that. Is it important? I just want to be… safe.
DOCTOR: "Safe" is… relative, Odell. Of course it's important. You’re traveling to a region with a completely different disease profile than what you’re used to here. Let me pull up your records… Hmm. Nothing documented here regarding travel vaccines. Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need you to be as specific as possible. Have you ever been to Thailand before?
PATIENT: No. Never. First time. We… we always talked about it. Beaches, temples… all that. She picked it out. Everything. I just… went along. Don't know much about it, really.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that simplifies things a little. Now, do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. Maybe… sometimes my stomach gets upset? But that’s probably just… food. Nothing serious. No hives or… breathing problems or anything.
DOCTOR: "Probably just food" isn’t a medical diagnosis, Odell. But alright. Any current medications you're taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Just… for my blood pressure. The doctor gave me… a little orange pill. I take one every morning. That’s it. Nothing else. Just the orange pill.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what is the name of that orange pill, Odell?
PATIENT: I… I don’t remember the name! The doctor just told me to take it. It's… small. Orange. That’s all I know! I don't keep track of these things! I just take it, okay? My blood pressure gets… high sometimes. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It is a problem that you don't know what medication you're taking, Odell. We need to know this information for your safety, especially when considering travel and potential interactions. Do you have any way to find out?
PATIENT: No. I… I threw out the bottle. After I filled the prescription. Didn’t need the… the paper. Just take the pill, that’s what the doctor said. I’m sorry. I just… I’m not good with this stuff. I just want to go to Thailand. Is there a shot for… missing a pill?
DOCTOR: There is no shot for “missing a pill”, Odell. Look, I'm going to need you to contact your primary care physician and get the name of that medication. Until we know what you're taking, I cannot advise you on travel vaccinations. It's irresponsible to proceed without that information. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. I’ll… I’ll call him. But… it’s going to be a hassle. He’s always busy. Can’t we just… do something else? Like… give me a general shot? For everything? Just… to be safe? I really need to go to Thailand. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: "A general shot for everything" is not how medicine works, Odell. It's… frankly, a rather naive suggestion. Each vaccine targets specific diseases. Giving you a cocktail of unnecessary vaccines is not only ineffective but could be harmful. Look, I understand you want to go to Thailand, but we need to proceed responsibly. I’m documenting that you are unwilling to provide medication list. Until you can provide that information, I strongly advise you postpone your trip. Do you want me to refer you to a travel clinic?
PATIENT: No! No travel clinic. They’ll just tell me the same thing. Look, I’ll… I’ll call my doctor. Tomorrow. Promise. But… can’t you just give me something in the meantime? Like… a broad-spectrum antibiotic? Just in case? I've heard those are good. For… everything. I’ll be careful. I really need to go. It’s… It’s all I have left.
DOCTOR: I am documenting your request for a broad-spectrum antibiotic without a clear indication, and my refusal. That is not appropriate medical practice. I strongly advise against self-treating with antibiotics, as it can lead to antibiotic resistance and other complications. I will provide you with a list of reputable travel clinics in the area, and I strongly recommend you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Until you can provide a medication list and consult with a travel specialist, I cannot assist you further. This visit is now concluded.
