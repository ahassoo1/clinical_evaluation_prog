DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, my blood pressure’s been a little high lately, that’s what the nurse said when she took it. It’s been botherin’ me some, so I figured I’d get it checked out. Don't rightly know much about it, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna, that’s perfectly alright. It's good you came in to get it looked at. The nurse did mention your blood pressure was a little elevated. We'll get to the bottom of it. To start, can you tell me a little more about when you’ve noticed feeling this bother, and what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm... when, you say? It ain’t a constant thing. Seems to come and go. Mostly when I’m bakin’, actually. When I'm rushin' around gettin' things done for orders, I get a little… flustered, I guess you’d call it. And then my head feels kinda full, and I get a little dizzy sometimes. Not fall-down dizzy, just… woozy. It usually goes away if I sit down for a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like it’s related to activity, specifically when you're baking and feeling stressed with orders. And you experience a feeling of fullness in your head and some dizziness. That’s helpful to know. Now, has this been happening for a long time, or is it something new?
PATIENT: Oh, it ain’t new new. It's been comin' on and off for... well, maybe a year or so now? I mostly just ignored it, thought it was just gettin' old. But it’s been happenin’ more lately, and I figured I oughta get it checked. My late husband, bless his soul, always said I worried too much. Maybe that’s part of it too.
DOCTOR: It’s good you decided to come in now, Venna. Ignoring things doesn’t usually make them go away! And it's certainly possible that worry plays a part. Let's talk a little bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with livin’ ninety years! Arthritis in my hands, mostly. Makes bakin' a little harder sometimes, but I manage. And my eyesight ain't what it used to be, but I got glasses. Other than that… no, I’m pretty healthy for an old woman, I think. I’ve always been a worker, always keepin’ busy.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you’ve stayed so active. Arthritis and vision changes are good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder out… goodness, must be thirty years ago now? And I broke my wrist once when I was a little girl, fallin’ out of a tree. But that healed up fine. That's about it, I think. It was a long time ago, so my memory ain’t the best.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We have your records here, and I can see both of those procedures noted. Now, thinking about your family – are there any health problems that run in your family, like heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mama, she had a weak heart, I think. Didn't live to be very old. And my brother, he had somethin’ with his blood sugar, had to watch what he ate. Other than that… not really. A lot of us just… wore ourselves out workin’. Mostly farmers, you know? Hard livin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good start. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anythin'. I can eat pretty much anythin' you put in front of me! Though, I don't eat a whole lot of sweets these days, even though I bake 'em all the time. Makes my teeth ache.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my arthritis. It’s called… … Diclofenac, I think? A little white pill. And sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I forget most of the time. Mostly I just try to eat a good diet. Mostly fruits and veggies from my garden when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Diclofenac for arthritis and an occasional multivitamin. That's helpful. Now, to get a better picture of things, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I've had doctors poke and prod me my whole life, so I'm used to it. Just try not to poke too hard! My bones are kinda brittle these days.
DOCTOR: I'll be very careful, Venna. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Then I'll check your pulse and blood pressure again. After that, I’ll take a look in your ears and eyes, and briefly check your reflexes. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Pulse is 72 and regular. Blood pressure is 148 over 82, still a little elevated. Ears are clear bilaterally. Eyes show some expected age-related changes, but no acute concerns. Reflexes are slightly diminished, which is normal for your age. Overall, your exam is largely normal for a woman of your age, but the elevated blood pressure does warrant further attention.
PATIENT: Well, that don’t sound too bad, I reckon. Just this high blood pressure thing. What does that mean, exactly? Is it somethin’ serious? I'm not wantin' to end up bedridden, that’s for sure. I got bakin' to do!
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking questions, Venna. High blood pressure, or hypertension, means that your blood is pushing too hard against the walls of your arteries. It doesn't always have symptoms, which is why it's important to check it regularly. It can be serious if left untreated, because it can put extra strain on your heart and other organs, increasing your risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney problems. But it’s also very manageable, and we have lots of ways to treat it. Before we talk about treatment options, I'd like to order a few lab tests, just to get a more complete picture of your overall health and rule out any other underlying causes for your high blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lab tests… well, I don’t like needles much, but if you think it's necessary... Alright, go ahead. Whatever it takes to keep me bakin’. What kind of tests are we talkin’ about? And how long will it take? I got orders to fill, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Venna. It's never fun getting poked. We'll just need a routine blood panel, which checks your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. We'll also check your electrolytes. It’s a standard set of tests. It won’t take long, maybe 15-20 minutes at the lab. And the results usually come back within a few days. We can schedule those for tomorrow morning if that works for you. In the meantime, I’d like to recommend a few lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure. Things like reducing your salt intake, eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and getting regular exercise – even a gentle walk each day can make a difference. And managing stress is important, too. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Well, walkin’ I can do. Always liked a good walk in the garden. Fruits and veggies… I already eat plenty of those, mostly what I grow myself. Salt… I guess I use a little too much, old habits die hard. Stress… …That’s the hardest part, Doctor. Runnin' a bakin' business all by myself, tryin' to keep up with orders… it gets to you sometimes. Tomorrow mornin' for the tests sounds fine. Just let me know where to go. And you said somethin' about treatment options? Is that pills? I don’t like takin’ a whole lot of pills.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're already making healthy choices with your diet and walking. And managing stress is key. We can discuss strategies for that as well. As for treatment options, yes, medication is often used to lower blood pressure if lifestyle changes aren't enough. But we'll wait to see what your lab results show first. Sometimes, just knowing the numbers and making a few adjustments can make a big difference. There are different types of medications, and we can discuss the pros and cons of each if it becomes necessary. We’ll start with the least invasive options first. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The nurse will give you a requisition form, and they'll take care of the rest. For now, let’s focus on those lifestyle changes. And we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss your lab results and see how you're feeling. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Lifestyle changes and see what the tests say. I can do that. A week from today… alright. I suppose I better go get this blood drawn then. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful, even if it is all a bit worryin'. I reckon I'll go see the nurse now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. Don’t hesitate to come to the nurse with any questions or concerns. And remember, we're in this together. We'll take it one step at a time. Have a good day, and I'll see you next week.
