DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache, starting about three days ago… dull ache, comes and goes. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It's… hard to say exactly when it comes. Not with anything special. Just… poof. There. Then gone for a while. I was working on the rail yard, like always, when it started. Moving cars around, you know? Not lifting nothing heavy, just… checking the brakes and things. It's not the worst pain, but it bothers me when I try to sleep. Makes it hard to rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started while you were working at the rail yard, doing lighter tasks… checking brakes, not heavy lifting. And it's affecting your sleep. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse besides trying to sleep?
PATIENT: Hmmm… worse? Let me think. The sun, maybe? When it’s really bright. Makes it feel… sharper. And if I bend over too fast, sometimes it gives me a little… dizzy feeling. But not every time. Mostly just the sun. And trying to sleep, of course. That's the worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bright sunlight seems to aggravate it, and bending over can cause some dizziness. Any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… No, I don’t think so. No fever. No… blurry vision. Nothing like that. Just the headache. And a little tired, maybe, because of not sleeping well. Old man problems, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Not exactly like this. I get little ones sometimes, when I’m stressed. From the work, you know? But those go away quick. This… this is different. It sticks around longer, and it’s in the back of my head. Not on the sides, like the others. Back, back here.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this headache is different in location and duration compared to your usual stress headaches. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really. I’m an old man, so the usual aches and pains, you know? My knees bother me when it rains. But no… no diabetes, no heart trouble. Nothing the doctor ever told me was serious. And I don’t take no pills, except sometimes for the knees, when they really bother me. Just the over-the-counter kind. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major medical conditions, just occasional knee pain treated with over-the-counter ibuprofen. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was a young man, I broke my arm. Fell from a tree, trying to get mangoes. But that was… a long time ago. They fixed it good, though. No problems with it now. Nothing else. No surgeries. Never needed them.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a young man, fully healed. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a hard one, Doctor. My family… we didn’t go to the doctor much. Not back in Guatemala. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. But I don’t know for sure. And my father… he just worked hard and died old. No fancy illnesses. I don’t remember anyone with… bad headaches or anything like that. It was a long time ago. Hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, limited family medical history available. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything the doctor gave me. Not even when they fixed my arm. I remember a little bit of dizziness after the medicine, but not… a rash or trouble breathing or anything like that. Just a little wobbly. I don’t have allergies, Doctor. I eat everything. Even spicy food!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check things out. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam – that’s just checking your reflexes and things like that. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: “Okay, your reflexes are a little slow, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Cranial nerves are all intact. I’m going to check your range of motion in your neck.” “Any pain with this?
PATIENT: A little bit, Doctor. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. Feels like the headache, but… more in my neck now. Especially when you bend it back like that. It's not terrible, but I can feel it. Like a tight muscle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some tenderness in your neck, which could be contributing to the headache. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by some neck muscle strain. The elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor as well. I'm going to recommend a few things. First, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the headache. Make sure you follow the dosage instructions on the label. Second, I'd like you to try some gentle neck stretches and exercises. I can give you a handout with some examples. And third, I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. If you don’t have a blood pressure cuff, you can come back in a week, and we can check it here again. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. I can try the stretches and the pills. And I can come back in a week to check the blood pressure. I don't have one of those… blood pressure things. A week sounds fine. Will that help me sleep better, you think? That's what I need most.
DOCTOR: Hopefully, managing the headache will improve your sleep. It’s often a vicious cycle – the pain keeps you awake, and lack of sleep makes the pain worse. I'll write down a prescription for a handout with the neck stretches, and a note to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to check your blood pressure. If the headache gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, please come in sooner. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you. And thank you for listening to an old man ramble.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It was my pleasure. It’s important to me that I listen to your concerns. Here's the handout with the exercises. And the nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Get some rest, and please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too. Have a good day. .
