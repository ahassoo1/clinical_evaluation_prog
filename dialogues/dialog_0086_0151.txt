DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s this… tingling. It’s in my hands, mostly. Been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. I just want to know what it is, you know? It’s not painful, just… strange.
DOCTOR: “A little while now…” Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… well, let me think. Maybe… three, four months? It started very faintly, I barely noticed it at first. Just a little pins and needles when I was sorting mail. Now it’s… more consistent. Especially after a long shift. I’m a mail carrier, you see. Lots of walking, lots of handling things.
DOCTOR: A mail carrier, right. And it's worse after work... Is it both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: Both hands, yes. Not exactly equal, though. My right hand feels it more, the one I sort with. Sometimes it goes up my arm a little, too. It’s hard to explain… it’s not constant pain, like a cramp or anything. More like… when your foot falls asleep, but not as strong. And it doesn't stay asleep, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does anything relieve it?
PATIENT: Well… resting helps. When I sit down and put my hands up for a bit. Warm water, sometimes. I’ll run them under the tap. But it always comes back, you know? It doesn’t stay gone. And honestly, Doctor, I just keep hoping it’ll go away on its own. I’m not one for fussing over things.
DOCTOR: “Not one for fussing…” Right. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. I still carry the mail, don’t I? Heavy bags and all. I might drop things a little more often than I used to, but honestly, I’m 63! Things slip sometimes. It’s just getting old, I figured. I don’t want to make a big deal out of nothing.
DOCTOR: Well, let’s have a look then. Just to be thorough. If you don't mind. I'll need to do a quick physical exam. Please sit here and extend your arms.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. I suppose. I really don’t like doctors, you know. Never have. But… if you think it’s best. Just be quick, please?
DOCTOR: Alright. Squeeze my hands now, as hard as you can. Both of them. And tell me if you feel this, or if you feel this… Okay, and now close your eyes. I’m going to move your thumb like this… tell me which direction I’m moving it.
PATIENT: There… is that alright? Up… no, down… wait, is that up again? Oh, goodness, this is harder than it looks! I'm not very good at this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your grip strength is… within normal limits, but slightly weaker on the right side. And the sensation is a bit diminished in your fingertips, also on the right. It’s not about being “good” at it, it’s about reporting what you feel. But alright. Let's move on. Do you have any neck pain?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Weaker on the right… that doesn’t sound good, does it? Neck pain… sometimes. A little stiffness, mostly in the mornings. I just thought it was sleeping wrong. It’s not bad pain, just… achy. Especially after a long day carrying those bags. You know, it’s a heavy job.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, neck pain can sometimes refer pain down the arm. It’s not uncommon. Do you have any history of arthritis, or any other joint problems?
PATIENT: Arthritis… no, not that I know of. My mother had some trouble with her hands when she got very old, but I never had any real problems. Just a little stiffness sometimes, like I said. I try to stay active, you know? Walking the route keeps me moving. I don't sit around feeling sorry for myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh goodness, Doctor, what does that even mean? I haven't been very social lately, not since my husband passed. Mostly just me and the mail route, to be honest. I don't drink, I don't smoke... never have. I used to go to church sometimes, but... it's hard.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to avoid them if I can. Pills always make me feel worse. I'd rather just tough it out, if you know what I mean. Are we almost done?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it could be carpal tunnel syndrome. The tingling, the weakness, the neck pain… it all fits. But to be certain, we’d need to do some nerve conduction studies. That would involve a referral to a neurologist. Of course, it could also just be a pinched nerve, or age-related changes. We can try some conservative treatment first: wrist splints, over-the-counter pain relievers, and physical therapy. But if it doesn’t improve, we will need to explore further. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Carpal tunnel… Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. A neurologist? More doctors? Oh, goodness. I really don’t like the sound of that. Wrist splints… I suppose I could try that. I don’t want to go running around to a bunch of specialists if I don’t have to. Allergies… no, not that I know of. I haven’t taken anything in years, so I wouldn't have noticed. Do you think… do you think it could just go away on its own?
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, I can't guarantee anything. It might improve on its own, but it's unlikely, given how long you've been experiencing these symptoms. I'm going to recommend the wrist splints for a month, and I'll write you a prescription for ibuprofen, just in case. If it doesn't improve within a month, or if it worsens, then we will need to consult a neurologist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A month… alright. Wrist splints and ibuprofen. I understand. I just… I don’t want to make a big fuss. I have a route to walk, you know? People are counting on me. Will you… will you write all that down for me? So I don’t forget?
DOCTOR: Here you are. Wrist splints, over-the-counter ibuprofen as directed. If no improvement in one month, call the office to schedule a referral to neurology. I’ll also send you a printout with information about carpal tunnel syndrome. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. I don’t think so… not right now. I just… I hope it doesn’t come to neurology. Thank you for seeing me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Ms. Uzarski. .
