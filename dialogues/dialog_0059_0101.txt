DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this headache I've been having. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been bothering me for a little while now. Not a terrible pain, but enough to make me notice it, especially when I’m bending over doing nails.
DOCTOR: I see. A headache at the back of your head, particularly when bending over… alright. And how long has this headache been bothering you, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it started maybe three weeks ago? Hard to say exactly, time flies when you're old, you know! But definitely over three weeks. It wasn't constant at first, just now and then. But it’s been pretty much every day for the last week or so.
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does have a way of doing that. Three weeks, with it becoming more consistent over the last week. And would you describe the pain as sharp, dull, throbbing, or something else?
PATIENT: Not sharp, definitely not. More of a… a pressure, I’d say. Like a tight band around the back of my head. And sometimes it feels a little bit… achy? Not a bad ache, just… there. It’s not a pounding sort of headache, if that makes sense. More… persistent. I can still work, you understand, I just notice it more when I'm concentrating.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Popova. A pressure, like a tight band, with some aching. Not sharp or throbbing, but persistent. And you said you've noticed it more when concentrating, particularly when you’re working… You mentioned you do nails – is that your profession, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do nails. Manicures and pedicures. Been doing it for… well, a long time now! Over fifty years, I reckon. My wife, bless her heart, she helps me out with the books and appointments. Keeps me on the straight and narrow, she does. But yes, bending over a lot, that’s part of it, you see. Lots of little movements with my hands, too. I wonder if that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: It very well could, Mr. Popova. Repetitive movements and sustained postures can certainly contribute to headaches. We'll explore that possibility. Now, besides the headache, have you noticed any other symptoms – perhaps any vision changes, dizziness, nausea, or sensitivity to light or sound?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... No dizziness, no. And no nausea, thank goodness. Vision's been alright, I think. I wear glasses, you see, and I had my eyes checked just last year. No changes there. Sensitivity to light... not really, no. Sound… well, sometimes loud noises bother me, but that's just old age, I reckon! Everything bothers me a little these days! But no, nothing specific with the headache, no. Just the pressure at the back of my head.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. No vision changes, dizziness, or nausea. Just the headache itself, without any accompanying symptoms. Now, Mr. Popova, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. No major illnesses, thank goodness. I had the flu a few times, of course, and a touch of arthritis in my hands, which is why I sometimes have trouble with the finer work. But that’s about it. My wife handles most of the doctor stuff, so I don't always remember all the details. She’ll probably be able to tell you more if you need to know. I’ve never been a smoker, and I only have a little rum on special occasions. Nothing heavy. And I don't take any regular medications, just a little cream for my hands sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Mr. Popova. No major illnesses, no smoking, limited alcohol intake, and no regular medications. And you mentioned a little cream for your hands. Do you recall the name of that cream?
PATIENT: Let me think... it’s a white tube… oh, it’s called… Eucerin, I think? Yes, Eucerin. It’s for dry skin, you see. My hands get very dry from all the washing. Just a little bit now and then, when they're particularly bad. It doesn’t have any strong smell or anything, just a plain white cream. I get it from the drugstore. My wife usually picks it up.
DOCTOR: Eucerin, for dry skin. Thank you. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never had any surgeries. And I’ve only been to the hospital once, when I broke my arm as a boy. Fell out of a mango tree, silly thing! But that was a long time ago, over seventy years now! Nothing since then, thank goodness. I’ve always been careful, you see. A little rum helps with the aches, sometimes! But no serious illnesses or hospital stays, no.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Popova. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, now that’s a good question. My mother, bless her soul, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father, he had diabetes, but he didn’t take care of himself, you see. Didn’t eat right, didn’t exercise. My wife’s family… her mother had arthritis, I believe. And her father, he had something with his heart, I think, but I can’t remember the details. It was a long time ago, and we weren’t as close to her family. I wouldn’t say there’s anything major that runs in the family, no. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of getting old, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. High blood pressure in your mother, diabetes in your father, and arthritis in your wife’s mother. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I just want to ask one last thing. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I'm not allergic to anything that I know of. Never had any trouble with food, never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, you see! I'm a Jamaican, we like to try everything! No allergies, no. Just a bit sensitive to loud noises sometimes, but that's just old age, I reckon!
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Popova. No known allergies. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll take a look at your eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and listen to your heart and lungs. Finally, I’ll feel your neck and shoulders to check for any muscle tension. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I’ve always been a good patient, you see. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. And try not to poke too hard! My bones are a bit fragile these days. But yes, go ahead, do what you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Popova. I appreciate your trust. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. … 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's check your pulse… 78, regular. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Your eyes look clear, and your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Your ears appear normal, no signs of infection. Your nose is clear, and your throat looks healthy, no redness or swelling. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm just going to feel your neck and shoulders… there's some mild muscle tension in your upper back and neck, especially on the left side. It's not severe, but it's noticeable. Do you feel any tenderness in that area?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, actually. Now that you mention it, I do feel a bit of a ache there, on my left side. Especially when I’m bending over doing nails, you see. I usually just rub it a bit, and it eases off. But yes, you’re right, it is a bit tender. And it sometimes goes down my shoulder, a bit. Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. My wife keeps telling me I need to stand up straighter, you see. Says I’m hunched over too much.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Popova. The tenderness in your upper back and neck, especially on the left side, and the ache radiating down your shoulder, is consistent with muscle tension, possibly related to your work posture. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical examination, it seems most likely that you’re experiencing tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by muscle strain in your neck and shoulders. The elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to keep an eye on, but doesn't necessarily relate to the headaches directly at this point. Now, I'd like to recommend a few things. First, I’d like you to try to improve your posture. When you’re working, make sure your chair is properly adjusted, and that your shoulders are relaxed. Try to take frequent breaks to stretch your neck and shoulders. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help to relieve the pain. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I’ve been meaning to get a better chair, you see. My wife keeps telling me the same thing! And I do hunch over a lot, I suppose. Stretching sounds like a good idea, too. I might even get my wife to remind me! And yes, ibuprofen, I can try that. I've taken that before for my hands. So, you think it’s just my posture, then? Not something serious? I was a little worried, to be honest. It’s not a terrible pain, but it’s been bothering me, you see.
DOCTOR: Based on the examination and your history, it appears most likely to be related to muscle tension and posture, yes. However, it’s important to monitor your symptoms. If the pain worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, vision changes, numbness or weakness – please contact me immediately. To rule out any other underlying causes, and just to have a baseline, I would recommend a simple X-ray of your cervical spine. This will allow us to check for any arthritis or structural abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray, eh? Hmm… I don’t mind, I suppose. If it will put my mind at ease, then yes, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’ve never had an X-ray before, but if you think it’s necessary, then do it. Just let me know what I need to do. I don't want to be a bother, you understand. I’m an old man, and I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Mr. Popova. It’s my job to ensure we’re doing everything we can to understand what’s going on. Alright, I'll write you a referral for an X-ray of your cervical spine. The receptionist will schedule it for you. It's a very quick and painless procedure. They'll simply take a few images of your neck. In the meantime, please start working on your posture and try the over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. I’d also like to see you back in two weeks, or sooner if your symptoms worsen, to discuss the X-ray results and see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Two weeks, then. I'll try my best to stand up straighter and take more breaks. And I'll get my wife to remind me! She's very good at that, you see. Thank you very much for your time and help, Doctor. I feel much better now, knowing what’s probably causing it. You've put my mind at ease. I think that's everything for today. Should I just go to the receptionist and get the X-ray scheduled?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. The receptionist will take care of everything for you. And don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Popova. Take care of yourself, and try to relax. .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. .
