DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 44 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, forty-four. It's… my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for a few days now. I don’t have time for this, honestly. Just need to know what it is and how to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sore throats are certainly disruptive. A few days, you said. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Describe…? It hurts. Like… when you swallow. And it feels… rough. Not smooth. I don't know. I don't usually bother with descriptions. Is it serious? Will I need… tests? I really don’t have the patience for all that.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Ottaviani. “Rough” is a good way to put it. And I understand your concern about tests. We'll try to keep things as efficient as possible. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly when I swallow. Talking isn't too bad. But eating… forget it. Like sandpaper. And… I don’t know. It feels worse in the mornings, maybe? Honestly, everything feels worse in the mornings. Is that helpful? I just want something to make it stop hurting.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Worse in the mornings can give us a clue. And you’re right to want relief. Before we discuss treatment options, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever…? I haven’t taken my temperature. I don't own a thermometer. And no, I haven’t been… chilling. It’s August! It’s hot! Body aches… well, I'm a woman of a certain age. Everything aches something. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re generally feeling well otherwise. No recent cough, runny nose, or congestion?
PATIENT: Cough…? A little, maybe? Just a tickle, really. Not a proper cough. And no… no runny nose. I keep things very… tidy. I don’t do congestion. This is all very… undignified, Doctor. Just tell me what pill I need.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Ms. Ottaviani. Just to get a better understanding, I'd like to quickly examine your throat. Could you please open wide and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Get it over with. Honestly, I haven't the time for all this. Are you sure it's not just something simple?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. The back of your throat is a little red, but it doesn’t appear significantly inflamed. I don’t see any white spots or pus. Your tonsils don't appear swollen. It looks like it could be a mild viral pharyngitis – a sore throat caused by a virus. However, given your insistence on a quick resolution and the absence of a definitive diagnosis without further testing, I'd like to briefly review your medical history to make sure there are no underlying conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Have you had strep throat before?
PATIENT: Strep throat…? Goodness, no. I haven’t had anything before, really. I'm a very healthy woman, Doctor. Mostly. I just… get sore throats sometimes. And I don’t like them. My husband… my late husband… he always took care of things when I was sick. I'm not good with this sort of thing. Just give me something strong, please. And quickly. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Ottaviani. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot. Given your mild symptoms and the lack of concerning signs, I believe this is likely a viral sore throat, and antibiotics would not be helpful. For symptomatic relief, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as directed on the label. Gargling with warm salt water several times a day can also soothe your throat. And plenty of fluids. Do you have any allergies to medications?
