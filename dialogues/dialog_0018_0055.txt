DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure, I suppose. Well, to be frank, I'm here about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it for my arthritis. Says it's the only thing that really helps. I haven’t any intention of becoming… that sort of patient, mind you, but I’m willing to consider it if it truly has merit.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Ranells. It’s good that you're approaching this with a thoughtful perspective. Many patients are finding medical marijuana helpful for a variety of conditions, including arthritis. To best advise you, could you tell me a little more about your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s in my hands, mostly. And my knees, when the weather changes. It’s just… aches, really. A lot of stiffness, especially in the mornings. It’s been going on for years, I suppose. My mother had it, and her mother before her. It’s just… a family affliction. I’ve tried the usual things. Creams, the occasional pain pill, but nothing seems to really do much good for very long. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not one for complaining, but it is rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I see. So, primarily hand and knee pain, worsened by weather, with a family history of arthritis. And you’ve tried over-the-counter creams and occasional pain medication with limited relief. Could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… sharp. Not like a broken bone, heavens no. It's more of a… dull ache. A constant throb, really. And the stiffness… that’s the worst part. It makes it difficult to do simple things, like buttoning my blouse or opening a jar. It's quite embarrassing, frankly. And it gets worse with humidity. I can feel it coming. A real nuisance, it is. I suppose you’d call it… nagging. That’s the best way to describe it. A persistent, nagging ache.
DOCTOR: A dull, nagging ache with stiffness, particularly in the mornings and with changes in humidity. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, Ms. Ranells, have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. And high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. A small thing, really. And… I had a touch of pneumonia once, but that was decades ago. Nothing… significant, I assure you. I’m generally a very healthy woman, Doctor. I always have been. It’s just this… arthritis. It’s a family curse, I tell you. A veritable family curse.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Ranells. So, gallbladder removal and hypertension, well-managed. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Let me see… I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, for my blood pressure. And… oh, a small dose of Vitamin D, the doctor suggested it for my bones. Nothing else, really. Just the Lisinopril and the Vitamin D. And occasionally a Tylenol if the arthritis is particularly bothersome, but that’s hardly a regular occurrence, you understand. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. It’s not good for the system, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Lisinopril 20mg daily, Vitamin D, and occasional Tylenol. That's very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens no. I’m a very robust woman, Doctor. Never had a single allergy in my life. Not to penicillin, not to shellfish, not to pollen, nothing at all. I’ve always been able to eat whatever I please, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. It’s one of the few blessings I have, really. A perfectly good system, you understand. No allergies whatsoever.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Ranells. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you briefly tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What exactly do you mean, Doctor? I’m a married woman, have been for fifty years. My husband, bless his soul, passed away five years ago. We had two children, both grown and with families of their own. I live in a quiet neighborhood, keep a tidy house, and enjoy my garden. I attend church regularly. Is that what you require? I fail to see how any of this is relevant to my arthritis, you understand. But I'm happy to oblige, if you insist.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Ranells. That’s very helpful. I ask about these things to get a complete picture of your lifestyle and potential contributing factors to your health. It is relevant, in the sense that it helps me understand your overall well-being. Now, have you ever smoked, or do you currently smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no! Absolutely not. Never have, never will. My husband, God rest his soul, he didn’t approve of such things. And I certainly wouldn’t dream of it. It’s a terrible habit, you understand. A dreadful, filthy habit. It’s simply… out of the question. I’ve always lived a very clean, healthy life. And smoking would be entirely contrary to that. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Ranells. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a glass of sherry with dinner, occasionally. Or a small glass of wine at Christmas. Nothing excessive, you understand. Just a little something to… soothe the nerves. And perhaps a small sip of port after a particularly good meal. But nothing that would impair my judgment, of course. I'm a very sensible woman, Doctor. And I certainly wouldn’t overindulge. A very small amount, on special occasions. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Ranells. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your range of motion, and examine your hands and knees to get a better understanding of the arthritis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam. Well… I suppose so. I haven't had one in quite some time, you understand. I'm not particularly fond of being poked and prodded, but if it's necessary… Very well. But please be gentle, Doctor. My skin is rather delicate. And I do dislike cold instruments. Just… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ranells. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I will examine your hands and knees. Please let me know if anything is uncomfortable at any point. Alright, Ms. Ranells. I’m noting some mild crepitus in your hands, particularly in the knuckles, and some mild swelling and decreased range of motion in both knees. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are normal. I don't feel any significant masses or abnormalities. This is consistent with osteoarthritis.
PATIENT: Osteoarthritis, you say? Is that… serious? I’ve heard such dreadful things about arthritis. Will I be… crippled? Will I require a wheelchair? My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about this medical marijuana, saying it's the only thing that helps. Perhaps she was right after all. Is it truly worth considering, Doctor? I'm not one for trying new things, you understand, but I am getting rather tired of this constant ache. It’s quite debilitating, really. And I would like to remain… independent, for as long as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Ranells. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, and while it can be painful, it is rarely debilitating to the point of requiring a wheelchair. It's a degenerative joint disease, meaning it worsens over time, but there are many things we can do to manage the pain and slow its progression. Regarding medical marijuana, it can be a helpful option for some patients, particularly for managing chronic pain. However, it's not without potential risks and side effects, and it's not a cure. It’s important to consider all options and discuss the potential benefits and risks with me. Before we discuss medical marijuana further, I would like to start with more conservative treatments. We can try physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your joints, and I can prescribe a topical pain reliever to help manage the discomfort. We can also consider oral pain relievers, although I prefer to use these sparingly. If these measures don't provide sufficient relief, then we can discuss medical marijuana as a potential option. Would you be open to trying physical therapy and a topical pain reliever first?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… well, I suppose so. I’ve always been rather active, you understand. I used to enjoy gardening, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult with this ache. And a topical pain reliever… that sounds… less invasive than taking pills. I do dislike the thought of becoming reliant on medication. Very well, Doctor. Let’s try the physical therapy and the topical pain reliever first. But if those don’t work… well, then perhaps we’ll have to revisit this matter of the medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s quite insistent. And I am getting rather desperate, you understand. I simply want to be able to enjoy my life, for as long as possible. Do you have any recommendations for a good physical therapist? One who is… gentle?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Ranells. I’m glad to hear you're open to trying those options first. I have a few excellent physical therapists I can recommend. I think Ms. Eleanor Vance would be a particularly good fit for you. She specializes in geriatric care and is known for her gentle approach. Her clinic is located on Elm Street, and I can provide you with her contact information. I'll write a prescription for a topical diclofenac gel, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that can help reduce pain and inflammation. Apply it to your hands and knees twice daily. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to assess your progress. If you're not experiencing sufficient relief by then, we can discuss medical marijuana further, and I can provide you with information on local dispensaries and the legal requirements for obtaining a medical marijuana card. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Diclofenac gel… yes, I think I’ve heard of that. Very well. And Ms. Vance, you say? Elm Street… I believe I know where that is. No, Doctor, I don’t believe I have any further questions at the moment. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate your patience. I do hope this physical therapy works. I simply want to be able to enjoy my garden again. It’s my one true passion, you understand. Thank you again, Doctor. And I shall see you in four weeks.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Ranells. I’m confident we can find a solution that works for you. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Enjoy your day, and I look forward to seeing you in four weeks.
