DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really have time for a lot of chatting, okay? I just… I want to get pregnant. And I want it to work this time. No issues, no complications. Is that possible? I’m 43, and frankly, I don’t want to mess around.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Villarreal. I understand your concerns and desire for a straightforward approach. We will absolutely do our best to facilitate a healthy pregnancy for you. To best understand the situation and ensure a smooth process, I will need to gather some information. First, can you confirm your date of birth for me, please?
PATIENT: Honestly? I barely remember dates anymore. It’s… August 12th, I think? Maybe the 10th? Look, it was a long time ago. Does it really matter? I'm 43. That’s the important part. My husband… well, he always remembered. It’s just… hard now.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Villarreal. We can confirm the exact date in your record. Knowing your age is, as you said, the most important thing at this point. To start, have you been trying to conceive for a specific length of time?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes. For… a while. Months, definitely. It’s not like I haven’t tried. It just… didn’t happen. And honestly, I don't want to sit here and recount every single month. It was embarrassing enough the first time around, and this is… different. It's later. Is that going to be a problem? Everything was so easy before.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and sensitivity, Ms. Villarreal. It's completely reasonable to feel that way. We will approach this with discretion and efficiency. Just to clarify, when you say “the first time around,” was that a successful pregnancy?
PATIENT: Yes! Of course it was! I had… I had my son, David. He's… grown now. A doctor delivered him, it was all very normal. No problems at all. That's what I expect this time. Why is this taking so long? Is something wrong with me? Don't tell me I'm too old, because I know people have babies later.
DOCTOR: It's good to know you had a successful pregnancy previously with David. That’s valuable information. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned about why it might be taking longer this time around. Many factors can influence conception, and while age is a factor, it's not the sole determinant. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh, cycles. Honestly? They’re… irregular. Sometimes they’re normal-ish, sometimes they're long, sometimes they skip altogether. I don’t really track them anymore. I used to, when I was trying for David, but it was just depressing after a while. Is that going to be a problem? I just want a straightforward answer: can you help me, or can’t you? I don't have time for a lot of tests and… and waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Villarreal, and I want to assure you we will aim for a focused approach. Irregular cycles can contribute to difficulty conceiving, but they are also something we can investigate and often manage. To help me determine the best course of action, could you describe what "normal-ish" means for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, "normal-ish"... like, every 28 days, sometimes. Or 30. Or 32. It varies! Honestly, I just know when it doesn't come, and then I get stressed, and then it usually shows up eventually. It's just… unpredictable. And before you ask, no, I don't know why. I don't spend my life thinking about this, okay? I have a job. I had a husband. And now I just want a baby, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Villarreal. It sounds as though your cycles have been quite variable. That does give us a place to start. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions—for example, diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think… No. Not really. I had… the usual colds, you know? Nothing serious. My husband always took care of everything. He insisted on yearly checkups and… I don’t even remember what they were for, honestly. I just trusted him. He always said I was healthy. I’m probably fine. I just think it’s taking a while, that’s all. Can we just skip this part? It’s all just… depressing.
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings, Ms. Villarreal. We can certainly move through this at a pace you're comfortable with. However, it's important to gather as much information as possible. Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Ugh… no. Not really. Well, I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that was ages ago. And… David was a C-section, but that’s it. Honestly, I don't remember much about it. It was a long time ago. Is that going to matter? Everything was fine then, why would it matter now? This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tonsillectomy as a child and a Cesarean section with David. That’s helpful information. Ms. Villarreal, I understand your frustration with this process. To ensure we're approaching this thoroughly, I would like to discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—for example, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or fertility issues?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… Honestly? It’s… complicated. My mother had… something. I don’t even remember what. She passed away a long time ago. And my father… he was healthy. I think. Everyone on my side of the family just… kept to themselves. We didn't really talk about things. It’s not like I know anyone’s medical records or anything. Can we just skip this? It's all just… depressing and I don't know anything. Can't you just give me something to make it happen?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Villarreal. It’s perfectly alright if you don't have that information. We will proceed with what we have. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Ugh, no! Absolutely not. Never have. My husband hated it. And frankly, it's disgusting. I eat reasonably well, you know? I'm not one of those people who eats junk all day. And I try to get some exercise when I can, but honestly, I've been a bit stressed lately, so it's been hard. Can we just get to the part where you tell me what I need to do?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Villarreal. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Now, could you tell me if you are currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think… Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And I take something for… my nerves. It's nothing major. I get a bit anxious. My doctor prescribed it. Honestly, I barely remember the name. It's a little blue pill. That's all I know. Can we just skip this? It's all just… so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and a small blue pill for anxiety, prescribed by your doctor. We can try to find the name later, if needed. Ms. Villarreal, I understand your frustration and desire to get straight to a solution. However, I want to ensure we have a complete picture before making any recommendations. To do that, I would like to perform a physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I have things to do, you know? This is taking up my whole day. Just… don’t poke me too much. And please don't tell me I'm too old. I've heard enough of that already.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Villarreal. I assure you, I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. And I will not tell you that you are too old. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I’ll do a quick abdominal exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just… hurry, okay? I have a life. And don’t make me lie on that cold paper table. Honestly, this is just humiliating. Just get it over with. And can you at least tell me what you're looking for? I hate not knowing what's going on.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Villarreal. We can do this seated if you prefer. It’s important to me that you are comfortable. I’m listening to your heart and lungs to make sure everything sounds normal. I’m checking for any unusual sounds that might indicate a problem. Your heart rate and rhythm are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this time. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, which is also within a normal range. Now, I’m just gently feeling your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I don’t feel anything concerning at this time. Everything feels soft and normal. Okay, Ms. Villarreal. That concludes the physical exam. Overall, everything appears normal. However, to get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a science experiment. But fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just... can we please get some results soon? I don't want to be waiting weeks for this. And can you explain what you're testing for? I hate being in the dark. And can I at least have a glass of water? All this talking is making me thirsty.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Ms. Villarreal. I’ll make sure the lab prioritizes your tests, and we should have results back within a few days, hopefully sooner. Here you go. I’m ordering a complete blood count to check your overall health and rule out any infections or anemia. I’m also ordering a hormone panel to check your hormone levels, including FSH, LH, estrogen, and progesterone. These hormones play a crucial role in ovulation and pregnancy. Finally, I’m ordering a thyroid panel to check your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can sometimes affect fertility. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Ugh, hormones and… things. It sounds complicated. So you're just checking to see if everything is working, right? Like, can I still get pregnant? Is that what all this is about? Just tell me straight, okay? No beating around the bush. I don’t need a medical lecture, I just need an answer. And can I get this over with? Where do I go for the blood work? I have a schedule, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Villarreal, that’s exactly right. We’re checking to see if everything is functioning as it should and identifying any potential obstacles to conception. Based on your medical history and the physical exam, I don’t see any obvious reasons why you wouldn’t be able to get pregnant. However, the blood tests will give us a more complete picture. Here's the lab requisition form, and these are directions to the lab. It’s located just down the street at 123 Main Street. You don’t need an appointment. Once you have the results, you can either schedule a follow-up appointment with me, or you can have the results sent directly to my office. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Villarreal, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to help you achieve your goal. We’ll review the results together and discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. I think that’s enough for now. Just… please don't make me wait too long for the results. I have a life to live, you know? And if it turns out I'm too old… well, just tell me straight. I don’t need false hope. Thank you. I guess. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Villarreal. I understand your concerns, and I assure you I will contact you as soon as the results are available. We will discuss all options, and I will provide honest and compassionate guidance.
