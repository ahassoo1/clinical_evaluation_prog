DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Billman. Well, it's... about the cancer. It's been a little while since I last saw someone about it, and things haven't been feeling quite right.
DOCTOR: Cancer, okay. And you said it's been a while…can you tell me a little more about which cancer we're talking about?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It was… breast cancer. I finished treatment about two years ago, I think. It was in my right breast. They said it was… stage one, I believe. It’s hard to remember everything, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Stage one breast cancer, right breast, treatment finished roughly two years ago. Okay. And you said things haven't been feeling quite right?
PATIENT: Yes. It's… hard to explain. I just feel tired all the time, even when I've been resting. And there's this… ache in my bones, mostly in my back. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull feeling. It's been getting worse over the last few months.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and bone aches…right. And where exactly in your back are you feeling this ache?
PATIENT: It’s mostly… lower back, Doctor. And it kind of goes around to my sides, a little bit. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. But when it is there, it makes it hard to… well, to do much of anything, really. Lifting things is the worst. Even just bending over feels difficult sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and the back pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been having… well, I’ve been losing my appetite. Not a lot, but I don’t feel hungry as much as I used to. And… I think I’ve been bruising easier. Like, small bumps will leave a mark more easily than before. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite and easier bruising… those are things we’ll want to explore. Have you had any fevers, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I haven’t really been sweating at night, no. As for weight loss… I don’t know. I haven’t weighed myself in a while, to be honest. It’s been… difficult. After everything… it's hard to keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and then check your back and look for any areas of tenderness. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Another deep breath… good. Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds regular. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels painful. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that’s okay. Not painful. It feels… normal, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, your back. I'm going to gently press along your spine and the muscles on either side. Let me know immediately if you feel any sharp pain. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Ouch. That… that’s a little tender. Right there. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a deep ache when you press on it. And it feels… warm, maybe?
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation in the lower lumbar spine, with reports of warmth. Hmm. Alright, Chellsea. Given your history of breast cancer and these new symptoms – tiredness, bone aches, easier bruising, and now the tenderness in your back – I think we need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll need a complete blood count to check for any abnormalities in your blood cells, and a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. I also want to order a bone scan to look for any areas of abnormal bone activity. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. A bone scan… will that take long? And… will it be painful? I just… I don’t want to go through a lot of discomfort.
DOCTOR: The bone scan itself usually takes about an hour or so. You'll receive a small amount of radioactive tracer, usually through an IV, and then lie on a table while a special camera scans your bones. It’s not usually painful, but you may feel a slight chill when the tracer is injected. It's more uncomfortable than painful, really. As for waiting for the results... that can take a few days, as the radiologist needs to interpret the images. I'll let you know as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I want to rule out any recurrence of your cancer or any other underlying condition causing these symptoms. Do you have any questions about the tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. An hour… and just a little bit of discomfort. Okay. Will the tracer… will it affect anyone else? I live alone, but I don’t want to… I don't want to put anyone at risk.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Chellsea. The amount of radioactive tracer used is very small, and it decays quickly. We'll give you specific instructions to follow after the scan – mainly to drink plenty of fluids to flush it out of your system. It poses virtually no risk to anyone else, but for the first 24 hours, we recommend limiting close contact with young children and pregnant women, just as a precaution. Otherwise, you can resume your normal activities. We'll go over all of these instructions in detail before the scan, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. That makes me feel better. Drink lots of fluids… and limit contact for a day. I can do that. So, what happens after the tests? Will I need… more treatment, if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: That’s… a difficult question to answer right now, Chellsea. It depends entirely on what the tests reveal. If we find evidence of cancer recurrence, we’ll discuss the best course of action – which could involve chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or a combination of these treatments. If it's something else, the treatment plan will depend on that specific condition. We’ll have a thorough discussion about all of your options, the risks and benefits of each, and make a decision together. Right now, we need to focus on getting a clear diagnosis. I'll write you a referral for the bone scan and the lab work, and the receptionist will schedule the appointments for you. Is there anything else I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Billman. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience. I’ll see you when the results are back. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
