DOCTOR: Hi Colt, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though, I must say, a young doctor like yourself... still learning, I presume? Anyway, it’s these… episodes. My wife, Srey, she's been worried. I get confused, you see. Not all the time, but enough to… bother her. She says I ask the same questions over and over. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel that way, Colt. Everyone has different levels of experience, and I’m always learning. And it’s very good of Srey to bring this to my attention – it’s always helpful to get input from family. So these episodes… can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, they don't happen every day, thankfully. Usually it's in the evening. I'll be talking, maybe about the work – I still do tile, you know, keeps me busy – and then… I just lose my train of thought. Or I'll ask Srey where we put the remote, even though I just had it. Simple things. Things I shouldn't be forgetting. And it’s not like a blankness, exactly. More like… a fog. A frustrating fog. And I know I repeat myself. Drives her mad.
DOCTOR: Okay, a frustrating fog, repeating questions... that helps me get a better picture. And these episodes are mainly in the evening, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly in the evening. Though, I do recall one time it happened mid-day, when I was measuring for a backsplash at Mrs. Henderson’s house. Luckily, her son was there to help. Embarrassing, really. I asked him the same question about the tile spacing three times in five minutes. He just stared at me. It's not like I’m losing my skills with the tile, mind you. My hands still work perfectly fine. It’s just… this other stuff.
DOCTOR: That sounds unsettling, Colt, especially when it happens at work. It’s good that Mrs. Henderson’s son was there to help. And it’s reassuring to hear your hands are still steady with your work. So, to clarify, these episodes involve repeating questions, feeling confused, and it happens mostly in the evenings, but occasionally during the day?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Exactly. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little… unsteady on my feet, too. Not falling, mind you, just a little… off-balance. It's not constant, but it happens during these confused spells. It's like everything is a little… muted. Like looking through a dirty window. And honestly, Doctor, it’s worrying me. I’ve always prided myself on my sharp mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we’ve got the confusion, repeating questions, a feeling of being off-balance, and this muted sensation… like looking through a dirty window. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in your memory other than during these episodes?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, sometimes I struggle to recall names. Not Srey’s, of course, or my children’s. But acquaintances… people I haven’t seen in a while. It's not a complete blank, more like… the name is on the tip of my tongue. And it’s getting worse, I think. I used to be very good with faces. I could remember anyone. And sometimes, I have trouble finding the right word. The word I want is right there, but it just won’t come out. It’s infuriating.
DOCTOR: Okay, difficulty recalling names and finding the right words... that's good information. And it sounds like these things are gradually worsening. Have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, or weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: No, no headaches. My eyesight is a little… cloudy, perhaps, but that’s just old age, I expect. I’ve had cataracts in both eyes for years. The doctor says they’re not bad enough for surgery yet. And no weakness. My arms and legs are strong. I still work hard, you know. Though, I will say, my balance has always been… not perfect. I wasn’t very athletic as a young man. But this… this feeling of being unsteady is new. It happens with the confusion, not on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, no headaches or weakness. Cloudy vision from known cataracts. And the unsteadiness only happens during the confused episodes. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while. The doctor put me on medication years ago, and it's been under control ever since. I take it every morning. And Srey makes sure I do. Other than that… nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. No diabetes, no heart problems. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fish and vegetables. Srey is very strict about that, too. She worries about everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the controlled high blood pressure and no other major medical conditions. And it's wonderful that you have Srey looking out for you. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… besides the blood pressure pill, there’s the one for my arthritis. It's in my hands, you see, from years of tile work. It helps with the pain, but not much else. And sometimes, when the arthritis flares up, the doctor gives me a stronger painkiller, but I try to avoid those if possible. They make me feel… foggy. It's ironic, isn't it? Taking a pill to clear the fog, and it just makes more fog.
DOCTOR: It is ironic, Colt. And helpful to know about the arthritis medication and the occasional painkiller. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I've always been quite lucky in that regard. Srey’s the one with the allergies. Pollen, dust… all sorts of things. She’s always sneezing. But me? Nothing. Never had a reaction to any medication. I've had plenty of pills in my life, you know. Old age comes with its share of ailments.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the lack of allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. Though, I must say, I’ve never been very good at those balance tests. Always clumsy, even as a young man. But go ahead. I’ll try my best. Just don’t expect miracles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. No worries at all. We’re just gathering information. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms and legs. Good. And now the other side. Alright, those look normal. Now, I’m going to check your eye movements and balance. Could you follow my penlight with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can do that. Though, I do feel a little… dizzy already. Perhaps it’s just me. I haven’t been sleeping very well lately. Srey says I snore too much. It’s a vicious cycle. Is that fast enough? Are you looking for something specific?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Just tracking the light. And yes, I see a slight… slowness in your eye movements. Nothing major, but worth noting. Okay, now if you could stand up for me, when you're ready. And try to stand with your feet together, arms at your sides. Now, I'm going to gently push you off balance, just a little. Don’t try to brace yourself, just let me see how you react.
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is not going well, is it? I always did have terrible balance. Be gentle, Doctor. Please. I don't want to fall. I’ll just stand here…and try not to wobble. And Srey will be furious if I fall…she worries so.
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy there. That’s alright. Yes, you are a little unsteady. It looks like you have some difficulty with balance, and it does seem to be worse on this side. Okay, now let’s talk about what we’ve found. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, you’re experiencing confusion, memory issues, and some unsteadiness, particularly with your balance. The slight slowness in your eye movements and the difficulty with balance are concerning. These symptoms could be due to a number of things. It could be something relatively benign, like a vitamin deficiency or a side effect of medication. But it could also be something more serious, like early stages of dementia, or even a small stroke. I want to be cautious and do some further testing to rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to get some blood work and an MRI of your brain?
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh dear. That sounds…serious, doesn’t it? A stroke… dementia… Those are frightening words, Doctor. I don’t like the sound of any of this. But…yes, I suppose I have to do whatever you think is best. If it will rule things out, then yes. Blood work… fine. An MRI… well, I don’t like the idea of being stuck in one of those machines, but if it’s necessary… yes. Srey will be so worried. This is just… terrible. What does this mean, Doctor? Am I… getting old? Is this what happens when you get old?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be scared, Colt. Those are frightening words, and it’s okay to feel that way. The tests aren’t meant to scare you, they’re simply to help us understand what’s going on and make sure we’re providing you with the best possible care. The tests will give us a clearer picture. The blood work will check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. The MRI will give us a detailed look at your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities, like a small stroke or evidence of dementia. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re getting old, Colt. These symptoms can be caused by a variety of things, and many of them are treatable. We need to gather more information before we can make any definitive conclusions. Let’s start with the blood work. I’ll write you a requisition, and you can get that done at the lab across the street. Then, we’ll schedule an MRI for you as soon as possible. We'll discuss the results together and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds… alright, I suppose. Blood work… I can manage that. And an MRI… I’ll try not to think about it too much. Just… please, Doctor, be thorough. I want to know what’s going on. I don’t want to be left wondering. And… please let Srey come with me for the MRI. I think I’ll need someone to hold my hand. And… is there anything I can do? Anything at all to help? Should I be taking any vitamins? Changing my diet? Should I be doing puzzles or something to keep my mind sharp?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Colt. We will be thorough. And of course, Srey can absolutely come with you for the MRI. It’s always good to have someone there for support. And yes, there are things you can do. While we wait for the test results, it’s a good idea to focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean protein is important. And staying mentally active is also crucial. Puzzles, reading, learning a new skill – anything that challenges your brain can be beneficial. I’m going to recommend a daily multivitamin, and consider adding some omega-3 fatty acids to your diet – fish oil is a good source. And I'll give you a list of brain-training exercises that you can try. For now, let’s focus on getting the blood work done and scheduling the MRI. I want to rule out any underlying medical conditions before we make any further recommendations. We'll take this one step at a time, Colt. And I’ll be here every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve given me a lot to think about. Thank you. Thank you for listening. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. I appreciate it. I’ll get the blood work done tomorrow. And I’ll have Srey call the clinic to schedule the MRI. And… Doctor? Please be careful when you look at the results. I’m… a little scared, you know. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Colt. I’m glad I could help. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll take good care of you. .
