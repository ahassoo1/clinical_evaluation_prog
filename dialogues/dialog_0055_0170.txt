DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s…pleasant to make your acquaintance. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of this visit today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get this life insurance thing done. They sent me here for a check-up, you know? Want to get it over with if we can.
DOCTOR: Life insurance… quite sensible, I suppose. Though I must confess, I find it…somewhat morbid to be solely motivated by such concerns. Nevertheless, we shall proceed. To fulfill the requirements of this…assessment, I will need a thorough understanding of your medical history. Let’s begin with your present health. Could you describe any symptoms you’ve been experiencing lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not really. I feel… okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn't? I work long hours at the hotel, you know. Running things… it takes it out of you. Nothing major, though. No aches, no pains, no… you know, anything like that.
DOCTOR: “Okay.” A little tired… predictable. Many individuals overestimate their baseline level of wellness, you see. Fatigue is rather…non-specific. Let’s delve a bit deeper. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight… hmm. I think I might've lost a few pounds, but I haven't really been keeping track. And my appetite is… normal, I guess. Eat when I'm hungry, don't when I'm not. Nothing fancy. Mostly just trying to grab something quick between work stuff. It's hard to eat regular meals when things get busy.
DOCTOR: Unremarkable. A tendency toward irregular eating habits… not ideal, naturally. Now, Mr. Putney, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions—diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No, not really. The doctor back home… he checked me up every now and then, just a general thing. Said I was okay. Blood pressure was always a little high, he mentioned, but nothing he needed to worry about. Just told me to watch the salt. Other than that… no. I haven’t been sick sick, you know? No diabetes or anything serious like that.
DOCTOR: “Borderline hypertension,” as I recall is often the phrasing. A lack of proactive management is… regrettable. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Putney?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. When I was a kid, I had my tonsils out. That's about it, I think. A long time ago. Nothing since. Just the tonsils. It was…routine, I guess. My mom took me, I barely remember it.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy. Commendable that you recall it at all. Now, regarding your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mom… she had some trouble with her heart when she got older. She passed away a few years back. And my dad, he had diabetes, yeah. That was a long time ago, though. He lived a pretty long life for having it. My sister, she's healthy as a horse. Never had a day of sickness in her life. Other than that… I don't really know much about my family's medical stuff. We didn’t really talk about it.
DOCTOR: A lack of familial medical awareness is… common, unfortunately. Now, Mr. Putney, concerning your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I'll have a beer with dinner sometimes, maybe a glass of wine, but that's it. Nothing heavy. And no drugs, never been into any of that. I’m a pretty simple guy, Doctor. Just work and… try to stay out of trouble.
DOCTOR: Sensible. A moderate alcohol intake… acceptable. Finally, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. Just… maybe some vitamin C when I feel a cold coming on. But that's it. No regular pills or anything. I like to keep things natural if I can. Don't like filling my body with too much stuff.
DOCTOR: Very well. That completes the preliminary questioning. Now, Mr. Putney, to obtain a more comprehensive assessment, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. Let's just get it over with, you know? I got things to do. Hotel doesn't run itself.
DOCTOR: Precisely. Please, if you would, have a seat on the examination table. We’ll begin with auscultation of your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt.
PATIENT: Okay. Hope this doesn't take too long. It's kinda cold in here.
DOCTOR: Respiration is within normal limits. Heart sounds… somewhat diminished, but no audible murmurs. Blood pressure is elevated, as expected… 148 over 92. Pulse is regular, 82 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but… slightly reduced vesicular breath sounds in the bases. Percussion is resonant. No signs of consolidation or effusion. Now, I’d like to palpate your abdomen. Please lie flat.
PATIENT: Okay, flat. Just let me know when you’re done, Doctor. I really need to get back to work. This is starting to take a while.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No palpable masses or organomegaly. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all quadrants. No evidence of rebound tenderness or guarding. Peripheral pulses are present bilaterally, albeit diminished in the lower extremities. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. No edema or cyanosis. Very well, Mr. Putney. That completes the physical examination. Based on my assessment, your blood pressure is elevated, and there is some reduction in breath sounds. Given your family history of hypertension and diabetes, I recommend a comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, and an electrocardiogram. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: More tests? Really? I just wanted a quick check-up for the insurance. Look, can’t you just… sign off on it? I mean, I feel fine. I don’t want to spend all day here getting poked and prodded. Is it going to take long? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: “Ridiculous,” you say?
PATIENT: Look, I just mean... I have a lot on my plate. Running that hotel…it's a lot of responsibility. I don't have time for a whole lot of tests, you know? I just need the paperwork for the life insurance. Is there anything...anything at all you can write down that’ll get them to approve it? I can pay extra, or something. I really just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I understand your desire for expediency, however, to fulfill my ethical obligations as a physician, I cannot simply provide a superficial assessment to satisfy the requirements of an insurance company. To do so would be…unprofessional and, frankly, irresponsible. A life insurance policy is predicated upon an accurate understanding of your health status. While your current symptoms may be minimal, the findings of elevated blood pressure and diminished breath sounds warrant further investigation. These could be indicative of underlying conditions that require medical attention. I will order the aforementioned blood work and EKG. The results should be available within 48 hours. Once I have them, we can discuss a suitable course of action. In the interim, I strongly recommend you adopt a healthier lifestyle, including a low-sodium diet and regular exercise. Do I have your consent to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Do the tests. Just…please hurry. And can you send the results directly to the insurance company? I don’t want to have to come back here again. This is a complete waste of my time. Yeah, send them to the insurance company. And...what’s their number, just so I can tell them you’re doing everything? I need to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will arrange for the laboratory work and EKG to be performed immediately. The results will be sent directly to your insurance provider. Their number, you say?
PATIENT: Here. It's on this form from the insurance company. Look, I really appreciate you doing this, Doctor. I just... I have a lot on my mind. A lot of responsibilities. You wouldn’t believe it. Hotel life is… something else. So, once they get the results, will that be it? Will they approve the policy? I need to know.
DOCTOR: That remains to be seen, Mr. Putney. The approval of your life insurance policy is entirely dependent upon the insurance company’s assessment of your health status, based on the results of these tests. I cannot guarantee their decision. However, I assure you, I will provide them with a comprehensive and accurate report of my findings. In the meantime, please refrain from making any significant lifestyle changes until we have discussed the results. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, that's it. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I'll just… wait for the results, then. I guess. Hopefully, this is the end of it. Thank you again.
