DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Pithan. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon. Yeah, well, it’s this cough. Been on me for… a while now. And I’m just tired all the time. Seems like I get a sinus infection every other month too. I just wanna get it figured out, if that makes sense. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A persistent cough, fatigue, and frequent sinus infections – that is frustrating, and definitely something we should look into. Let's start with the cough. When did it first start?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… probably last fall, maybe around October? It started kinda mild, just a tickle in my throat. Thought it was a cold, you know? But it just… stayed. It gets worse when I lay down, usually. And I cough up… stuff. Not a lot, but yeah, stuff. Sorry if that’s… gross.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Pithan. It's important information. "Stuff" is good to know. Is it colored?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. Usually yellow, sometimes a little greenish. Not bright green, more… murky. And like I said, not huge amounts. Just enough to be annoying, really. It’s more the constant feeling of needing to cough that bothers me. It keeps me up at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellow or greenish mucus and a cough that's worse when lying down... that gives us a bit more to work with. Do you have any other symptoms along with the cough and fatigue?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes my chest feels tight. Not always, but when I’m really coughing a lot, yeah. And my nose gets… stuffed up, always. That’s probably with the sinus infections, I guess. My head hurts too, a dull ache, mostly in my forehead. I don't get a fever, though. Never do.
DOCTOR: Alright, chest tightness, nasal congestion, forehead ache, no fever… Okay. Have you noticed any shortness of breath with the chest tightness?
PATIENT: Nah, not really shortness of breath. Just feels… constricted, you know? Like someone’s squeezing my chest. It doesn’t make it hard to breathe, just… uncomfortable. I mostly notice it when I’m trying to lay down flat. That’s when it gets worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And you mentioned frequent sinus infections. About how often would you say you get those?
PATIENT: Like I said, every other month, maybe. Sometimes it's three months between, sometimes it's closer to a month and a half. But it feels like I'm always getting one. Stuffed up nose, pressure in my face, that sort of thing. I usually just ride it out. I don’t bother with the doctor for those unless it gets really bad.
DOCTOR: I understand. Riding them out sounds rough, though. Alright, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like asthma, COPD, or allergies?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had pneumonia when I was a kid, a long time ago. But other than that… nothing. I try to stay healthy. I was a ranch hand for a long time, so I was outdoors a lot. Never been much for doctors, honestly. I just don't like going if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Pithan. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Broke my arm once when I was younger, but they just put it in a cast. That was it. No big operations or anything.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, a little about your family... is there anyone in your family with a history of lung problems, like asthma or COPD, or frequent sinus infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom had bad allergies, always sneezing and sniffly. And my grandpa, on my dad’s side, he smoked his whole life, so he had some breathing problems towards the end. But other than that, not really. Everyone else seemed pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, allergies in your mother, and your grandfather with smoking-related breathing issues. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Do you mean like… do I drink or smoke? No. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink much, maybe a beer now and then with supper, that’s it. I live alone now, mostly keep to myself. Been that way for a while. I used to work on a ranch, but retired a few years back.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or excessive alcohol use, living alone, retired ranch hand. Good to know. And finally, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything the few times I’ve taken something. I don't take regular medications though. Just over-the-counter stuff when I need it. Pain relievers, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pithan, that gives me a really good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Can you step up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s a bit high. But okay. Let me know what you want me to do. I just want to get this figured out, so I can get back to… well, just being home.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. First, I'm going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths in and out for me, please. Okay, I'm hearing some mild wheezing, especially on your exhale. Nothing terribly concerning at this point, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to check your sinuses for tenderness. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Right… here. And a bit on this side too. It's not sharp pain, just… pressure. Like a dull ache. It's been like that for weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to palpation over your forehead and left cheek. And I'm going to take your temperature and check your throat. Temperature is normal, and your throat looks clear. Now, I want to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. Oxygen saturation is 97%, which is good. Overall, things aren't alarming, but the persistent wheezing and sinus tenderness warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a chest x-ray and a complete blood count, or CBC, just to rule out any infection or other issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. A chest x-ray and… a blood test. Okay. How long will that take? I don't wanna be here all day. And will I get the results right away?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The chest x-ray will only take a few minutes, and the lab can draw the blood right here in the clinic. We can usually get the results back within a couple of hours, though sometimes it can take a little longer depending on the lab's workload. I'll have the nurse draw your blood and send you over to radiology for the x-ray. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a course of a nasal steroid spray to help with the sinus inflammation. It's not a cure, but it should provide some relief. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope. Like I said, don't take much, and never had a bad reaction to anything. A nasal spray… okay. Hopefully that'll help with the pressure. Alright, let's just get this over with, then. Blood test and the x-ray. I appreciate you looking into it. Hopefully it's nothing too serious. Just wanna get back home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pithan. I understand. Let me have the nurse come in and get you started with the blood draw and I will send the order for the chest x-ray over to radiology. We'll get this sorted out. Please let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: Alright. Thanks. .
