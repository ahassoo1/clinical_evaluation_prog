DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Helaina. Honestly? It’s a bit embarrassing, but my daughter, Layla, she… well, she suggested I come in. She’s very insistent when she thinks I need looking after. She said something about… preventative medicine for, you know, staying healthy. I’m not really sure what it’s all about, to be honest. It’s about HIV, isn't it? She used the letters… PrEP? That’s right. PrEP.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Helaina. It’s very thoughtful of Layla to encourage you to prioritize your health, and it’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure about things. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, can be used to prevent HIV, but it’s certainly not the only thing we discuss during a preventative medicine visit. To understand what’s best for you, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your overall health, lifestyle, and any concerns you might have. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that’s fine. Questions are good. I just… I don’t want to waste your time, Doctor. I’ve got a long shift at the parking garage this afternoon. But yes, ask away. I’ll try to be as quick as I can.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll take things at your pace, Helaina. Your time is valuable, and I assure you, any information you provide is helpful. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I mean, I get a bit tired sometimes, working those long hours, but nothing a good cup of tea can’t fix. My mother had… something with her joints, arthritis, I think, but I haven’t had any problems like that. I get my check-ups when I have to, through Medicare, but they usually just tell me my blood pressure is a little high and to watch my salt intake. And I do. I really do. I'm pretty careful with my salt.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that you’re proactive about your health, Helaina, and mindful of your salt intake. It’s excellent that you’re keeping up with your Medicare check-ups as well. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. When I was a little girl, maybe seven or eight, I fell out of a date palm tree. Broke my arm. Had to have a cast. That was in Palestine, a long time ago. And… oh! When I had Layla, obviously. A C-section. That was… nineteen years ago now, I suppose. Other than that… no, nothing major. A few stitches here and there, little things. Nothing that required a hospital stay.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Helaina. That's helpful information. And congratulations on Layla – nineteen years is wonderful. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a small blood pressure tablet, once a day. Doctor Khalil prescribed it, after one of my Medicare check-ups. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And… sometimes, when my knees are acting up, I take ibuprofen. Just the regular kind, from the pharmacy. And… oh! I take a vitamin D supplement, in the winter. It's supposed to help with the… the lack of sun. I've been taking that for a few years now, on and off.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for your knees, and Vitamin D during the winter months. Very good. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I eat everything. Layla always jokes I'll try anything once. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Nothing I can remember, anyway. I've certainly had a few bad meals in my time, but that wasn't an allergy!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Helaina. And a willingness to try new things is certainly a positive quality. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother… she smoked, unfortunately. It wasn't a good habit. I always said I wouldn’t start, and I didn’t. I prefer strong tea, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Helaina. And a strong tea is an excellent choice. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how often?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe once a week, if that. Sometimes, with Layla, we’ll have a little more if we’re celebrating something. But I don’t drink heavily. It makes me sleepy. And I need to be alert for my shift at the garage.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Helaina. And being alert for your work is very important. Now, a slightly more sensitive question, but an important one for a complete health assessment: Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That is a bit personal, isn't it? Honestly, Doctor, no. Not for… a long time. Since my husband passed, no. It’s just… not something I’ve thought about. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Helaina. I understand it’s a personal question, and I appreciate your honesty. It’s important for me to ask these things to get a complete picture of your health. Now, to finish up with the history, could you tell me a little about your social situation?
PATIENT: Well… I live alone. I have Layla, of course, she visits often, and we talk on the phone every day. She’s my everything. I have a few friends from the neighborhood, we meet for tea sometimes, but mostly it’s quiet. I work long hours at the parking garage, so I don't have a lot of time for socializing. It’s… a simple life. A quiet life. And I suppose… a bit lonely sometimes, but I manage.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Helaina. It sounds like you have a close relationship with Layla, which is wonderful, and I appreciate you being so open with me. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are there any specific concerns you have today, aside from what brought you in initially?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I mean… Layla was very worried about this PrEP thing, said it was important to be protected. That’s really why I’m here. To put her mind at ease, if nothing else. I don’t really understand it, to be honest. And I don't want to waste your time going over things I don't need to know.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Helaina. It's good to know what's on your daughter’s mind, and it’s always best to be informed. Let's talk about PrEP then. It stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis, and it’s a medication taken daily to prevent HIV infection. It’s very effective when taken as prescribed. However, PrEP isn't for everyone. It's primarily for individuals who are at higher risk of HIV exposure. Since you've shared that you are not currently sexually active, it's unlikely to be necessary in your case. But, before we completely rule it out, it's always best to perform a physical exam to assess your overall health and discuss your individual risk factors. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it’s not something I need, then I don’t want to bother with it. A check-up is good, I suppose. Just… try not to make it too long, Doctor. I really do need to get back for my shift.
DOCTOR: Of course, Helaina. We'll keep it as concise as possible while still ensuring a thorough assessment. Let’s start with your height and weight. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I’m rather tall, you know. Always have been. My mother said it ran in the family. Go ahead. The sooner we get it done, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll step onto the scale for me, please. Okay, it says you are 6’2” and 187 pounds. That is quite tall! And your blood pressure is 142 over 88, which is a bit elevated. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Now, I’m just going to take a look at your ears and throat. Ears appear clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything looks good so far.
PATIENT: That's good to hear. I always worry about my blood pressure, but I do try to watch my salt. It’s just… hard sometimes when you're on your feet all day. Do I need any tests or anything? I really do need to get back.
DOCTOR: Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I would like to order a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying issues. We’ll check your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. It's a standard precaution. It will also be helpful to repeat the blood pressure reading in a few minutes to see if it's consistently high. It's not something to worry about immediately, but it's best to get a baseline and monitor it over time. The blood draw will only take a few minutes, and the results should be back within a few days. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. More tests. Well… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. But please, don't keep me long. I really do have to go. And can Layla see the results? She worries so much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Helaina. We'll keep it as quick as possible. And yes, absolutely, Layla can absolutely see the results. In fact, with your permission, I can even have the results sent directly to her. We encourage family involvement in healthcare, especially when there are concerns. I’ll just need a quick sample of your blood. This might feel like a little pinch, but it should be quick. And we’ll have the results back to you and Layla as soon as possible.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be gentle, please. And hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, all done. Just a little pressure here for a moment. There you go. All finished. You may experience a little bruising at the site, but it should resolve within a few days. Now, while we wait for the lab results, I’m going to document our discussion and formulate a plan. Given your current health status and lack of risk factors, PrEP is likely not necessary. However, it’s important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, monitor your blood pressure regularly, and schedule follow-up appointments to ensure your overall well-being. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… sensible. I just want to make sure Layla is happy. And I need to get back to work. Is there anything else you need to do right now?
DOCTOR: No, Helaina, I don’t believe so. I’ve documented everything we’ve discussed, ordered the blood tests, and we’ve addressed your concerns about PrEP. I’ll send a copy of my findings to Layla, as you requested. I'll also have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a few weeks to review the lab results and discuss any further steps. For now, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. And thank you for not keeping me too long. Tell Layla I say hello.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Helaina. It was a pleasure meeting you. I will certainly pass along your greetings to Layla. Please, take care, and have a safe shift at work. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
