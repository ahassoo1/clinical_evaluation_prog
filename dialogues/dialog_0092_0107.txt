DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my heart. It feels... funny sometimes. Like it's beating too fast, but not regular. It started, maybe, two weeks ago? I don’t know exactly. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. "Funny" is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a little more about when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm... it's hard to say. It doesn't seem to be when I'm doing something. Like, not when I work, not when I walk... Sometimes when I'm just sitting, watching TV with my wife. Or, even when I'm sleeping, she says. But not every time I sleep. It’s… random, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, "random" is helpful to know. And it’s good your wife has noticed it while you’re sleeping. That gives us some additional information. Now, when you feel this fast or irregular heartbeat, does it last for just a few seconds, minutes, or longer?
PATIENT: It lasts… a while. Not just a quick beat, you know? Maybe… ten, fifteen minutes sometimes. Then it stops. Then it comes back later. Not always right away, could be hours. I don't know the exact time, sorry. It's hard to watch the clock when your heart is doing that.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright that you don't have precise timings. Ten to fifteen minutes is certainly long enough to be concerning. Do you experience any other symptoms while this is happening?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… Sometimes I feel a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… light-headed. And maybe a little bit tired, but I’m always a little tired, if you know what I mean. Working with the chemicals all day… But I think maybe more tired when the heart is doing the funny thing. No chest pain, though. Definitely no pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lightheadedness and increased fatigue with the palpitations. No chest pain, that’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've never been to the doctor much, to be honest. Just for check-ups, maybe ten years ago. Never anything serious. My wife, she goes to the doctor a lot more than me. She has the insurance. I… don’t have insurance right now. I work, but it’s… complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that with me. We will work with what we have. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no hospital. Nothing. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, playing football, but that’s it. Just a cast for a few weeks. Nothing serious like… being in the hospital overnight or anything. Just the arm. Long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father, he had some problems with his heart when he was old. He had to take pills, but I don’t know what kind. He lived in Yemen, so it was hard to know exactly what was going on. My mother, she was healthy, I think. She lived a long life. No one else… I don’t know much about their hearts, to be honest. We don’t talk about it much. It’s… not a thing we do.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing what you know. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. I drink… sometimes. Maybe a beer with dinner, on the weekend. Not every weekend. And definitely no drugs. I don't do any of that. I work hard, I come home, I eat with my wife, I watch TV. That's it. Simple life.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Nothing at all. Just… sometimes a painkiller for my back, if it’s really bad after work. But not often. Like, once or twice a year. Just the regular kind, you can buy at the store. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That's standard procedure. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's okay. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor. My heart feels… okay now, but it's good to check, you know? Just to be sure. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Please lie back on the exam table. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart rate is currently 78 and regular. I hear no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. I’m now going to feel your pulse in both wrists and ankles. Pulses are regular and equal on both sides. No edema noted in the extremities. Do you feel any pain when I press on your abdomen?
PATIENT: No, no pain. It feels… normal, I think. Just my stomach. I eat a lot, sometimes. But no pain when you press. Everything feels… okay. A little nervous, maybe, but not pain. Is something wrong, Doctor? It’s okay to tell me.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness. It's good to be thorough, and it's perfectly normal to be anxious when something feels off. Right now, everything feels okay on physical exam, but that doesn't rule everything out. Based on what you’ve told me – the palpitations, the dizziness, the occasional fatigue – and the fact that your heart rate is normal right now, it sounds like we’re dealing with intermittent palpitations. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some tests. An EKG – that's a quick, painless test that records your heart's electrical activity. We should also do a basic blood panel to check your electrolytes, thyroid function, and complete blood count. Finally, I recommend a 24-hour Holter monitor. That’s a small, portable device that continuously records your heart rhythm over 24 hours. You wear it while going about your normal activities and it will capture any irregular heartbeats that might be happening when I'm not in the room. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Okay… those sound… complicated. But if it helps, I guess. The Holter monitor… I wear it all day? Even when I sleep? I work with chemicals, is that okay? Will it… get damaged? And the blood panel… that’s just a needle, right? I don’t like needles. But if you think it’s important… yes, I’ll do it. What about the cost, Doctor? Is it… expensive? I don’t have insurance, remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, the Holter monitor is worn continuously for 24 hours, even while you sleep. It’s water-resistant, so you can shower with it. As for working with chemicals, it shouldn’t be a problem, but please be careful to avoid getting any chemicals directly on the device itself. The blood panel does involve a needle, but it’s a quick pinch. We'll draw a small amount of blood from your arm. Regarding the cost, I understand your concern. Without insurance, these tests can be expensive. The EKG is usually around \$150-\$200. The Holter monitor is around \$200-\$300. The blood panel is approximately \$100-\$150. We do offer a self-pay discount of 10%, which I can apply. Alternatively, there are some free or low-cost clinics in the area that may be able to provide these tests at a lower cost. Would you like me to provide you with a list of those clinics?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot of money. Even with the discount. I don’t know if I can afford that right now. Maybe just the EKG, to start? See what that shows? The Holter monitor sounds… complicated and expensive. And I don’t want to damage it at work. And yes, please, a list of the free clinics would be good. My wife can help me look at them. Thank you, Doctor. You're very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything. It makes me feel… a little better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. I completely understand your financial concerns. Starting with the EKG is a perfectly reasonable approach. It's a quick and relatively inexpensive test that can give us some initial information. We’ll proceed with the EKG today. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you set up. After we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. I’ll also print out a list of free and low-cost clinics in the area for you and your wife to review. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the EKG?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now. Just... when will I get the results? And will you call me, or...? I don’t always check my email. My wife does that for me. So maybe call her? Her number is… 555-123-4567. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The EKG results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. I will have the nurse call your wife at 555-123-4567 as soon as we have them. She can then let you know the results. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. I think. Thank you very much, Doctor Giganti. You've made me feel much better about all this. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. That's what I'm here for. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will be right in to get you set up for the EKG. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
