DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, to be honest, I’m just…checking things out. Been meaning to get a check-up for a while now. Not really sick or anything, just want to see how I’m doing. You know? Just curiosity, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Demondre. Preventative care is very important. It's good you're taking the initiative to get things checked out. So, just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little bit about why now feels like a good time for a check-up?
PATIENT: Hmm…good question. I just got back to town, actually. Been at sea for a while with my work – I’m a sailor, mostly oilin’ stuff on the ships. And before that…things were kinda busy. Divorced and all, you know? Now things are calmer, figured I could finally take a day for myself and see how I'm holdin’ up. Been feelin’ okay, but…better safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, better safe than sorry is always a good approach. And thank you for sharing that, Demondre – life changes can certainly impact your health, and it’s good to be mindful of that. Being a sailor and working with oil… that’s physically demanding work, and potentially exposes you to certain risks. To start, can you tell me about any specific symptoms you’ve been experiencing, even if they’re minor?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is hard work. Lots of liftin’ and bendin’. And yeah, the oil ain’t the cleanest stuff. Symptoms… not really. I get tired, like, really tired sometimes, but I figure that’s just the work. Maybe a little achy in my back, but again… normal, right? I haven't been coughin’ or feelin’ sick or nothin’. Just…tired and achy. And thirsty, actually. Been drinkin’ a lot of water lately. Is that somethin’ to worry about?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, back aches, and increased thirst. Those are all things worth exploring. It’s good you mentioned the thirst, as that can be significant. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ like that. Never been to the doctor much, to be honest. Just when I had to for work, you know? Gotta have a clean bill of health for the ship. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothin’. I think my parents were healthy, too, if that matters. They’re…they’re gone now. But they didn't really have any major problems when they were alive. Just…old age, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to hear your parents were generally healthy. Knowing that family history is helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I did break my arm when I was a kid, fallin’ out of a tree. But that was a long time ago, and they just put it in a cast. Didn't need to go in the hospital for it. Other than that… nope. Pretty boring, health-wise, I guess.
DOCTOR: That is good news, Demondre. A relatively uncomplicated medical history is always a plus. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Sometimes I take ibuprofen if my back really hurts, but that’s it. And…sometimes a multi-vitamin, just when I remember. But it’s not regular, you know? I mostly just try to eat good and get enough sleep when I can. No prescription stuff or nothin’ like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen and a multi-vitamin. That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Shellfish maybe? But I didn't really like it to begin with, so I never ate enough to find out if I was allergic. No bee stings, no bad reactions to any drugs…I think I’m pretty lucky in that department, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Demondre. No known allergies is certainly a relief. Alright. To get a better understanding of your current health, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's okay with you. We'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your general physical condition. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I'm ready. I figured there'd be some checkin' involved, so go ahead. Just let me know if it's gonna be…uncomfortable or somethin'.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. I'll explain everything as I go. First, let’s start with your weight and height. And then I'll take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, and I'll do the rest. Okay, your height is 183 centimeters, and your weight is 91 kilograms. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 37 degrees Celsius. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. 183 and 91, huh? Not bad, I guess. 140/90…a little high, you say? Is that bad? Just let me know if you need me to do anything different.
DOCTOR: It's slightly elevated, Demondre, but not immediately alarming. Blood pressure can fluctuate depending on many factors. We'll need to monitor it over time to see if it remains consistently high. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lung sounds are clear, but a little diminished in the bases…take a deep breath again for me. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and a few simple neurological functions. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Can you tell me when I touch your fingers?
PATIENT: Okay. Diminished in the bases…is that bad? 2+...is that good? Okay, I’m ready. Tell me when you touch me.
DOCTOR: 2+ is normal, Demondre – it indicates a healthy reflex response. Can you feel that?
PATIENT: Yeah, I feel it. On the tips of my fingers, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. That’s good. Alright, Demondre. Based on what I’ve heard and what I’ve found during the exam, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your lung sounds are a little diminished. Everything else seems normal, but I’d like to run some basic blood work to get a clearer picture. This will help rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds smart. If you think it's best to get some blood work done, then yeah, go ahead. Better to be sure, right? What kind of stuff are you lookin’ for, exactly? Just curious. And…where do I go for that?
DOCTOR: That's exactly right, better to be sure. We'll be looking at your basic metabolic panel – that checks your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. We'll also check your cholesterol levels and a complete blood count, which looks at your red and white blood cells. It's a standard set of tests, nothing to worry about. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The phlebotomist, Sarah, is very skilled and will take excellent care of you. She'll explain the process before she begins. It will take about 30 minutes. Do you have any questions about the blood work, or the process?
PATIENT: Okay. Kidney stuff, cholesterol, blood…sounds good. 30 minutes…that’s not bad. Phlebotomist…is that the person who takes the blood? Just…will it hurt a lot? I’m not a big fan of needles, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, a phlebotomist is the person who draws the blood. And I understand your concern about needles. It's perfectly normal to feel a little anxious about that. Most people only feel a brief pinch, and it's over very quickly. Sarah is very gentle and efficient, and she'll do her best to make you comfortable. If you feel faint or unwell at any point during the process, please let her know immediately. After the blood work, we'll get the results back in a few days, and I'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay…a brief pinch. That’s…good to know. A few days…yeah, that sounds good. And I’ll let Sarah know about the needle thing. Just…so, what do you think is goin’ on with my blood pressure? Is it the work? Or is it somethin’ else?
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Demondre. It's difficult to say definitively at this point. Your physically demanding work could be a contributing factor, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. Elevated blood pressure can sometimes be related to genetics, diet, stress, or underlying medical conditions. The blood work will help us identify any potential contributing factors and determine the best course of action. Until we have the results, I recommend trying to reduce your stress levels, maintaining a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep. Also, avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol intake. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Okay, reduce stress, healthy diet, get sleep…I can try. That’s…good advice. I think…I think that’s everything. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly, Doctor. And thanks for bein’ patient with me and all. So, I guess I’ll just go down to room 203 and get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. I’m glad I could help. Yes, that’s correct. Just head down to room 203, and Sarah will take care of you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was nice meeting you, Demondre. I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. .
PATIENT: Nice meeting you too, Doctor Vodzak. Okay, room 203 it is. Thanks again. .
