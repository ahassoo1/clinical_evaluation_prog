DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Aldine. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not constant, but enough to notice, definitely.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Aldine. A headache at the back of your head… and you said it’s been bothering you for a little while now. Could you tell me a bit more about that "little while"?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three weeks ago? Something like that. It comes and goes, mostly in the evenings, I think. After I’ve been workin’ all day, standin’ on my feet. I do nails, you see, manicures and pedicures. Lots of bendin’ and lookin’ down. Could be that, I suppose. It's not the worst pain, not like a migraine, but it's… persistent. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Aldine. Three weeks, mostly evenings after work… and you suspect it might be related to standing and bending for long periods during your work. That’s good information. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well now, let me see… It's not a sharp pain, not really. More like a… dull ache, kinda spread out. Like a band tighten’ around the back of my head. And sometimes, it feels like it goes up the back of my neck a little bit. It's not throbbing, thankfully. Just… uncomfortable. And it never happens when I’m relaxin’, always after work. Does that help? I’m tryin’ to remember everything properly, it’s sometimes hard to explain these things.
DOCTOR: You're doing very well, Aldine. That's very helpful. A dull ache, like a band tightening, sometimes radiating up the neck… and only happening after work when you're not relaxed. Have you noticed anything that makes it better – anything at all that gives you relief, even temporarily?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sittin’ down usually helps a bit. And if my wife, Delphine, rubs my neck and shoulders, that eases it for a little while. Not a cure, mind you, but it takes the edge off. And a warm bath sometimes does the trick, but that's only temporary too. Honestly, nothin’ seems to completely get rid of it, just takes it down a notch for a bit. I usually just try to rest. Delphine worries about me, of course. She's a good woman.
DOCTOR: It sounds like Delphine is a wonderful support, Aldine. And it's good you've found a few things that offer some temporary relief. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you been experiencing any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me think… No dizziness, thankfully. And no blurry vision. No nausea or anything like that. No fever, I checked myself this morning. Just… tired, sometimes. But I’m 87, Doctor, a little tired is normal, isn't it? My memory's not what it used to be, but I haven’t forgotten anything major, if that makes sense. No numbness or weakness in my arms or legs either. Just the headache, mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Aldine. No dizziness, vision changes, nausea, fever, numbness, or weakness – and you've rightly pointed out that some fatigue is common at your age. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you’re aware of – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, now… let me see. Delphine keeps track of most of this, to be honest. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some tablets, and it’s been alright ever since. I stopped takin’ ‘em about a year ago, doctor said I was doin’ well enough. No diabetes, no heart trouble. Just… the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, I suppose. I used to have bad arthritis in my hands, but that's not been botherin’ me much lately, thankfully. Makes it easier to do nails, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was previously treated with medication, but you’ve been off of it for about a year now, and you have some arthritis in your hands that's currently not troubling you. Have you ever had any surgeries, Aldine?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. Yes, actually. A long time ago, when I was quite a bit younger, I had my appendix out. And I broke my arm when I was a boy, fell out of a mango tree. That needed a cast, but it healed up fine. That was… oh, goodness, maybe sixty years ago? Everything feels so long ago these days. Nothing recent, though. No surgeries in the last… well, decades, certainly. Delphine will probably remember the exact dates if you need them. She has a very good memory.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a broken arm in your youth. Good to know. Now, Aldine, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking – even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a little somethin’ for my joints sometimes, when they’re botherin’ me. It’s just ibuprofen, the regular kind you get at the drugstore. Not every day, just when I need it. And sometimes, a little bit of paracetamol for aches and pains. Again, just when I’m feelin’ stiff. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. Mostly just the ibuprofen for the joints, and the paracetamol when I’m feelin’ particularly old, Delphine keeps a little box of ‘em in the kitchen, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen and paracetamol as needed for joint pain. Now, Aldine, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, and Delphine always asks when she gets me somethin’ new, and I always say no. No allergies to food either. I eat everything, thankfully. I haven’t got a delicate stomach, you see. I’m a pretty simple man, really. No allergies, no sensitivities. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Aldine. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and a quick neurological exam. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors pokin’ and proddin’ at me, I’m not afraid of a little exam. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. I’m an old man, everything’s a bit creaky these days. Do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll make sure to be gentle. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here I am, relaxin’ as best as an 87-year-old can. Go ahead. Delphine always tells me to breathe deeply when the doctor's checkin’ my pressure, says it makes it easier. You can tell her I'm listenin' to her, if you like.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 148/82. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your pulse is 76 and regular. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function – just some simple tests to see how your nerves are working. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can do that. My eyes aren’t what they used to be, but I can still follow a finger. There you go, movin' it nice and slow. Easy peasy. Don't worry, I haven't got the shakes or anything, just old age, you see.
DOCTOR: Your eye movements look good, Aldine. No signs of any weakness or imbalance there. Now, I’m going to gently check your reflexes. I’ll tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt too much. Just relax your legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, but they're symmetrical, which is good. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your neck muscles and the back of your head to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, go ahead. I can feel every ache and pain already, so don't worry about me jumpin' at every little poke. Ooh, that’s a bit sore there, right at the base of my skull. That's where the headache usually is, you see? Not sharp pain, just… tender. Feels a little tight too, like a knot. The rest feels alright, just the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can feel some definite tenderness and tightness in the muscles at the base of your skull, Aldine. That correlates with where you’re experiencing the pain. The rest of your neck muscles feel relatively normal, although a bit tight overall. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it's likely that you're experiencing a tension headache, possibly related to the strain from your work. The muscle tightness in your neck and the base of your skull is consistent with that diagnosis. However, given your age and the fact that this has been going on for three weeks, I would like to order some blood work just to rule out any other potential causes. It's a precaution, just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work, you say? Well, I suppose that’s alright. Can’t hurt, can it? Better safe than sorry, as Delphine always says. I don’t mind a little poke if it puts her mind at ease. Just let me know what I need to do, and I’ll get it done. Hopefully it doesn't take too long, though. I've got a manicure appointment tomorrow afternoon, and I don't want to be late for Mrs. Gable. She's a very particular woman, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Aldine. It shouldn't take too long. We’ll just need a routine blood test to check your complete blood count, thyroid function, and a few other basic markers. I’ll give you a requisition form to take to the lab. They're usually quite quick. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest when you can, using over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and applying a warm compress to your neck and shoulders. I’ll also prescribe a muscle relaxant to help ease the tension in your neck. It’s a low dose, and it should help. Once we have the blood work results back, we can discuss a more long-term plan. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Muscle relaxant, blood work, rest… I can manage all that. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old man like me, and not just brushin’ it off as “gettin’ old”. Warm compress, alright. Delphine will be pleased, she's always tellin’ me to warm up my neck. And I’ll take the muscle relaxant as you prescribe. Hopefully, that'll get me back to workin' on Mrs. Gable's nails without a headache. She's got a very important event comin' up, you see. Thank you, Doctor Seil. I feel much better just knowin’ what’s goin’ on. I’ll get that blood work done right away.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aldine. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And don’t worry about Mrs. Gable – we’ll do our best to get you back on your feet as quickly as possible. Here’s the requisition form for the blood work, and here’s the prescription for the muscle relaxant. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again once the results are back. Have a good day, Aldine. And tell Delphine I said hello.
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor. I will, and I'm sure she'll appreciate that. I will get that blood work done tomorrow morning, first thing. And I'll let you know how I'm gettin' on. You have a good day too, Doctor Seil. And thank you again for takin’ the time to listen.
