DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise; my schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Concise is my middle name, Doctor. Though frankly, it shouldn’t be necessary. I’m here because… well, it’s rather obvious, isn’t it? I want to be pregnant. And I want it to happen easily. I don’t have time for complications. I’m 51, not 70. It should just… work.
DOCTOR: “Easily” is rarely a factor in these matters, Ms. Shteynberg. While your age is… not ideal, it doesn't preclude attempting conception. However, a simple desire doesn't always translate to a swift outcome. Let’s gather some information, shall we?
PATIENT: Information? Honestly. Look, I've lived a perfectly healthy life. I cycle everywhere, for goodness sake! I eat reasonably well – mostly. I don’t smoke, haven’t for decades. What specifically do you need to know? Just get on with it, please. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's begin with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? That’s… vague. I had my tonsils out as a child, a very common thing. And a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing that required… hospitalization. Divorced my husband, if that counts as significant. Other than that… no. Perfectly healthy, as I said. Are we done yet? This is all rather… repetitive.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother… something with her knees. Honestly, Doctor, are you expecting me to recite the medical records of every distant relative? It's all rather irrelevant. I'm here for my problem, not theirs. Look, I'm a perfectly strong, capable woman. I need a baby, not a genealogy lesson.
DOCTOR: Irrelevant?
PATIENT: Yes, irrelevant! Unless you’re planning on breeding with my family tree, I fail to see the connection. Look, I understand you need to ask questions, but some of these are… frankly, a waste of everyone’s time. I’ve already established I’m in good health. Can we please move on to, I don’t know, actual solutions? Perhaps some… helpful medication? Or a timetable? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I assure you, I am attempting to gather necessary information. A “timetable” is not something I can provide, and simply demanding medication is… inappropriate. Have you been trying to conceive for a certain period of time?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not actively. I just… assumed it would happen. I mean, I’m still… functional. And my recent… companionship has been… regular. I haven’t been tracking anything, because, frankly, the idea is… undignified. Is that what you want to hear? I thought you’d be offering assistance, not questioning my… methods. Honestly, this is quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: “Functional” is not a medical term, Ms. Shteynberg. And the lack of any tracking complicates matters significantly. As you are over the age of 35, and given your lack of previous attempts, a basic fertility work-up is advisable. We need to assess your ovarian reserve, among other things. It's a standard procedure. Would you consent to blood tests and a transvaginal ultrasound?
PATIENT: Transvaginal… ultrasound? Really? Must we go into that level of detail? Look, I’m not comfortable with… poking and prodding. I came here expecting a simple solution, not a… invasive examination. And blood tests? I suppose that’s acceptable, but the ultrasound… I'd prefer to skip that, if possible. It feels… unnecessary. Are there not other ways to determine my… viability?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, with all due respect, “feeling” is not a substitute for medical assessment. An ultrasound is necessary to evaluate your uterine lining and follicle development. Without it, I cannot responsibly advise you. I can order the blood tests, but I will not proceed without the ultrasound. It is a crucial part of the work-up. We can schedule it for tomorrow. Do you agree to that, or would you prefer a referral to another physician?
PATIENT: Fine! Fine, do your… ultrasound. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. And if it’s unpleasant, I’m holding you responsible. Tomorrow is… acceptable, I suppose. But make it quick. I have things to do, you know. Important things. Not just… lie around being poked and prodded. Now, what exactly will these blood tests involve? I need to know. And don’t use medical jargon, please. I’m not a doctor.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will assess your hormone levels – things like FSH, LH, estradiol, and AMH. It gives us a basic idea of your egg supply and how well your ovaries are functioning. The results will take a few days. I'll schedule both tests for tomorrow morning. We will discuss the results then, and determine the next course of action. Do you have any further questions before I proceed?
PATIENT: Hormone levels… right. Look, I understand you need to do your job, but frankly, this is all rather… disheartening. I came here expecting help, not a full-scale medical investigation. I suppose I have no choice. No, I don't have any further questions. Just… do the tests. And please, be efficient. I'm already wasting my time as it is. Now, if you'll excuse me…
