DOCTOR: Right. Terasa Mayhugh, 59. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Memmolo, is it? Yes. Well, it’s… my ears, mostly. They’ve been playing up. It’s hard to explain. Things just… go quiet sometimes. And I get really dizzy. It’s not constant, thankfully. And… my family, you see. My brother had something similar, I think. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Quiet, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like someone turned the volume down really low. Not painful, just… gone. Then it comes back, usually. It’s just… unsettling, you know? And the spinning… oh, the spinning is the worst part. Makes me feel quite sick. How long does this usually take, to figure out what’s going on?
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. It comes and goes, like waves. I suppose… on and off for maybe… six months now? Perhaps longer. It’s hard to pinpoint. I’ve been trying to ignore it, really. But it's been happening more often lately. My son kept telling me to come, bless him.
DOCTOR: Six months… intermittent. Alright. And have you noticed anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, no. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m standing up too quickly, maybe? But not always. I work… well, I used to work at the casino, running games. Lots of standing. Lots of noise. Maybe it was that? I don't know. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good at remembering things like that. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: The casino…noise exposure… possible. We'll get to that. Now, let's go through some basics. Any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Let me think… sometimes, yes. A faint sort of… whine. Not all the time, just occasionally. It’s… high-pitched, I think? It doesn’t bother me too much, usually. Just… there. Like a quiet mosquito, perhaps? Does that make sense? I’m not sure I’m explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any hearing loss you've noticed?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s what I was trying to say earlier! It's not like I can't hear at all, not ever. It’s just… muffled sometimes. Like someone put cotton wool in my ears. And it goes in and out, as I said. Sometimes one ear seems worse than the other. Is that… is that common with this sort of thing? I’m sorry for rambling. My mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Muffled, intermittent… fluctuating. Alright. Have you ever had any ear infections, or had any problems with wax buildup?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ear infections… when I was a little girl, maybe? I had a lot of sore throats growing up, but I don't specifically remember ear infections. As for wax… well, I sometimes use those little cotton buds, if I feel a bit blocked up. Is that a bad thing? My mother always used them, so I just… carried on. I didn't know it could be harmful.
DOCTOR: Cotton buds… right. Alright. Let's have a look in your ears. Please, sit forward.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I always feel a bit silly having someone poke around in my ears. But do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just be gentle, alright? It's a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just relax. Hmm. Some cerumen present, but nothing excessive. And the right… mild inflammation of the eardrum. Alright. I’m going to do a quick hearing test now, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Inflammation, you say? Is that… bad? I haven’t been feeling unwell, just the ears, as we discussed. A hearing test… that sounds a bit daunting. Will it hurt? I do get a bit anxious with these things. Tell me what to do, slowly, alright? I'm not very good with complicated instructions.
DOCTOR: It’s a simple test. No need to worry. It won't hurt. I will simply have you wear these headphones and indicate when you hear a sound. We just need to see how well you hear different pitches. Put these on, please. And when you hear a beep, raise your hand. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Headphones… beep… raise my hand. I think so. It sounds easy enough. Just tell me if I’m doing it wrong, alright? I don't want to mess everything up. Should I close my eyes? Perhaps that will help.
DOCTOR: Just relax. Listen carefully. Any sound at all?
PATIENT: …No. Nothing yet. Just… quiet. Wait… is that… very, very faint? Almost like a whisper? No… I think not. Definitely nothing. Still quiet. Are you sure it’s working?
DOCTOR: Alright. And now?
PATIENT: …Oh! Yes, I hear it now. A faint beep. Very, very faint, but I can hear it. Just now. Is that right? Did I do it correctly? It’s hard to tell when it’s so quiet. My hearing isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Correct. Good. We’ll continue at this level.
PATIENT: …Yes. I hear it. Again. And… again. It’s… getting a bit annoying, to be honest. Is this going to take long? I do get a bit… fidgety when I have to sit still for too long. It's my knees, you see.
DOCTOR: Almost done. Just a few more pitches.
PATIENT: …Oh! Yes. Definitely hear that one. Clear as a bell. Is it getting louder? I’m starting to feel a bit… strange. My head feels a bit funny. Are you sure everything is alright? This test is… rather intense. Perhaps we should stop for a moment? I'm not feeling very well.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's enough. We have enough information for now. You’re experiencing some slight discomfort, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A bit of a funny feeling in my head, and… well, I just don’t feel quite right. Perhaps it’s the test. Or perhaps it’s just my age. I do get these little spells sometimes. Not often, but… there they are. Is something wrong? You look… concerned.
DOCTOR: It appears you have mild sensorineural hearing loss, more pronounced in the higher frequencies, and some evidence of Eustachian tube dysfunction. This is consistent with your age, noise exposure and history of muffled hearing. We’ll need to rule out other causes. I’m going to order a tympanometry to assess middle ear function and a blood test to check for any underlying inflammation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. All those… words. Eustachian… tympano… it's all a bit much, you see. And blood tests? Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? I’m not very good with medical things. I just want to be able to hear properly again, that's all. And not feel so dizzy all the time. Is there anything… anything simple I can do in the meantime?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It's a precautionary measure. As for something simple… avoid loud noises, try not to use cotton buds, and I’ll prescribe some nasal spray to help with the Eustachian tube dysfunction. It's unlikely to be anything more than age-related hearing loss. But we need to be thorough. I’ll also refer you to an audiologist for a hearing aid evaluation. They can provide a more detailed assessment and discuss options for improving your hearing.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. No cotton buds… nasal spray… a hearing aid evaluation… That sounds… expensive. And a bit scary, to be honest. I've never needed a hearing aid before. When do I need to come back? And what about the blood test? I do get a bit nervous around needles.
DOCTOR: The blood test can be done at the lab downstairs, any time this week. The audiologist appointment is scheduled for August 16th. Follow-up with me in two weeks, after you've had the blood test and seen the audiologist. Any further questions?
