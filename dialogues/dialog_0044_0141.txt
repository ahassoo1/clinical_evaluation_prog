DOCTOR: Good morning, Brendan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this itching, really. Everywhere, it seems. Been going on for a little while now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. It’s not…painful, exactly, just constantly irritating.
DOCTOR: Okay, “itching everywhere” – that’s good information to start with. And you said “a little while now”?
PATIENT: Yeah, “a little while.” Hmm… let me think. Probably… six, maybe eight weeks? It started subtly, I didn't really pay much attention at first, figured it was just dry skin. But it’s gotten steadily worse, you know? It's… constant now. Doesn’t really go away, even with lotion.
DOCTOR: Alright, six to eight weeks, starting subtly and progressively worsening despite using lotion. That helps. Now, is the itching all over, or are there specific areas that are worse than others?
PATIENT: It’s pretty much everywhere, but… my back is the worst, definitely. Hard to reach, of course, so maybe that's part of it? And my arms… the insides of my elbows, especially. And my legs, below the knees. Everywhere else is just… less intense, I guess. Not really better, just less bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so back, inner elbows, and below the knees are the most affected. And it's a constant itch, even with lotion. Have you noticed any changes to your skin along with the itching?
PATIENT: Good question. Let me think… Well, it's a little red in those spots, yeah. Not like a rash, exactly. More… a general redness? And maybe a bit dry-looking, even with the lotion. No bumps, no blisters, nothing like that. Just… red and irritated. Honestly, it’s hard to tell, because I scratch at it so much!
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. Scratching can definitely make it harder to assess. No bumps or blisters is good. Now, have you tried any other treatments for the itching, besides lotion?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, no. Just the lotion, like I said. I figured it would go away on its own, honestly. I'm not one for rushing to the doctor, usually. My wife… she always handled things like this. It's just been… persistent, and starting to interfere with sleep, that's why I came.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good you came in when it started affecting your sleep. Losing sleep makes everything worse. Okay, let’s talk about your medical history a little. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat pretty much everything, and I don't have any sensitivities that I’m aware of. I used to get hay fever as a kid, but that cleared up years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily vitamin, really. Nothing else. And I haven’t taken anything for the itching, apart from trying different kinds of lotion. I take the vitamin for… well, old age, I guess. Doctor recommended it a few years back. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a daily vitamin. Good. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that’s about it, really. And… a bad bout of pneumonia a few years ago, but that cleared up with antibiotics. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. Nothing else to report.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a teenager and pneumonia a few years ago. And your family – do any of your close relatives have any skin conditions – eczema, psoriasis, severe allergies, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had… dry skin, I think. Always complained about it, especially in the winter. But nothing serious, as far as I know. And my sister… she had some allergies as a kid, pollen mostly. But she grew out of them, I think. Nothing really severe, nothing like this itching.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry skin in your mother and some childhood allergies in your sister. Now, just a couple more quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. Tried it once or twice as a young man, didn't like it. No, definitely not a smoker.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that's all. Nothing excessive. Maybe three or four times a week. And it’s not a big glass, either. Mostly with food, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. And finally, what do you do for work, and does your job involve exposure to any chemicals or irritants?
PATIENT: I work as a dispatcher. Mostly on the radio, taking calls. It's mostly office work, to be honest. I don’t really deal with any chemicals or anything like that. Just a lot of talking and typing. It can be stressful, sometimes, but nothing physically demanding.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brendan, that gives me a good starting point. So, to summarize: you've had a constant itch for six to eight weeks, worsening over time despite lotion use, mostly all over but worse on your back, inner elbows, and below your knees. No rash or blisters, just redness and irritation. No known allergies, just a daily vitamin, appendix removal as a teenager, pneumonia a few years ago, some dry skin in your mother, and allergies as a child in your sister. You don’t smoke, a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, and you work as a dispatcher. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to let you have a look. Hopefully, you can figure out what’s causing all this irritation. It’s really starting to get on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I do see some diffuse redness, especially on your back, as you mentioned, and a bit on your inner elbows and below the knees. There's no evidence of a rash, blisters, or any open sores. The skin feels slightly dry to the touch, but no significant scaling. I don’t see any signs of anything obviously concerning, but the diffuse nature of the redness is a little unusual. I'm going to document these findings. Now, to help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a couple of blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, liver function, kidney function, and thyroid levels. Also, I'd like to do a basic metabolic panel. These tests will help rule out a number of potential causes for your itching, like underlying liver disease, kidney problems, or thyroid abnormalities. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to go along with. I just want to get this sorted out. It's just... constantly irritating, you know? I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Okay, the lab technician will come in shortly to draw some blood. It will just be a routine blood draw, and it shouldn’t take long. After the results come back – typically within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to moisturize your skin regularly with a fragrance-free lotion. And try to avoid any harsh soaps or detergents. Also, try to keep your skin cool and dry, as heat and sweating can worsen the itching. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Just… try to keep my skin cool and moisturized. And wait for the results. Thank you very much for seeing me so quickly and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get those results back to you as soon as possible. The lab technician will be in shortly. And don’t hesitate to call the office if your symptoms worsen or if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Brendan.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
