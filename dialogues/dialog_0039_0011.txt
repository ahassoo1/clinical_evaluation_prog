DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get right to it. I need… a paper. A paper sayin’ I can do somethin’. Somethin’ with my… face. That what this is about. Clearance, you said? I need clearance.
DOCTOR: Okay, a paper… for something with your face. Clearance, right. I see. It's a little vague, but we can definitely try to figure out what you need. Could you tell me a bit more about why you need this clearance?
PATIENT: Look, it’s… personal. It’s for a… a thing. A procedure. Folks want to know I can do it, you understand? They need a doctor to say I’m healthy enough. It’s not… complicated. Just a paper. Why does it matter why? You just write the paper, Doctor. That's what you do, right?
DOCTOR: You're right, I do write papers, Mr. Honcoop. But to make sure I can write a proper one, and to keep you safe, I need some information. It’s not about prying, it's about making sure this procedure won't cause you any harm. For example, do you know what kind of procedure it is?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Not really. Some kinda… face lift, maybe? I saw it advertised. They said I needed a doctor's okay. Look, I work with towers, okay? Radio waves and stuff. I ain’t a doctor. I just want to look… better. Is that so hard to understand? And I gotta tell ya, I ain’t got time for a whole lotta questions. I got a schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, a face lift. That's helpful to know. And you’re right, it's not complicated if you're healthy enough for it. Since you're coming to me for clearance, I need to get a little bit of your medical history first. It’s standard procedure, I’m afraid. Have you been seeing any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: Doctors? No. Not for years. Last time I went to a doctor, they told me I was gettin’ old. I didn’t need to hear that! I mostly just… take some aspirin when I need it. That’s it. Look, I ain’t sick. I just wanna fix my face. Can you just… skip the history stuff? It's a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand you feel like it’s a waste of time, Mr. Honcoop, but even if you feel healthy, there could be things I need to know. Things like allergies, or if you have any heart problems, things that aspirin could mask. Just a few quick questions, okay?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I take aspirin. Sometimes. That’s all. I ain’t got allergies, I ain’t got no heart problems, and I don’t wanna talk about it anymore. I’m a busy man! Just tell me if you can write the paper or not, and let me get on with my day. I got towers to climb. Frankly, I’m startin’ to regret comin’ here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I can’t responsibly write a clearance for a procedure like a face lift without knowing a little bit about your health. It’s about making sure you're safe. Could you tell me, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not gonna sit here and be interrogated! I told you, I’m fine! I climb towers for a livin’! That's hard work. Do you think a sick man can climb towers? No! I'm healthy. And if you won't write the paper, then just say so! I got other doctors to see. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, please, just sit down for a moment. I'm not trying to interrogate you, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being. Providing medical clearance without any information could be dangerous. I can’t ethically write that paper without at least performing a basic physical exam and getting a few answers about your health. Would you at least allow me to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart?
