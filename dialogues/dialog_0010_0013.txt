DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seein’ me. It’s… well, it’s my waterin’. It’s been hard to… let it all go, if you know what I mean. Like it’s stuck, kinda. It’s been happenin’ for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're having difficulty with urination – feeling like you're not completely emptying your bladder, and it’s been going on for about a month. “Stuck,” you said. Can you tell me a little more about that sensation?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Stuck… like there’s somethin’ holdin’ it back. Not pain, exactly, just… effort. I gotta push a lot more than I used to. And even then, it feels like there’s still some left in there. It’s uncomfortable, mostly. And I find myself goin’ to the bathroom more often, tryin’ to get it all out, but… not always succeedin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased effort to urinate, a sensation of incomplete emptying, and increased frequency… that gives me a better picture. Is the stream of urine itself different than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think. I suppose it’s… weaker. Not a strong stream like it used to be. More of a trickle, really. And it takes a little while to get goin’, too. Not just… whoosh, you know? It sputters a bit at the start.
DOCTOR: Alright, weaker stream, hesitancy… good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your water – the color, any odor, or blood in it?
PATIENT: No, sir, nothin’ like that. The color looks normal, as far as I can tell. No funny smells, either. And definitely no blood. Just the trouble gettin' it out, like I said. It's mostly just worryin' me, to be honest. Makes a man feel… not himself.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. It’s good that there’s no change in color or blood, that's reassuring. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or abdomen?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, Doctor. My back… well, I’m an older man. It aches a little most days, but that’s just old age, I reckon. Not any new pain, and nothin’ in my belly, no. Just the feelin' of… strainin', when I try to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no new abdominal or back pain. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a bit, years ago, but the doctor got it under control with pills. I stopped takin' 'em a while back, and it's been okay. As for… prostate problems, I haven’t been told nothin’ about that. My wife… she always handled the doctor stuff. It's been a little lonely since she passed, and I don't always remember things like that.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber, and I’m sorry for your loss. It's completely understandable that things might be difficult to recall. High blood pressure, now controlled, is good to know. Let me check your EHR to see what I can find regarding past medical history. Okay, I see here a history of hypertension, as you mentioned, and… some notes about a PSA screening a few years ago. It was within normal limits at that time, but it was several years ago. Any surgeries or hospitalizations that you can recall?
PATIENT: Surgery… hmm. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And I broke my leg once, fallin’ off a ladder. Other than that… nothin’ major that I can recall. No hospital stays, not really. Mostly just colds and flu over the years.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and a broken leg. Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir, nothin’ regular. Just a little aspirin sometimes, for my joints when they're achin’. But it's not every day, and I don’t take it all the time. Just when I really need it. I mostly try to tough it out.
DOCTOR: Alright, just occasional aspirin. And, to finish up the history part, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had one, as far as I know. I can eat pretty much anything. My wife used to tease me about my cast iron stomach. I miss her cookin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. I’m very sorry for your loss again, Mr. Hilber. It sounds like you were very close. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, check your prostate, and do a neurological exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s goin’ on, and get back to feelin’ like myself again.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your abdomen sounds normal. No unusual sounds. Now, I'm going to perform a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. Okay. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but not significantly. It's also smooth, without any obvious nodules. No acute tenderness. Your reflexes and sensation are normal. Now, I’m going to order a urinalysis and a PSA test to get a better idea of what's going on. Would you be able to provide a urine sample for me now?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. That don’t sound too bad. Where should I go? I reckon a man gets used to things over the years.
DOCTOR: Right this way. There’s a private restroom just down the hall. There's a specimen cup and instructions on the counter. Try to collect a midstream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample about halfway through. Once you have it, just bring it back to me and we'll get it sent to the lab. We should have results in a couple of days. While we wait for those results, I’m going to recommend we try a bladder diary, just to track how often you're urinating and how much you're drinking. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. I can do that. Write it down, if you think it’ll help me remember. My memory ain't what it used to be. I’ll go get the sample now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here’s a bladder diary. Just write down the time you urinate, and roughly how much you drank since your last urination. We'll review it when you come back for your results. I’ll be right here when you're finished. Take your time. And again, thank you for coming in today, Mr. Hilber. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. You've put my mind at ease a bit, just talkin' about it. I’ll be right back.
