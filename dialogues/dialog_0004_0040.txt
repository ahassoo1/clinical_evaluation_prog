DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this pain in my side, mostly. It comes and goes, but when it does come, it's not a nice feeling, I can tell you that. And, honestly, I seem to be getting urinary tract infections a lot lately. It’s… troublesome.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Troublesome” is one way to put it. Let's start with this side pain. Can you be more specific about the location?
PATIENT: It's… hard to say exactly. It’s on my side, of course, but more towards my back, I think. Not right on my hip, but… kind of wrapped around, you see? Sometimes it feels like it's deeper than others. Both sides have bothered me, but the left side seems to be the worst of it lately. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you for clarifying. And how would you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp, sudden pain. It’s more of a… dull ache, that builds up. Like a heavy weight pressing on me. And sometimes, when it's really bad, it feels like… waves of discomfort, if you know what I mean. It’s not constant, thankfully, but when it’s there, it's definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Right, a dull ache, building up, with waves of discomfort. And you mentioned this occurs on both sides, but is currently worse on the left. Does anything specific seem to trigger the pain – certain activities, foods, or positions, for instance?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I haven't really noticed anything specific, to be honest. I thought maybe it was something I was eating, but I haven’t been able to find a pattern. It doesn't seem to matter what I’m doing – walking, sitting, lying down… it just comes and goes. Maybe if I’ve been lifting something, it's a bit worse afterwards, but even then, not always. It’s… unpredictable, really.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable is frustrating, I agree. And you also mentioned frequent urinary tract infections. How often would you say you're getting these infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It used to be maybe once a year, which is unpleasant enough. But the last… well, the last six months, it’s been three times. And now I'm starting to feel… anxious about it, to be frank. I don’t want to keep taking antibiotics all the time, you know? It doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about repeated antibiotic use, Mr. Espinueva. That’s very reasonable. Three infections in six months is cause for further investigation. Let's review your past medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… there was something the previous doctor mentioned, years ago now. Something about my kidneys not being quite right. Polycystic… something? He said I had cysts on them. I don’t really remember the details, to be honest. He didn’t say it was anything serious at the time, just something to keep an eye on. I've never really had any problems with my kidneys, until this pain and the infections started.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… yes, I see it noted here, diagnosed approximately fifteen years ago. Stage 1 chronic kidney disease at that time. That certainly could be contributing to both the pain and the recurrent UTIs. Do you recall any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Nothing major, anyway. I had my tonsils out as a child, I suppose. But that was a long time ago. And maybe a broken arm once, when I was a boy. Nothing serious enough to require a hospital stay, as far as I remember. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, until recently. I'm starting to worry, though, if this kidney thing is getting worse.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any kidney problems or UTIs that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one, Doctor. My mother’s side… my grandmother had something, but I don’t remember what. Something to do with her waterworks, perhaps. And my uncle… he was always a bit sickly, but I never knew exactly what was wrong with him. Nobody really talked about illnesses much in my family, if you understand me. It wasn't considered polite, I suppose. So, I don't have much information to give you, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Espinueva. We can still proceed without a detailed family history. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, and also any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Let’s see… right now, I’m only taking a tablet for my blood pressure. Losartan, I think it’s called. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it a few years ago. As for allergies… not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. No trouble with food, no trouble with medicines… I’m pretty good in that regard. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that cleared up years ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never smoked a day in my life. My father always said it was a foolish habit. And I very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with a nice meal once in a blue moon. And definitely no recreational drugs, never have, never will. I like a cup of tea, that's about it. I try to keep things simple, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva, thank you for providing that information. Given your history of polycystic kidney disease, recurrent UTIs, and the side pain, I would like to perform a physical exam and order some lab tests. The exam will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your blood pressure, and a urine sample. The lab tests will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function, and a urine analysis to check for infection. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? It’s been worrying me, and I’m happy to do whatever tests you need. A physical exam and lab tests… yes, that’s fine. When can we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just follow me over here, and we’ll get started. I’ll need you to lie down on the table, and I’ll begin with listening to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam.
PATIENT: Right you are, Doctor. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, I’m afraid. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I'll lie down and do my best to stay still.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. I’m listening to your abdomen now. I'm not hearing anything immediately concerning, although there's a slight tenderness in your left flank. Does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it… right there. A bit tender, yes. Not sharp pain, like I said, just… a dull ache, when you press on it. And maybe a little bit higher up, on my back. It's… it's where the pain usually starts, I think. Is that what you're feeling? It’s hard to explain, you know, it's not a very precise pain.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Espinueva. It’s helpful that you can pinpoint the general location. I’m noting the tenderness in your left flank and upper back. I’m percussing your abdomen now, just to check for any fluid accumulation. Your lungs sound clear, and your heart sounds regular. Now, let's collect a urine sample. There's a collection cup in the bathroom. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample. I’ll leave the room for privacy.
PATIENT: Right. A mid-stream sample… yes, I remember those. I’ll just go to the bathroom then. Tell me if there's anything special I need to do. I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Just a standard sample, Mr. Espinueva. I'll be just outside when you are finished. Take your time.
