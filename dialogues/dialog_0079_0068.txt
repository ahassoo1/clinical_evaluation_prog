DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 59 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning Doctor. Yes, Sasha Queener. It’s… well, my leg. It’s been swelling up. It’s after the… the treatment, you know, for the cancer. It’s just… bigger. And uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: After treatment for cancer… alright. And when you say "bigger," can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, um… Well, it used to be… normal size, I guess. Like my other leg. Now it’s… I don’t know… maybe two or three inches bigger around? It’s hard to say exactly. It’s just… noticeable. And it feels tight.
DOCTOR: Two or three inches larger in circumference… and tight, you say. Is the swelling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly… constant. But it gets worse at the end of the day, I think. If I’m on my feet a lot. Then it gets really uncomfortable. I try to put my feet up, but… it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: And where exactly is the swelling located?
PATIENT: It’s… on my left leg, mostly. From my… knee down to my ankle. Not my foot, thankfully. Just the calf part, really. It’s… hard to explain. It’s just… puffy. All around the back of my leg.
DOCTOR: Calf swelling, left leg only. Has this been getting progressively worse since the cancer treatment ended, or was it sudden?
PATIENT: Oh, it wasn't sudden, no. It started small, you know? Just a little bit. Then it got… more. Slowly. It’s been… a few weeks now, I think. It’s hard to keep track of time, to be honest. It just… keeps getting bigger. That's why I came. I don't want it to get too bad.
DOCTOR: Progressive swelling over several weeks… Alright. And what type of cancer treatment did you receive?
PATIENT: Oh… um… It was… chemo, I think? And… radiation? They gave me pills, too. A lot of pills. It was at the hospital, of course. I don't really remember all the names. It was a long time ago, and I was… not feeling well, you know? Is that okay? I’m not good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Ms. Queener. We can review your records. Let me pull up your oncology report… Ah, here we are. Chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by radiation therapy to the left leg. Was the radiation specifically targeting a tumor in your leg?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. They… found something on my leg. A lump, I think they said. They wanted to get rid of it. I don't really remember the details. I was just… glad they were doing something. It was… scary. Do you need me to tell you more? I’m sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: A tumor treated with radiation… Alright. Now, have you noticed any pain associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit. Not terrible, but… uncomfortable. It’s more of a… ache, really. Especially if I stand too long. Or if I walk a lot. It’s not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. And it feels… heavy. Like my leg is weighing a ton.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, heaviness, exacerbated by standing and walking. Now, let's review your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Oh… um… Let me think. I had my blood pressure, for a while. But they said it was okay now. No… I don’t think so. Nothing major, I don't think. I get a little tired sometimes, but that’s just… old age, you know? I’m Medicare, if that helps. They know everything, hopefully.
DOCTOR: History of hypertension, currently controlled. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, other than what you may have been prescribed during your cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Oh… just the blood pressure pills sometimes. When it gets high. But not every day. And… I take something for my arthritis. It’s… something for the pain. I don't remember the name. A little white pill. It helps a little. That's it, I think. I really don't take many pills. I try not to.
DOCTOR: Intermittent antihypertensive medication, and a medication for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. They always ask, but… no. I eat everything. I don't have any problems with anything. I'm pretty easy, I think. Never had a reaction to anything. It's good to be simple, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's perform a physical examination. I'm going to measure the circumference of both of your legs to assess the swelling. If you would please lie down on the table.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yes, that sounds… good. Is it cold? I get cold easily. And… how long will it take? I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: We can use this blanket if you're cold. It won’t take long, Ms. Queener. Just a few measurements. Now, please lie on your back, and I will begin. Hmm. Your right leg measures 38 centimeters. Now, the left leg… 43 centimeters. As you described, there is a significant difference in circumference. The skin is warm to the touch, and there’s some mild pitting edema present. This confirms the swelling, and the pitting suggests it's fluid accumulation. I'm also going to check your pulses in your feet to assess circulation. Pulses are present, but slightly diminished on the left foot compared to the right.
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… not good. Diminished? What does that mean? Is my leg going to… fall off? I knew I shouldn’t have come. I always worry too much. Is it the cancer coming back?
DOCTOR: Ms. Queener, please try to remain calm. “Diminished” simply means they are slightly weaker than normal, not absent. It is not indicative of your leg falling off. Given your history of cancer treatment and the swelling, pitting edema, and slightly diminished pulse, the most likely cause is lymphedema. This occurs when the lymphatic system, which helps drain fluid from the body, is damaged or blocked, often as a result of radiation therapy. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot in the leg. I am going to order a Doppler ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your leg and rule out DVT. We also need to check your kidney function, as that can contribute to swelling. I will order a basic metabolic panel.
PATIENT: Oh… Lymph-what? And… a blood clot? That sounds… scary. Kidney problems? I don’t understand. I just want my leg to go back to normal. Are you sure it’s not the cancer? I don't want to go through all that again. Is this going to cost a lot of money? .
DOCTOR: Ms. Queener, please. It is important to gather information before jumping to conclusions. Lymphedema is a common side effect of radiation therapy and is not a sign that the cancer is returning. The ultrasound and blood tests are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes. Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, but I cannot guarantee the exact amount. We will address the financial aspect later. I am also going to prescribe a compression stocking to help reduce the swelling and improve fluid drainage. It is important to wear this stocking every day, as directed. I will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the tests and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Do you have any questions?
