DOCTOR: Hi Arlan, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s… it’s my waterworks, I suppose. Going a bit too often, if you catch my drift. It’s bothersome, mostly at night. Wakes my wife, you see. Not ideal. Though, honestly, at my age, something’s always going wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination, especially at night, is definitely something we can look into. It’s good you’re bringing it up. And you’re right, things do tend to change as we get older. So, when did you first start noticing this becoming a problem?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start? That's a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Months, at least. Maybe longer. It comes and goes, you know? Not every night is bad. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to these things unless it’s really bothering me. My wife usually points it out first. She has a good memory, that one.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s common to not keep track of these things. And it’s helpful that your wife has noticed – sometimes another set of eyes is very useful. So, it's been happening for months, comes and goes… besides waking you up at night, are you having any difficulty starting the stream of urine?
PATIENT: Difficulty starting? Hmm. Now you’re asking something. I… I don’t think so. Not that I recall. There's a bit of… hesitation sometimes. But that's just old age, isn't it? Everything slows down eventually. I wouldn’t call it difficulty, no. It just isn’t as… forceful as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, hesitation, not as forceful… that's good information. And you're right, things can change with age. Let’s try to get a bit more detail. Do you feel like you completely empty your bladder when you go, or do you feel like there’s always a little bit left?
PATIENT: A little bit left, probably. Yes, that sounds right. Not a lot, mind you. Just… a feeling. Like it doesn't quite get everything out. I usually have to go back a short while later. My wife says I'm always in the bathroom. She exaggerates, of course. Women… always exaggerating.
DOCTOR: It's good you're able to share these details, Arlan, even the bits about your wife. It all helps me get a clearer picture. So, feeling like you don’t fully empty your bladder, and needing to go back relatively soon after… Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not at all. Burning, either. It's not uncomfortable, exactly. Just… inconvenient. And annoying. Mostly annoying. Like a leaky faucet, you know? Drip, drip, drip. Drives a man mad. Though, I suppose I'm too old to be driven mad by anything anymore.
DOCTOR: A leaky faucet is a good way to put it. No pain or burning, that’s good to hear. And I understand the annoyance. Now, let's talk about other fluids. Do you drink a lot of liquids throughout the day?
PATIENT: Well, I like my tea. Always have. A few cups in the morning, a couple in the afternoon. And water, of course. Can’t go without water. But I wouldn’t say I guzzle it, if that’s what you’re asking. Not like those youngsters with their sugary sodas. Gives me the jitters just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few cups of tea and some water throughout the day… That’s reasonable. And I agree, sugary drinks aren't ideal. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Really, Doctor? What’s that got to do with my waterworks? You’re asking a lot of personal questions, aren’t you? I mean, a man has some dignity left, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Arlan. It may seem unrelated, but the bladder and bowel work closely together, and sometimes changes in one can affect the other. It helps me get a full picture of your health. I apologize if it feels personal, but it’s important information. I understand your concern about dignity, and I’ll try to be as respectful as possible. Have you experienced any constipation, diarrhea, or changes in the color or consistency of your stool?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Don't look at me like I'm a child. Constipation, maybe a bit. Not terrible, but… sluggish, you could say. Everything’s sluggish at my age. As for the color… it’s brown, Doctor. What do you expect? I eat regular food. Don't ask me to start inspecting it, though. That's going too far.
DOCTOR: Sluggish, okay. No major changes, just a bit slower. I appreciate you sharing that. We’re getting a good picture here. Now, one last question about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? High blood pressure, yes. Been on pills for that for… oh, I don't know, twenty years, maybe more. The doctor told me something about my cholesterol too, but I don’t pay much attention to those details. And… my wife mentioned something about my prostate a while back. Some sort of swelling, she said. I had a test, I think. A finger up… well, you can imagine. Didn’t feel right, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, cholesterol concerns, and a prostate test in the past… that’s very helpful information. Do you recall what the doctor said about the prostate test results?
PATIENT: Now that's a tricky one. It was… enlarged, I think. Benign enlargement, maybe? The doctor used a lot of fancy words. Said it was common for men my age. Something about it pressing on the… well, on the plumbing. That’s all I really remember. I mostly remember it being uncomfortable and my wife fussing over me afterward.
DOCTOR: Okay, benign prostate enlargement, pressing on the plumbing… that's a very important piece of the puzzle. Alright, Arlan, thank you for answering all my questions. It sounds like we have a good starting point. Let me just review your records here quickly to confirm some things and see any recent lab results… Okay, here we are. Your blood pressure is generally well-controlled with medication. Cholesterol is a bit elevated, but we can discuss that later. And I see you had a prostate exam about five years ago, and it was noted as mild enlargement. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to check your abdomen, and I'll also do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. It's similar to what you had before, but it will help me get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Another finger up, you mean? Honestly, Doctor, must you? I’m an old man, not a… a specimen. But… alright, alright. If you insist. Just… be quick about it, will you? And try not to make a mess. My wife will have my hide if she finds out.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Arlan. It's not the most comfortable exam, but it's a necessary part of evaluating your symptoms. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible, and I assure you, I'll be professional. Okay, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or fullness… Everything feels normal here. Now, I’m going to ask you to lean forward… … Alright, I can feel your prostate, and it does feel slightly enlarged, as noted in your previous exam. It’s smooth and symmetrical, which is good, but it is pressing on the urethra. Okay, Arlan. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it sounds like you are likely experiencing benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a common condition in men your age. The enlarged prostate is pressing on your urethra, causing the frequent urination, hesitation, and feeling of incomplete emptying.
PATIENT: Benign… what now? Hyper-something? Sounds complicated. So, it’s just… old age, then? My plumbing’s worn out? I figured as much. Honestly, I don't want any fancy treatments or pills if I can avoid it. I’m too old for all that nonsense. Just tell me what I need to do to make it stop bothering me, if anything.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it’s largely related to age and the natural enlargement of the prostate. And it's good you want to avoid unnecessary treatments. BPH isn’t necessarily dangerous, but it can be bothersome, as you know. We can often manage it with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. First, let's talk about fluids. Try to limit your fluid intake, especially in the evening, before bedtime. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Also, try to urinate when you feel the urge, and don't hold it in. And double voiding – that means trying to urinate again a few minutes after you think you're finished – can help empty your bladder more completely. These are simple things, but they can make a big difference. We can also discuss medication if these don’t provide enough relief. There are medications that can help relax the prostate and improve urine flow. Would you like to try these lifestyle changes for a few weeks and see if they help?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… sounds like a lot of fussing. But… alright. I suppose I can try. Less tea, no alcohol… my wife will be pleased about that one. And going to the bathroom more… well, I’m already doing that. A few weeks, you say? And then what? More poking and prodding? I don't want any of those fancy pills unless absolutely necessary. They always have side effects, don't they? Give me a simple solution, Doctor, if you have one.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, and then we'll check in and see how you're doing. If the lifestyle changes aren’t enough, we can discuss medication options. There are several different types, and we can choose one with the fewest potential side effects. There isn’t a simple, one-time cure for BPH, unfortunately. But we can definitely manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. I’m going to order a urine analysis to rule out any infection. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for six weeks from today to see how you’re doing. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, blood in your urine, or inability to urinate, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Fever, chills, blood… you’re making me nervous now, Doctor. All this talk of poking and prodding and infections… honestly. No, I don't think so. Just… try not to poke too much next time. And keep the pills to a minimum. And… tell my wife to be patient with me. She gets a bit fussy when I'm running to the bathroom all the time. Alright, I suppose that’s all. Thank you… I think.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Arlan. We'll take things one step at a time, and I’ll do my best to make you comfortable. I’ll make a note for your wife about her patience. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Arlan. And try to relax. We'll get this sorted out.
PATIENT: Relax… easy for her to say. .
