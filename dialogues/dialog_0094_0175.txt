DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, honestly, it’s this pain I’ve been having. It’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a little while now.” Can you tell me more about the pain, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s mostly in my… well, it’s hard to say exactly where. It feels like it’s deep inside, you know? Not on the surface. And it comes and goes. Some days it’s barely there, other days it really makes it hard to move around. It's just…painful. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Way. Deep pain that comes and goes is definitely something we need to investigate. When did you first notice this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe around April? Yeah, April or May, I think. It was very mild at first, just a little ache after I’d been on my feet a lot. I didn’t really pay much attention to it then. It’s gotten worse gradually, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting around April or May, mild ache after activity, and gradually worsening. And you said it affects your ability to move around on the bad days. Can you describe the type of pain?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It’s not…sharp, exactly. More of a dull ache, but sometimes it feels like a… a squeezing. Yeah, squeezing is a good word. And it's not constant, like I said. It comes in waves, almost. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly well, Mr. Way. Dull ache with squeezing sensations, coming in waves... that gives me a good starting point. Does anything specific seem to trigger the pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Well, definitely walking a lot. And standing for long periods. Even just climbing stairs is pretty rough. Sitting for too long doesn’t help, but it’s not the main thing. Moving around makes it worse, for sure. I work from home now, thankfully, so I don't have to walk much. But I still have to go out sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so walking, standing, and climbing stairs exacerbate the pain. Good to know. And you mentioned you work from home now. Have you always worked from home, or is this a recent change?
PATIENT: It's recent. I used to be an Operations Research Analyst for a big shipping company. Lots of walking around the warehouse, checking things. That was maybe… five years ago? Then I retired, and then I started doing some consulting work from home. That's when I switched to working from home full-time, about a year ago. The pain was already starting a little before that, but it's definitely gotten worse since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain predates the full-time work from home transition, but has worsened since. And you were an Operations Research Analyst, which involved a lot of physical activity. Now, aside from the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven't had any fever or anything like that. No numbness or tingling. Just the pain. I have been a little more tired lately, but I figured that was just getting older. I’m 65, you know. Things start to ache!
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Way. It’s good you’re keeping track of things, though. Fatigue can be a symptom of many things, and it’s good we’re noting it. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but I’ve been managing it with diet and exercise. Mostly, I’ve been pretty healthy. No surgeries or anything major. And I don't take any regular medications, except for a multivitamin. Oh, and my wife keeps reminding me to take fish oil! Is that a medication?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about your overall health, Mr. Way, and managing your blood pressure is excellent. Fish oil doesn't usually count as a regular medication, but it's good you're taking it. So, no major medical conditions or surgeries. What about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had arthritis in her knees when she got older. Pretty bad arthritis, actually. She ended up needing a knee replacement. And my father had… I think it was diabetes? Yes, diabetes. He had to watch his sugar intake very carefully. That’s about it, really. Nothing else major that I can think of. We weren't a very sickly family, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis and diabetes. That’s helpful to know. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. My wife would kill me! I’m a pretty boring guy, Doctor. I mostly just like to read and spend time with my grandkids.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Way. It sounds like you have a good life. Alright, with all that information, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to check your abdomen and range of motion in your legs and back. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Way, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds clear and regular. Now I’m checking your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness anywhere when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn't feel any different than usual. Maybe a little… firm, but not painful. It's hard to say. Oh, wait. There. That feels a little… sensitive. Right about there, on the lower right side. It’s not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for pointing that out. And now I'm going to check your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… not as easy as it used to be. I can get down pretty far, but it hurts a little in my lower back. And my legs feel a little stiff. There. That's about as far as I can go comfortably.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Now, can you stand and lift each leg up, one at a time?
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. There. That’s about as high as I can lift them without it hurting too much. It feels tight, you know? Like something is pulling in my hips.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Way. That gives me a good idea of what’s going on. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing pain related to a few possibilities, including muscle strain, possible hip flexor involvement, and we need to rule out other causes. Given the tenderness in your lower right abdomen, I'd also like to get some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will help us to rule out any more serious conditions. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. If that’s what you think is best, then yes, let's do the blood work and the scan. I’d rather be safe than sorry, you know? I just want to know what’s causing this pain. It’s been worrying me. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Way. It’s always best to be thorough. Okay, I’ll write you an order for the blood work. You can get that done at the lab down the hall. They’ll take a sample and send the results to me. As for the CT scan, I’ll send the order electronically to the imaging center across the street. They will call you to schedule an appointment. It’s important to let them know if you have any allergies or if there's a chance you might be pregnant. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend taking over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen for the pain, as directed on the label. Also, try to avoid any strenuous activity that makes the pain worse. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can take ibuprofen, that's fine. And yes, I'll try to take it easy. No heavy lifting or anything like that. That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it. What kind of timeline are we looking at for the results? Will it be a few days? A week?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I'm glad I could help. The blood work usually comes back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan results can take a little longer, usually 1-2 business days. My office will call you as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, if the pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor Gegan. I feel much better knowing what’s going on and having a plan. Thank you again. I’ll be sure to call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Get some rest, and I’ll see you soon. .
