DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re starting to droop a bit. It’s just… concerning.
DOCTOR: “Weakness” is rather vague, Mr. Schaust. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Right, yes, I understand. Vague isn’t helpful, is it? Hmm… It’s mostly in my arms and legs, I think. It’s not a sudden thing, more like… doing everyday things are becoming harder. Like, carrying groceries, or even just climbing the stairs. They just feel… heavier than they used to. And it gets worse as the day goes on, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: So, progressive weakness, primarily in the limbs, worse with exertion. And this has been going on for… how many months exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started, I’d say, around November last year. So, about nine months now? It was very gradual at first, barely noticeable. But it’s definitely gotten worse the last few months, which is why I finally decided to come in. I thought it was just… getting old, perhaps? Though I don’t feel old. I’m only twenty-five, after all.
DOCTOR: “Getting old” at twenty-five is… unlikely, Mr. Schaust. But we'll investigate. Do you notice any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: That’s fair, yes. No, not really… well, sometimes I feel a bit more tired than usual, but I thought that was just stress from work. And… now that you mention it, my vision has been a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses anyway, so I just figured it was my prescription. I haven't really connected it to the other things.
DOCTOR: Blurred vision and fatigue… Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in… bowel habits? Oh. Um… not really, no. Everything seems… normal there, if you don’t mind me saying. I haven't had any trouble with that, thankfully. Is that… is that something related to the weakness? I’m sorry, I don't really understand what we’re trying to figure out.
DOCTOR: It's important to rule things out, Mr. Schaust. Sometimes seemingly unrelated symptoms can point to a larger issue. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any serious illnesses, or broken any bones, or… anything like that. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, but nothing beyond that. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. Well, until recently, of course. I did have a divorce last year, which was stressful, but I don't think that's… physical.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly exacerbate things, Mr. Schaust. But we need to investigate the physical side. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never been under the knife. Nothing like that. I avoid hospitals if I can, to be honest. I don’t particularly like being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind me saying so. And my ex-wife… well, she had a lot of medical issues, but that’s a whole other story. Nothing to do with me, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother… she has arthritis, I think. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had some sort of heart problem, but I don’t know the details. He passed away when I was quite young. My father… he's mostly healthy, just the usual things for his age. Nothing major that I know of. Oh! My aunt, on my mother’s side, she had something with her nerves, I think. She was always a bit shaky. But I don't know what it was called.
DOCTOR: “Something with her nerves” is not particularly helpful, Mr. Schaust. Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Sorry. I don’t really… keep track of those things. Social history? Do you mean… do I drink? No, not really. I have a beer occasionally with friends, but I don’t smoke, and I don’t use any drugs. I work… a lot. I'm a facilities manager, so I'm usually running around fixing things. It’s a bit lonely, if I’m honest. Especially since the divorce. But that’s not relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: It's all relevant, Mr. Schaust, whether you deem it so or not. Now, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything. I rarely take medication, actually. A painkiller now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. I'm generally quite careful, if you don't mind me saying. I try to stay healthy, and I avoid things that might cause problems. I don't even like taking vitamins, if that tells you anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to perform a physical examination now, Mr. Schaust. We'll start with your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. I… I suppose that’s the next step. Just… let me know if anything feels… strange. I'm not very good with medical things, as you can probably tell.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… diminished bilaterally. Now, let's check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I can do that. Is that… is that enough? It feels a little weaker than normal, to be honest. I usually have a pretty good grip. It's probably just from work, though, right? Lots of repetitive motions?
DOCTOR: Strength is 4/5 in both upper and lower extremities. Some mild weakness noted, as you stated. Now, let’s check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger, repeatedly?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I can do that. It’s a bit harder than it looks. I seem to be a little… shaky. I haven't noticed this before. Is that bad? I’m sorry, I’m probably making a mess of this.
DOCTOR: There is mild ataxia, Mr. Schaust. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear.
PATIENT: Okay. Is everything… alright? You're very quiet. I feel a bit… exposed, if I'm honest. And all these tests… it’s making me worry. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Based on the initial examination, your symptoms – progressive weakness, diminished reflexes, mild ataxia, and blurred vision – are concerning. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but these findings suggest we need to investigate further. I'm going to order some blood work and an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. Do you have any significant medical insurance, Mr. Schaust?
PATIENT: No, I… I don’t. I lost my insurance when I got divorced. It’s… complicated. MRI… that sounds expensive. I… I don’t know if I can afford that. And blood work… how much will all of this cost? What are we looking for, exactly? Is it… something really bad?
DOCTOR: The cost is… a concern. However, we need to determine the cause of your symptoms. We'll start with the blood work. It will help rule out certain deficiencies and infections. As for the MRI… We can discuss options for financial assistance. We need to rule out neurological causes, such as multiple sclerosis or a brain tumor, though I don’t want to alarm you. I'm referring you to a neurologist for further evaluation. Here's a list of neurologists in the area. I’ll also have the lab draw blood today. Do you have any questions, Mr. Schaust?
PATIENT: Multiple sclerosis… a brain tumor… That sounds… terrifying. How long will it take to get the results? And… what if it is something serious? What are the… the options? I… I don’t know what to do. I just want to know what’s happening to me. And… can we maybe talk about the cost again? Perhaps there’s something… something I can do?
DOCTOR: The results will take approximately one week. I understand your anxiety, Mr. Schaust, but we need to remain objective until we have a definitive diagnosis. As for the cost, I can provide you with the billing department's contact information. They may be able to offer a payment plan or connect you with financial assistance programs. I’m referring you to Dr. Anya Sharma. She's an excellent neurologist. Here's her contact information as well. For now, I recommend you avoid strenuous activity and monitor your symptoms. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, vision loss, or severe headaches – seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions before I leave?
