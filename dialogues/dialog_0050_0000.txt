DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s…fine. Honestly, it’s rather bothersome. I had a little cold last week – just a sniffle, really – and now my legs feel like jelly. Not all the time, mind you, but enough to be inconvenient. It's just…weakness, I suppose. Both of them. It's quite disruptive when you're trying to show people things, you know? Running a tour and all.
DOCTOR: I see. A cold last week followed by leg weakness. “Disruptive when you’re trying to show people things…” running a tour, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. I run tours of the historical sites here. It's…demanding work, requires a lot of walking. And frankly, I don't have time for this nonsense. I’m very reliable, you understand. My clients expect a certain standard, and I deliver. It’s just…difficult when my legs decide to give out on me. It makes me look unprofessional. Do you…understand the importance of a good reputation? Some people just don't appreciate quality these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Firestone, I understand the importance of maintaining a professional image. It’s certainly…unfortunate when physical issues interfere with one’s livelihood. Could you describe this weakness in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I collapse, Doctor. It’s more…a feeling of instability. Like they might buckle. And it comes and goes. Sometimes they feel perfectly normal, and other times…other times I need to really concentrate just to walk straight. It's worse after I’ve been standing for a while, I think. And it's both legs, which is just…odd. One would think if I were just tired it would be one, wouldn't it? I’ve been trying to ignore it, to be honest, but it’s getting harder. I simply haven't got time for this.
DOCTOR: “Buckling,” you say. And it’s bilateral – affecting both legs. Worse with prolonged standing. I see. And has this weakness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. No…no collapsing, as I said. No pain, really. A little…tingling, perhaps? In my feet, sometimes. But it comes and goes so quickly I almost dismiss it. It's hard to say if it's even related. I haven't been ill otherwise. No fever, no headaches, no dizziness. Just the weakness. It's rather inconvenient, honestly. Do you think it’s something serious? I have a tour scheduled for next week and I absolutely cannot cancel.
DOCTOR: “Tingling” in the feet… intermittent, you say. It’s important to consider all possibilities, Ms. Firestone. Before we jump to conclusions, let’s review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. Well, I had my gallbladder removed years ago. That was…unpleasant, but it was a long time ago. And I have a bit of…high blood pressure, I think. My previous doctor mentioned it, but I haven’t been to see anyone regularly. I just…don't have the time, honestly. It’s managed with a small pill, I think. I’m not really one for remembering details. But nothing else, no. No diabetes, no arthritis, no…anything serious. I'm generally quite healthy, you know. I walk a great deal for my job, as I’ve said. And I try to eat…reasonably well. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, and a small pill for management. Very good. And any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, no. Just the gallbladder. And…oh, I had my wisdom teeth taken out when I was young. That doesn’t count, does it? It was ages ago, when I was a teenager. Truly, I've been very fortunate, Doctor. I’ve never had any serious illnesses. I'm generally quite…robust. It’s just this leg weakness. It’s so…unsettling. And the timing is just terrible. Do you think it could be…a virus? Perhaps something lingering from the cold? I simply cannot afford to be ill.
DOCTOR: It could be post-viral, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family. That's…complicated. My mother had…arthritis, I think. In her hands. And my father…well, he had heart trouble. He wasn’t very good at looking after himself, honestly. Smoked too much, didn’t eat properly. But that was a long time ago. I don’t really…keep up with my relatives. They live in Honduras. It’s difficult to communicate, you know? I'm not sure if anyone else had anything…significant. I’m rather…removed from that side of the family. It's not something I often think about. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It does. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I find it utterly repulsive. And I only drink…occasionally. A small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Not every night, mind you. I need to be sharp, you understand? Running a tour requires…focus. And I need to be able to think on my feet. Literally. So, no, I don't smoke, and I drink very little. I'm generally quite…moderate. Is that what you were asking, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Firestone. Now, are you currently taking any medications, aside from the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think... well, just the one for my blood pressure, as I mentioned. Oh! And sometimes, if my knees are bothering me - which they occasionally do, all this walking - I take ibuprofen. But it's only as needed. Not every day. Just when I've overdone it a bit. A regular dose, nothing excessive. Do you think that could be it? Perhaps I've been taking too much ibuprofen? I always try to follow the directions on the bottle, but…one forgets, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s possible. Prolonged use of NSAIDs can sometimes have side effects. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it couldn’t hurt. But I assure you, Doctor, I am generally quite…healthy. It’s just this weakness. It’s so…unsettling. And frankly, rather inconvenient. I have a tour scheduled for next week, you understand. And I absolutely cannot cancel. Just please be quick, if you don't mind? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll please have a seat on the examination table. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 76 and regular. Now, I’d like to assess your reflexes. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'm going to test your strength. Please resist as I push against your legs. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally, which is also normal. I’m going to assess your gait now. Please walk a few steps for me. I notice a slight hesitancy in your step, but no obvious weakness or instability. Do you feel any discomfort or tingling while walking?
PATIENT: Well, that was…thorough. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine walking, Doctor. It’s just…the feeling of weakness, you understand? It’s hard to describe. It’s not that I can’t walk, it's that I worry I might not be able to. It's unsettling. And frankly, rather embarrassing. I run a professional tour, you know. People expect a certain…confidence. I try to ignore it, but it’s always there, lurking in the back of my mind. And it's worse after I've been standing for a while. It’s just…a feeling. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain. Is there anything wrong with my legs, Doctor? Tell me straight. I don’t have time for vague explanations.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Ms. Firestone, it is difficult to explain. The examination is largely normal, which makes it more challenging. Your reflexes and strength are within normal limits, and your gait, while showing slight hesitancy, doesn't reveal any significant abnormalities. However, your concern is valid, and the sensation of weakness warrants further investigation. At this point, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or electrolyte imbalances. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your neurological function. While it's likely nothing serious, it’s always best to be thorough. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work and a neurologist? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds rather…excessive. Are you sure it’s necessary? I assure you, I am generally very healthy. Perhaps it's just…stress? Running a tour is demanding work, you know. A lot of responsibility. And frankly, a lot of walking. I’m simply not accustomed to being…fussed over like this. But…if it will rule things out, I suppose. I absolutely cannot cancel my tour next week. It’s…crucial. But please, Doctor, make it quick? I have a schedule to keep. And if it turns out to be nothing…serious, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t suggest any further…interventions. Just tell me it’s nothing, and I'd like to get on with my life. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Firestone, I understand. We will proceed with the blood work to rule out any obvious medical causes. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a Vitamin D level. I will also submit a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist in the area. She’s excellent. The blood work will take a few days to process, and it may take a week or two to get an appointment with Dr. Ramirez. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. And if your weakness worsens, or you experience any new symptoms – such as numbness, tingling, or difficulty walking – please contact my office immediately. While I cannot definitively say what is causing your weakness at this time, I believe these tests will provide us with more information. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable…yes, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my tour. Honestly, I just want to get this sorted out quickly. It’s…disruptive, you understand? Running a professional tour requires a certain…stability. And this weakness is…unsettling. So, blood work and a neurologist. Fine. But please, Doctor, keep me informed? I don't want to be left in the dark. And if everything turns out to be normal…I’d like a written note stating that. Just for peace of mind, you know? It’s…reassuring to have something tangible. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a schedule to keep. And a tour to prepare for. Is there anything else, or can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Firestone, you are free to go now. My staff will schedule your blood work and the neurology appointment. We will notify you as soon as the results are available, and I will be happy to provide you with a written summary of the findings once we have a definitive conclusion. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you experience any changes in your condition. Thank you for your patience, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly. .
