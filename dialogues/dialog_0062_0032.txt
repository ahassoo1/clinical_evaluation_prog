DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Krok, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… that’s a rather… direct question, isn’t it? One doesn’t simply broadcast such matters. But, if you must know… there’s been… a bit of an issue. A most unpleasant issue, actually. It's been going on for a little while now. I suppose it’s best to get it sorted, though I must say, it's hardly a topic for polite conversation.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krok. It can be difficult to talk about personal matters, especially if it’s something you’re not comfortable with. There's no rush, and you can tell me as much or as little as you feel able to. We’ll just take it one step at a time. Perhaps you could start by telling me what’s been bothering you, and for how long it’s been going on?
PATIENT: Very well. It's… a discharge, Doctor. A most unwelcome one. And it's been… oh dear, time escapes me these days. A few weeks, perhaps? Maybe longer. It's not painful, precisely, but… irritating. And rather… messy. My wife, bless her soul, has been most understanding, but one doesn’t want to trouble her unduly. It just… is. Do you follow? I haven’t the faintest idea what’s caused it, mind you. I’ve always been a careful man.
DOCTOR: I do follow, Mr. Krok. A discharge for a few weeks, not painful but irritating. That’s helpful to know. To get a better understanding, could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Good heavens. It’s… well, it's not like water, certainly. More… viscous. And a rather unpleasant colour, if I’m honest. A sort of… yellowish-grey, I suppose. Not bright yellow, thankfully. More muted. And there’s… an odour. Not a strong odour, but… present. It stains the… undergarments, naturally. A most disagreeable situation all around. I’ve been attempting to… manage it, with… well, with what one has on hand, but it doesn’t seem to be improving. Does that suffice? I’m not accustomed to discussing such… intimate details.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Krok, thank you for being so forthcoming. Yellowish-grey, viscous, with an odour… and staining your undergarments. It sounds quite bothersome. Now, is this discharge coming from anywhere specific, or is it more general?
PATIENT: Specific? Well, Doctor, where else would it come from? It’s… emanating from the… appropriate region. From the… tip, I suppose. Though I hardly examine myself with a magnifying glass, you understand. It's not a hobby of mine. It's… certainly not coming from my ear, if that's what you mean. Is that specific enough? Honestly, this is quite undignified. I pride myself on being a man of… decorum.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. That clarifies things nicely. It's coming from the tip of the penis. No need to apologize for feeling undignified; this is what I'm here for. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. Well, there's been a slight… burning sensation, occasionally. Not constant, mind you. More like a… tickle, really. And… yes, I suppose I've felt a little more… fatigued than usual. But I am an old man, Doctor. One tires easily these days. Is that what you mean by symptoms? I haven't noticed any… swelling or anything of that nature. Just the discharge and the occasional… irritation. And the fatigue, of course. It's difficult to say what's caused by what, at my age. Everything aches, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a slight burning sensation, intermittent, and some increased fatigue. No swelling. That’s good to know. Now, Mr. Krok, I’m going to ask some more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Fever? Goodness no. I haven't been ill, Doctor. Just… inconvenienced. A slight chill, perhaps, on a particularly damp evening, but nothing one wouldn’t expect. I keep a good fire burning, you see. My wife is very particular about that. A proper hearth is essential in a home, she always says. But a proper fever? No. I haven't been bedridden or anything of that nature. I'm a sturdy man, generally. Though perhaps a little… worn around the edges these days. It's the years, you see. The years take their toll.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever or chills. Now, have you had any recent changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Changes in my… urination? What sort of changes? It’s… urination, Doctor. One urinates. It’s hardly a topic for detailed examination, is it? I suppose… it’s been a little more frequent, perhaps. And… yes, now that you mention it, there's been a slight… stinging sensation when I go. Not terrible, mind you. But noticeable. Is that what you mean by changes? It's hardly a dramatic alteration, you see. Just a little… discomfort. And a bit more frequent. Though I do enjoy a good cup of tea, and that naturally leads to… increased frequency.
DOCTOR: Alright, increased frequency and a slight stinging sensation during urination. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical history… Good heavens. At my age, it’s a rather lengthy document, I assure you. Let me see… My wife handles most of those details. She’s very organized. High blood pressure, yes, I believe so. The doctor mentioned it… a few years ago. Diabetes… I don’t think so. She always monitors my sugar intake, thankfully. And… there was a touch of rheumatism, years ago. But it’s mostly settled now. I take a tonic, you see. A rather potent tonic. She insists on it. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. I’m not one for remembering dates and ailments. I leave that to my wife. She has a remarkable memory for such things.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Krok. High blood pressure is good to know. And you mentioned a history of rheumatism. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! Are you… implying something? I am a married man! A respectable man! I have been faithful to my wife for… well, for a very long time. To even suggest such a thing… it's… outrageous! I will not dignify that question with a response. It is… inappropriate. I came to you for medical assistance, not… character assessment. Honestly, I am appalled. .
DOCTOR: Oh, Mr. Krok, please forgive me. I apologize profusely. That was a deeply insensitive question, and I should not have asked it. It was a standard part of the assessment, but completely inappropriate given your circumstances and… frankly, completely unnecessary to pursue. Please accept my sincerest apologies. Let's move on. Now, can you tell me about any surgeries you've had in the past?
