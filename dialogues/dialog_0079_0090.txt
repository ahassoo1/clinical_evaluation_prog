DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. I see here you're 29 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Um, well, I’m here for a check-up before some… surgery. It's cosmetic, actually. I believe that's what my… the office said? It’s all a bit… fuzzy, honestly. I apologize if I seem a little lost.
DOCTOR: Cosmetic surgery, yes. And a pre-operative assessment. Fuzzy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s… difficult to recall all the specifics. It was a decision my husband and I made together, and… well, things have been a bit of a blur since then. I just want to make sure I’m healthy enough to go through with it, and that everything is… safe. I don’t remember exactly what the surgery is for, if I’m being completely honest. Does that… sound odd?
DOCTOR: Not… ideal, Ms. Brightful, but not unheard of. People often have anxieties surrounding procedures. We will certainly get to the bottom of it. Let's start with a general overview of your health. Do you have any significant past medical problems – anything you’ve been treated for previously, or are currently managing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… I don’t recall anything major, Doctor. I’ve always been fairly healthy, I believe. Maybe a bad cold here or there, but nothing that required… a lot of attention. My husband always handled the… the doctor’s appointments. He was very… organized. I do have private insurance, if that’s helpful? I’m just… drawing a blank on specific illnesses or conditions.
DOCTOR: Insurance is helpful for billing, yes. Let’s try this another way. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: I… I don’t think so, Doctor. No, I don't recall any surgeries. Perhaps a wisdom tooth removed when I was younger? But I honestly can’t be certain. It was a long time ago, and… well, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is it alright if I pause for a moment? Trying to remember is… a little exhausting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Brightful. Take your time. Though, for the record, it is important to have a clear surgical history. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, herbal supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications regularly. Not even vitamins, I don't think. My husband… he was the one who always made sure we had everything we needed. I might have taken something for a headache occasionally, but nothing… consistent. I really wish I could be more helpful. This is terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t believe so, Doctor. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything I can recall. But, again, my husband usually handled that sort of thing. He was very careful about… everything. I feel awful that I can’t provide more details. It's just… so much has happened. I don’t remember things the way I used to.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to your family history, then. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we didn’t talk much about health. My parents… they passed away when I was quite young. And I didn’t have a lot of contact with my extended family. I know my mother had… something with her heart, I think. But I don’t know the specifics. I’m so sorry. I wish I could be more helpful, truly. I feel like I’m failing this entire examination.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal, Ms. Brightful. But we will proceed as best we can. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. My husband… he didn’t approve. And honestly, I never had any interest. I try to be… healthy, when I can. I enjoy gardening, actually. It’s… peaceful. Though, it’s been difficult to keep up with things lately. I apologize for rambling. I seem to be doing a lot of that.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally, Doctor. Just… a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive. My husband and I… we enjoyed a glass of wine together. But I haven’t had any in… quite a while now. It doesn’t… feel right, without him. I’m sorry. I’m getting emotional. I didn’t mean to…
DOCTOR: It’s understandable, Ms. Brightful. Now, lastly regarding lifestyle, can you describe your typical diet and exercise routine?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of fruits and vegetables, when I can. I enjoy cooking, actually. And, as I mentioned, I used to garden quite a bit. That was good exercise, I suppose. But… since my husband passed away, I haven’t been as motivated. I don't really have much of an appetite these days. I mostly… eat simple things. I apologize. I'm not very good at describing routines. It feels like… a long time since I had a proper routine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful. Now, given the vague history, and the impending surgery, I need to conduct a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… perfectly acceptable. I understand. Anything to make sure I’m… healthy enough. Please, go ahead. I’ll… try to cooperate as best I can. I just… I hope this doesn’t take too long. I get a little… overwhelmed easily.
DOCTOR: First, I'll check your vital signs. Blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in... and out. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Now, could you please step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. ...Is something wrong? It feels like it took a long time to register. I've… I've been a little preoccupied lately, and I haven't really been paying attention to my weight. I apologize if this is a silly question.
DOCTOR: Weight is 93 kilograms, which is approximately 205 pounds. And your height is recorded as 155 centimeters, or about 5'1". That puts your BMI at 38.6, classifying as obese. Now, Ms. Brightful, while these vital signs aren’t immediately alarming, your weight does present a potential concern, particularly given the upcoming surgery. It can increase the risk of complications. We may need to consider some pre-operative weight management strategies. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: ...Weight management? Oh. I… I hadn't realized. I mean, I knew I’d gained some weight, but… I didn’t know it was that much. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t been thinking clearly since… well, you know. Is it… serious? Will it prevent me from having the surgery? I just… I had so much hope. And I… I don’t know where to even begin.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, it doesn’t necessarily prevent the surgery, but it does elevate the risks. Increased risk of infection, delayed wound healing, and complications with anesthesia. It’s something we need to address. Now, given your history – or lack thereof – and your current weight, I recommend a consultation with an endocrinologist to rule out any underlying metabolic issues and to discuss a safe and effective weight management plan. We also need to get some baseline bloodwork to assess your overall health. Would you be amenable to those recommendations?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Whatever you think is best. An endocrinologist… and bloodwork. I’ll… I’ll do whatever it takes. I just want to be healthy enough. And… I want to make sure the surgery is safe. I trust your judgment. It’s just… a lot to take in, all at once. Will you be coordinating these appointments for me? I’m not sure I’m capable of managing everything right now. I apologize for being… difficult.
DOCTOR: My office will schedule those appointments for you. We'll coordinate with the endocrinologist and the lab to ensure a seamless process. I'll also have my assistant provide you with a list of pre-operative instructions and resources. Now, are there any other concerns or questions you have for me at this time, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough. And… patient. I apologize again for not being more prepared. It’s just… a difficult time. I’m grateful for your help. And… thank you for not judging me. I really appreciate it. I suppose… I’ll just wait to hear from your assistant about the appointments? Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You've done what you could, Ms. Brightful. Simply wait for my assistant to contact you regarding the scheduling of the appointments. We will review the results of the bloodwork and the endocrinologist's assessment at a follow-up appointment, which we will schedule shortly. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms – fever, shortness of breath, chest pain – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions regarding that information?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I understand. No concerning symptoms. I’ll… I’ll be careful. Thank you again. For everything. I think… I think I’m ready to leave now. If you’ll excuse me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Brightful. My assistant will see you to the reception desk. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if any questions arise. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
