DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Tosca. It’s lovely to meet you too. Oh, it’s these hiccups! They started a few days ago and just won’t stop. It’s rather embarrassing, really, especially when I’m trying to have a nice chat with people.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can certainly be disruptive and frustrating. A few days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about three days now. They come and go, but they’ve been pretty consistent since yesterday. Not constant, mind you, but… enough to be annoying. I’ve tried holding my breath, like my grandmother used to tell me, and drinking water upside down. Nothing seems to work for long.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or anything that makes them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I haven’t really noticed a specific trigger, no. I was gardening yesterday, bending over a lot, and they were pretty bad then. But they were happening before that too, just… less frequently. Eating doesn’t seem to make them worse, and neither does drinking. I really can’t put my finger on it. It’s just… random.
DOCTOR: Alright, random hiccups for three days. And you’ve tried the common remedies – holding your breath, drinking water upside down – without much relief. Have you experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes, I have. Not this long, usually. When I was a girl, growing up in Fiji, I’d get them sometimes after laughing really hard with my cousins. They’d always go away pretty quickly then. But never like this. Never lasting days. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest. I’m not a young spring chicken anymore, you see!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Sucich. It's good you've noticed this is a bit different than hiccups you've had in the past. Let's do a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be… forty years now? And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, which is just part of getting old, I suppose. Nothing major. Oh! And I was diagnosed with mild hypertension a few years back, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I take a small dose of lisinopril every day. Apart from that… I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think! I try to stay active, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal forty years ago, arthritis in the knees, and well-controlled hypertension treated with lisinopril. That’s helpful to know. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the lisinopril, Dr. Tosca. And a daily multivitamin, that’s all. Nothing fancy. I used to take calcium for my bones, but my doctor said I was getting enough in my diet, so I stopped that a while back. I try to eat a good, balanced diet, you see. Lots of fruits and vegetables. And fish, when I can get it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, traveling and whatnot. No problems at all. I don’t even get mosquito bites very often, which is lucky living in this climate.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, Ms. Sucich, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… well, my mother lived to be 92, and she was quite healthy until the very end. My father passed away younger, in his 70s, from a heart condition. He smoked a lot, unfortunately. My brother has diabetes, but other than that, no major illnesses on either side of the family, as far as I know. Everyone lived a long time, mostly. It's funny, isn't it, how some things just skip generations?
DOCTOR: It is. Alright, thank you for that information. Now, before we move on, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, as I mentioned, and it wasn't a pretty sight. I always vowed I'd stay far away from them. And I have! I always thought they were a terrible habit.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, Dr. Tosca. Nothing heavy. Mostly on weekends, if I'm having a nice meal. I don't drink every day, and when I do, it's only one glass. I used to enjoy a little sherry with my girlfriends, but I've cut back on that lately. Just trying to be sensible, you know?
DOCTOR: That sounds very sensible. Okay, Ms. Sucich, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn't take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Dr. Tosca. Go right ahead. I’m not worried, but I do appreciate you being thorough. It's always good to know everything is as it should be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sucich, just take some nice, deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, not tender to touch. No masses or organomegaly detected. Bowel sounds are normal. Everything seems normal so far, Ms. Sucich. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Dr. Tosca. It’s reassuring to know things seem normal. Go ahead with the reflexes, please. I used to be quite nimble, but I think they’re slowing down a bit these days!
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age, Ms. Sucich. Nothing concerning. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Pulse is 72 and regular. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Now, given the persistent hiccups and your age, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests, just to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Dr. Tosca. If it puts my mind at ease, then absolutely. Blood tests are no trouble at all. What sort of things will they be looking for? Just so I have an idea.
DOCTOR: We'll check a complete blood count to look for any signs of infection or anemia. We'll also check your electrolytes – sodium, potassium, calcium – to make sure those are balanced. And we'll check your kidney function and liver function, just to be thorough. It's a pretty standard set of tests, Ms. Sucich. It will help us rule out anything serious. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds very reasonable, Dr. Tosca. You’ve explained it all very clearly. So, just to be sure, it's nothing to worry about, just a routine check? I’m probably being silly, but I always get a little anxious about tests.
DOCTOR: You're not being silly at all, Ms. Sucich. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests. And yes, it is mostly a routine check. Given the duration of your hiccups and your age, we just want to make sure everything is working as it should be. We'll send the blood sample to the lab, and the results should be back in a couple of days. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if your hiccups get significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain – please don’t hesitate to come back or go to the emergency room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Dr. Tosca. Thank you for being so thorough and reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll keep an eye on things and call if anything changes. And I’ll look forward to hearing from you in a couple of days. I suppose I should go and get that blood drawn, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. My nurse will be in shortly to take you to the lab. She'll explain the process to you. And again, please don’t hesitate to ask her any questions you have. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Dr. Tosca. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again for your time and patience. I really appreciate it. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sucich. I'm glad I could help. We’ll get those tests done and figure out what’s going on. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon.
