DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It's… well, it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It feels like there’s always a little bit left, you know? It’s been happening for a while now, a few months, maybe longer. It’s just… inconvenient, and a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds frustrating to not feel like you’re fully emptying your bladder. A few months, you said… hmm. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, frustrating is a good word. It's… not painful, exactly. More like a straining feeling. I have to… push a little bit to get it going, and then even after that, it doesn’t always feel like everything comes out. It happens every time, I think. And I have to go… more often than I used to, especially at night. Waking up a couple times, you know? My wife… she used to help me remember these things, but… well, she’s gone now. So, it's hard to say exactly how long. A long time, though.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Dondre. That must be very difficult. And you're right to get this checked out – it's good you're addressing it. So, no pain, but straining and a feeling of incomplete emptying, and increased frequency, especially at night… okay. Do you find yourself having any trouble starting the stream of urine, or is it just the emptying part that’s difficult?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. It doesn’t usually bother me starting it. It flows… okay, when it gets going. It’s more that… it doesn’t feel like it stops when it should. Like there’s still some left inside, even when I think I’m done. I have to… try again sometimes, and push a little harder. It’s… hard to explain. I just feel like it's not all coming out at once, you know?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Dondre. It sounds like you have good awareness of your body. So, good start, but incomplete emptying, requiring straining... alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in the strength of the stream itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It… it doesn't feel weak, exactly. It feels… normal when it’s going, but maybe it doesn't go as far as it used to? It’s hard to say, I don’t really… pay attention to that part. I just know it feels like it takes longer to finish. And like I said, I have to push a little. I don’t know if that affects the stream, or not. It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, no noticeable weakness, but perhaps not as forceful as before… and you’re needing to strain. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I don't have a whole lot. I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was okay after I started watching my salt. Other than that… nothing major. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. I have Medicare, if that's important. My wife… she took care of all the paperwork. I don’t really remember much of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some history of blood pressure, now controlled with diet, and otherwise generally healthy. Medicare is good to know, thank you. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a young man, working on a boat. Had surgery for that, a long time ago. That’s… about it, I think. No other surgeries, and haven't been in the hospital since then. Just the usual doctor’s visits for check-ups and things like that. Nothing serious. I was always a strong one, you know? Didn't get sick much. It's just… this water problem is worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright, a broken arm repaired long ago, and otherwise no significant surgical history. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a hard question, Doctor. My family… we didn’t talk much about that sort of thing. My mother… she had a little trouble with her kidneys when she was older, I think. And my father… he had a weak heart, I remember that. He passed when he was fairly young. But other than that… I don’t really know. We didn’t have much contact with the rest of the family. We lived pretty far away. It’s hard to say, really. I don't know a lot about their medical histories.
DOCTOR: Okay, some possible family history of kidney issues and heart problems. That’s helpful to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve taken all sorts of medicines over the years. My wife… she always made sure I took what the doctor prescribed. She was very careful about that. No allergies. I don't think. I don't remember ever having one.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just try to eat healthy and get a little bit of exercise. That's what my wife always told me, anyway. No medicines. Not even vitamins. I just… haven’t needed any, I guess. Until now. With this water problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications currently. That simplifies things. Alright, Dondre, based on what you've told me – the straining, incomplete emptying, increased frequency, especially at night, and no fever or pain – we need to investigate a little further. It could be a number of things, including an enlarged prostate, which is common as men get older, or possibly a bladder issue. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, and then I'll order a urine test to check for infection and other problems. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. An exam and a test… that's fine. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I don't like feeling like I can't… get everything out. So, whatever you need to do, just let me know. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then I'll do a quick neurological exam – just to make sure everything is functioning properly. Finally, I'll do a digital rectal exam – that’s where I gently examine your prostate through the rectum. It's not the most comfortable thing, but it gives me important information. I’ll explain everything as I go. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during any of this, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. I’ll let you know. It’s… not something I’m looking forward to, but I’m willing to do whatever you think is necessary. I’ve always been a tough one, so I can handle it. Just… please be gentle, if you wouldn’t mind. And explain things as you go, like you said. That would be helpful. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Dondre. I'll be as gentle as possible and explain everything beforehand. Everything sounds normal so far with your abdomen and reflexes. Now, for the rectal exam. I’m going to ask you to lean forward on the exam table, and I'll be using a lubricated gloved finger to gently examine your rectum and prostate. This will help me assess the size and shape of your prostate, and check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It may feel like you have the urge to urinate, but it should not be painful. It will only take a few moments. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I think so. Just… let me know when you’re starting, okay? I don’t want to be… startled. I’ll try to relax. It’s… not my favorite thing, but I understand it’s important. Just go slow. And… please, be gentle. That’s all I ask. Alright. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dondre. Taking a deep breath... I’m going to start now. Alright. That's done. I did feel some enlargement of your prostate, and it felt a little bit firm, but not particularly hard. There was no obvious tenderness. This is consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a common condition in men your age. It means your prostate is enlarged, which can cause some of the symptoms you’ve been experiencing. Now, to be sure, we need to send a urine sample to the lab to rule out any infection or other issues. I’ll have the nurse come in and give you a cup to collect a sample. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… alright. An enlarged prostate… BPH… is that serious? Is it something that can be fixed? I appreciate you explaining things to me. I'm glad you checked. A urine sample… yes, I can do that. Just let me know what I need to do, and I'll collect it. I just want to feel normal again. So, whatever you recommend, I’m willing to try.
DOCTOR: BPH isn’t usually serious, Dondre, but it can be bothersome, as you’ve experienced. It’s very common – many men experience it as they age. There are a number of treatments available, ranging from lifestyle changes and medications to more invasive procedures, if necessary. We'll start with the urine test to rule out infection, and then we can discuss the best course of action based on the results. The nurse will be in shortly with the cup for the urine sample. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect the sample about halfway through. She will give you instructions. It's nothing to worry about. In the meantime, I'll order the urine test and will review the results as soon as they come back. I’ll also print out some information about BPH for you to read while you wait. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. A urine sample and some information to read… that’s a good plan. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, and for not rushing me. I just want to get this figured out, and get back to feeling like myself again. Thank you. I’ll wait for the nurse, and I'll collect the sample when she comes. And I’ll read the information you print out. Just let me know if there’s anything else I need to do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dondre. That's what I'm here for. The nurse, Sarah, will be with you shortly. She's excellent and will walk you through everything. Don't hesitate to ask her any questions you have. In the meantime, try to relax. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll be back in a few minutes to discuss the results of the urine test once they’re available.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I will wait for Sarah, and I'll try to relax. .
