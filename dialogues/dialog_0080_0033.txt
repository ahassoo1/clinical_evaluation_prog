DOCTOR: Hi Burdette, it's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's…difficult to explain. Things haven’t been quite right, you understand. My vision…and hearing…they’ve just…gone. Or, mostly gone. It happened rather suddenly, and frankly, I haven’t the time for drawn-out explanations. I have a very busy schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sudden changes in vision and hearing are concerning, and I appreciate you coming in right away. “Mostly gone” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it's all a bit of a blur. Things are…dim. Fuzzy. Like looking through a dirty window, perhaps? And sounds…they’re muted. Distant. It's most inconvenient, naturally. I can’t quite make out what people are saying unless they shout, and even then, it’s…unclear. I really can't spend all day asking people to repeat themselves, you see. I have standards.
DOCTOR: Right, dim and fuzzy vision and muted, distant hearing. And this all came on suddenly?
PATIENT: Yes, suddenly! As I said. It wasn't a gradual decline, if that's what you're implying. It happened…well, it was a few days ago, I believe. Perhaps a week? Dates aren't terribly important, Doctor. The fact is it happened, and it's quite distressing. I’ve never experienced anything like it. And truthfully, I suspect it's something…unpleasant. I don't like doctors much, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week or so, coming on suddenly. I understand your hesitation about doctors, Burdette, but we need to figure out what's going on. Let's start with some basics. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly, Doctor, are you suggesting I'm making this up? It's quite obvious something is wrong with my sight and hearing! However… now that you mention it… I have been feeling rather… fatigued. And a little… off-balance, perhaps. But these things happen when one is a busy woman, don’t they? It's probably just… stress. I assure you, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and feeling off-balance are good things to mention, Burdette, even if you think they’re just stress. Those can sometimes be related. Have you had any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… hmm. Well, occasionally. Not terribly severe. More of a… pressure, really. Behind the eyes, perhaps? Though, I suspect that's from reading so many important documents. One must stay informed, you see. It’s not a headache that would necessitate a doctor’s visit, certainly. Honestly, I’m not sure why we are dwelling on these insignificant details. Are you going to do something, Doctor, or are we simply going to discuss my lifestyle?
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure behind the eyes… alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you're agreeable. Just a quick check of your vision, hearing, and a neurological exam to check your balance. It will give us a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Must we? It seems rather… unnecessary, given the obviousness of the situation. However… very well. But please, be quick about it. I have a luncheon meeting, and I absolutely cannot be late. And do try not to poke and prod too much. I have sensitive skin, you understand. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Burdette. I'll be as gentle and efficient as possible. Let's start with your vision. Could you please look straight ahead at this chart and tell me what you see?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a blur. Fuzziness, as I said. I can… perhaps make out some dark shapes? But I can’t decipher any letters. It's rather pathetic, really. I used to have excellent vision. Perfectly adequate for reading important contracts, you understand. This is…unacceptable. Are you sure this machine is functioning correctly?
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s try this closer up. Just tell me what you see on this chart, even if it’s just shapes. And don't worry about trying to be perfect; just do your best.
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. This is… excruciating. I can barely distinguish anything. Perhaps an ‘E’? No… wait. A blurry line. Honestly, Doctor, it's quite humiliating. I can’t possibly read this. It’s… a complete disaster. Are you quite sure you’re not wasting my time? I feel rather faint, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, Burdette. We’ll move on. Let’s take a look at your ears now. This won't take long. Just relax. Okay… I see a little wax buildup in both ears. It's not excessive, but it could be contributing to some hearing difficulty.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness! Are you going to dig in there? I do hope you're using sterile equipment. Honestly, the thought of anything near my ears is rather unsettling. I have a very delicate constitution, you understand. Is that all you’re going to do? Because frankly, I find this entire process… distressing. And rather undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Burdette. I’m being as gentle as possible. I won't dig, I assure you. Just a quick look to rule things out. Now, let's check your balance. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please be careful! I have a terrible fear of falling. It's the principle of the matter, you understand. A woman of my stature does not simply fall. Do try to catch me if I stumble. And do hurry! I have a very important luncheon appointment. This is… utterly preposterous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Burdette. Just follow my finger with your eyes. Keep your gaze steady. Don't worry, I'm right here. Now, close your eyes and extend your arms straight out in front of you. Can you touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Oh dear, this is… terribly undignified. I haven't done this sort of thing since…well, I can't even remember. It feels rather foolish, to be frank. There! I’ve done it. Though, it wasn’t terribly precise. It feels…rather precarious. Am I doing it correctly, Doctor? Honestly, this is… most unsettling. I feel rather faint, again.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's enough for now, Burdette. Please sit back down. Okay. So, based on this quick exam, your vision is significantly reduced, you have some difficulty hearing, and there's some unsteadiness with your balance. The wax buildup in your ears could be contributing to the hearing loss, but we need to investigate further to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms. Given the sudden onset, and the combination of issues, I’d like to order a few tests. First, I want to do a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or inflammation. Then, I’d like an MRI of the brain to get a better look at everything and rule out anything serious. And finally, an audiological evaluation to assess your hearing loss in detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, tests! Frankly, I suspected as much. It's always tests, isn't it? Well, if it must be done, I suppose it must be done. But I do hope they won't take too long. I have a very busy schedule, you understand. And please, make sure the facilities are… adequate. A woman of my standing simply cannot tolerate substandard accommodations. As for the MRI… is it perfectly safe? I read somewhere they can be…hazardous. And please, ensure it doesn't interfere with my hair appointment. That is non-negotiable.
