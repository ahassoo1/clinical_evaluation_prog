DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger, so what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh? What's dat you say, young man? Speak up, I no dey hear too well these days. Something about…bringing me in? I come for check-up. The company send me. They say I need to make sure the dust no kill me. Long years I been down in dat mine. Long years.
DOCTOR: Right. A check-up. The company sent you. Dust…in the mine. Look, I got a lot of patients today, so if you could just try to be concise, that’d be great. Have you been having any specific problems?
PATIENT: Specific problems? Problems like…what kind of problems? I no feel sick. Dat's why dem send me! If I feel sick, I go tell you. I been working dat mine since…since before you been born, I bet. No cough, no trouble breathing, no nothing. Just…old. I old. Dat the only problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, “no specific complaints.” Right. And you said you've been working in the mine a long time. Any history of…anything?
PATIENT: History? You want my life story now? I no know what you mean. I dig rocks out the ground. Dat’s the history. Been doing it for…well, a very long time. Before electricity even! We use pickaxe and shovel. Now dem got machines. Machines make noise. But still rock. Still dust. What kind of history you want? You askin’ too much question.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Bigger, I'm just trying to get a sense of your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Like…like what kind of sickness? I been strong all my life. I eat my yam and my fish. I drink water. Maybe I get fever sometimes, small one. Wife, she used to give me herbs. Good herbs. But diagnosed…no. Never been diagnosed with…with anything fancy. I just old!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known diagnoses. Any family history of…anything?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmmm. My papa, he live long life, but he fall from a tree. Dat's how he go. Mama, she get…she get bad water sickness, a long time ago. Before the doctors even come to our village. Plenty people get it. Not much you could do. Plenty people dead. Now, my brother, he get…he get big belly. Eat too much food, I think. Dat it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so…father, fall. Mother, “bad water sickness.” Brother, weight gain. Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? You mean…pills and things? I no like pills. Taste bad. Wife try to give me one time for headache, I spit it out! I prefer the herbs. I no know about allergies. I no take much medicine. Maybe…maybe I get rash one time, but I no remember what cause am. Plenty mosquitoes where I come from. Maybe from mosquito bite.
DOCTOR: Right. No known medication allergies. Let's just do a quick exam, okay?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? You go poke me and prod me? I no like being poked and prodded. I just want you to say I healthy and send me home! Is dat so hard? I no feel sick, young man. Waste of time, all dis.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s a standard check-up. Blood pressure, listen to your lungs…it's just to be sure. Roll up your sleeve. And please, try to cooperate. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine, fine. But no funny business. I been through enough in my life, no need for poking around. You young people think you know everything. Get it over with. But if I faint, I no responsible.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is…elevated. 160 over 90. Lungs sound…clear, but you have a bit of diminished breath sounds, likely from your age. Heart rate is regular. Anything you've noticed about your breathing recently?
PATIENT: Breathing? Like…am I panting like a dog? No! I breathe. Always been breathing. Maybe…maybe when I climb stairs, I get a little…winded. But I old! Stairs is for young people. I no run around like a goat anymore. Diminished what? You using too much fancy word, young man. Just tell me am I healthy or no.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some mild shortness of breath with exertion. Given your age and history of working in the mine, we need to consider possible chronic lung issues. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a basic pulmonary function test, just to get a baseline. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: X-ray? Test? You want to take picture of my insides? And make me blow into some…some tube? I no like dis at all. What you looking for? What if you find something bad? I no want to know about bad things! I just want you to tell me am I healthy enough to go home and tend my garden. Is dat too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Look, it’s just preventative. We're checking your lung capacity and looking for any signs of…dust accumulation. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. It’s better to be safe than sorry. And frankly, given your occupation and age, it's responsible care. Here. Take this to the imaging center across town. They’ll schedule the X-ray. Then, the pulmonary function test is at Dr. Anya’s office, down the street. They'll call to schedule.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But if I get dizzy from blowing into dat tube, you paying for my yams. And I want a written report. I want to see everything you find, good or bad. I no trust fancy machines. I trust my body. And my body tell me I healthy. But fine, I go do your tests. Just to get you off my back. Now, can I go home?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go. We’ll review the results when they come in and schedule a follow-up appointment. This has general information about shortness of breath and how to manage it. Try to avoid strenuous activity until we get the results. Have a good day, Mr. Bigger.
PATIENT: Hmph. Manage shortness of breath? I been managing my life for 86 years! I think I can manage a little bit of windedness. Fine. Good day to you too, young man. But no wasting my time with unnecessary tests next time. .
