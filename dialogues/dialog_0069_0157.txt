DOCTOR: Good morning, Tasmia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don't have time for this. Just tell me what I need to do to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're busy, and we'll certainly try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. But to make sure I can give you the best advice, I need a little more information. "High blood pressure" can mean a lot of things, and it's important to understand why it's happening for you. First, do you know what your blood pressure reading was, or when it was taken?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. The nurse just took it when I got here, and it was…high, I guess? That's why I'm here. I don’t memorize numbers. Look, I work. A lot. I don’t have time to keep track of…vitals. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful to know. It's alright if you don’t memorize numbers – that’s what we're here for. The nurse did let me know your blood pressure was elevated in the office today. Before we jump to solutions, I'd like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Could you tell me a little bit about any other medical conditions you might have?
PATIENT: Nothing. I'm fine. Always have been. I eat…normal food. I work. That's it. My husband keeps telling me to go to the doctor more, but I don’t get sick. This blood pressure thing is probably just stress from work. It's a really demanding job, you know? Civil engineering isn’t exactly relaxing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And it's certainly possible that stress is a factor – civil engineering is demanding. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with anything in the past – even something minor?
PATIENT: Look, I told you. Nothing. My family… we just don't get sick. It's probably genetic. Good genes, okay? Can we just skip the life story and figure out what pill I need to take? I have a site inspection at two.
DOCTOR: I understand you're pressed for time, Tasmia. And I want to respect that. However, it's important to me that we gather enough information to make the best possible recommendation for you. Simply prescribing a medication without understanding your full health picture isn't responsible care. Let's try this: have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No! Never. What is with all the questions? Honestly, I thought doctors just…fixed things. Not interrogated people. I’m starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like an interrogation, Tasmia. It's not my intention at all. I'm simply trying to build a complete picture of your health, which helps me determine the safest and most effective treatment plan. It's a bit like building a bridge – you need to know the foundation before you can safely add the supports. Okay, let's shift gears slightly. How about your family?
PATIENT: What about them? They’re fine too. Look, my grandma lived to be ninety, and she smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and drank coffee constantly. Good genes, remember? It’s all good genes. I don’t see what that has to do with my blood pressure. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay. It is good to hear about your grandmother’s longevity. Sometimes, a family history of good health can be reassuring. However, knowing about any conditions that do run in the family can also be helpful. For example, have there been any instances of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or kidney problems in your family?
PATIENT: Honestly? I have no idea. We don't talk about that stuff. It’s…private. My family doesn't share medical information. It’s just not done. Are you trying to be difficult? I need a prescription, not a family history project. Can we please just get to the point? I have a job to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't have that information or aren't comfortable sharing it. We can definitely move forward without it. Let's talk about your lifestyle a bit more. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Seriously? Are you accusing me of something? I am a professional engineer. I do not have time for…that. I drink coffee, okay? Lots of it. To stay awake at work. That's it. And I do not appreciate the implication. This is getting absurd. Just write me a prescription and let me go.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions came across as accusatory – that was absolutely not my intention. I'm simply trying to understand all the factors that could be contributing to your blood pressure. Many things can affect it, and I want to make sure I'm considering everything. Okay, let's skip ahead then. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No. Never had one. Look, I’m wasting my valuable time here. I have a site to manage, people depending on me. Can we please just get to the medication? This is beyond ridiculous. You’re a doctor, aren’t you? Write the prescription. I’ll take it. End of story. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Tasmia. I respect your wishes. Given your strong preference, we can proceed with a trial of medication. However, I want to be very clear: without a more complete understanding of your health, it’s difficult to predict how you’ll respond, and it’s important to monitor your blood pressure closely. Are you currently taking any other medications or supplements, even over-the-counter ones?
