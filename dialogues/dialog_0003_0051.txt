DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let's try to be concise, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Concise? Yes, yes, that sounds… nice. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. I just need to know… what’s my blood type? That’s what I came for, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Your… blood type?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It's for… insurance things, I think? My daughter, bless her heart, she said I needed it updated. Something about a new policy. Honestly, all this paperwork… it just swirls around in my head. I used to be so good with details, working as a rigger and all, but… well, things change, don’t they? Do you need me to fill out a form?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nini, with all due respect, determining your blood type is not typically the reason for a comprehensive medical visit. However… we can certainly look into it. Do you have any records indicating your previous blood type?
PATIENT: Oh, records… hmm. That’s a good question. I… I honestly don’t remember. I’ve moved around a bit, you see. Spain, then here… it’s been a long time. I don't think I kept all those papers. Would they have it… somewhere? Like, with my other doctor, maybe? I used to see Dr. Alvarez, back in… well, a long time ago. Does that help? I’m just trying to remember… everything is so hazy these days.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nini, we can attempt to retrieve records from Dr. Alvarez, but that will take time – potentially weeks. We could proceed with a blood test here today to determine your type directly. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A blood test… yes, that sounds… sensible. If it’s quicker. Weeks… oh, my. I don't know if I have weeks. Is it… painful? I’ve never been afraid of heights, working as a rigger, but needles… well, they’re different, aren’t they? A quick prick, is it? Just let me know if it’s going to hurt a lot.
DOCTOR: It's a standard blood draw, Ms. Nini. A small prick, as you say. Minimal discomfort. We'll need to check your insurance coverage first, though. And, while we're at it, perhaps a brief review of your general health history would be prudent, considering your age. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me see. Not that I know of. I used to eat everything, you know? All sorts of Spanish food… paella, tapas… but now… sometimes my stomach feels a bit funny. Is that an allergy? I don’t think so. Just old age, probably. My daughter always tells me to eat more carefully, but… I like my food. And insurance… yes, I have private insurance. I think. She handles all that, bless her heart. She’s a very organized girl.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… let me think. I take something for my… joints. They ache, you know? Especially in the cold. A little white pill, I think. And sometimes, for my stomach, if it's really bothering me, I take something… a pink one, maybe? But I don’t take them regularly, just when I need to. I’m not sure what they’re called. My daughter… she keeps track of all that, too. Honestly, I’m just a bit lost with everything these days.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nini, with all due respect, this is proving… difficult. Do you have any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family… hmm. My mother… she lived a long life, but her heart wasn’t strong, I think. And my father… he worked hard, out in the fields, and his back always bothered him. Nothing… dramatic, you know? Just old age things. My brother, he was healthy as a horse, until… well, until he had that accident. But that wasn’t… age related. Is that helpful? I'm trying my best, Doctor, but my mind is like a sieve these days. Everything just slips away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we proceed with the blood draw, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. It’s standard procedure. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh, a physical examination… yes, that sounds… thorough. Alright. Just let me know if I’m doing something wrong. My balance isn’t what it used to be, you see. Working as a rigger, I used to be so nimble… but that was a long time ago. Is it cold in here? I always feel the cold these days.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though breath sounds are somewhat shallow. Blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg. Blood pressure is elevated, Ms. Nini. Have you been told this before?
PATIENT: Oh, elevated… is that bad? I… I think so. My daughter mentioned something about it once, but I don’t remember the details. She said I should watch my salt intake, maybe? I do like a good paella, you see, and it’s usually quite salty. Is it very serious? Should I be worried? It’s just… I feel alright, mostly. A little tired, perhaps, but that’s just old age, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It requires monitoring, Ms. Nini. We will proceed with the blood draw to establish a baseline, and I will write a prescription for a basic metabolic panel. This will give us a more comprehensive picture of your overall health. And I strongly recommend discussing dietary changes with your daughter, or perhaps consulting a nutritionist. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, a basic metabolic panel… that sounds… complicated. Will it hurt? And dietary changes… yes, I suppose I should listen to my daughter. She always knows best. But a nutritionist… that sounds expensive. Will the insurance cover that? Just the blood draw for now, then, please? Let's get that done, and we can worry about the rest later. My daughter can handle the insurance and the nutritionist, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Very well. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. I will write the order for the basic metabolic panel regardless. It's prudent to have a complete picture. And I strongly advise you to schedule a follow-up appointment within the next month to discuss the results. I have limited availability, so please schedule it soon. Do you have any further questions now?
PATIENT: Oh, a follow-up appointment… yes, alright. I’ll ask my daughter to schedule it. She’s very good with appointments. And… no, I don’t think I have any other questions now. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I know I’m not the easiest patient. Is it alright if I sit here for a moment? I feel a little… faint.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Nini. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly. .
