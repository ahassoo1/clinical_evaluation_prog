DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s…a little thing, really. Not a big problem. I just…thought it would be nice. A card, you see? A “Get Well” card. Or…something encouraging. My ex-wife, she always sent those when I had a…a little sniffle. It was…thoughtful. I have Medicare, so I figured this might be covered.
DOCTOR: A…card, sir?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A card. You know, with…pretty pictures. And…words. To make a man feel…better. It’s…a boost. I’m not asking for medicine, or anything. Just…a little something. Is that…unusual? I mean, a doctor can do that, right? People get cards for birthdays…this is just…feeling a bit down.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, you’re in a medical office. I'm a physician specializing in internal medicine. We address health concerns. While I appreciate you utilizing your Medicare benefits, they unfortunately don't cover…emotional support via greeting cards. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms that are contributing to you feeling “down”?
PATIENT: Well, now. That’s…rather blunt, isn’t it? I am feeling unwell, Doctor. In spirit, if not in…in body. A man’s feelings are part of his health, you know. But alright, alright. I have been…a little tired lately. And my appetite isn’t what it used to be. Not a big eater, never was, but…less so now. Is that…physical enough for you? It’s just…everything is so…dull. A card might…brighten things up.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and decreased appetite… alright. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, Mr. Kammer. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…around the time the garden didn't do so well. That’d be…oh, April, I reckon. Maybe March. The tomatoes were a disaster. Really. A disaster. Didn't get a single good one. And the beans…well, don't even mention the beans. It's…demoralizing, you see? A man takes pride in his garden. And then…nothing. Just…wilted leaves and sad little sprouts. That’s when I noticed I wasn’t…bouncing around like I used to.
DOCTOR: So, approximately April. And you’ve noticed a decrease in energy coinciding with…a disappointing gardening season. Have you experienced any other symptoms since then?
PATIENT: Well…my sleep hasn't been the best. I wake up a lot. Not because of pain, mind you. Just…thinking. About things. The garden, mostly. And…old times. It's not a terrible sleep, just…not restful. And I…haven't been visiting my friends as much. Not that I want to, exactly. It's just…easier to stay in. They talk a lot. About…things. I prefer the quiet. Does that…count as a symptom?
DOCTOR: Difficulty sleeping, increased introspection, and social withdrawal… alright. Have you noticed any changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…yes. I think so. The clothes feel a little…looser, maybe? Not a dramatic difference, you understand. I never was a big man. But my ex-wife…she always commented on my appetite. Said I needed to eat more. Perhaps…perhaps I haven’t been eating enough. It’s hard to keep track, really. Everything feels…the same these days. Dull, like I said. I don’t weigh myself, never have. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. Definitely no night sweats. I do get warm sometimes, you know, with the heat and all, but that's just…Puerto Rico in the summer. As for weight loss…I haven't been trying to lose weight. So, no. Nothing like that. Just…less interested in eating, I suppose. And feeling a bit…blah. Like a wilted tomato. Does that…help? I still think a card might cheer me up, you know. It’s a small thing. A gesture.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you’d like a card, but I'm concerned about your symptoms - fatigue, decreased appetite, social withdrawal, and changes in sleep and possibly weight. These could indicate a number of things, and I need to investigate further. We need to rule out any underlying medical causes. I'm going to conduct a brief physical exam, and then I’d like to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? A physical exam? For feeling a little down? Seems…a bit much, Doctor. I just want a card. But…alright. If you think it's necessary. I suppose I can humor you. But don't expect miracles. A card would still be nice, you know. And please, be gentle. I'm not as young as I used to be. And try not to poke too much. It's…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your vital signs. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. After that, I’ll palpate your abdomen and check your reflexes. It’s a standard exam, Mr. Kammer, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. If you’ll have a seat…
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Let’s get it over with. But I’m telling you, Doctor, this is probably just a temporary slump. A bad garden, a little loneliness…it happens. Just remember the card, alright? It really would brighten my day. And please, be careful with the blood pressure cuff. It always feels so tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kammer. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Not bad, but we’ll need to do a more thorough exam to understand what's going on. Take a deep breath for me…and exhale…Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths…in and out…Again…and again…Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Opening your ears now…Good. Ear canals are clear, no signs of infection. And now, say "Ahhh…" Good. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Everything seems…clear, you say? Just as I thought. A little tired, a little down…it’s nothing serious. Are we done now? My stomach is starting to rumble. This exam is making me hungry. And still…a card would be nice. You wouldn’t happen to have any on hand, would you? Just a simple one. With flowers, perhaps. It’s the thought that counts, you know.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. Not alarming, but something to monitor. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Extend your leg…Good. And now the other one…Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Alright, Mr. Kammer. The exam doesn't reveal anything acutely concerning, but your symptoms, combined with the tenderness in your abdomen, warrant further investigation. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We'll also check your Vitamin D levels. And no, I don’t have any greeting cards on hand. I’m a physician, not a florist. I understand you’d like a card, but my priority is to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure your health. The results should be back in a few days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them.
PATIENT: A few days? And more tests? This is…ridiculous. I just want to feel better, not become a science experiment. Are you sure you can’t just…prescribe something? Maybe a little something to brighten my mood? Or at least point me towards a good card shop? I’m starting to feel worse just thinking about all these tests. This is…overkill. A card...that’s all I’m asking for.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration, but I cannot simply prescribe medication without knowing the underlying cause of your symptoms. That would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. Your fatigue, decreased appetite, social withdrawal, and abdominal tenderness could indicate a variety of issues, ranging from a simple vitamin deficiency to something more serious. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions before we can determine the appropriate course of treatment. I will write you a referral to a therapist, as your symptoms suggest possible depression or anxiety. They can help address your mood and provide coping strategies. As for a card shop, there's a Hallmark store located in the Suburban Mall, about fifteen minutes from here. I’m concerned about your well-being, and I want to ensure you receive the best possible care. I urge you to follow through with the blood work and the therapy referral. And I will, once again, reiterate that I am a physician, not a card vendor. I'm printing out the lab requisitions and the therapy referral now.
PATIENT: Therapy…more tests…a referral…This is…a disaster. A complete and utter disaster. I just wanted a simple card, Doctor. A little gesture of kindness. And now I'm being treated like…like a broken machine. Fine. Do your tests. Send me to your therapist. But don't expect me to be cheerful about it. And if I’m still feeling down after all this, I’m blaming you. A card…that’s all I wanted. .
