DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Szmyd. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Doctor. Good to meet you. I... moved here. New place, you know? Just need to... check things. With the old people’s insurance. Medicare, it is called. Need to make sure everything is okay. Is that right? I forget so easily these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. It’s very common to want a check-up when establishing care with a new doctor, especially with Medicare. And don’t worry about forgetting things, it happens to all of us. To get started, could you tell me a little more about why you wanted to get checked today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Why... well, I feel... okay. Mostly. A little tired, maybe. But I work hard, you know? Makeup is not easy. For the theater. Very demanding. I suppose I just want to be sure nothing is… breaking. Like an old machine. You understand? Everything just feels… slower.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. It’s good you're proactive about this. "Slower" is a useful way to describe it. So, a little more tired than usual, and a general sense of things being less efficient. Has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Very, very gradual. Like... the color fading from a costume. You don’t notice it right away. But then one day… poof. Not so bright anymore. Years, maybe? I don’t keep good track of time. Too busy. Always with the glitter. And the actors. They need so much help. It's exhausting. Not complaining, just… is how it is.
DOCTOR: Right. A slow fading. And you feel this is impacting your ability to do your work with the theater?
PATIENT: Impact… yes. Not so much the doing of it. I can still make a beautiful face. It takes longer, maybe. More brushes to clean. More… concentration. But the standing. The hours. Before, I could go all night. Now? I need to sit down. A lot. My legs… they are not what they used to be. Old legs. Everything hurts a little, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. So fatigue, some aches and pains, and difficulty with prolonged standing. Have you noticed any pain anywhere specifically – in your joints, muscles, back?
PATIENT: Joints, yes. My knees mostly. And my hands, sometimes. From all the brushes. It's a funny pain. Not sharp, not terrible. Just… there. Always there, like a dull ache. Especially after a long performance. My wife... my ex-wife... she always told me to use a cream. But creams are for… ladies. I am a makeup artist, not a lady. So I didn't. Perhaps I should have. Everything hurts now. It's just...life. You know? Old age. Stop.
DOCTOR: Right. A dull ache in your knees and hands, worse after performances. And you haven't tried any creams or other treatments for it?
PATIENT: No. No creams. A little stretching, maybe. Before a show. But not much. I used to be very strong. I lifted… many things. For the sets. But now? Forget it. My back… it makes noises. Like an old house. Creak, creak, creak. Is that bad? I don’t know. I just… try to ignore it. It's just… getting old. Everything falls apart eventually. You can’t stop it. What’s the point?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're trying to stay active with stretching. And you're right, things do change as we get older. But ignoring things doesn't always make them better. Let's do a quick physical exam just to get a better idea of what's going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your joints, and see how you’re moving. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Alright. I suppose so. But don't expect much. I'm a broken machine, remember? Everything creaks. I just… I don’t want to lay there all day. I have things to do. Actors need their faces done. Very important work. But alright. Whatever you need. Just be quick, please. My legs are already tired just thinking about it. Stop.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as efficient as possible, Mr. Szmyd. I promise. Okay, if you could just sit here on the edge of the table for me... First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. I'm going to use the stethoscope here...
PATIENT: Stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, but that could be due to just being here. I didn’t notice any abnormal sounds. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Can you extend your arms and legs for me, please?
PATIENT: Stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. I understand. We can stop here for now. It sounds like you’re experiencing some fatigue, aches and pains in your knees and hands, and difficulty with prolonged standing. Given your reluctance to continue a full exam, and the limited information we have, I recommend a few things. First, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue. This will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and basic inflammatory markers. Secondly, given the pain in your knees and hands, I think it would be beneficial to see a specialist – a rheumatologist. They can properly evaluate your joint pain and recommend appropriate treatment options. Would you be open to those suggestions?
PATIENT: Stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Then let's just discuss a plan based on what you've told me. I'm going to recommend we start with the blood work. It's a simple test, and can give us a better understanding of what might be going on. We'll get the paperwork started for that now. In the meantime, I would encourage you to try some over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed, and to rest when you feel tired. If the pain becomes severe or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Szmyd. Then, to summarize, we've discussed your fatigue and joint pain. I'm ordering blood work to start, and I’ll have the nurse give you information on a referral to a rheumatologist. We can discuss the results when they come back, and you can decide if you want to pursue further evaluation with the specialist. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. In that case, I'll have the nurse send the lab order and referral information to you. Thank you for coming in today. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if anything changes or you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Stop.
