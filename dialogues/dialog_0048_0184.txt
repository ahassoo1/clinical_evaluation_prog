DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Trendler, is it?
PATIENT: Trendler. Kern Trendler. And yes, it is. Look, I ain't got all day, you know. Busy man, even at my age. What do you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we all have commitments. Let's just get straight to it then. What brings you in today, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Well, it's… lookin' in the mirror, right? And things ain't holdin' up like they used to. Skin's droopin' and all that. My wife, bless her soul, she always said I was a handsome man. But that was before. Now… now it’s just… saggy. I want it fixed. Is that what you do here? Fix saggy things?
DOCTOR: "Saggy things," as you put it, can have a variety of causes. Are you referring specifically to the skin on your face and neck?
PATIENT: Face and neck, yes. And maybe… the upper arms. Don't need no flapping, you understand? It's unsightly. I see younger men, still got some life in 'em, lookin' good. And then there's me… lookin' like a melted candle. Is there a way to… tighten things up? Without, you know, a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you're concerned about skin laxity – the loss of elasticity – in your face, neck, and arms. And you'd like to explore options for improvement. Before we discuss procedures, I need to get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No. Diabetes? Nah. I used to be a pile driver operator, you know. Hard work. Kept a man strong. Never needed doctors much. Just the usual aches and pains. Insurance is private, if that matters. Good insurance. Paid good money for it.
DOCTOR: Insurance is noted. Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hmm… let me think. Had my appendix out when I was a boy. That's about it. And I broke my wrist once, fallin' off a roof. They set it, put a cast on. No fancy operations. Just fixin' what was broken. That’s all I know about surgeries.
DOCTOR: Very good. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What kind of family history? My mother lived to be ninety, strong woman she was. Father died young, accident. Didn’t bother much with doctors, neither of ‘em. You askin' about skin things? Nobody in my family ever bothered with… tightenin’ things up. They just got old.
DOCTOR: I’m gathering a comprehensive medical history, Mr. Trendler. Any history of skin cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Skin cancer? No. Never heard of nobody havin’ skin cancer. We Jamaicans spend plenty time in the sun, but never heard of that. You startin’ to ask a lot of questions. I told you, I ain’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Trendler. However, these questions are necessary to determine if you're a suitable candidate for any cosmetic procedures. Now, do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little somethin' for my joints, you know? Arthritis. Old age. Doctor gave me somethin’ blue. Small pill. I can’t remember the name, to be honest. Never been a man for rememberin’ names. And that’s it. Just the blue pill.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had no allergies. I eat anything. I drink anything. Strong man, I tell ya. Didn’t bother with allergies, even when I was a boy runnin' wild in Jamaica. No allergies. Now, are we gettin' anywhere with this? I need to know if you can fix me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's move on to a quick physical examination, then. I’d like to take a look at the skin in question. If you don’t mind. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Examination table, huh? Fine. But don’t be pokin' and proddin' too much. I don't like bein' handled. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm assessing the degree of skin laxity, noting the texture and tone. There's some noticeable loss of elasticity here, and a slight fullness. Similar findings on the upper arms. I'm also noting some sun damage – some age spots and a slightly leathery texture. We’ll need to document this for your record.
PATIENT: Leathery texture? You mean I’ve lived a life? I worked outside, buildin' things! Of course it's leathery! Don’t need you tellin' me I look old. I came here to fix it, not have you describe how much time has passed! So, what can you do about it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Based on my examination, you have moderate skin laxity in the face, neck, and arms, with some evidence of sun damage. Several options could be considered, but they range in invasiveness and cost. A mild lifting procedure, or possibly radiofrequency treatments to stimulate collagen production, might offer some improvement. However, given your age and the degree of laxity, more significant results would likely require a surgical facelift and arm lift. I need to be frank. These are not without risks, and recovery can be lengthy.
PATIENT: Surgery? Surgery?! No, no, no. I ain't lookin' for surgery. I thought you just tightened things up a bit. Like pullin’ a string. I don’t want no cuttin' and stitchin'. I ain’t got time for lengthy recovery. Radiofrequency… what was that? Is that the string thing? Just tell me what’s the least fuss possible.
DOCTOR: Radiofrequency treatments involve using energy waves to stimulate collagen production, which can subtly tighten the skin over time. It’s non-invasive, meaning no cuts or stitches. However, the results are… modest. You’d likely need multiple sessions, and it won't achieve the dramatic lifting you initially described. Frankly, given your expectations and your aversion to surgery, I'm not sure we can achieve a satisfactory outcome here. Perhaps managing expectations and focusing on skincare to protect against further sun damage would be the most realistic approach. Or, I can refer you to a dermatologist who specializes in non-surgical cosmetic procedures. They can provide a more detailed assessment and discuss your options.
PATIENT: You mean you can't fix me? After all this askin’ about my mother and blue pills? I come here for a solution, not a lecture on sun damage! A dermatologist? Waste of time. I'm a busy man. I guess I'm just gonna get old. You know, my wife would be disappointed. Disappointed in you, mostly.
