DOCTOR: Hi Marquie, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's… nice to meet you too. Honestly, it’s kinda hard to explain. I’ve just been… short of breath lately. It feels like I can’t get enough air, you know? It’s been happening for… a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Everything’s a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “A bit fuzzy” is alright – we’ll sort it out together. It’s common to not remember exact timelines when you’re feeling unwell. So, you’ve been experiencing shortness of breath for a while. Can you tell me a little more about when you notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… When? It’s… mostly when I’m doing stuff, I think. Like, at work. I work at the water treatment plant, so there's… walking around, checking things. And sometimes even just climbing stairs. It’s… worse when it's hot, definitely. But sometimes it happens when I'm just… sitting around too. It’s just… random, I guess? Does that make sense? I really don't remember when it started getting bad, just that it… is.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Marquie. Randomness is a good detail to note. And it’s helpful to know it’s worse with exertion and in the heat. Okay, so it sounds like it’s impacting your daily activities at work, and even happens at rest sometimes. Can you describe what the shortness of breath feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Like… I can’t fill my lungs all the way. It feels tight, kinda. And… sometimes a little bit wheezy? I don’t know if that’s the right word. Like there's a whistle when I breathe. It's not always there, though. And… sometimes my chest feels… heavy? Like someone’s sitting on it, but not really heavy. Ugh, I'm probably not making any sense. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: You're making perfect sense, Marquie. Tightness, a whistling sound sometimes, and chest heaviness – those are all very helpful details. It's good you’re able to describe it so well, even if it feels hard to put into words. Now, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Uh… I don't think so. Not like this, anyway. I had… bronchitis when I was a kid, I think? But that was a long time ago. And that was… coughing mostly. This is different. It’s just… this feeling of not being able to breathe. I don't recall ever feeling like this as an adult. Everything feels a bit… new, to be honest. It’s kinda scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no previous episodes like this as an adult, and a history of bronchitis as a child. That’s good to know. You mentioned it's a bit scary – I understand that feeling completely. Now, let's talk a bit about your general health. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I haven't really… been to the doctor much. I work, you know? And things get… expensive. I'm generally… healthy, I think. I try to eat okay. I haven't been diagnosed with anything, ever. My wife… she's the healthy one, always telling me to eat my vegetables. I don’t have insurance, so I just… avoid going if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s common to put things off when access to care is a concern. No known medical conditions, and you generally feel healthy besides this shortness of breath. That’s helpful information. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been in the hospital for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. Nothing like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Just… this breathing thing is starting to worry me. It’s getting harder to do my job, and… I don’t want to get sick. It's just… frustrating, you know? I feel like something is wrong, but I don't know what.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good to know. You're right to be concerned if it's impacting your work, Marquie. Let’s talk about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had… something with his heart, I think. My wife says he had high blood pressure. But… I don’t really know much about it. He passed away a long time ago. And my mother… she's fine, I think. No major problems. Honestly, we don’t really talk about health much. It’s… not really a big thing in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of potential heart issues and high blood pressure on your mother's side. That's useful to know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she hates smoking. And honestly, I don't like the smell. It’s bad for you, you know? I try to stay healthy, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. No smoking history. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Sometimes. I’ll have a beer with dinner, maybe a couple on the weekend. Nothing crazy. It’s… social, you know? I don’t drink every day, and I definitely don't get drunk. Just… a couple to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol consumption. That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I haven't really taken much medication in my life. Maybe… penicillin when I was a kid? But I didn’t have a reaction or anything. I don't have any food allergies, either. Nope, I think I’m good. I’m pretty boring, health-wise.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. It sounds like you are pretty healthy overall, despite this breathing issue. Alright, Marquie, I think I have a good understanding of your history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good. Whatever you need to do. I just… want to figure out what’s going on, you know? I’m ready, I guess. Just… let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything as I go, and let you know if anything might be a little uncomfortable. Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. I’m listening for any wheezing, crackling, or other unusual sounds. I'm hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes of both lungs, and a very faint wheeze on exhalation. Your heart rate is a little elevated at 92 beats per minute, and the rhythm is regular. I don’t hear any murmurs or abnormal sounds. Okay, everything seems relatively normal besides the slightly diminished breath sounds, faint wheeze, and slightly elevated blood pressure. I want to check your oxygen saturation level to see how well your lungs are transferring oxygen into your blood. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is within a normal range, but on the lower end.
PATIENT: Okay… 95%… is that… good? The wheezing… that sounds bad, right? And my blood pressure… is that high? I don't really understand all this. Is something seriously wrong? I just feel… tired all the time.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel anxious, Marquie, and it’s good you're asking questions. 95% oxygen saturation is okay, it's not dangerously low, but it’s a little lower than ideal and warrants investigation. The wheezing can indicate some narrowing in your airways – that’s why I want to look into it further. And yes, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which we should monitor. It doesn’t necessarily mean something seriously wrong, but it’s definitely something we need to address to prevent potential problems down the road. The fatigue you’re feeling could be related to your breathing difficulties, or it could be something else entirely. Based on your history and the exam findings, I suspect you might be experiencing early stages of asthma, or possibly a condition called COPD – Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. However, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis without some further testing. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and I also recommend a pulmonary function test – that measures how well you can breathe in and out. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Asthma… COPD… I’ve heard of asthma, but… COPD sounds serious. I don’t… I don’t smoke. Can you get that without smoking? And an X-ray… is that safe? I don’t want to get… radiation or anything. It’s just… a lot. I just came in because I couldn’t catch my breath, and now you’re talking about all this… I don't know.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, Marquie, and it’s good you're expressing your concerns. COPD is often associated with smoking, but you absolutely can develop it without ever having smoked. It can be caused by long-term exposure to other irritants like dust, pollution, or even frequent respiratory infections. As for the X-ray, it uses a very small amount of radiation, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. Modern X-ray machines use minimal radiation, and it’s a routine procedure. It's important to get an image of your lungs to rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. We'll take it one step at a time. We’ll start with the chest X-ray and pulmonary function test. Those tests will help us determine what’s going on and develop a plan to help you feel better. To be clear, I'm not making a diagnosis yet. These tests will give us more information. Do you have any questions about the X-ray or pulmonary function test specifically?
PATIENT: Okay… so the X-ray won't… hurt me? And the… pulmonary function test… what does that involve? Do I have to… blow into something? I get out of breath just thinking about it. And how much is all this going to cost? I don’t have insurance, remember? I'm worried about getting a big bill I can't pay.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned about the cost, Marquie, and I completely understand your anxiety. The X-ray itself is painless. You'll simply stand or lie down while a machine takes pictures of your lungs. It’s very quick. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a mouthpiece connected to a machine. You’ll take a deep breath and blow out as hard as you can for a few seconds, and we’ll measure how much air you can exhale and how quickly you can do it. It does require some effort, but we can stop at any time if you're feeling too tired or short of breath. We’ll take breaks as needed. Regarding the cost, I understand you don't have insurance. Let me check with our billing department to see what the cash price is for the X-ray and pulmonary function test. We also have some financial assistance programs available, and I can provide you with information about those. I don’t have the exact prices on hand right now, but I’ll find out for you. In the meantime, I want to reassure you that we’ll do everything we can to help you get the care you need, regardless of your financial situation. Do you want me to write down the names of the tests and the cost when I find out?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… really helpful. Writing it down is good. I always forget things. And the financial assistance… that would be amazing. Just… anything to help. Thank you. I'm just… really stressed out now. I wish I had just stayed home and tried to rest.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marquie. It's completely understandable to feel stressed out, and you did the right thing by coming in to get checked. Ignoring it wouldn’t have made it better, and we’re here to help. Let me get a nurse to draw up the orders for the X-ray and pulmonary function test. She can also explain the process in more detail and schedule the appointments for you. While she’s doing that, I’ll check on the financial assistance programs and the cash prices for the tests. In the meantime, try to relax. I know it’s easier said than done, but getting worked up won’t help. We’ll figure this out together.
