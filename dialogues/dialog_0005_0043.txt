DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I'm Dr. Donate. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, I’ve got this headache, right at the back of my head. Been botherin' me for a few days now. Not a real bad pain, more like a…a dull ache, you know? It just won't go away.
DOCTOR: A dull ache at the back of the head for a few days… alright. And when you say a few days, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday afternoon. I was helpin’ my granddaughter with her math homework, and it just kinda… started. Not right away, it was gradual. It wasn’t awful, so I didn't think much of it at first. But it hasn’t really gone away since. Now that I think about it, maybe Wednesday it was a little worse.
DOCTOR: So, Tuesday afternoon, gradual onset, slightly worse Wednesday… and today it’s still present. Has anything specific made it better or worse since then?
PATIENT: Well, not really. I tried takin' some of those over-the-counter pain relievers… you know, the kind for headaches? They took the edge off for a bit, maybe an hour or two, but it always comes back. And nothin' makes it worse, not that I've noticed. Layin' down doesn’t really help, and bein' up and about doesn't make it worse either. It's just… there. A constant little throb, mostly.
DOCTOR: A constant throbbing… alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No fever, no dizziness. Not nauseous or anything. My vision’s been fine, I think. I was readin' the paper this mornin' with no trouble. I have been a little tired lately, but… well, I’m eighty-four, Doctor! I figure bein’ tired comes with the territory. I don’t know if that counts.
DOCTOR: Tiredness at your age is… expected, yes. But it's good you mention it. No fever, no nausea, vision is fine… Have you noticed any stiffness in your neck?
PATIENT: Stiffness in my neck… Hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe a little. Not bad stiffness, just… a bit creaky, I guess. I always get a little creaky in the mornings, but maybe it’s been worse the last few days. It’s hard to say, honestly. I don’t pay much attention to things like that unless it really bothers me. It doesn't hurt to move it, just… feels a little tight, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Tightness in the neck… alright. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with some pills years ago. I haven’t taken those in a long time, though. They said I was all good. And my knees… they bother me, arthritis, you know? But that's just old age. Apart from that… not much. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. No major surgeries or anything like that. Oh! I had my gallbladder out… a long time ago. Must be thirty years now. But they said everything went fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, controlled hypertension in the past, arthritis in the knees, and gallbladder removal thirty years ago. Are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones regularly?
PATIENT: Just those pain relievers for the headache, like I said. Every now and then. Not every day, though. And sometimes I take a little something for my knees when they're really botherin’ me. But that's it. I don't like takin' pills if I can avoid it. Makes me feel sluggish. And I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of vegetables. My daughter always tells me I need to eat more fiber. She worries about me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medication use. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. The doctor gave me penicillin as a kid, and I was fine. I think my wife was allergic to somethin', maybe codeine, but that was a long time ago and I don't remember exactly. It wasn’t me. Definitely not me. I’m pretty good with most things, thankfully. A little tough to keep track of all that stuff, though, after so many years.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, before we move on, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. Let me think. My mother had… what was it? She had trouble with her heart when she got older. Something with the rhythm, I think. And my brother… he had diabetes, but he didn’t take care of himself. Smoked too much, drank too much. My father… he lived a long life, actually. But he had high blood pressure, like me. And arthritis, too. Oh, and my aunt… she had some kind of cancer, lung cancer, I think. A long time ago. That's about all I can remember, honestly. My family wasn't big on talkin' about illnesses. Superstition, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of heart problems, diabetes, hypertension and cancer in the family. And finally, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife tried to get me to, once, when we were young and foolish. But I told her no way. Didn't see the point, and it smelled awful. Always thought it was a foolish habit. I did spend a lot of time around it though. My brother smoked like a chimney. Used to bother me somethin' awful.
DOCTOR: Alright. No history of smoking. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, I enjoy a little wine with dinner sometimes. A glass of red wine, usually. Nothing too much. Doc always said a little wine was good for the heart, you know? Keeps the blood flowin’. I don’t drink every day, though. Maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing that would make me stumble around, I assure you. My wife liked her wine too, so we'd share a bottle now and then. A nice Cabernet Sauvignon. That was her favorite.
DOCTOR: Alright. Occasional alcohol use. Okay, Mr. Gibbel, I think I have enough information for now. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your vital signs and have a look around. Nothing too invasive, just a standard check-up. We’ll start with your blood pressure, just to confirm what you told me. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose and throat. We'll also check your reflexes and strength. It shouldn't take long. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with this. Relax your arm for me… Okay. 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart rate is regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Not particularly concerning at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear… No wheezing or crackles. Ears look clear as well. Throat is clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. And finally, let's test your strength… Strength is good, though slightly weaker in your left arm. Now, I'm going to palpate your neck to assess for stiffness. There is some mild tenderness to palpation, but no significant rigidity. Overall, the exam is largely unremarkable, but there are a few findings that warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds thorough. What kind of investigation are you thinkin’? Is it somethin’ serious? I’m not too worried, but… you know. It’s always best to know, right?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Gibbel, given your headache, the slightly elevated blood pressure, the murmur I heard, the mild neck stiffness, and the diminished reflexes, I'd like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to rule out any infection or anemia. Also, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm more closely. To rule out any underlying cardiac issues. And finally, I think a CT scan of your brain would be prudent, just to make sure there's no structural abnormality causing your headache. Now, I know that sounds like a lot, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. These tests will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Wow. That is a lot. A CT scan… That sounds a little scary, Doctor. Is it definitely necessary? I mean, couldn't it just be… a tension headache? Maybe I've been stressin' too much? And what about the cost? I don’t have insurance, you know. I appreciate you bein’ thorough, but… this is a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gibbel, while a tension headache is possible, your age, the murmur, and the subtle neurological findings make it irresponsible to dismiss more serious possibilities without further investigation. We need to rule out things like a stroke, a tumor, or an aneurysm. Ignoring these symptoms could have severe consequences. As for the cost, I understand your concern. Unfortunately, these tests are necessary for a proper diagnosis. We can discuss payment options with the hospital billing department. They may offer a financial assistance program or a payment plan. I can also write a referral to a lower-cost imaging center, if that’s an option. But I strongly advise against delaying these tests. Your health is the priority, and we need to get a clear picture of what's going on as soon as possible. Now, are you willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: …Alright, Doctor. You’re right. It’s probably best to be safe. I don't want anything serious goin’ on without knowin' about it. A stroke… that wouldn’t be good. And I appreciate you lookin’ into lower cost options. I’ll talk to my daughter about the billing. She’s good with that sort of thing. Yes. Let’s do the tests. When can I schedule them? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Good. That’s a responsible decision, Mr. Gibbel. Alright, I'm sending the orders to City General Hospital. They should contact you within 24 hours to schedule the tests. The CT scan will likely require an appointment within the next few days. The blood tests can be done on an outpatient basis at any lab. As for the results, it usually takes 24 to 48 hours for the blood tests to come back. The CT scan results may take a little longer, depending on the radiologist’s schedule. Once I have the results, I’ll contact you immediately to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage your headache. It's just a temporary measure, while we wait for the results. Here you go. Take this as directed. And if your headache worsens or you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, dizziness, vision changes, or weakness, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for takin' the time to explain everything so thoroughly, even if it's a little… scary. And thank you for lookin' into the cost options. I appreciate it. I guess I’ll wait for the hospital to call. I hope everything turns out alright. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gibbel. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day.
