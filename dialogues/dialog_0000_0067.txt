DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. So, tell me... what brings an 80-year-old man to my office today?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it’s my chest. Hurts when I… when I take a big breath. Not all the time, just… when I try to. It's been… a little while now. Hard to say exactly how long, everything feels the same these days.
DOCTOR: "A little while," right. That's helpful. Okay. And is this pain... sharp?
PATIENT: Sharp… hmm. No, not really sharp. More like… a dull ache. Like someone’s sitting on my chest, maybe? It doesn't feel good, that's for sure. But it's not a stabbing pain, if that makes sense. I don't really know what "sharp" feels like for something like this. Everything just… hurts.
DOCTOR: "Everything hurts," I see. Well, we need to focus on this chest pain, Mr. Ruocco. Does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… let me think. Walking up the stairs, definitely. And… when it’s cold. Cold air. Makes it tighter. I try not to… do too much, you know? But even just getting the mail can be… a bit much sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Walking, cold air... and you’re avoiding exertion. Any coughing or shortness of breath along with this pain?
PATIENT: Coughing… not really. Maybe a little, sometimes, but it's an old man’s cough, you know? Just… clearing my throat. Short of breath… …sometimes. But I figure that’s just getting old. It’s hard to breathe deeply when your chest hurts, right? I don't know if that's because of the pain, or… just how it is now. It’s all… jumbled up in my head.
DOCTOR: Right. “Jumbled up.” We’ll try to un-jumble it. Have you ever smoked, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Smoked… …oh, a long time ago. When I was younger. Not much, though. A pack a day for… maybe ten years? Then I quit. A long, long time ago. Before… before my wife. It was a long time ago. I don't remember exactly. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It always matters, Mr. Ruocco. Even if it was “a long time ago.” Any other medical problems that you know of?
PATIENT: …My knees. Bad knees. And… my back. Hurts a lot. The doctor gave me something for it, a long time ago, but it didn't really help. And… …I had a little trouble with my heart, maybe twenty years ago? Something with the rhythm… but I can’t really remember. They gave me pills, and I took them for a while. Everything is just… blurry. I don't keep track of these things anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Blurry” and “a long time ago.” Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. They gave me… something for my blood pressure, a long time ago. And the pills for my heart. But… no, I don’t think so. I'm pretty sure. But like I said… I forget a lot these days. Is this important?
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, it’s always important to know about allergies. But we'll move on. Let's do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, please. My back’s been acting up, too. Makes it hard to… you know, move around. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, then we’ll check your blood pressure and oxygen levels. Take a deep breath when I tell you. …Okay. Heart rate is a little fast. Irregular rhythm, as expected. …Some diminished breath sounds on both sides, but nothing particularly concerning at this moment. 140 over 85. Not terrible, but could be better. Oxygen saturation is 92%. A little low, but acceptable. So, your oxygen is a bit low, and your heart isn't exactly firing on all cylinders, but that’s… to be expected at your age.
PATIENT: To be expected? What does that mean? Is it bad? I just want to know what's going on, you know? I don’t want a lot of fancy words. Just… is it something I need to worry about? And what about my chest pain? Is that… normal, too?
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, “normal” is a very subjective term. You’re 80 years old, you’ve smoked, you have a history of heart problems, and you’re not exactly a picture of health. Your chest pain could be related to a number of things – muscle strain, inflammation, even just old age. The low oxygen could be due to diminished lung capacity, or… well, again, a number of things. We need to rule out anything serious. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better look at your lungs and heart. And a blood test to check your inflammation levels. Don’t panic. It's just… standard procedure.
PATIENT: X-ray… EKG… blood test… Just seems like a lot. Is it really necessary? I just want something to make the pain go away. I don't want to spend the rest of my days going to doctors and getting poked and prodded. Is there… is there nothing else I can do? Just a pill, or something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I understand your frustration, but I’m a doctor. My job is to find out why you’re in pain, not just mask the symptoms. Giving you a pill without knowing the cause would be irresponsible, and frankly, dangerous. Look, I'm not going to pretend this is fun. But these tests will give us valuable information. If it's just muscle strain, great. We'll give you something for the pain. But if it's something more serious – pneumonia, heart failure, even… well, we need to know. I'll write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever in the meantime. But you need to get these tests done. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I understand. Fine. Do what you have to do. Just… tell me when and where I need to go. And… how long will it take? I don't have a lot of energy these days. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've scheduled you for a chest X-ray and an EKG at Suburban General Hospital. The X-ray is tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM, and the EKG is right after. The blood test can be done at the lab next door anytime today. These papers have the addresses and instructions. It shouldn’t take more than an hour or two total. And please, try to get some rest tonight. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. And Mr. Ruocco, if your chest pain gets significantly worse, or you develop a fever or shortness of breath, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. Emergency room… It just seems like a lot. A lot of… everything. Thank you, Doctor. I guess. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Good day, Mr. Ruocco. And please, try not to worry unnecessarily.
