DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I'm Dr. Galena. It's...nice to meet you. Though, honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Good morning to you too, Doctor. My name is Delmon, yes. They sent me here. Said I need to be checked 'cause of the work. All that dust and… things. No trouble now, mind you. I feel alright. Just doing what they say.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. “Work,” you say. And it’s a check-up related to that, preventative, is that right?
PATIENT: Preventive? Is that… stopping something bad from happening? Yes, that’s right. Stopping something. I been digging in the ground a long time, you know. Underground. Lots of dust. Not good dust, I imagine. They give me insurance, thank goodness. But still, better to be safe.
DOCTOR: Yes, precisely. Preventing things. Good. Very good. And you’ve been doing this digging… how long, roughly?
PATIENT: Eh, a long time. Too long to remember exactly. Maybe… forty years? Forty-five? Started when I was a young man, strong as an ox. Now… not so much. But I still go down there. Gotta make a living, you see?
DOCTOR: Forty or forty-five years… that’s quite a while. And you mentioned dust. Are you experiencing any… cough, shortness of breath, anything like that now?
PATIENT: No, no cough. Breathe alright. Like I said, I feel… fine. They ask me if I feel anything, I tell them no. They worry too much, these young people. Back in my day, you just kept working until you couldn't work no more. No time for feeling!
DOCTOR: Alright, no cough, no shortness of breath. That’s good to hear. Still, forty years of dust exposure… it's something we need to look into. Just to be safe. Perhaps we could do a quick listen to your lungs, just to be thorough?
PATIENT: Listen to my lungs? What for? If I could barely breathe, I'd tell you, wouldn't I? I'm not stupid. This is a waste of time, if you ask me. But… alright. If you must. Get it over with, then.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all. It's just a routine part of the check-up. I assure you, it won’t take long. If you could just sit back and relax… and take deep breaths for me, when I ask?
PATIENT: Relax? Easy for you to say. You ain't spendin' your life in a hole in the ground. But fine. Deep breaths. Hmph. What exactly are you listenin' for, anyway? Just curious.
DOCTOR: I’m listening for any unusual sounds – wheezing, crackling, things like that. It helps me understand how well your lungs are working. Take a nice, deep breath… and exhale slowly. Good. Again, if you would… Alright. And one more… Hmm. I do hear… some mild crackling in the lower lobes of both lungs. It's not alarming, but it could be related to the dust exposure.
PATIENT: Crackling? What does that mean? Is that bad? Dust exposure, you say? I knew it! All that dirt… I told them it wasn't good for you. So, what now? Am I sick? I need to get back to work, you know. I got bills to pay.
DOCTOR: "Crackling" just means there's some… fluid or congestion in the lungs. It’s not necessarily serious right now, but it warrants further investigation. We need to rule out anything more concerning. To be thorough, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. That’ll give us a clearer picture of what's going on. And perhaps a simple blood test to check your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood test? More tests? Hmph. Look, Doctor, I ain't afraid of a little dirt. I been breathin’ it for forty years. I feel fine! This sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing. But… alright. If you think it's necessary. But don't keep me waiting all day. I got things to do, you know. Bills to pay. And a wife to… well, she's gone now. But still. Time is money.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. I assure you, we’ll try to keep the wait as minimal as possible. The X-ray should be quick, and the blood test won’t take long either. My nurse will draw up the lab order now. While we're waiting, perhaps you could tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? What's to tell? I work. I eat. I sleep. I used to have a wife, but she passed. No fancy illnesses. Maybe a bad cold every now and then. I been strong as an ox all my life. Never needed a doctor before this, except for… when I broke my arm when I was a boy. That was a long time ago. No, no history to speak of. Just a simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history. Just the broken arm as a child. And no known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. What kind of question is that? I live in the ground! Dust, dirt, rocks… I'm allergic to not workin', maybe! No, no allergies. I eat anything. Back in my day, you didn't waste food. You ate what was put in front of you, and you were thankful. No fancy allergies.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. No known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never needed 'em. I take a little paracetamol sometimes, if my back's botherin' me from the work. But that's it. And I don't take it often. Waste of money, if you ask me. Just a little something for the pain, when it gets bad. Nothing fancy, Doctor. I prefer to tough it out.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional paracetamol for back pain. And no other medications. Now, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood for the lab tests and schedule your chest X-ray. Is there anything else you want to tell me before she gets here?
PATIENT: Hmph. Just one thing. This whole thing better not keep me from work for too long. I got responsibilities, you know. And I don’t want no young people tellin’ me I need to slow down. I’ll work as long as I can. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Bigger. We'll do everything we can to get you back to work as quickly and safely as possible. We’ll review the results as soon as they come in and discuss the best course of action. The nurse should be in shortly. Thank you for your patience.
