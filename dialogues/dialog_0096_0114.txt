DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this breathing. It’s… difficult when I try to lie flat. It feels like… something is pressing on me, you see? It started a few weeks ago, I believe. August 1st, to be exact. I keep two calendars, you understand.
DOCTOR: August 1st, right. Very organized. Hmm. And this difficulty… is it a constant thing, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Mostly at night, when I’m trying to sleep. During the day, I’m alright, mostly. I use extra pillows, you see. Three, to be precise. But it doesn’t always help. It’s quite bothersome. And I don’t want to use too many pillows, for my neck.
DOCTOR: Three pillows, you say. Alright. And when you lie flat and have this difficulty, can you describe what it feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… a pressure, like I said. A heavy weight. Not a pain, exactly, but… uncomfortable. And I have to sit up, you see? Straight up. Or lean forward a bit. It feels… like I can’t get enough air, maybe? It doesn’t last long, usually. Just until I adjust. But it happens nearly every night now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this… pressure?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, my ankles have been a bit swollen, lately. Not terribly, you understand. Just… puffier than usual. And I’ve been feeling a little more tired. But I am seventy-one, you see. It could just be old age, I suppose. I try to stay active, but… it's not always easy.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles, tiredness… Right. And have you had any coughing?
PATIENT: Coughing? No, not really. A little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing to speak of. No, Doctor. I don’t cough. I had a bad cough once, many years ago, when I lived in… well, never mind. It wasn’t this. Just a little tickle, like dust. I keep my house very clean, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your records here… Hmm. Your height is listed as 175 centimeters, and your weight as 68 kilograms. Do you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your lungs?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s fine, Doctor. Perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I’d like to get this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind. I have a book club meeting this afternoon, you see. It’s very important. We're discussing a rather good mystery.
DOCTOR: Right, a book club. Let’s get this done then. Just relax your arm for me, please. And breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. I am trying to relax. It's just… I don't usually like things wrapped around my arm. Makes me feel a bit… confined. But go ahead, Doctor. I understand.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140 over 90. Lungs are clear, but there’s a slight wheeze on exhale. Do you have any history of asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Asthma or… COPD? No, Doctor. I don't think so. I’ve never been told I have either of those. I had the flu, once, when I was a child, but that was many, many years ago. I haven’t had much trouble with my breathing, until recently. Like I said, it’s just this lying flat issue. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Well, the wheezing is a little concerning. And the swelling in your ankles, combined with the difficulty breathing when lying down… it could be a number of things. It's likely fluid buildup, possibly related to your heart. I want to order a chest x-ray and an EKG to get a better look. And a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh. X-ray? EKG? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? I don't like tests. I had a mammogram once, and it was… unpleasant. And will this take long? My book club…
DOCTOR: Look, it’s better to be thorough. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is bad. It just means we need more information. The x-ray and EKG are quick. The blood test will take a little longer to process. We'll have the results in a couple of days. The nurse will schedule those for you. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs when you rest and limiting your salt intake. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I take a small aspirin every day, for my heart, Doctor. My previous doctor recommended it, years ago. I don't recall any allergic reactions. I eat everything, mostly. Except for okra. I never liked okra. Will the tests tell me if I need to… stop lying flat? It's awfully uncomfortable sitting up all night.
DOCTOR: Well, the tests will help us determine the cause of the problem, which will then inform our treatment plan. It’s not about stopping lying flat immediately. We need to know why it’s difficult first. Here are the orders for your tests. The nurse will go over everything with you. For now, just try to keep your legs elevated and limit your salt. And try not to worry too much. We’ll get this sorted. Next patient…
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. Elevate legs, limit salt. I understand. Thank you. I suppose I’ll go and see the nurse, then. Is she… down the hall? I don’t remember where everything is. I just want to get home now, and read my book. .
