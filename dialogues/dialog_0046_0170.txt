DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi Doctor. It's Waleed. I'm here for, uh, a life insurance thing. They sent me, you know, for a medical check before they approve everything. I just wanna get it over with quick if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. We can definitely work through this as efficiently as possible. This is a standard medical assessment for life insurance purposes. It will involve going over your medical history, performing a physical exam, and possibly ordering some lab work. To begin, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I'm... okay, I guess. I get tired easy, but I work a lot. Long hours at the hotel. Not much time for, you know, taking care of myself. Divorced a few years back, keeps me busy running things on my own now. I have Medicare, if that matters. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Medicare does matter, as it helps me understand your coverage and previous medical care. And yes, feeling tired easily is good to mention. To clarify, when you say tired easily, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Like... all the time, really. Even after a full night's sleep. Not like I'm sick tired, just… always a little sluggish. Especially in the afternoons. It’s been going on for… a while, I don't know, maybe a year or so. Honestly, I just figured it was the job. Long shifts, you know? It's a hotel, so weekends and holidays are always busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, "always a little sluggish," even with adequate sleep, and worse in the afternoons. A year or so in duration. And it's impacting you at work, with the long shifts. Do you notice anything else associated with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Maybe a little… achy sometimes? My back, mostly, from lifting stuff at the hotel. But I just chalk that up to the work too. I don’t get headaches or anything like that. No fever or chills. Just… tired. And maybe a little grumpy because of it, if I'm being honest. My ex-wife would definitely agree with that last part.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue as the primary symptom, with some occasional back aches likely related to work. No headaches, fever, or chills. That's good information. Now, let’s go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past - things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a while, honestly. Just went to the emergency room once for a bad cut at the hotel, but they patched me up and sent me home. Nothing serious. Oh, wait. I think the doctor mentioned something about my cholesterol being a little high a few years ago, but they just told me to eat better. I haven't really done that. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does count, Mr. Putney. It's good you remembered that. Knowing about the previously mentioned high cholesterol is helpful. And it’s okay that you haven’t seen a doctor regularly – we can address that today. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Not even as a kid. I was pretty lucky that way. Just the cut at work, and that didn’t need surgery. It was just a deep one, they stitched it up. I think it was from a broken glass or something. Hotel stuff, you know. Things happen.
DOCTOR: Right, hotel work can be unpredictable. No surgeries, that's good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… that’s a tough one. I didn’t really talk to my family much. My mom passed away a long time ago, and I wasn’t close to my dad. I know my grandma had… something with her heart, I think? But I don’t know what exactly. My sister’s still alive, but we don't talk often. I don’t know her medical history either. Sorry, I'm not much help with that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Putney. Family medical history can be difficult to gather. It’s not always easy to have that information. We can proceed without it for now. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, even stuff I probably shouldn’t. I'm not picky. No bee stings or anything like that either. I think I’m pretty lucky, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I drink a lot of coffee, if that counts. But that’s it. Just coffee to get through the day. I figure that’s not a medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, just coffee. That's helpful. Alright, Mr. Putney, thank you for providing me with this information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Get it over with. I just wanna make sure this insurance thing gets approved, you know? I don't wanna drag this out any longer than I have to.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. We will be as efficient as possible. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then I’ll do a basic neurological exam. Could you please sit back and relax on the exam table?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Just let me know if it's gonna be weird or anything. I don’t really like doctors very much.
DOCTOR: I will absolutely let you know before each step, Mr. Putney. It will be a quick and straightforward exam. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. Take deep breaths… in and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but I do note a slightly rapid rate. Blood pressure is 140/90… and your pulse is 88 beats per minute. That’s a bit elevated. We'll need to monitor that. Ears look clear. No signs of infection. Throat looks normal. No obvious signs of infection. Now, I’m just going to quickly check your reflexes and test your strength.
PATIENT: Okay… whatever you gotta do. My dad always said I had quick reflexes, but I think he was just proud of me. Just get it over with quick, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's check your reflexes... Good, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Good grip strength. And now I'm going to ask you to push against my hands with your legs. Good leg strength as well. Alright, Mr. Putney, that completes the physical exam. Overall, your exam is relatively normal, but I did note a slightly rapid heart rate and elevated blood pressure. Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I get a little winded sometimes, but that’s from running around at the hotel all day. No chest pain or anything like that. Sometimes my head feels a little…fuzzy, but I figured that was just from being tired all the time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. The fatigue could certainly contribute to feeling “fuzzy.” Given your elevated blood pressure and heart rate, combined with the fatigue and the feeling of being “fuzzy”, I’d like to order some lab work to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Uh, more tests? Really? I was hoping to just be done with this. But, I guess if you think it's necessary... What kind of tests are we talkin' about? Just try not to take too much blood, alright? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Putney. I will keep the blood draw as minimal as possible. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid function. These tests will give us a good baseline and help us rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. Would you prefer to have the blood drawn here at the clinic, or would you like a lab recommendation?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just do it here, I guess. Get it over with, right? I don’t wanna have to come back another day. Just tell me when and where, and I'll be here. The quicker we can get this done, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It should only take a few minutes. We will get the results back within a few days. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on getting adequate sleep, staying hydrated, and trying to incorporate some stress-reducing activities into your daily routine. Would you like me to provide you with any resources on stress management techniques?
PATIENT: Nah, I'm good. I just wanna know when the results are back. You said a few days? And, uh, can you just call me when they are? I don’t really check my email much. My number is… 555-123-4567. That's it. Just call me when you got somethin'. Thanks.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I’ve noted your phone number as 555-123-4567, and I will call you as soon as the results are back, typically within 3-5 business days. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that’s it. Just get the tests done and call me with the results. I got a hotel to run, you know? Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you gettin’ this over with quickly.
