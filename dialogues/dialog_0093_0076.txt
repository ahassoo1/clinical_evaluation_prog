DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doc. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. They’re red and kinda sore, mostly on my shins here. <points to shins> They’ve been botherin' me for a bit now, maybe a couple of weeks or so. Not sure exactly when they started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. A couple of weeks of red, sore bumps on your shins. That's helpful. To get a better understanding, could you describe the bumps a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, they’re… hard, I guess? Not like a pimple, more like… little knots under the skin. And they’re kinda raised, you know? Not flat. They don’t really itch, mostly just… ache when I walk too much or if I bump ‘em. They're about the size of a pea, some are a little bigger, though. <I gesture with my hand to show the approximate size>
DOCTOR: Alright, hard, raised knots about the size of a pea, not particularly itchy, more of an ache with walking or impact. And are these bumps appearing in one area specifically, or are they scattered around your legs?
PATIENT: Mostly on the front of my shins, like… right here. <points to the front of both shins> There's a couple on the side, but most of 'em are on the front. And they seem to be gettin’ a little bit more, slowly, if that makes sense. Not a ton all at once, but I notice a new one every couple of days maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily on the front of your shins, and slowly increasing in number over the past couple of weeks. Have you noticed anything that seems to make them worse, or perhaps better?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. I haven't really noticed anything specific. I'm on my feet a lot at work, you know, movin’ stuff around. Maybe that makes 'em worse? I don’t really stop moving though, so hard to say. Rest doesn’t really seem to help much, to be honest. They're just...there. <shrugs> I haven’t tried anything special for 'em, just been ignoring 'em mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Being on your feet frequently at work could certainly be a factor, and it's good you haven’t noticed anything that definitively worsens or improves them. Let me just review your medical record quickly to see if there's anything relevant in your history. Do you have any known allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not really. I get a little itchy sometimes with certain soaps, but nothing serious, just a mild rash. No food allergies, no medicine allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thank goodness. <nods> I take a little bit of something for my blood pressure, that's about it. I'd have to look up the name, I can't remember off the top of my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant allergies, and you mentioned taking medication for blood pressure. That's good to know. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any recent injuries to your legs, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, not really. I might bump my legs sometimes at work, but nothing major, just little scrapes or bruises that healed right up. I don't remember any real injuries to my legs recently. I mean, I'm an old man, I get little bumps and bruises easily! <chuckles lightly> But nothin' that would explain these. I think. <frowns thoughtfully>
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent injuries. Thank you for that information, Mr. Aluia. Now, I'd like to take a closer look at these bumps, if you don't mind. Would you be comfortable if I examined your legs?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! That's perfectly fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doc. Just tell me if you need me to do anything. <I pull up my pants legs a bit to better expose my shins.> They're right here, as you can see. <points to shins again>
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting several firm, raised nodules on the anterior shins, consistent with your description. They range in size from approximately 5 millimeters to 1 centimeter. The skin over them is normal in color, with no signs of inflammation or drainage. There is some tenderness to palpation, as you mentioned. I do not feel any significant swelling or warmth. Based on my examination, and considering your history, these bumps are most likely shin splints with associated inflammation of the small blood vessels, also known as stasis dermatitis. Do you have any history of varicose veins or swelling in your legs?
PATIENT: Varicose veins… hmm… <I pause and think for a moment, tapping my chin.> My wife, she tells me I have some little spider veins, but nothing big, nothin' that I ever worried about. And… sometimes my feet swell a little at the end of the day, especially if it's really hot. But it goes away when I put 'em up. Not too bad, really. Never really bothered me enough to see a doctor about it. Is that what you're askin’ about? <looks at Dr. Bakan expectantly> Stasis… what was it again? That sounds kinda scary.
DOCTOR: Stasis dermatitis is often associated with venous insufficiency, which means the valves in your veins aren't working as efficiently as they should, leading to some fluid buildup and inflammation in the legs. The spider veins and occasional swelling you describe are consistent with that possibility. It’s not necessarily scary, but it’s good to be aware of, and we can manage it. Now, to confirm this, and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a simple Doppler ultrasound of your legs to assess the blood flow in your veins. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A Doppler… ultrasound? <frowns slightly.> Sounds a bit fancy, Doc. What exactly does it do? I don't like needles or anything, if that matters. Is it gonna hurt? <looks concerned> I’m just… not a fan of tests, to be honest. But I trust you. If you think it's best, then I guess I'm willing. Just tell me what to expect. <nods slowly>
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Aluia. A Doppler ultrasound is completely non-invasive – no needles at all. It uses sound waves to create an image of the blood flow in your veins. It doesn't hurt at all, you won’t feel anything. A technician will apply a gel to your legs and then move a small handheld device over your skin. It may feel a little cool, that's all. It takes about 30-45 minutes. It will help us determine if there’s any significant blockage or valve dysfunction in your veins, which will guide our treatment plan. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule that for you?
PATIENT: Okay, no needles, that’s good. And it doesn't hurt… Alright. <takes a deep breath.> Thirty to forty-five minutes… I can handle that. <nods slowly.> Yes, please. Go ahead and schedule it, Doc. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know when and where. <looks relieved> Thank you. I appreciate you explainin' it to me. It’s just… gettin’ old, you know? Things start to break down. <chuckles softly>
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Aluia. Here’s the appointment slip with all the details. Just bring this with you when you go. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, especially at the end of the day. Also, wearing compression stockings can help improve blood flow and reduce swelling. I can give you a prescription for those as well. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… <frowns.> Oh, those tight ones? My wife has those. Are they… comfortable? <looks skeptical> I’m not sure I wanna be squeezin’ my legs all day. But… if it helps, I guess I could try ‘em. What kind do you recommend? And the prescription… yeah, that would be good, if you think so. And… what if it’s somethin’ serious? <looks concerned again> I don’t wanna worry my wife too much. <wrings hands slightly> It's just… all this talk is makin’ me a little nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Aluia. It’s natural to be nervous when you're not sure what’s going on. Compression stockings have come a long way, and there are many comfortable options available. We can start with a milder compression level – 15-20 mmHg – which shouldn’t be too constricting. They’re available at most pharmacies. I will write you a prescription for those, just in case. As for what if it is something more serious, we will know more after the ultrasound. It's important to remember that we're being proactive and gathering information. If we do find something concerning, we will discuss all your options and create a treatment plan together. I will be here to answer all your questions and support you every step of the way. We’ll take it one step at a time. For now, let's focus on elevating your legs and trying the compression stockings. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week, once we have the ultrasound results, to discuss them and determine the best course of action. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. One step at a time… that sounds good. <nods slowly, looking relieved> Compression stockings, elevatin' my legs… I can do that. Elevatin' my legs, I can manage. <smiles faintly> Thank you, Doc. You’ve really put my mind at ease. Next week… that’s fine. <takes the prescription.> I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything. I’m an old man, but I still worry, you know? <chuckles softly> I guess that never goes away. <stands up slowly, adjusting tie> Alright, I think that’s everything for now. Thanks again, Doc. I'll see you next week. <starts to walk towards the door>
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Aluia. It was my pleasure to meet you. Remember, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before our next appointment. And please, take care of yourself. .
