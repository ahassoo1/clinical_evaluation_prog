DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I’m Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's this… weakness in my legs. It just came on suddenly, after I had a really nasty cold a couple of weeks ago. Not a pleasant experience, that cold. But this leg thing is… inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes. Well, sudden onset weakness after a cold… that's… interesting. Could you describe the weakness?
PATIENT: Interesting how? Look, I don’t usually get sick, and when I do, it's just a sniffle. This cold knocked me flat. And now this. As for the weakness… it’s like they just… don’t want to work, you know? Both legs, feels like trying to wade through mud. Not painful, exactly, just… heavy. It’s worse when I try to stand up after sitting for a bit. And walking isn't as easy as it used to be. Honestly, it’s quite a bother.
DOCTOR: Hmm. "Heavy," "wade through mud"... and worse after sitting. Okay. And how long has this leg weakness been going on, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started maybe three days ago? Right after I started feeling better from the cold, actually. I thought it was just lingering effects, but it hasn’t gone away. If anything, it seems a little… more noticeable today. I was hoping it would just resolve on its own, but it’s not. Frankly, I’m not one for fussing over things, but this is interfering with my tours. Can't very well show people around if I can barely walk, can I?
DOCTOR: Tours, right. Well, lingering effects can happen, but three days is… a bit long for just a simple post-viral issue. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Just… weakness. Like they're filled with lead. And honestly, Doctor, I’ve seen a lot of different kinds of people on my tours—all sorts of ailments and complaints—and this feels… different. It’s not like a pulled muscle or anything simple. It’s… deeper. I’m not trying to diagnose myself, but I do know my body. And something isn’t right.
DOCTOR: "Deeper," you say. Right. Well, let's have a look. Could you sit on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Though I do hope this won't take long. I have a group arriving tomorrow morning, and preparation takes time, you know. Do be gentle, please. I'm not exactly known for my flexibility.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation. Please let me know if anything feels painful. And don't worry, I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's start with your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh! That was… startling. I don’t care for those things. Honestly, it feels like being poked with a… well, never mind. Is that normal? It just feels… intrusive. Are you sure that's necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Firestone. It helps me assess your nervous system function. It appears your reflexes are… diminished, bilaterally. Now, let’s check your strength. Could you please try to push your heel down into the table, and resist me as I try to lift it?
PATIENT: Resist you? You're a small woman, Doctor. With all due respect. But alright, fine. I’ll humour you. There. Am I doing it correctly? I pride myself on being quite strong, actually. Years of leading tours, you know. It builds character—and muscle.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are. But your strength is… weaker than expected, bilaterally. Not dramatically so, but noticeably diminished. Let’s try the same thing with your toes – push your toes down against my resistance.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is rather unpleasant. And you said 'bilaterally' again. What does that mean, exactly? It sounds very… serious. And if my strength is diminished, what does that mean? Is it something… awful? I’m not fond of being kept in suspense, you know. I need to know what’s going on so I can plan accordingly. I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: "Bilaterally" simply means on both sides, Ms. Firestone. And diminished strength could indicate a variety of things. It's not necessarily "awful," but it does require investigation. Now, I'd like to check your sensation. Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch your legs?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you're making me quite anxious. All this talk of diminished strength and… investigation. It sounds rather dramatic for a little post-cold weakness. Alright, touch away. But please, be quick about it. I have a schedule to keep. And don’t poke me unnecessarily, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone. Can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I feel it. Perfectly normal sensation, if you ask me. Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? You're prodding me like a… like a laboratory specimen. I understand you need to do your job, but I’m not accustomed to this level of… scrutiny. Is there anything concrete you can tell me yet? Or are we just going to continue poking and prodding indefinitely?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Firestone, your sensation appears intact. However, diminished reflexes and diminished strength in both legs, coupled with your recent cold… it's concerning. It’s not a simple post-viral issue. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and electrolytes, and an MRI of your spine to rule out any nerve compression or inflammation.
PATIENT: An MRI? Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, this is escalating rapidly. An MRI sounds… rather unpleasant. And what do you mean, “rule out?” Rule out what, exactly? Is it something serious? You’re not telling me everything, are you? I’m a perfectly capable woman, Doctor. I deserve a straight answer. And I have a tour group arriving tomorrow. This is… inconvenient, to say the least. Do you think I’ll be able to work?
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your concern, but I’m not going to speculate. The MRI is necessary to rule out serious neurological conditions. It could be something benign, or it could be something more significant. Until we have the results, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis. As for your tour group… I strongly advise you to postpone it. I’m not saying you definitely cannot work, but attempting to lead a tour in your current condition could be… detrimental. It's better to be safe. I’m referring you to a neurologist for further evaluation. Here is a referral slip. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And, honestly, Ms. Firestone, try to rest.
PATIENT: A neurologist? Honestly, Doctor, this is… excessive. A neurologist! For a little leg weakness? You're overreacting. But alright, fine. I'll see a neurologist. But I’m not postponing my tour. I have a reputation to maintain, you know. People are relying on me. And I’m perfectly capable of managing my own condition. I suppose I’ll schedule an appointment when I have a moment. But don't expect miracles. I have a very busy schedule. And honestly, this entire experience has been… quite stressful. A neurologist… honestly.
