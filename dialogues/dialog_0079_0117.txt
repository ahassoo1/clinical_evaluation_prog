DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. Morning. It's… a cough. Been coughin’ a bit. And… there's blood. Not a lot, but… in the stuff I cough up. It worries me. I smoke, you see. Been smokin’ a long time.
DOCTOR: I see. A cough with…hemoptysis, as we call it – blood in the sputum. And you’ve been a smoker for quite some time. Very good. Could you elaborate on the cough, please?
PATIENT: Hemop… what now? Just… blood. Yeah. The cough… it's mostly in the mornings. Always been a bit worse then. Lately it just… feels deeper. Harder to get rid of. I don't know if that makes sense. It's not always there, just… when it is, it's bad.
DOCTOR: Hemoptysis simply means coughing up blood, Mr. Reyno. I understand. So, primarily a morning cough that's recently become…deeper, and more difficult to clear. And you say it isn’t constant?
PATIENT: Yeah, not constant. Some days I don’t even think about it. Others… well, others I’m hackin’ and wheezin’ all morning. I try to ignore it mostly. Just figured it was the smokes.
DOCTOR: Ignoring it is…not advisable, Mr. Reyno. While smoking is certainly a significant factor, we need to ascertain the underlying cause. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… I get tired easier, maybe? But I’m gettin’ older, so… hard to say. No fever. No… chills, I don’t think. Sometimes a little short of breath, but not always. Like I said, it’s hard to remember things these days.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, shortness of breath… and difficulty with recall. Very well. Now, I need to ask some more detailed questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? I don’t know. I haven’t been weighin’ myself. Clothes feel… the same, I guess. Haven't needed to buy new ones. Not recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any chest pain associated with the cough, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Chest pain…? Not really. Sometimes it feels… tight, when I’m coughin’ real bad. But it’s not… sharp. More like a pressure. Just feels like I'm gonna burst, sometimes.
DOCTOR: A pressure, not a sharp pain. And regarding your medical history – do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Pre-existin’…? Uh… the doctor back home said my blood pressure was a little high, once. That was… a while ago. They gave me some pills, but I stopped takin’ them. Didn’t like feelin’… funny. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, and discontinuation of medication. A regrettable decision, Mr. Reyno. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized…? When I was a kid, I broke my arm. Fallin’ outta a tree. But… not as an adult, no. Not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? My mom… she had somethin’ with her lungs, I think. Coughin’ a lot, like me. But… a long time ago. Can’t remember exactly what it was. My dad… he just… got old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Reyno. I'm going to need to conduct a physical examination. This will involve listening to your lungs, checking your heart rate and blood pressure, and palpating your lymph nodes. I would also like to order a chest X-ray and a sputum sample for analysis. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Sputum sample…? Sounds… serious. Is it somethin’ bad? I don't mind the listenin’ and feelin’… but all that other stuff… Is there any other way?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, I understand your apprehension, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your cough and hemoptysis. Ignoring the problem will not make it disappear; it may, in fact, allow a serious condition to progress. The X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs, and the sputum sample will help us identify any potential infections or abnormalities. Without these tests, I am unable to provide an accurate diagnosis or appropriate treatment plan. I assure you, we will proceed as quickly and efficiently as possible. Do you consent to the tests?
PATIENT: …Alright. Fine. Do them. Just… don’t take too long. And tell me what’s goin’ on, okay? Don’t just leave me hangin’.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll begin with listening to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Again… Deeper breath… Good. I'm hearing some…wheezing in both lung fields, and some crackles in the lower lobes. This is consistent with some degree of airway obstruction and possible inflammation. Now, I will palpate your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but not significantly concerning at this time. Now, we will collect a sputum sample. I will provide you with a sterile container and instructions. Please follow them carefully. And then we will proceed to the X-ray. A technician will guide you through the procedure. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Sputum sample… Okay. What do I do with it? Just… cough in a cup? It sounds… messy. And… will the X-ray hurt?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Reyno, you simply cough into the cup until you have a sufficient sample. The nurse will provide you with detailed instructions on proper collection technique to ensure the sample is adequate for analysis. As for the X-ray, no, it will not hurt. It is a non-invasive procedure that uses a small amount of radiation to create an image of your lungs. The technician will position you appropriately and take the image quickly. It is a routine procedure. I will have the nurse assist you with the sputum sample collection and direct you to the radiology department for the X-ray. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, I think so. Cough in a cup… no pain… Nurse will help. Just… get it over with, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will inform the nurse immediately. Please remain seated, and she will be with you shortly. And Mr. Reyno, I must reiterate, while I understand your desire for expediency, it is imperative that you follow the instructions carefully to ensure accurate results.
