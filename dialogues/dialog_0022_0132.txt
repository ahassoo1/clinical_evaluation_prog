DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Coby’s the name. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, to be honest. Waste of time, mostly. But this heat… it’s just… different this year, isn’t it? I can’t seem to handle it like I used to. Feel like I’m melting just walking to the bus stop. That’s why I’m here, I suppose. Heat intolerance. Though, really, it’s just common sense, isn’t it? Getting old.
DOCTOR: Yes, it has been a particularly warm summer. And you're right, sometimes changes just happen as we get older. But it's good you came in to get it checked out. We want to make sure there isn’t anything more going on. So, when did you first start noticing this increased sensitivity to the heat?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It wasn’t sudden, like. More of a… gradual thing. Last summer, I remember thinking it was a bit warmer than usual. But this year… this year it started almost right away, in June. Even the shade doesn’t help much. Used to be able to work outside all day, no problem. Painting, mostly. And a bit of construction, fixing things up. Now? Forget it. Can’t do more than an hour before I’m completely wiped. It's ridiculous. And I’m a hard worker, always have been. Never taken a day off sick in my life, practically.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started gradually around June, and it's significantly impacting your ability to work, especially outdoor work like painting and construction. You said you've never really taken time off sick before, which is excellent. That’s good information to have. Besides feeling wiped out, are you experiencing any other symptoms when you’re exposed to the heat?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… I get a bit dizzy, sometimes. Not falling-down dizzy, just… lightheaded. And I’m awfully thirsty, all the time. More than usual, anyway. And I find myself… irritable. Snapping at people, which isn’t like me. My neighbour, bless his heart, asked if I was feeling alright the other day. Said I wasn’t my usual self. He’s a good man, but I told him to mind his own business, if you can believe that. Wouldn't normally say something like that. And my skin gets… hot, obviously. But hotter than it should be, even when I’m in the shade. Like a fever, almost. Though, I haven't actually taken my temperature. Don't bother with that nonsense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dizziness, increased thirst, irritability, and feeling hot to the touch – almost like a fever, even in the shade. All of those are important things to know. You mentioned you haven’t taken your temperature, which is perfectly alright. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No, not really. Nothing major, anyway. Bit of arthritis in my hands, the doctor said years ago. But that's just old age, isn’t it? Doesn’t bother me much. I take some over-the-counter pain relief when it flares up. And I had my gallbladder removed… oh, must be twenty years ago now. That’s about it. Always been a healthy man, truthfully. Never smoked, hardly ever drank. Eat a decent diet, mostly. Though my wife… well, my late wife, she was the cook. I’m not much of one myself, to be honest. Mostly just sandwiches and simple things these days. Don't see the point in fussing about it. Medicare covers everything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so arthritis in your hands, managed with over-the-counter pain relief, and a gallbladder removal about twenty years ago. Good to know. And you’ve never smoked or drank much, and maintain a fairly simple diet. That’s excellent lifestyle information. And I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the pain relief for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Just the ibuprofen, when I need it. That's it. Don’t believe in loading up on pills unless I absolutely have to. My wife… she was always at the doctor’s, always complaining about something. I told her she worried too much. It's just… well, it didn't do her any good, did it? She passed away three years ago, you know. Cancer. A terrible thing. Now, where was I? Oh yes, medications. No, just the ibuprofen. And a bit of liniment for my hands sometimes, if they’re really aching. But that’s hardly a medication, is it? Just a rub. I get it at the pharmacy. That’s all. Don't trust these doctors to give me anything worthwhile, frankly. They just want to sell you something.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've had a lot on your plate, and I appreciate your honesty. We will certainly take a conservative approach. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. My wife… she was allergic to cats. A terrible thing for her, really. Couldn’t even be in the same room as one. But me? No allergies. I eat everything. I’ve never had any reactions to any foods or medicines. Honestly, I think people exaggerate these allergy things. Just a way for the doctors to sell you more things, if you ask me. I’ve lived a long life, worked hard, eaten everything, and never had a problem. That’s the truth of it. Now, is that what you need to know? Because I’m getting a bit tired of sitting here, to be honest. Just want to get this sorted and get back to work, if I can. This heat is ruining everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful to know. No known allergies. And I completely understand your desire to get back to work. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're agreeable. Just checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. And I’ll quickly check your skin for hydration. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam, huh? Honestly, I don’t see the point, but… alright. Get it over with. But don’t expect much. I’m a healthy man, as I said. Been working outside my whole life. Probably tougher than most of these young doctors. Just get it done quickly, if you will. And please, don’t poke around too much. I don’t like being touched. Just the basics, if you don’t mind. Blood pressure, pulse… whatever. Let's just get this over with. And I’m telling you now, if you tell me to lose weight or change my diet, I’m walking out. Medicare might cover it, but my pride won't.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Just the basics. Blood pressure, pulse, and a quick check of your skin. I understand your concerns, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148 over 82. Your pulse is 88 and regular. And your skin feels warm and dry, and there’s a bit of decreased skin turgor, which means it’s not bouncing back as quickly as it should. That can be a sign of dehydration. I’m also noting some dryness of your mucous membranes. It’s subtle, but present.
PATIENT: Dehydration? Mucous membranes? What are you talking about? I drink plenty of water. More than most people, I reckon. Always have a bottle with me when I'm working. And I don’t sweat much, never have. Always been that way. Tough skin, I suppose. You're telling me I’m dehydrated? That’s ridiculous. My wife, she always fussed about me drinking enough water. Told me I didn't take care of myself. But I’m fine. I’ve always been fine. This is just the heat, isn’t it? A bit warmer than usual. You’re making a big deal out of nothing. And that blood pressure… a bit high, you say? I get stressed easily, especially when I'm waiting around in places like this. You're stressing me out now, if you want to know the truth. Now, is there anything else you need to poke and prod at? Because I really need to get back to work. The day’s wasting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Coby. I'm not trying to alarm you, just gathering information to understand what's going on. The elevated blood pressure could be related to stress, as you mentioned. And while you may not feel significantly dehydrated, the exam findings—warm, dry skin and decreased skin turgor—suggest it’s a possibility, especially given the heat and your reported symptoms. To rule out other potential causes and get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests. We can check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Now you're talking about needles and poking around again. Honestly, I don't like this one bit. Needles? Absolutely not. I haven't had a blood test in… oh, goodness, probably fifty years. And I don't intend to start now. I’m fine. I don't need blood tests. It's just the heat. A bit warmer than usual. You're making a fuss about nothing. I told you, I drink plenty of water. And I'm a tough man. I can handle it. You're just trying to sell me something, aren't you? More pills, more tests… I knew I shouldn't have come here. Now, look, can we just forget the blood tests? I'll drink more water, alright? Is that what you want? I'll drink a gallon of water. Just let me get back to work. I have things to do. This is a waste of my time, and frankly, a waste of your time too. Now, are we finished here? Because I'm getting very impatient. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Coby. We can skip the blood tests for now. However, I strongly recommend increasing your fluid intake, especially water, and avoiding strenuous activity during the hottest part of the day. Given your concerns and the reluctance for further testing, I will document our discussion and suggest close monitoring of your symptoms. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe dizziness, confusion, or decreased urination, please seek immediate medical attention. I can provide you with a written summary of our conversation and these recommendations. Would you like that?
