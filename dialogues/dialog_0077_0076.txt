DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doc. Well, it's my legs. I got these… bumps, kinda like red knots, on my shins. They’re achin’ a bit, too. Not terrible, but enough to bother me, you know? Been there for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Alright, bumps on your shins that are achy… and for how long have these been present, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… a couple of months, I reckon? It started with just one or two, and now there’s… well, a good handful. Not gettin’ worse fast, thankfully. Just… there.
DOCTOR: A couple of months, gradually increasing… and not rapidly changing. Have you noticed anything that makes them better or worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Honestly, not really. They don’t seem to bother me more when I’m workin’ or restin’. It’s just… always kinda the same. I thought maybe my boots were too tight, so I switched to looser ones, but didn’t make a difference. I don’t know, Doc. That's why I came to see you!
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll try to figure it out. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with these bumps?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… uh… let me see. No fever, no chills, nothin’ like that. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m 71, so… That could just be old age! No pain anywhere else, no cough, nothin’. Just the bumps and the ache in my legs. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright, no systemic symptoms… just localized to the legs. Now, could you describe the bumps a bit more precisely?
PATIENT: Well, they're… round-ish, I guess? Not too big, maybe the size of a pea, some a little bigger. They’re definitely red, kinda raised. And… kinda hard to the touch. Not squishy, if that makes sense. They don’t have a head on ‘em, no pus or anything. Just red, hard bumps.
DOCTOR: Alright, round, red, hard bumps, approximately pea-sized. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin color around the bumps, or any itching?
PATIENT: No, no change in the color of my skin, not around ‘em anyway. And no, they don’t itch. That’s good, right? Itching would be awful. Just… achy and red. Honestly, Doc, I’m not too worried, but I just wanted to get it checked out, y’know? Better safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: No itching, no changes in skin color. Very good. Now, let’s go over your medical history briefly, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, well I got high blood pressure, Doc, been on medicine for that for years now. And my knees are kinda bad, arthritis, you know how it is. Other than that… not much. I had the flu a couple of times, but who hasn’t? Oh! And I take a little somethin’ for cholesterol too. That's about it, I think.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, arthritis, and cholesterol medication. And are you currently taking any medications for those conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. For the blood pressure, I take… Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And for the cholesterol, it's Atorvastatin. And for my knees, sometimes I take ibuprofen when they’re really botherin’ me, but not every day. I could show you the bottles if you like?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Aluia, no need to trouble yourself. We have your medication list on file. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never had a reaction to any medicine, thank goodness. I’m pretty lucky that way, I think. My wife, she's allergic to penicillin, but not me. Nope, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Good, no medication allergies. Now, before we proceed, I would like to examine your legs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Go right ahead. They're kinda itchy now that you mention it, but that's probably just from me lookin' at 'em so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. I am just going to gently feel your legs and examine the bumps. They are indeed raised, firm to the touch, and slightly warm. There’s no noticeable swelling or discoloration around them. Your pulses are strong and regular in both legs. Based on this preliminary examination, and given your medical history, these could be stasis dermatitis, potentially exacerbated by your circulation. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to be safe. Also, I'd like to get a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Wow, that’s… a lot of tests, Doc. Stasis dermatitis… is that bad? And a biopsy? That sounds… serious. I just thought it was a little irritation or somethin’. What will those tests tell us? And what if it isn't stasis dermatitis? I'm kinda nervous now, Doc. I just wanted to know what these bumps are, not… get a bunch of tests!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Aluia. It does sound like a lot, and I apologize if it’s overwhelming. Stasis dermatitis is not necessarily bad, but it indicates some underlying venous insufficiency, meaning the blood isn't flowing back from your legs as efficiently as it should. We can manage that with compression stockings and lifestyle changes. The biopsy is a very small procedure – we take a tiny sample of skin and send it to a lab for analysis. It’s the most accurate way to confirm the diagnosis. We need to rule out other possibilities, such as infections or even early signs of other skin conditions. It’s better to be thorough, especially given your age and medical history. The tests will help us determine the exact cause of these bumps and develop the most appropriate treatment plan. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or anything I've explained?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. A tiny sample of skin… that doesn’t sound too awful. And you said compression stockings? Like… the ones old ladies wear? I’ve always thought those were kinda… embarrassing. But if it helps… And how long will I have to wait for the results? And will the biopsy hurt? I don't handle pain too well these days. Honestly, Doc, I'm just a little scared of all this. It's just bumps, right?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension completely, Mr. Aluia. It’s natural to feel scared when facing the unknown. And yes, compression stockings are similar to what some people wear, but they come in different styles and colors now - they don’t have to be unsightly. We can find a pair that’s comfortable and discreet. The biopsy itself is usually quick, and we'll use a local anesthetic to numb the area, so you shouldn't feel much discomfort – just a brief pinch. You might experience some mild soreness afterward, but that can be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. The lab results usually take about a week, sometimes a little longer. While we wait for the results, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible and avoiding prolonged standing. We can also discuss some lifestyle modifications to improve your circulation. And to be clear, yes, they are just bumps right now, but it’s important to get a proper diagnosis so we can address any underlying issues and prevent them from worsening. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes a little more sense. Elevate my legs and… not stand so much. I can do that. I mostly just sit around watching TV anyway. So, a week for the results… and you’ll call me if anything’s wrong? And the biopsy… you’ll numb it first, right? I just don’t want any surprises. And… will the insurance cover all this, Doc? Medicare, you know. I don’t want a big bill, too! I’m retired, you know. It’s kinda tight.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Aluia. We'll schedule the biopsy for next week, and yes, we will ensure the area is thoroughly numbed beforehand. You won’t feel a thing. And don't worry about a surprise bill. We will verify your Medicare coverage before proceeding with any tests or procedures. Our billing department will handle everything, and they will contact you if there are any out-of-pocket expenses. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a mild topical steroid cream to help with any inflammation or itching in the meantime. It won’t cure the condition, but it can provide some relief while we wait for the results. To summarize, we’re ordering a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a skin biopsy. We'll schedule the biopsy for next week, and I'm prescribing a topical steroid cream for now. I will also give you a handout with information about elevating your legs and improving circulation. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds good, Doc. Thank you. A plan is good. That makes me feel better. So, I just need to schedule the biopsy, get the cream… and wait for the results. And elevate my legs. I can do that. You've been very patient with me, Doc. I was kinda scared at first, but you explained everything so well. Thank you. Now, where do I go to schedule the biopsy? And is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I’m glad I could ease your mind. And you were perfectly justified in being scared, it’s always better to ask questions! I’m going to have my nurse, Sarah, schedule the biopsy for you before you leave. She'll also give you the prescription for the cream and the handout with information about venous insufficiency and leg care. In the meantime, please try to avoid crossing your legs for extended periods and wear loose-fitting clothing. Also, stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. If you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, chills, or increased pain or redness around the bumps, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any further questions for me at this time, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doc. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been a big help. I’ll go see Sarah now, and schedule the biopsy. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel a lot better now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. It was my pleasure. Please let Sarah know if you have any trouble scheduling the appointment. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Take care now, and I’ll see you next week. Have a good day.
