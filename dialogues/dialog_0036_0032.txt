DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to Radford Krok Clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Bacy, was it? Yes, a rather…delicate matter, I’m afraid. It’s a bit embarrassing to discuss, frankly. Though I suppose that’s what one comes to a doctor for. It concerns… a discharge. A rather unpleasant one, at that. I haven’t the faintest idea what could be causing it. It just…started.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly alright. Many things can cause discharge, and we'll figure out what's going on. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, so thank you for being open with me. To help me understand, can you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Well, it's… not a great colour, if I may be so blunt. A sort of… yellowish-grey. And there’s a… odour. Not a pleasant one. I've been trying to keep things… clean, as one does. But it persists. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I can't say precisely. A week? Perhaps a little longer. Time does rather slip away at my age, you know. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… worrying. And rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. Yellowish-grey discharge with an odour is definitely something we need to investigate. And you're right to be concerned. The fact that it's not painful is good, but doesn't rule anything out. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Let me think. Well, I have been feeling rather… tired lately. Though, to be fair, one always feels tired at my age. Perhaps that’s not relevant. And… my waterworks haven’t been quite as… forceful, shall we say? It takes a bit longer to… start. No burning sensation, mind you, just… a weaker stream. And I believe my wife mentioned something about a… smell? Not specifically from me, but in the general vicinity. She has a very sensitive nose, you know. Is that helpful, Doctor? I do apologize for my rambling. It’s difficult to recall these things.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Mr. Krok, please don't apologize. It’s good you’re sharing these details, even if they seem small. The fatigue and weaker stream are important to note, as is what your wife mentioned about the smell. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about that?
PATIENT: Go right ahead, Doctor. Though I doubt I’ll be much help. My memory isn’t what it once was. I’ve seen doctors, of course, over the years. Mostly for the usual aches and pains of growing old. Arthritis, mainly. And a touch of high blood pressure, I believe. Nothing too serious. I’m covered by Medicare, if that’s relevant. I’ve been married for… oh, goodness, nearly sixty years now. My wife, Eleanor, she handles all the paperwork. I leave the details to her. She’s a very organized woman. I’ve never had anything… down there bother me before, mind you. This is entirely new.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the arthritis and high blood pressure. Medicare is relevant, and it’s helpful to know Eleanor handles the paperwork. And thank you for letting me know this is a new issue. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Yes, I believe I had my appendix removed many years ago. A rather unpleasant experience, as I recall. And… a hernia operation, I think. Perhaps twenty years ago? It was on my… abdomen. Nothing else comes to mind immediately. I've never been one for unnecessary medical procedures, you understand. I prefer to avoid them whenever possible. I find hospitals… unsettling. All those beeping machines and strange smells. It’s all rather… clinical. And I’ve never been particularly brave, you see. A bit of a coward, really. My wife says so.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. That’s helpful to know about the appendix and hernia repair. Now, can you tell me about any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… another difficult topic. My father… he was a strong man, a farmer. He lived to a good age, thankfully. But he had… heart trouble, I believe. And my mother… she suffered from arthritis, much like myself. And my sister, she had… something with her stomach, I think. A rather serious illness, as I recall. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't particularly close to her, so I don't recall the details. Eleanor would know more, naturally. She keeps track of all these things. I mostly just try to avoid thinking about it, if I'm honest. It's all rather depressing, you see. Illness and death… not pleasant topics at all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It’s not easy to think about these things. Knowing about the heart trouble and arthritis is helpful, though. Now, I’m going to ask you about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Certainly not! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit, if you ask me. And alcohol… a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, perhaps. But nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? Preposterous! I am an upstanding member of the community, Doctor. A retired mechanic, a devoted husband, and a man of… moderate habits. I find such questions rather… intrusive, if I’m honest. Though I suppose one must answer them to receive proper medical care. I do apologize if I seem… judgmental. It's just… I’ve always believed in leading a clean and respectable life. And such things… well, they're simply not done.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions were intrusive, Mr. Krok. It's standard procedure, and I appreciate you being honest with me. I understand your lifestyle, and it's good to hear. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. Well, I believe I had a rather unpleasant reaction to penicillin many years ago. A rash, I think. Nothing too serious, thankfully. And… I don't believe I’ve ever had any trouble with foods. Though I'm not particularly fond of shellfish. But that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. Dust bothers me sometimes, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? My wife is very careful about keeping the house clean. She dusts religiously. And… I don’t believe that’s all. No, I'm quite certain. Nothing else comes to mind. I'm a fairly… robust individual, you see. Not prone to allergies or sensitivities. I've always been rather… lucky in that regard. Is that helpful, Doctor? I do apologize for my rambling. I'm afraid my mind isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Krok. Knowing about the penicillin allergy is important. Okay, thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the exam table. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll need to examine your abdomen and, if you’re comfortable, perform a genital exam to take a closer look at the source of the discharge. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… a genital exam? Oh, dear. Well, I suppose it’s necessary, if you insist. Though I must confess, the thought is… rather unsettling. I haven't had anyone… examine that area in… well, in decades! But I trust your professional judgment, Doctor. Yes, alright. Do as you must. But please be… gentle. And discreet. It’s a bit embarrassing, you understand. A man doesn’t like to have his… private parts poked and prodded. But I suppose it’s all in the name of good health. Yes, alright. Proceed. But please, be quick about it. And… gentle. Very gentle. I do apologize for my… nervousness. It’s just… not something one anticipates at my age.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I understand your discomfort completely. I assure you, I will be as gentle and discreet as possible. We will take things slowly and at your pace. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'll just gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Now, if you’re comfortable, we’ll move on to the genital exam. I'll need you to lie on your back with your knees bent. I’ll use a gloved and lubricated finger to gently examine the area. Please let me know immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort. Alright, Mr. Krok. I've observed some inflammation and discharge consistent with a possible infection. I’d like to collect a sample of the discharge to send to the lab for analysis. This will help us determine the cause of the infection and the best course of treatment. Do you agree?
PATIENT: An infection, you say? Well, that’s… disconcerting. I suppose that’s what I feared. Yes, a sample. Of course. Whatever it takes to get this… sorted. Though the thought of it is… unpleasant. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Yes, proceed. Just… be gentle. And quick about it. And… explain everything beforehand, if you would be so kind. A man likes to know what’s happening to his… private parts, you understand. It’s a matter of… dignity, I suppose. Yes, proceed. But please, be gentle. And quick. And explain everything. I do apologize for my… nervousness. It’s just… not something one anticipates at my age. A rather undignified affair, if I may be so blunt.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I completely understand. This is a routine procedure, and I’ll explain everything every step of the way. I’m going to use a sterile swab to gently collect a small sample of the discharge. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Now, this may feel a little cold… just for a moment. Alright, that’s all done. I’ll send this off to the lab, and we should have results in a few days. While we're waiting for the lab results, I'm going to prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic to start treating the possible infection. It's important to start treatment as soon as possible to prevent the infection from worsening. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A broad-spectrum antibiotic… yes, that sounds… sensible. Anything to get rid of this… affliction. Though I'm not particularly fond of taking medication. It always makes me feel… sluggish. But I suppose it’s necessary. Yes, proceed. Anything to get rid of it. Just… tell me what to expect. Any side effects? Will it interact with my… arthritis medication? My wife handles all the details, you understand. She's very careful about these things. But I'd like to be informed, if you wouldn't mind. Yes, tell me everything. And please, be quick about it. I'm not one for prolonged medical discussions, you understand. Just tell me what I need to know to get rid of this… unpleasantness. Yes, proceed. But please, be quick. And tell me everything. Is that too much to ask? I do apologize for my… nervousness. It’s just… not something one anticipates at my age. A rather undignified affair, if I may be so blunt.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too much at all, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to be informed. I’m prescribing you Amoxicillin, 500mg, three times a day for seven days. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and stomach upset. If you experience any severe side effects, like difficulty breathing or a rash, stop taking the medication immediately and contact me or go to the emergency room. Regarding your arthritis medication, it shouldn't interact with Amoxicillin. However, it’s always best to double-check with your wife or your pharmacist to be absolutely sure. I’ll also write down the dosage and instructions on a piece of paper for you to take home, and I’ll send a copy to your pharmacy. We'll also need to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to check your progress and see if the antibiotic is working. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: One week, you say? Yes, that sounds… acceptable. A week is a long time, of course. But I suppose it’s necessary. A week to get rid of this… affliction. Yes, schedule it. Whatever it takes. Just… try to keep it brief, if you would be so kind. A man doesn’t like to linger in doctor’s offices, you understand. A week. Very well. Schedule it. And try to keep it brief, if you would be so kind. A man doesn’t like to linger in doctor’s offices, you understand. Yes, schedule it. And try to keep it brief. If you would be so kind. I do apologize for my… nervousness. It’s just… not something one anticipates at my age. A rather undignified affair, if I may be so blunt. Yes, schedule it. And please, be quick. If you would be so kind. I do apologize for my… nervousness. It’s just… not something one anticipates at my age. A rather undignified affair, if I may be so blunt. Is there anything else? Anything at all? I'm afraid I'm rather anxious to get home now. Yes, anything else?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Krok, that’s all for today. I've scheduled your follow-up appointment for August 9th at 10:00 AM. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed – the prescription, the instructions, and the follow-up appointment date. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. I understand this wasn't a pleasant experience, but you did the right thing by coming in. We'll get this sorted out. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable before you leave?
PATIENT: No, no. That’s quite alright. I appreciate your… efficiency, Doctor. And your… gentle demeanor. It was… less unpleasant than I anticipated. Though I must confess, I’m rather anxious to get home now. To my wife. She'll want to hear all about it. Yes, I'm rather anxious to get home. To my wife. She handles all these things, you understand. The medication, the appointments, the… everything. Yes, I'm rather anxious to get home. Thank you, Doctor. That will be all. I believe I’m quite capable of finding my way out. Yes, thank you, Doctor. That will be all. I believe I’m quite capable of finding my way out. Good day, Doctor. And thank you again. For your… efficiency. And your… gentle demeanor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and I’ll see you next week. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before then. Have a good day, and give your wife my best.
