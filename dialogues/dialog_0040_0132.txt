DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Heat intolerance, you say? Honestly, it's about time someone asked. It's just...well, it's the heat. Always has been a bother, really. Even as a young man climbing in the Himalayas, the sun was too much. Now, at my age...it's just ridiculous. I can't even spend five minutes outside without feeling like I'm going to melt. And it's not like I'm doing anything strenuous! Just...being. It's a nuisance, pure and simple.
DOCTOR: Right. "A nuisance." Well, these things usually have a reason, even if it feels simple. When did you first start noticing this… increased sensitivity?
PATIENT: Increased sensitivity… Hmph. That's a fancy way of putting it. Let me think… It's been gradual, you see. Not a sudden thing. Probably… oh, I’d say around ten years ago, maybe? It started when I took that job remodeling the old church, all that roofing in the blazing sun. That was a particularly hot summer, even for around here. I just figured it was the work, you know? But it never really went away, even when I was doing lighter work indoors. It just…got worse each year. Honestly, I don’t understand why it's taking so long to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Ten years… Alright. And has anything else changed in that time?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean? I’ve gotten older, naturally. A bit slower, a bit creakier. But other than that… Not really. I eat the same food, drink the same tea. I've always been a simple man. I haven’t been sick with anything major, haven’t started any new medicines… I do get a bit tired easier now, but that's just age, isn't it? I don’t see how that's connected to the heat. Are you suggesting I'm imagining things? Because I assure you, this heat is real.
DOCTOR: No one is suggesting you’re imagining things, Mr. Coby. I’m simply trying to get a complete picture. Any weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now there's a question. Hmm. Well, I haven’t exactly been gaining weight, that's for sure. My appetite isn't what it used to be, which is probably just the age thing again. I used to be able to put away a plate of dal bhat like nobody’s business, but these days… maybe a smaller portion. I wouldn’t say I’ve lost a significant amount, but probably a few pounds here and there. It’s hard to keep track, to be honest. I don’t weigh myself religiously, you know? I'm a working man, not a… a scale enthusiast.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any change in how much you sweat?
PATIENT: Sweat? Oh, plenty of sweat. Too much, if you ask me. I mean, a normal amount for someone doing physical work, naturally. But even when I’m just sitting inside, I find myself… glistening. Not constantly, mind you, but more than I used to. It's… unpleasant. Always have to keep a towel handy. And it's not the nice, cooling kind of sweat, either. It’s… sticky. It doesn't help with the heat, that’s for sure. It’s just adds to the misery. Honestly, Doctor, I don't know why I'm even explaining this. It’s obvious! I'm too hot!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Coby. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule a few things out. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Scale? Really? After all this questioning, you want me to weigh myself? I told you, I haven’t been tracking my weight. But fine, if you insist. There. Happy now? I suppose you’ll want my height next? Honestly, it feels like I’m back in school getting measured. A waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, 77 kilograms. And your height is listed as 172 centimeters. Good. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140 over 90… pulse is 88. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Heart sounds normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to feel your thyroid. Thyroid feels… slightly enlarged. Not dramatically, but I’m noting it.
PATIENT: Enlarged? What do you mean, enlarged? Is that bad? My thyroid? Never heard of anyone having trouble with their thyroid. Is that connected to the heat? I don't feel anything different. Is this serious, Doctor? Because I have work to do. I can’t be laid up with some… thyroid problem. What does this mean?
DOCTOR: It could be connected to the heat, Mr. Coby, but it’s not definitive. An enlarged thyroid can cause a number of symptoms, including heat intolerance and increased sweating. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to investigate further. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. It's a simple blood draw. And I’d also like to order a thyroid ultrasound, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. These tests will help us determine if there’s an underlying issue with your thyroid that's causing your symptoms. While we wait for the results, I recommend staying hydrated and avoiding strenuous activity, especially during the hottest part of the day. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ultrasound? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. All this for a little heat intolerance? It sounds expensive, too. I’m on Medicare, you know. I don’t want a bill the size of Mount Everest. I suppose if you think it's necessary... but I still think it's a waste of time and money. And avoiding strenuous activity? That’s hardly an option! I’m a painter and construction worker, Doctor. What am I supposed to do, sit inside all day? I need to earn a living. But fine, I'll get the tests. But if they come back normal, I expect an apology for all this fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. I've put in the orders for the blood tests and ultrasound. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll schedule the ultrasound for you. The results should be back in a few days. I understand your concerns about the cost; we’ll make sure everything is billed correctly to Medicare. In the meantime, try to pace yourself and take frequent breaks. And if your symptoms worsen—if you experience rapid heartbeat, unexplained weight loss, or difficulty breathing—go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Rapid heartbeat? Difficulty breathing? Now you're scaring me! Fine, fine. I’ll be careful. I'll pace myself. I’ll go to the emergency room if I start… collapsing or something. But honestly, I still think this is overkill. But I’ll get the tests done. Just… please hurry. I have work to do, and I don’t want to be sidelined for weeks over a bit of heat. And make sure they don’t charge me a fortune! Is that all?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now. Here’s a paper with the lab order and information about scheduling the ultrasound. Please follow up with your primary care physician once you have the results. And I’ll see you back here in a week, or sooner if you experience any of the symptoms I mentioned. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you, I suppose. A week… Honestly, what a waste of time. And all this fuss over a little heat.
