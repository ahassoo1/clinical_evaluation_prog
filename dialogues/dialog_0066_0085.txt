DOCTOR: Hi Gabbrielle, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, well, it's this… discoloration. It’s on my hands, mostly. It’s quite bothersome, really. Not aesthetically pleasing at all. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it just… hasn’t gone away. I suppose it could be nothing, but one must be careful, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, discoloration on your hands for a few weeks now. I understand it’s concerning to you, and you’re right to get it checked out. Can you describe the discoloration a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a rash, definitely not. It's… uneven. Sort of brownish, in patches. Not a uniform color, which is particularly irritating. It’s most noticeable against my skin tone, naturally. I keep very good skincare habits, so it’s not from neglect, I assure you. It’s not raised or itchy, thankfully. Just… there. And spreading, I think. Though, it's hard to say for sure if I'm just noticing it more.
DOCTOR: Okay, brownish patches, uneven in color, not raised or itchy. And you feel like it might be spreading. You mentioned good skincare habits, which is great. Has anything changed recently with your routine, or have you started using any new products—lotions, soaps, even hand sanitizers?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I’ve been using the same things for years. Absolutely no changes. It’s a very simple routine, really. A gentle cleanser, a good moisturizer with SPF, and occasionally a hand cream at night. All very high-quality brands, of course. I wouldn’t put just anything on my skin. It’s just… baffling. And I haven’t been doing anything different – no new hobbies, no gardening, no… rough work. I mostly just sort through old papers all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes to your routine or recent activities. That helps narrow things down. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discoloration?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, no. Not really. My hands haven’t been… drier than usual, I suppose. A little bit of stiffness in the mornings, but that’s just age, I expect. I haven’t had any pain or swelling. Nothing like that. It’s purely cosmetic, which is frustrating. I mean, I deal with historical documents all day, preserving things – and my hands are falling apart! It feels rather ironic, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does sound a bit ironic, dealing with preservation and having this happen. No pain, no swelling, just some minor morning stiffness and the discoloration. Alright. To get a clearer idea, could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, I have Medicare, as you can see. I’m generally very healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. My husband, bless him, has high blood pressure, but that's hereditary. I had a rather unpleasant bout of the flu a few years back, but I recovered fully. No allergies that I’m aware of, and I haven’t had any surgeries. I take a daily vitamin, of course, and I try to eat a balanced diet, though sometimes it's difficult with the hours I keep. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: That's a good start, thank you. So, generally healthy, husband with high blood pressure, childhood illnesses, no allergies or surgeries, just a daily vitamin. No current medications besides that?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just the vitamin. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take a mild pain reliever, but that’s very rare. I’m not one for taking pills unless absolutely necessary. I prefer natural remedies, really, but this… discoloration isn’t something I can simply will away, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. Can you extend your hands for me, palms up?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Do be gentle, please. My skin is rather sensitive, you know. I've always had delicate hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the brownish patches you mentioned. They are irregular in shape and distribution, primarily on the dorsal surfaces of your hands. The skin feels normal in texture, no thickening or scaling. There's no evidence of inflammation or swelling. Palpation is non-tender. I also notice the skin tone is relatively fair. It doesn't appear to be a rash, eczema, or psoriasis. Given the lack of other symptoms, and your history, there are a few possibilities we should consider. It could be a form of hyperpigmentation, potentially related to sun exposure—even incidental exposure—over time. Or, less commonly, it could be a manifestation of a mild systemic issue.
PATIENT: Hyperpigmentation? But I’m so careful about the sun! I always wear a hat and sunscreen when I’m outside. Though, it’s true I do spend a lot of time near the windows at work… is that enough? A systemic issue? Oh dear. That sounds rather… serious. What sort of systemic issue? I’m not one for worrying unnecessarily, but one must be prepared, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re careful about sun exposure, and even incidental exposure through windows can contribute to pigmentation changes over time. And a systemic issue doesn’t automatically mean something serious, but it’s something we need to rule out. We’re talking about things like mild liver or kidney issues, or even vitamin deficiencies, though those typically present with other symptoms as well. To get a better idea, I’d like to order a basic blood panel. It’ll check your liver function, kidney function, vitamin levels, and a complete blood count. It’s a routine test, and should give us a clearer picture. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: A blood panel… no, I suppose not. It’s better to be safe than sorry, as they say. Though, I do hate needles. But if it’s necessary… yes, alright. Will it require a lot of blood? And when will I get the results? I have a rather important cataloging project I’m working on, and I’d prefer not to have it disrupted for too long.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard blood draw, so just a few vials—nothing excessive. And it shouldn’t take long at all. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so the results should be back within 24-48 hours. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I’d also recommend continuing your skincare routine, and being especially diligent about sun protection. We can also discuss some topical creams that might help lighten the discoloration, but I’d like to see the bloodwork results first, to make sure there’s no underlying cause that needs to be addressed. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Continue my routine and diligent sun protection… of course. I wouldn’t dream of neglecting that. And the topical creams… yes, let’s see the results first. I don’t want to mask anything, only treat it. Very well. When do we draw the blood? I suppose I should cancel my afternoon appointment…
DOCTOR: Great. We can draw the blood right away. There’s a phlebotomist just down the hall. It shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes. And don’t worry about canceling your appointment just yet. We’ll get the bloodwork done, and I’ll give you a call with the results. Let me print out a lab requisition form for you, and I’ll let the phlebotomist know you’re coming.
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Condray. That’s very kind of you. I appreciate you taking the time to look at this. It's reassuring to have a professional opinion, you know? Please let me know if there’s anything else I should do in the meantime. And I do hope the results are nothing serious…
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gabbrielle. That’s what I’m here for. And I understand your concern, we’ll get to the bottom of this. For now, just try not to worry too much. If you have any questions or concerns before I call, don't hesitate to call the clinic. The nurse can always help. And please, just go down the hall to the lab, and they'll take good care of you. Let’s see what the results tell us.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Dr. Condray. I appreciate your kindness. I shall go to the lab now. I will call if I have any questions.
