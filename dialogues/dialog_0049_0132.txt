DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s this heat, really. Can’t stand it anymore. Never used to bother me, but this summer… it’s something else. Makes me feel quite weak, to be honest. I’ve always been a strong man, worked hard my whole life, you see. Construction, painting… but this heat just… takes it out of you.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Weakness… and you attribute that to the heat?
PATIENT: Well, what else would it be? I’m not a young man anymore, mind you, but I keep myself busy. Always have. This isn’t like normal tiredness. It's… draining. Like someone’s siphoning the energy right out of me. And I sweat like a… well, you wouldn't believe it. More than usual, definitely. It's quite embarrassing, actually. I always prided myself on being a… a stoic man. Not one to complain or fuss. But this is different.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started properly, I’d say, around the beginning of July. Maybe a little before. It was gradual, at first. Just felt a bit more tired than usual after a day’s work. But it's gotten worse steadily. Now, even just walking to the shops feels like a real effort. And I haven’t been sleeping well either. Tossin’ and turnin’… just can’t get comfortable. It’s been a miserable few weeks, truthfully. I'm not one for complaining, as I said, but it’s starting to interfere with things.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fatigue and difficulty sleeping, starting in early July, worsening steadily. And you mentioned excessive sweating. Any fever, chills, or body aches accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my muscles aren’t achin’ or nothin’. Just… weak. Like I said, it's not like the usual tiredness after a long day. It’s a different kind of weak. And it doesn’t go away with rest. I used to be able to bounce back, you know? Now… I just feel worn down, all the time. I’ve always been healthy, never had much trouble with sickness. Good strong Nepalese blood, I always say. But this… it’s worryin’ me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Hmm. Appetite… not really. I eat about the same as always. I like a good meal, always have. Dal bhat, you know? Keeps a man strong. As for weight… I haven’t been weighing myself, to be honest. Never really saw the point. But my trousers might be a little looser. Or maybe I’m just imagining things. I do tend to lose weight in the summer, it's always been that way. But I wouldn't say it's significant. Not like I'm wasting away or anything. It's probably just the heat playing tricks on me.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant weight loss, appetite unchanged. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. Never had a problem with my heart, thankfully. Blood pressure… the doctor checked it a few years back at the clinic, said it was fine. Bit high, maybe, but nothing to worry about, he said. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. Worked hard all my life, out in the sun, buildin’ things. Good, honest work. I don’t smoke, never have. And I only drink a little, maybe a small glass of beer with my dinner sometimes. A treat, you see. I’ve always taken care of myself. This heat… it’s just thrown me for a loop. I really don't understand it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No chronic conditions, no smoking, minimal alcohol. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. Never needed one, thankfully. And I’ve never been in the hospital, not once. A few bumps and bruises over the years from work, you see, but nothing serious. Just patched myself up and got back to it. I’m a practical man, I don’t fuss over little things. Always believed in keepin’ yourself going. It's just... this is different. It’s not a bump or a bruise. It’s… a draining weakness. A fella can’t work when he feels like this. And I like to work, you see. It keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Okay. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my father… he had a bit of trouble with his heart in his later years. Not sure what exactly, it was a long time ago and we didn’t have doctors like we do now. He lived to a good age though, nearly eighty. My mother… she was always healthy, strong woman. Lived in the mountains, you see, hardy stock. As for cancer… not that I know of. Nobody talked much about sickness back then. We just kept ourselves busy, worked hard. It wasn’t a thing to dwell on. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure what's going on. I've never felt like this before. And it's a worry, you see. A man likes to be independent. Doesn't like to feel weak.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of heart disease on the father’s side. Now, just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Never been one for pills. Always believed in letting the body heal itself. A bit of rest, a good meal, that's all I've ever needed. I might take a painkiller now and then for a bad back after a long day’s work, but that’s about it. Nothing regular. I don't trust those medications, to be honest. Too many side effects, you see. I prefer the natural way of things. Let the body do its work. This heat… I really think it's just the heat. It's unusually strong this year. Never felt anything like it before. It’s thrown everything off, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay. No medications. Alright, Mr. Coby, I’m going to do a quick physical exam now. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at you generally. It'll just take a few minutes. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I suppose a quick look can’t hurt. Though I’m tellin’ you, it's probably just the heat. Still, I’ll do as you say. Be careful now, my bones aren’t as young as they used to be. Always been a strong man, you see, but time takes its toll on everyone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Hmm… 150/90. A little elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit distant. Lungs are clear, but breathing is slightly labored. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let me just check your pulse… Pulse is a little weak, but regular. Any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. Not that I've noticed, anyway. I haven't really been lookin', to be honest. I've been too busy feelin' weak to worry about my ankles. But no, I don’t think so. They feel normal. Always been on my feet, you see, workin’. Strong legs, they are. Or were. This heat… it's gettin' me down, I tell you. Makin' everything feel… sluggish. It's not like the normal tiredness after a long day. It's different. Deeper. Are you sure it's not just the heat?
DOCTOR: Alright. No swelling in ankles. Mr. Coby, while the heat certainly isn't helping, your blood pressure is elevated, and your pulse is a bit weak. Your breathing is also slightly labored. Given your symptoms – fatigue, weakness, difficulty sleeping, and these physical findings – I don’t think it’s just the heat. We need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I want to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG. The blood tests will check for things like anemia, infection, and kidney problems. The EKG will check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Hmph. I don’t like the sound of tests, Doctor. Always somethin' wrong when they start stickin' needles in you. I've always been a healthy man, as I've said. Never needed tests before. But… I suppose if you think it's necessary. It's just… I don’t trust those things. They always find somethin', even when nothin' is wrong. Still, I don't want to be a bother. If you really think it’s best… then alright. Do what you have to do. But I'm tellin’ you, it’s probably just the heat. Unusually strong this year, it is. Where will I have these tests done? And how long will it take? I have work to do, you see. Can't be layin' about all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Coby. We’ll take it one step at a time. The tests are just to rule things out and get a clearer picture. We'll do the blood work right here in the clinic. It'll take about 15-20 minutes, and then we'll send it off to the lab. The EKG will only take a few minutes, we can do that right after the blood work. It's a simple, painless test. You can sit there while we get everything prepared. I’ll explain everything as we go along. And, frankly, given your symptoms and findings, I think it's best to be thorough. It's better to know what we're dealing with, even if it turns out to be nothing serious. We’ll take care of you, Mr. Coby. First, let’s get the blood work done.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. Do what you have to do. But don't keep me waiting too long, you hear? I have a schedule to keep. Gentle now, I have strong veins, but I don’t like needles. Always been a practical man, not one for fussin', but… needles. It’s just… not pleasant. Get it over with quickly, please. And tell me what you're doing, I like to know what's goin' on. Don’t want any surprises. This heat… it's makin' me nervous, you see. Everything feels… off.
DOCTOR: “Just a routine blood draw, please. Mr. Coby is a little anxious about needles.” “The phlebotomist is going to draw a small amount of blood from your arm. It'll sting for a moment, but it shouldn’t be painful. She’ll use a sterile needle and bandage the area afterward. It's just a precaution, Mr. Coby. We’ll get the results back within a few days, and then we’ll discuss them. We'll also do the EKG after this. Just some stickers and a quick recording of your heart's electrical activity.” “Try to relax, Mr. Coby. It’ll be over before you know it. And I'll explain everything as we go. You've always been a strong man, and you’re doing the right thing by getting this checked out.”
