DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day. I woke up this morning and…well, I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face feels…droopy, on that same side. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I’m a radiologist, you know. I need to hear things. And looking presentable is rather important.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That is concerning, especially given your profession. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping – those are symptoms we need to take seriously. Just to be clear, it happened this morning, after you woke up?
PATIENT: Yes, this morning. Woke up, went to get coffee, and…nothing on the left side. It wasn’t gradual. It just was. And yes, I understand it's "serious." I read things. I know when something isn't right. Though frankly, I’m not sure what you can even do about it.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned and to recognize something isn’t right. And it’s good you’re aware of the potential seriousness. It sounds like a very sudden onset, which is important information. I see here you’re 59 years old. Do you have any past medical history I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, or anything else?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Honestly, not much. I was a very healthy woman. My husband…he had some things, but I took care of him. I don’t really…get sick. Widowed, as you can see on the paperwork. It was a few years ago now. No diabetes, no high blood pressure. Perfectly fine, until this. And no, I don’t have insurance. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. And it’s wonderful that you’ve been so healthy. No, your lack of insurance isn’t a problem right now. Our priority is to figure out what’s going on and get you the care you need. We can discuss options later, but let's focus on that first. Have you had any recent surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed them. And I haven't been in a hospital since…well, when my husband was sick, of course. But that was years ago. Honestly, this whole situation is rather…irritating. I have appointments to get to. People relying on me. I don’t have time for…mysteries. Can we just fix it? What do you think it is? Is it something dreadful?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I wish we could just immediately “fix” it. I truly do. It’s completely reasonable to want answers and to get back to your life. Given your symptoms – the sudden hearing loss and facial drooping on one side – the biggest concern is something called Bell’s palsy, or possibly a stroke. We absolutely need to rule out a stroke first. It’s vital to determine what’s causing this, and that requires a careful examination and potentially some imaging. I'm going to do a quick neurological exam – just some simple tests to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation. Then, I’d like to get you over to radiology for a CT scan of your brain, if possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, I'm a radiologist. I know what those things look like. And I'm sure it's not a stroke. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. No headache, no dizziness, no weakness in my arms or legs. Just…this. Look, if it’s going to take hours, I’m not sure I can stay. I have things…important things…to do. Can't you just…give me something for it? Some sort of steroid, perhaps? I've read about those being effective for Bell's palsy. Is that an option? Let’s try that first.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Nissenbaum, especially given your expertise. And I appreciate you sharing your thoughts. However, even with your knowledge of radiology, it’s crucial to follow established protocols to ensure we don’t miss anything. A stroke can present in subtle ways, and a CT scan is the quickest way to rule it out definitively. It's for your safety. You are right that steroids can be effective for Bell’s palsy, if that’s what we determine is causing your symptoms. But starting treatment before knowing the cause could be detrimental if it turns out to be something else. Let's compromise. I will perform a focused neurological exam right now. It will be quick, and will give me a better understanding of your situation. If everything looks very reassuring, and you remain stable, we can discuss observation and potentially starting steroids as an outpatient. But if anything concerning arises during the exam, we need that CT scan immediately. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. A quick exam. But if it’s going to involve poking and prodding for an extended period, I’m walking out. I have a very important meeting this afternoon, and I simply don’t have time for…fooling around. And I expect a clear explanation of everything you're doing, and why. Don't treat me like a simpleton, Doctor. I know my own body.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Nissenbaum. A quick, focused exam, with a clear explanation of each step. I completely understand your concerns and will not treat you like anything less than the knowledgeable patient you are. First, I’m going to check your facial movements – I'll ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and close your eyes tightly. Then, I’ll test your hearing in both ears with this tuning fork. After that, I’ll briefly check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. It should only take a few minutes. Alright, let’s start with your facial movements. Can you smile for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It’s…difficult. As you can see, it's not exactly symmetrical. And it feels rather strange. Don't take too long with this, Doctor. I assure you, it's as obvious as it gets. I’m a radiologist. I notice things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that, Ms. Nissenbaum. Thank you for pointing that out. It is quite noticeable. Now, I’m going to test your hearing. Just let me know when you can no longer hear the sound. First, with this tuning fork on your forehead…do you hear the tone?
PATIENT: Yes, I hear it. Faintly, but I hear it. Though, naturally, it’s much quieter on the left side. Honestly, this is rather pointless, isn't it? I already told you I can’t hear out of that ear. Are you just trying to waste my time? I have a very busy schedule, Doctor. Perhaps we can skip to the part where you prescribe something?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum. And you are right to point out that you've already described your hearing loss. However, it’s important for me to document everything objectively, and to rule out any other contributing factors. This is part of the standard medical process. Just for completeness, let’s test the other ear. Can you tell me if you hear the tone as clearly as you did before?
PATIENT: Yes, perfectly clear on this side. As expected. Look, I appreciate your…thoroughness, Doctor. But honestly, this is getting us nowhere. I'm a radiologist. I know what's happening. It's Bell's palsy, or something equally benign. Can we please move on to treatment? I'm starting to feel a headache coming on from all of this…testing. And if I don’t get back to work soon, people are going to start relying on me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. I respect your expertise and your assessment of the situation. Given your profession, and the clear asymmetry with your facial movements and hearing loss, and the absence of any other neurological deficits during the brief exam, I am willing to proceed with a trial of oral steroids, under close observation. I will prescribe a 10-day course of Prednisone, starting today. It’s important to complete the full course, even if you start to feel better. We will also discuss potential side effects, and I want you to contact me immediately if you experience any concerning symptoms – like fever, severe headache, or worsening weakness. Here is information about Prednisone, including the dosage instructions and potential side effects. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Finally. Good. That's what I wanted. I'll take it. Is there anything else? I really must get going. I have a very important meeting this afternoon, and frankly, I'm losing valuable time. And I expect this to work, Doctor. I don't have time for multiple trips to the clinic. No, I don't think so. I've read enough about steroids in my time. Just…let me get this prescription and be on my way. Thank you, Doctor. Though, honestly, I could have probably diagnosed myself faster. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your urgency. Here is your prescription. Please contact my office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. I will make a note to follow up with you in a week to assess your progress. I wish you all the best, and a speedy recovery. Please prioritize rest and try to avoid any stress. Have a good day.
