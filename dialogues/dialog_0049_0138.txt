DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit hard to explain, to be honest. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. There's been a bit of that in the family, you see. Not me so much, but my brother… Oh dear, what was his name again? It’s on the tip of my tongue. Anyway, it’s been bothering my daughter, she’s a worrier, that girl.
DOCTOR: Weakness and headaches… right. And your daughter brought you in because of her concern. Can you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it's not… constant, you understand? It comes and goes. Like a little… a little slip, sometimes. On one side, I think. It’s hard to say which side. My left? Or maybe my right? Oh, it’s silly, I can’t remember. It doesn’t happen often, thankfully. Just enough to make me a little unsteady, you know? I just hold onto things, and it passes. It’s been happening… oh, for a while now. Months, I suppose. Not every day, certainly not. More like… when I’m tired, maybe? Or stressed? But honestly, Doctor, everything makes me a little stressed these days.
DOCTOR: Intermittent weakness, more noticeable with fatigue or stress… and you're unsure which side it affects. And the headaches?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. The headaches… well, they’re not like a terrible, pounding thing. More of a… a dull ache, really. Behind my eyes, mostly. They come and go, too. And like the weakness, they seem worse when I’m tired. My mother used to get them something fierce, always complaining about them. She said it was the humidity. I don't know if that had anything to do with it. She took a lot of… what were those little pills she used to take? I can’t seem to recall. It's just all a bit fuzzy these days, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for memory to change as we get older. We'll take our time. So, dull ache behind the eyes, intermittent like the weakness… Have you noticed anything that relieves the headaches, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Relieves them? Hmm… Well, lying down helps, I think. A nice, dark room, and just… resting. And my daughter makes me a lovely chamomile tea, sometimes. That seems to calm me down, which probably helps with the ache. But nothing really gets rid of it completely, you know? It just… fades. And sometimes, they just go away on their own. I don't really take anything for them. I used to take aspirin for everything, but my daughter said I shouldn’t, that it wasn't good for my stomach. She worries so.
DOCTOR: Alright. Chamomile tea and rest provide some relief. No medications currently. Now, let’s talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you’re asking things I really can’t remember! I’ve been to doctors over the years, of course, but… what did they say? I think… I think they told me my blood pressure was a little high once, a long time ago. But I don't recall taking anything for it. And my knees, oh my knees! They ache terribly in the cold weather. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? Arthritis, maybe? My sister had that. It runs in the family, everything does. Honestly, Doctor, I’m probably not very helpful with this part. It was so long ago, and I just… don’t remember the details.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible history of elevated blood pressure, knee pain suggestive of arthritis. We can try to access your records if you’re comfortable with that. It might help to clarify things. Do you know where you’ve received medical care previously?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good idea, Doctor! Yes, please do! I used to go to… Dr. Bellini, I think. He was a lovely man, down on Elm Street. But he retired years ago. After that… oh, goodness. I went to a few different places. There was a clinic over near the supermarket for a while. And then… My daughter usually takes care of all that now. She knows all the doctors and the insurance things. I just… go when she tells me to. I can't really remember the names of the other places. Perhaps if you talk to her, she can fill in the blanks. She has a very good memory, that girl.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll see what we can find regarding Dr. Bellini and any other records available. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries? Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. And I had a… a little procedure on my eye once, to fix my cataract. That was a few years back. Nothing major, thankfully. And I was in the hospital once, when I broke my wrist falling on the ice. But that was… oh, goodness, probably thirty years ago? Everything is just a blur these days, Doctor. I apologize. It's not that I'm trying to be difficult, it’s just… my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child, cataract surgery, broken wrist… Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. My daughter makes sure I take it every morning. And I used to take something for my cholesterol, but I think the doctor took me off of that. Or maybe I stopped taking it myself… I honestly can’t remember. And that's about it, I believe. Just the blood pressure pill, and maybe something for my knees when they're really bothering me. But that’s just an over-the-counter thing, like ibuprofen. Nothing serious, Doctor. I’m not a big believer in taking a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, occasional ibuprofen. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of, dear. I’ve never really had any trouble with allergies. I eat just about everything. My daughter is always telling me to watch my salt intake, but… well, I like my food! No, I don’t believe I have any allergies, thankfully. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, at least not that I remember. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose in the spring, but that’s just the pollen, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. Thank you for that information. Now, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I may be a bit unsteady on my feet, so if you need me to sit down, just tell me.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please, have a seat here. Heart sounds… regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Balance is slightly diminished, but stable with assistance. Coordination is slightly impaired on the left side. Neurological assessment reveals mild incoordination on the left side. Overall, your strength appears normal, but there is some mild difficulty with coordination. I will note that in your chart.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Mild difficulty, you say? That doesn't sound very good, does it? Is it… serious, Doctor? I knew something wasn't quite right. Sometimes I feel a little clumsy, like I'm going to stumble. I just thought it was old age. My daughter always says I need to be more careful. Is it something I should worry about?
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively, Ms. Tofani. Mild incoordination can be caused by a number of things, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem. However, given your history of intermittent weakness and headaches, and the mild incoordination I observed during the exam, I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. I recommend a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an MRI of the brain. The MRI will allow us to evaluate your brain structure and identify any potential issues.
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh my. That sounds… rather serious, doesn’t it? Is it painful, Doctor? And what exactly are you looking for? I don’t want to go poking around in my brain if it’s not absolutely necessary. My daughter will be very worried if she hears about this. She gets so anxious over everything. Is there… is there anything else we can do? Perhaps just monitor things for a while?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Tofani. An MRI is a non-invasive procedure, meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or incisions. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It's not painful, although you will need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. The purpose of the MRI is to rule out any structural abnormalities, such as a stroke, tumor, or multiple sclerosis. Given your symptoms, it's the most appropriate next step to ensure an accurate diagnosis. While monitoring your symptoms could be considered, it would be difficult to assess the underlying cause without imaging. Delaying diagnosis could potentially worsen the condition if something serious is present. I will, of course, discuss the results with you in detail and explain all of your options before proceeding with any further treatment. And I’ll be happy to answer any questions you or your daughter may have.
PATIENT: Well, I suppose if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. But please, tell me everything. I don’t want any surprises. And my daughter… you’ll call her, won’t you? She’ll want to know everything, too. She's a good girl, very responsible. She'll want to be there when we talk about the results. When can we schedule the MRI? And is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Tofani. I will explain everything to you in detail, and I will certainly call your daughter to discuss the results with both of you. Regarding the MRI, I will have my assistant schedule it for you as soon as possible. Typically, you can eat and drink normally beforehand. However, you will need to remove any metal objects, such as jewelry or dentures, before the procedure. You will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire to ensure there are no contraindications, such as a pacemaker or other metallic implants. I'm scheduling the MRI for next week, Tuesday at 10 AM. My assistant will call you to confirm the appointment and provide any additional instructions. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headache, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please contact my office immediately. We will discuss the results of the MRI at our next appointment, and we will develop a treatment plan based on your individual needs. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you. I appreciate your patience with me. My memory isn’t what it used to be, and I worry so much. Please, just call my daughter. She’ll know what to do. And… I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Tofani. I understand your concerns, and I will certainly call your daughter to discuss the results with both of you. And we will take things one step at a time. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, Ms. Tofani. And please, try not to worry too much.
