DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. Everywhere, pretty much. Been going on for a couple weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit crazy, to be honest. Not a sharp itch, just…constant. It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: I see. Constant itching for the past two weeks. That certainly sounds frustrating, Mr. Ferneding. To help me understand what might be causing this, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… well, it doesn't really seem to matter what I’m wearing. Cotton, wool, doesn't make a difference. And it's not just one spot, like, it’s my arms, my legs, my back…even my scalp sometimes. I haven’t changed anything recently – no new soaps, lotions, detergents, nothing like that. I did go for a walk in the woods about a month ago, maybe five weeks ago, but I didn’t notice anything then. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed information, Mr. Ferneding. No changes in soaps or detergents, and it's widespread. The walk in the woods is potentially relevant, yes. We’ll certainly consider that. To clarify, when you say it doesn’t seem to matter what you’re wearing, is there anything that provides even temporary relief?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Well, a cool shower helps for maybe fifteen, twenty minutes. And sometimes, if I really distract myself, like watching a good movie, I don’t notice it as much. But it always comes back. There's no real getting rid of it, just…managing it, I guess. And cream doesn’t do a thing. Tried some over-the-counter stuff, the kind for eczema and bug bites, but no luck.
DOCTOR: I understand. Temporary relief with a cool shower and distraction, but no lasting improvement with over-the-counter creams. That gives us some helpful information. Mr. Ferneding, could you describe the skin itself?
PATIENT: Sure. It looks… normal, mostly. Not red, not bumpy, no blisters or anything like that. Just…skin. Maybe a little dry in places, but I’ve always had dry skin, especially in the winter. It’s not like a rash, you know? Just…itchy normal skin. It's very strange. I’ve been looking at it constantly, trying to find something obvious, but there’s just nothing there.
DOCTOR: “Itchy normal skin,” you say. That is indeed puzzling. Alright, Mr. Ferneding, let’s move on to some other questions to help narrow down the possibilities. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the itch?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever, no weight loss. I haven’t noticed any fatigue, and my appetite is fine. No changes in my bowel movements or anything like that either. I sleep okay, although sometimes the itching keeps me up a little. But that's probably just…the itching, you know? And I haven't noticed any swollen glands or anything. I feel generally fine, apart from…well, this. It’s just the itch, really. A really annoying itch.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Ferneding. No systemic symptoms like fever, weight loss, or fatigue. Just the persistent itch. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been well-controlled with medication for about ten years now. Here’s my Medicare card, in case you need it. And, um… my wife, God rest her soul, passed away three years ago. That was a hard time, but I’m doing okay now. As far as allergies go, I don’t really have any that I know of. No trouble with food or medications. And I don't smoke, and I only drink occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Ferneding. I appreciate you sharing that information. Appendix removal as a child, well-controlled hypertension for ten years, no known allergies, and occasional alcohol use. I’ve noted everything. Let’s briefly discuss your current medications. What are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: I’m taking… let me see. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And that's it. Just the Lisinopril. I've been on it for years, as I said, and it works fine. My doctor keeps an eye on it, regular checkups and all that. I always make sure to have it refilled on time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension. Now, regarding your family history, are there any skin conditions, or any history of allergies or itching in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother had some eczema when she was a child, I think, but it wasn't too bad. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, always had sensitive skin. But no one that I know of ever had really bad itching, like this. Or any kind of serious allergies, really. My wife's family… I didn’t know them too well, to be honest. She was an only child, and her parents are both gone now. So, not much help there, I’m afraid. It’s probably just me. I have a feeling it's something…weird.
DOCTOR: I understand. History of eczema in your mother and sensitive skin in your grandmother, but no significant history of chronic itching or allergies in the family. Alright, Mr. Ferneding, now I would like to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to take a closer look at your skin, particularly where you're experiencing the most itching. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I figured you’d want to take a look. It's just…hard to believe there's anything to see, honestly. But I'm happy to let you take a look. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Ferneding. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. And again… Excellent. Everything sounds clear. Now, let’s examine your skin. I’ll start with your arms. As you mentioned, there's no visible rash, no lesions, and minimal excoriations. The skin appears generally normal in color and texture. Scalp examination is also unremarkable. I do note some very subtle dryness on your lower back, but it's not significant. I'm also noting a normal capillary refill in your extremities. Heart rate is 72 and blood pressure is 130/80. I do not detect any lymphadenopathy.
PATIENT: So… nothing? That’s what I figured. It’s just… frustrating. It’s like my skin is just…itchy. No reason, no visible sign. It’s driving me crazy, Doctor. What do you think it could be? Is it something serious? I keep thinking it's something I picked up in the woods, maybe some kind of bug bite that just isn’t showing. Or maybe it’s just…old age?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Ferneding. It is perplexing when the physical exam is unremarkable. Based on your history and the exam findings, several possibilities come to mind. It's unlikely to be an acute infection or a typical allergic reaction, given the duration and lack of visible rash. Given your mention of the walk in the woods, a subtle insect exposure, even if not immediately apparent, is possible, though less likely after this length of time. We also have to consider systemic causes, though your lack of other symptoms makes that less probable. Another possibility is a condition called pruritus, which is simply unexplained itching. Sometimes this can be associated with underlying medical conditions, but often the cause remains unknown. It could also be a neuropathic itch, where a nerve is sending incorrect signals. To investigate further, I would like to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid levels. These tests will help us rule out some potential underlying causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds…thorough. Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and not just brushing it off as…old age. The blood work sounds good. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back for another appointment? Is there anything I can do in the meantime, apart from trying not to scratch? I’ve been using lotion, but it doesn’t really help. Maybe I should try a different kind?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad you feel comfortable with that plan. The blood work should take approximately 3-5 business days to come back. We will schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, continuing to moisturize is a good idea, even if it doesn't provide significant relief. You can try a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic lotion. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents. Cool compresses can help soothe the itch temporarily, as you've already discovered. And try to minimize any potential irritants, like wool or tight-fitting clothing. While we await the results, I’m going to prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid cream to help manage the itching. It’s a low-potency cream, and we'll use it sparingly, only applying it to the areas that are most affected. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of before I write the prescription?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I haven’t had any trouble with medications before, as I said. Topical cream sounds good. Anything to help. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate it. Three to five days… I can wait. I’ll try the cream and the lotion, and avoid anything irritating. Hopefully, the blood work will give us some answers. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any special signs to look for? Anything that would warrant a call sooner than the follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known medication allergies. Regarding signs to watch for, please contact the office immediately if you develop a fever, notice any swelling or redness, or experience any other new or worsening symptoms. If you develop any blisters or open sores, or if the itching becomes unbearable and interferes with your sleep or daily activities, please call us right away. Otherwise, we will await the blood work results and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I will write you a prescription for the topical corticosteroid cream now. Do you have a preferred pharmacy?
PATIENT: Yes, I use CVS, on Main Street. It's just around the corner. They’re pretty good over there. They know me, and they’re always helpful. And thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little better just having a plan, to be honest. I’ve been getting so frustrated, trying to figure this out on my own. I’ll keep an eye on things, and I’ll call if anything changes. I really appreciate your patience and thoroughness. .
