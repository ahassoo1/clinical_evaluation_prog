DOCTOR: Right. Kerriann Purtee, 49 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I've noticed a change in… how I smell, my body odor. It's different than usual, and I can’t quite place it. It’s not bad, exactly, just… not me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A change in body odor. Okay. And how long have you noticed this change?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started maybe three or four weeks ago? It wasn't sudden, it was gradual, so it's hard to pinpoint the exact day. I noticed it mostly after I’ve been working, you know, after a long day on the job.
DOCTOR: Three to four weeks, noticeable after work. And what is your work?
PATIENT: I lay floors. Not carpet, or wood, or tile, the other kinds. Like, vinyl, linoleum, that sort of thing. It’s pretty physical work, lots of bending and moving. It can get warm, too, especially in some of the older buildings.
DOCTOR: Physical labor, potentially warm environments. Alright. Any fever, chills, night sweats accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, none of that. No fever, no chills, and I sleep pretty soundly, haven't woken up sweaty at all. Just the smell. It's…hard to describe. Not like a typical sweat smell, more…musky, maybe? I don’t know. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Musky. Okay. And have you changed anything recently?
PATIENT: Changed anything? Let me think… Not really. Same soap, same deodorant. I haven’t started any new medications or anything like that. My diet’s been pretty much the same too – I usually pack a lunch for work, mostly sandwiches and fruit. Oh! Except… my divorce was finalized about six months ago. Does…stress have anything to do with it?
DOCTOR: Divorce finalized six months ago. Stress can certainly contribute to changes in body odor. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I've been a little tired lately, but honestly, who isn't? Work is tiring. And, you know, the divorce was hard. But no rashes, no new moles, no pain anywhere, nothing like that. Just the smell and feeling a bit worn out. Is it possible it’s just… me adjusting to things?
DOCTOR: It could be stress-related. However, it’s important to be thorough. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Here we go.
DOCTOR: 134 pounds. Height is 164 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. 164 centimeters. So, what are you looking for exactly? I'm not usually one to worry about smells, but this is just…different, and I figured it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I'm checking for any skin changes, unusual growths, or signs of infection. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Anything unusual there?
PATIENT: No, nothing feels unusual. My chest feels normal, I haven’t been coughing or short of breath. I do have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I guess. It doesn’t really affect my breathing or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. A little tender, maybe, but nothing I’d call painful. I do sometimes feel a little…swollen in my armpits after a long day at work, but I always thought that was just from all the bending and lifting.
DOCTOR: I see no obvious rashes or lesions. Alright. Let's just check your thyroid. Anything uncomfortable?
PATIENT: No, that's okay. It doesn't hurt. I haven't noticed anything different about my neck or throat, no swelling or pain. I do sometimes get a little bit of a dry throat, especially in the winter, but that's just the heating, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything seems…within normal limits. Given your history and the exam findings, it’s possible this is stress-related. However, a change in body odor can sometimes indicate an underlying medical condition. I'm going to order some basic blood work just to rule out anything serious. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Better to be safe than sorry, right? Blood work sounds good. I appreciate you being thorough. Will I need a referral or anything? And where do I get it done?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It's always best to be cautious. I'm sending the order to the lab at St. Luke's, it’s just down the street, 142 Main Street. They take most insurance plans, but you might want to confirm with them beforehand. Medicare should be accepted, but it’s always good to double-check. I'll also put in a note for you to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks, once the results are back. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all sounds very clear. St. Luke's, Medicare, follow-up in two weeks. Thank you, Dr. Memmolo. I appreciate your time and attention to this. It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I feel much better having it checked out.
DOCTOR: Very well. You're welcome. The nurse will give you the lab requisition and instructions on fasting requirements, if any. Don't hesitate to call if you experience any new symptoms. Now, I have other patients waiting. Thank you. .
