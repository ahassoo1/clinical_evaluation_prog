DOCTOR: Bonjour, Mr. Murph. Welcome. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Oh! Right, right. It's about… the team. My grandson, he’s tryin' out for somethin’. A sports team, you know? They need a check-up first. That's why I'm here. For the check-up. It's for him, though, not me! I just gotta make sure he’s okay to play.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. A sports physical for your grandson. Excellent. And how old is your grandson, Mr. Murph?
PATIENT: Let me think now… He’s… seventeen, I think? Or maybe eighteen? He just graduated high school. Yes, that's it! Just graduated. So, seventeen or eighteen. Around that age, anyway. Time flies, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, seventeen or eighteen. And what sport is he trying out for, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that's a good question. It's with a ball… a round ball. He likes to run a lot. Oh! It’s basketball! Yes, basketball. He’s always liked basketball. A very good player, that boy. Always practicing.
DOCTOR: Okay, basketball. Wonderful. And has he had any issues with injuries in the past, while playing?
PATIENT: Injuries… You know, I think he twisted his ankle once. A long time ago, though. When he was… younger, maybe ten or eleven? It didn’t seem too bad, he was back playin’ pretty quick. I don’t remember anythin’ serious. Nothing that kept him off the court for long, anyway. Is that what you’re askin’ about? Serious injuries?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking about, Mr. Murph. Any history of concussions, broken bones, or anything that required a doctor's visit?
PATIENT: Hmm... Broken bones… no, I don’t think so. Concussions… that’s a big word. He’s bumped his head a few times, playin’ rough, you know? But I don’t remember ever takin’ him to the doctor for a head injury. He’s a tough boy. He usually just shakes it off. But… I’m not a doctor, you know? I couldn’t really say for sure. Maybe he had a small one and I just didn’t realize? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly understandable. We can certainly look into that further during the physical exam. Has he ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like asthma, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… asthma… no, he doesn’t cough much. Never had any trouble breathin’ that I know of. Diabetes… his mother, she worries about that sometimes, you know? But he's a healthy weight. Always runnin’ around. I don’t think he has that either. Heart problems… no. No, his heart seems strong. He’s always been very active. I really don’t know of anythin’ wrong with him, Doctor. He’s a good boy. A very good boy.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to hear. And is he currently taking any medications, or has he had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not that I know of. He doesn’t seem to take nothin’ regularly. Maybe for a headache sometimes, but that's it. Just over-the-counter stuff, I think. Surgeries… hmm. No, I don’t think so. He’s a pretty healthy boy. He’s never had to go to the hospital for anythin’ big. I’m tryin’ to remember, but it’s been a long time. It’s hard to keep track, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Now, just to be thorough, does he have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Oh! Yes, I think he had a little trouble with… bee stings when he was little. He got a little puffy face once. But it wasn't too bad. Just some cream, I think. Food… hmm. No, I don’t think so. He eats everything. A very good appetite, that boy! He loves all kinds of food. Is that all the questions you have, Doctor? My memory isn't what it used to be, you know! I'm doing my best here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Murph, that’s very good information. Thank you for your patience. Let’s move on to a brief physical exam to assess your grandson’s overall health and make sure he's fit to participate in basketball. I’ll need to check his vital signs—height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse—and listen to his heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes! That sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. That’s what I’m here for, right? To make sure he's okay? He's a good boy, that grandson of mine. I want him to be safe. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready. Just let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. First, let me just verify his height and weight in the system… Okay, it has him listed at 168 centimeters and 65 kilograms. Is that approximately correct, Mr. Murph?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds about right, Doctor. He's grown a little bit since high school, I think. But yes, about that. 168… and 65, yes. He's a good size, you know? Not too big, not too small. Just right for basketball. He gets it from his mother’s side, I think.
DOCTOR: Excellent. His blood pressure is 128/78 mmHg, which is within a normal range. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Everything seems to be normal so far, Mr. Murph. Do you have any concerns I should address?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear, Doctor. Really good. No, I don’t think I have any concerns. He seems perfectly healthy to me. A strong boy. He’s always been very active. Maybe... he gets tired easily sometimes, after a long practice. But that’s probably just normal, right? For a young boy playing basketball? He’s a little worried about tryouts, you know. He wants to do well. But other than that, no. Everything seems fine. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Fatigue after prolonged exercise is fairly common, especially during tryouts with increased intensity. However, it's always worth ruling out other potential causes. I'm going to order a complete blood count just to check for any underlying anemia or vitamin deficiencies that could be contributing to the fatigue. It's a simple blood test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A blood test... that doesn't sound too bad. If it helps make sure he's okay, then absolutely. He's a good boy, you know? I just want to make sure he's healthy and strong. Thank you for being so thorough. You're very kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’ll write the order for the blood test now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get it done quickly. Here you go. You can take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of it. Once the results are back—usually within 24-48 hours—we can discuss them and determine if any further action is needed. Based on the physical exam and his medical history, I don’t see any immediate reason why he shouldn't participate in tryouts, but it’s always best to be cautious. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, thank you, Doctor. 24-48 hours... alright. I’ll take it right away. Hmm… I don’t think I have any questions, Doctor. You explained everything so clearly. Just… make sure he’s okay, that’s all I ask. He’s a good boy, you know? He works very hard. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Murph. I understand. We've done what we can to ensure your grandson is healthy and safe. Please call the office if you have any concerns or questions once you receive the lab results. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and best of luck to your grandson at tryouts!
