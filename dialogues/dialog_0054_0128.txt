DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. My name is Dr. Dashevsky, it’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Dashevsky, you said? It's...nice to meet you as well. Let me think… well, my joints. They get so stiff in the mornings. It's a bother, really. Not painful always, just… stuck. It takes a while to get moving. I don't really remember when it started, to be honest. A long time, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in your joints, especially in the mornings. That's a good place to start. When you say "a long time," would you mind giving me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a rough estimate? Hmm. It feels like… maybe a few years? Or more? Everything is a bit blurry these days, you see. It wasn't sudden, it just… gradually got worse. I don't really keep track of things like that, if I'm being honest. Does that make sense? I just know getting out of bed is harder than it used to be.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Lilliana. Many things can develop gradually. A few years is helpful to know. And it’s perfectly alright that you don't keep track – we’ll figure it out together. Now, is this stiffness in all your joints, or are certain areas more affected?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I was worried I wasn't making sense! Um… let me think. It’s mostly my hands, I think. And my knees. My back too, sometimes, but not always. My elbows feel a bit…tight, but not as bad as my hands. It’s hard to say for sure, really. It changes, you know? Some days it's one joint, other days it’s another. It’s never all of them at once, though. Not that I remember, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily hands and knees, with some involvement in your back and occasionally your elbows. It sounds like it fluctuates, which is important to know. Now, when you wake up in the morning, how long does it typically take for the stiffness to ease up?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me see… it takes a while. A good while. I usually shuffle around for… maybe half an hour? Before I feel… less creaky, I suppose. Sometimes longer, if it’s a cold day. I try to do little exercises, you know, wiggle my fingers and move my legs. It helps a little, but it doesn't go away completely right away. It’s just… slow. Everything is slow in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Okay, about half an hour of shuffling and exercises to feel less stiff, and it's worse on colder days. That gives me a better understanding. Now, besides the stiffness, do you experience any pain in these joints?
PATIENT: Hmm… pain… not really pain, exactly. More like a… ache, sometimes. A dull ache. It's not sharp or throbbing. It's more of a… discomfort, I guess. It's not enough to stop me from doing things, but it’s there, in the background. Some days it’s worse than others, of course. It’s never so bad I can’t do what I need to do, though. I still manage, you know? I work with children all day, so I have to keep moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache, not sharp pain, and it doesn't prevent you from your daily activities. That's helpful. You mentioned you work with children – what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: Oh, I work in childcare. I look after little ones, mostly. Playing with them, feeding them, taking them to the park… you know, all the usual things. It keeps me busy! It’s good work, I like it. But it can be hard on my joints sometimes, all the bending and lifting. Though, I don't think it's that bad… I've been doing it for years, haven't I? It’s just… something I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, childcare, so a fair amount of physical activity. That's good to know. Now, Lilliana, have you noticed any swelling or redness in any of these joints?
PATIENT: Swelling or redness… hmm. Let me think… I don't think so. I haven't really paid much attention, to be honest. I haven’t noticed anything obvious, anyway. My hands might look a little puffy sometimes, but I just thought that was from… well, from being old! I don't really know what to look for, if you know what I mean. I haven't had any bright red, hot, swollen joints, if that's what you're asking. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no noticeable swelling or redness. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk about other health concerns. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky question. Let me see… I think my doctor, a long time ago, said something about my blood pressure being a little high? But that was years ago. I don't really remember the details. I don't have anything that I take medicine for regularly, if that helps. I’m not a very good patient, you see. I forget things easily. I don't have anything… serious, I don’t think. I just get tired easily, sometimes. Is that a medical condition?
DOCTOR: Okay, possible history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, but nothing currently managed with medication. Feeling tired easily. We can certainly explore that as well. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I had my appendix out when I was young, a long, long time ago. And… I was in the hospital for a few days once, when I broke my wrist. Fell down the stairs, silly me! But that was ages ago. Nothing else, not that I can remember. Just the usual bumps and bruises, I suppose. Nothing major. Does that make sense? I’m not a very exciting patient.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a broken wrist in the past. Nothing recent or major. Now, thinking about your family, do any of your relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have arthritis or any similar joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me see… my mother, she had… something with her hands. She used to complain about them being stiff and achy. I think it was arthritis, yes. She had trouble with her knitting, I remember that. And my grandmother… she was very stooped over. Maybe that was arthritis too? But I’m not really sure. We didn’t talk about these things much when I was growing up. It was just… old age, I suppose. Does that help? I’m not very good at remembering family history.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of arthritis in your mother and possible joint problems in your grandmother. That’s helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I take a little something for my indigestion sometimes, if I eat something rich. But that’s it. Just something I get from the pharmacy, nothing prescribed by a doctor. And… I sometimes take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because I don’t get much sun. But that’s about it. Nothing else. I try to stay away from pills, if I can. They always make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional indigestion medication and a vitamin D supplement. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of things, and I’ve never had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I’m a pretty lucky person, I suppose. I don’t really have any allergies. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. Is that okay? I hope I haven't forgotten anything important.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright, Lilliana. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this joint stiffness for quite some time. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam of your joints, just to get a better sense of what's going on?
PATIENT: Oh, not at all, Doctor. Please do. I’m happy to help in any way I can. I just want to feel a bit better, you know? It’s just… tiring, getting old. But, yes, please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. Do whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, if you would. My joints are a bit sensitive today, I think.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Let's start with your hands. I’m going to gently feel around your knuckles and the base of your fingers, and I'll have you bend and straighten them for me. Okay, just relax your hand as much as you can. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… a little bit. Not sharp pain, but… a dull ache, I suppose. Especially when you press right there, on the little bumps. And… yes, bending them is a bit stiff. It feels like they're… stuck, almost. Not awful, just… uncomfortable. It’s like when you haven’t used your hands for a while. But it’s worse in the mornings, of course. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things. But yes, a little tenderness and stiffness, especially here.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Lilliana. It sounds like there’s some tenderness and stiffness in the metacarpophalangeal joints – those are the joints in the knuckles. And how about this hand?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s pretty much the same, Doctor. A little tenderness when you press on the knuckles, and a bit stiff when I bend them. Maybe a tiny bit worse on this side, but it’s hard to tell. I think it changes from day to day. It’s just… uncomfortable. Not terrible, but definitely not as smooth as it used to be. I used to be able to knit for hours, you know? Now… well, now it’s a bit of a struggle. Does that make sense? I'm not trying to complain, it's just… how it is.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and you're not complaining at all. Both hands showing similar findings – tenderness and stiffness in the MCP joints. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. I'm going to gently feel around your knee and ask you to bend and straighten your leg for me. Any pain or discomfort when I touch here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… a little bit of discomfort when you press right here, on the inside of my knee. Not sharp, just… achy. And yes, bending it… it’s a bit stiff. It doesn’t bend as far as it used to. It feels a little… creaky, if you know what I mean. It’s worse when I’ve been sitting for a while, I think. It takes a while to get moving. But it’s not terrible. I can still walk, you know? Just… a little bit slower than I used to. Does that make sense? I hope I'm not being a bother.
DOCTOR: You’re not being a bother at all, Lilliana. That’s very helpful information. It sounds like there's some tenderness and stiffness in both knees, with crepitus – that’s the creaky feeling you described. And how about this knee?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s pretty much the same, Doctor. A little tenderness on the inside when you press, and a bit stiff when I bend it. Maybe a tiny bit more creaky on this side, but it’s hard to tell. I think it changes from day to day, you know? It’s not always the same. It's just… achy. Not terrible, but definitely not as smooth as it used to be. I used to be able to garden for hours, you know? Now… well, now it’s a bit of a struggle. Does that make sense? I'm not trying to complain, it's just… how it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilliana. Thank you for your patience. Based on the physical exam and your history, it sounds like you have some evidence of joint stiffness and tenderness in multiple joints, affecting both your hands and knees. This has been going on for a while and is worse in the mornings. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us rule out other possible causes of joint pain and stiffness, such as rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests… alright, yes, that sounds sensible. If it helps you figure out what's going on, then yes, please do. I don't mind a little poke, if it means I can feel a bit better. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do beforehand.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The tests I’m ordering include a complete blood count, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a C-reactive protein. These will give us a good starting point. You don’t need to do anything special beforehand, just no need to fast. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take care of everything. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend trying to stay active, even if it’s just gentle exercises to maintain your range of motion. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can also help manage any discomfort. Once we have the blood test results, we can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds good, Doctor. No fasting, that’s good. Gentle exercises… yes, I try to do that. And I've got some ibuprofen at home, yes. Let me see… um… well, I was wondering… is it something serious? I don’t want to end up in a wheelchair, you know? I still like to get around and do things. I just want to feel a bit better, that's all. Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, and I understand your concern. It's unlikely that this is something that will lead to needing a wheelchair. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may have some early signs of osteoarthritis, which is a common condition that develops with age. It’s not typically a rapidly progressing condition, and with appropriate management, we can often control the symptoms and maintain your quality of life. The blood tests will help us rule out other, more serious conditions. Even if it is osteoarthritis, there are many things we can do, like physical therapy, weight management , and medications, to help you stay active and comfortable. I want to reassure you that we're going to take this one step at a time. We'll get the test results, discuss them thoroughly, and create a plan that’s right for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… reassuring, Doctor. Osteoarthritis… yes, I’ve heard of that. It’s good to know it’s not something… terrible. And physical therapy… yes, I think that might help. Um… well, I was wondering about the cost of everything. I’m a widow, you see, and I don’t have a lot of money. I don’t have insurance either. Would it be very expensive?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important concern, Lilliana, and I completely understand. I apologize for not asking about your insurance situation earlier. The cost of the blood tests will be approximately $100-$200, depending on the lab. As for physical therapy, the cost can vary depending on the number of sessions and the therapist's fees. We can discuss options for finding more affordable therapists in the area, and I can also provide you with information about potential financial assistance programs. I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to make sure you receive the care you need, regardless of your financial situation. We can explore all available options and work within your budget. We have a social worker at the clinic who can also assist you with finding resources and programs. Would you like me to connect you with her?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Yes, please, connect me with the social worker. I really appreciate you thinking of that. $100-$200… well, I can probably manage that, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t get too expensive. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a bit better now, knowing there are options. I was just very worried, you see. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. It’s my job to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. I'm glad I could ease your worries a bit. I’m going to send a referral to our social worker, Sarah Miller. She will reach out to you within a few days to discuss available resources and programs. Her contact information is also listed on this paper. Here are the lab order forms and Sarah’s contact information. You can go to the lab anytime during their business hours. For now, focus on staying active and taking ibuprofen as needed. We’ll discuss the blood test results when they come back. Do you have any other questions before you go, or anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your kindness and patience. You’ve been very helpful. And thank you for connecting me with Sarah. I feel much better now, knowing there are people who can help. I think I'll go home now and try to relax a bit. Thank you again, Doctor. You're a very good doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. It was my pleasure to meet you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, staying positive and active is half the battle. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the results. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Have a good day.
