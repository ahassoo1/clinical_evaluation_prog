DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Frankly, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s… a bit embarrassing, really. It’s this… white stuff in my mouth. It’s quite unpleasant. I haven't the foggiest idea what it is, but it's not going away.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be unsettling when something unexpected happens with your health, and I appreciate you coming in despite being pressed for time. It's perfectly alright to feel embarrassed – we're here to help, and I assure you, I’ve seen many things. Could you describe this “white stuff” a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… creamy, I suppose. Like cottage cheese, but… in my mouth. Mostly on my tongue, and it's difficult to scrape off. It’s been going on for about a week, maybe a little longer. I assumed it would just… go away on its own, but it hasn’t. Honestly, I don't know what causes things like this. I'm a faller, Doctor, not a doctor. I work with trees.
DOCTOR: Okay, creamy and resembling cottage cheese, mostly on the tongue, and difficult to scrape off. About a week or so in duration. And you said you work with trees – that’s good to know. Just to clarify, when you say you're a "faller," do you mean you cut down trees professionally?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. I cut down trees. It’s… strenuous work. Lots of being outdoors, you understand. Perhaps it’s something I picked up out there. Though, I assure you, I take precautions. This isn't my first time in the woods, Doctor. I've been doing this for twenty years. It’s… likely nothing serious. Just… a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Twenty years is a long time! And working outdoors certainly exposes you to a lot. It’s good you're cautious. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms along with this white stuff?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. My mouth feels… a bit sore, I suppose. Not terribly so, just… irritated. And it’s hard to eat, especially anything sweet. Makes it worse, you see. Other than that… no, not really. I haven’t been ill, no fever, no… anything dramatic. Frankly, Doctor, I'm not prone to dramatic ailments. I’m a practical man.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some soreness in your mouth and it’s worsened by sweets. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed anything similar to this white stuff anywhere else in your mouth – on your gums, your cheeks, the roof of your mouth?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Just the tongue. It’s… quite localized, really. I’ve examined it myself, and it doesn’t seem to be spreading. Which, as I said, leads me to believe it’s nothing of consequence. I really don't understand why I had to come in for this. I have trees to fell, Doctor. This is… time consuming.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with taking time away from work, Mr. Schieber. Even if it seems minor, it’s important to rule out anything serious. Now, regarding your medical history, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always been quite healthy, as a matter of fact. I don't bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary, and this… barely qualifies. I'm married, if that's relevant. My wife suggested I come in, naturally. She worries excessively. But no, I've never experienced anything like this before. It’s… new. And rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And wives often have good instincts! Let’s talk about some other things, just to be thorough. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I find the habit… distasteful. And unhealthy, naturally. I take pride in my physical fitness, Doctor. It’s essential for my profession. No, I do not, and never have, smoked. It would hinder my ability to fell trees, you see. A clear head is paramount.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. I don’t… indulge. It interferes with one’s judgment, and as I've said, a clear head is essential. My wife enjoys a glass as well. But no, I wouldn’t say I drink. It’s… recreational, at best. Definitely not a contributing factor to this… problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine with dinner. That's good to know. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like certain foods?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I am aware. My wife keeps track of these things, naturally. She’s very thorough. But no, I haven’t experienced any allergic reactions to anything. Food, medication… nothing. I’ve always been quite robust, as a matter of fact. This is… perplexing. I really don’t understand why I am here.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Schieber, let’s do a quick examination. I'm going to take a look inside your mouth. I’ll need you to open wide and say “Ah.” It will only take a moment. Hmm… yes, I see what you mean. There’s a patchy, creamy white coating on your tongue. It does appear somewhat localized. It's not easily scraped off, as you mentioned. There's some mild redness in the surrounding area, but no obvious sores or lesions. It appears to be thrush, a fungal infection. However, I'd like to confirm that with a quick swab. It's a simple test.
PATIENT: Thrush? A fungal infection? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds… ridiculous. I fell trees! I'm exposed to dirt, sap, the elements… not some delicate fungal ailment. Are you certain? It sounds… unsanitary. A swab? Must we? I really don’t have time for this. Is there not some other way to diagnose this… improbable condition? It's rather demeaning, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Schieber. It does seem counterintuitive given your profession. However, thrush, or oral candidiasis, can occur even in healthy individuals, especially if there’s a slight disruption in the natural balance of bacteria in the mouth. It’s not a reflection of hygiene, and it’s not uncommon. It's often seen with mild immune system fluctuations. The swab is a quick and painless way to confirm the diagnosis. It will give us a definitive answer, and allow us to treat it appropriately. It takes only a moment, and will help rule out other possibilities. If it's not thrush, we’ll need to explore other causes, which may require more extensive testing. Would you be willing to let me take a quick swab?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I have trees waiting. And I expect a full explanation afterwards. This entire situation is… unprofessional. But if it gets me out of here faster, so be it. Just… be gentle. And please, don't take too long. My schedule is rather tight. Do whatever you must. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, that was quick. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes for the results to come back. While we wait, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely none. As I said, I avoid doctors and medication whenever possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. No pills, no syrups, no… anything. My wife occasionally suggests vitamins, but I generally decline. I prefer a robust constitution, not reliance on artificial substances. Do you understand? I am a practical man. This entire affair is… unsettling. Honestly, Doctor, I’m losing valuable daylight.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. A robust constitution is admirable. Alright, the results are back, and it confirms my initial suspicion. You do have oral thrush. It’s a fungal infection, caused by an overgrowth of Candida. It's not usually serious, and easily treatable. Now, I know you were skeptical, but it’s good we have a diagnosis. The good news is, we can treat it with an antifungal mouthwash or lozenges. Would you prefer a wash or lozenges?
PATIENT: Lozenges, I suppose. A wash sounds… messy. And I have no desire to swish liquids around in my mouth all day. Lozenges seem… more discreet. Though, frankly, I still maintain this is a ridiculous ailment for a man who fells trees to be afflicted with. What caused this, Doctor? Is there something in the woods… something I should be avoiding? It’s rather concerning. I don't want to be incapacitated by a fungal infection. My livelihood depends on my physical strength.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. While it’s not always possible to pinpoint the exact cause, thrush can sometimes be triggered by a number of things. It can happen after taking antibiotics, even if you haven't taken any recently. Stress can also be a factor, as can a slight weakening of the immune system. In your case, it’s possible the frequent exposure to the elements – particularly dirt and sap – may have contributed to a slight imbalance in your mouth’s natural flora. We’ll prescribe you antifungal lozenges. You'll need to take five lozenges daily for two weeks. They should start to alleviate your symptoms within a few days. Be sure to let them dissolve slowly in your mouth, and avoid eating or drinking for at least 30 minutes afterwards. I’ll also recommend maintaining good oral hygiene – brush and floss regularly. And try to stay hydrated. Do you have any questions about the medication or the treatment plan?
PATIENT: Two weeks. Very well. No, I don’t believe so. Dissolve slowly, avoid eating… It sounds… tedious. And is there anything else I should be aware of? Any side effects? Will this affect my ability to… work? I have deadlines, you understand. Trees don’t fell themselves. This entire process has been… a significant waste of time. I trust these lozenges are effective. I have no intention of returning for a follow-up. And… how much will this cost? My insurance situation is… complicated. Let’s just say I prefer to avoid unnecessary expenses.
DOCTOR: The lozenges are generally well-tolerated, but some people experience mild side effects like a slightly upset stomach or a metallic taste in their mouth. These usually resolve on their own. They shouldn't affect your ability to work, though. As for the cost, let me check the price for you. It’s $28.50 for a two-week supply. I understand your insurance situation is complicated. We do have a program to assist patients with limited financial resources. We can also explore options for a generic alternative, if available. And while I respect your desire to avoid a follow-up, I would recommend coming back in two weeks just to ensure the infection has cleared completely. It’s a quick check-up, and peace of mind is valuable. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: $28.50. Fine. I suppose that’s… acceptable. No generic, please. I prefer to stick with what you prescribed. And no, I do not want a follow-up. I have trees to fell, Doctor. My time is valuable. This is… settled. Here. Just… process it quickly, please. I have a schedule to maintain. And please, no further medical recommendations. I am a practical man, and I prefer to rely on my own strength and resilience. This has been… an unfortunate experience. And… good day.
DOCTOR: Alright, here’s your receipt. The pharmacy is just down the hall. You can pick up your prescription there. I understand your desire to get back to work, Mr. Schieber. I wish you all the best, and a speedy recovery. And please, if your symptoms worsen or don't improve within a few days, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
