DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, the reason I’m here is… the nurse took my blood pressure yesterday and it was kinda high, she said. I don’t usually bother with doctors unless something really feels off, but she seemed a little worried, so I figured I'd better get it checked out.
DOCTOR: That was very wise of you to follow up, Ms. Sladen. It’s always best to investigate when there’s a change, even if you generally feel well. And it’s good you're proactive about your health. Could you tell me a little more about how you’ve been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Hmm… generally? Everything’s been pretty normal, to be honest. No headaches, no dizziness… I haven’t been feeling tired more than usual. I work a bit, you know, helping folks out with… little things. And I try to get around when I can. Nothing major's been going on that I've noticed. I eat okay, I guess. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Sladen. "Mostly" is good information. Could you elaborate a little on what "mostly" entails when it comes to your diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat my fruits and veggies, you know? But sometimes… sometimes it’s easier to grab something quick. Like a sandwich or a little snack from the corner store. I do like a good roti sometimes too, especially on Fridays. And I love a good juice drink, but I know those have a lot of sugar. I don’t drink soda much anymore, though. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Sladen. It sounds like you’re quite aware of what constitutes a healthy diet, and you’re making conscious efforts, which is excellent. Now, let's talk a bit about your activity level. You mentioned "getting around when you can." Could you describe a typical day or week for me?
PATIENT: Okay, so, I help out a few people in the neighborhood with errands, cleaning, little things like that. It’s not a regular job, you know? It depends on who needs help. Some days I’m walking a good bit, going back and forth. Other days I’m… not so much. I try to walk to the market instead of taking the bus when the weather is nice. And on Sundays, I usually go to church, which is a bit of a walk too. I used to dance more, but… life got in the way, I guess.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have periods of moderate activity, which is good. And it's understandable that life can sometimes make it difficult to maintain certain habits. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical history. Let me think. I haven’t really had much of a medical history, thankfully. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, you know. Nothing serious. I had a bad flu a couple of years ago, but I recovered okay. My mom had high blood pressure when she got older, but she lived to be 85, so… I guess it runs in the family a little. And my dad… he had some problems with his heart, but that was a long time ago. I don’t really know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sladen. That's very helpful. Family history is important to note. And it's good to know you haven't had any major illnesses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Not even tonsils out or anything. And no, just the one time in the hospital with the flu. It was bad, but I bounced back. I’m usually pretty healthy, like I said.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. And I use ibuprofen now and then if I have a headache, but that’s it. Nothing regular. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully! Never had a reaction to anything, that I've noticed.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Now, Ms. Sladen, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a baseline and listen to your heart and lungs. It will just take a few moments. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Sounds good, Doctor. Go ahead. I don't mind at all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please remove your shoes and socks, that would be great. I’m going to start by checking your blood pressure again, just to confirm the nurse’s reading. Your blood pressure is currently 148 over 92. That is a bit elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. It’s not particularly concerning at this point, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I’m going to check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems alright physically, but the elevated blood pressure is something we need to address. We will need some additional testing. Would you be amenable to a blood test and an EKG?
PATIENT: Okay… 148 over 92, you say? That does sound a bit high, doesn't it? I guess the nurse was right to worry. A murmur… that sounds a little scary. Blood test and an EKG… hmm. Yeah, okay, I guess so. If you think it’s necessary, I’ll do it. I just… I don’t like needles, Doctor. Is it a lot of blood? And what exactly are you looking for with the EKG?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Sladen. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about needles and tests. The blood test will just be a few vials – about a tablespoon or so. It will help us check your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar levels, among other things. The EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a simple, painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us get a better picture of that murmur and rule out any potential heart issues. It involves placing a few stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It doesn’t hurt at all. We’re not necessarily looking for something wrong, but rather gathering information to understand your overall health and see why your blood pressure is elevated. It’s a preventative measure. Would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: Okay… a tablespoon, that doesn’t sound too bad. And stickers… that I can handle. You're right, preventative is good. I just… I get a little nervous, you know? My mom always worried about her heart, so I guess it runs in my head. So, the blood test and the EKG… and then what? Will I have to come back for more tests? Or will you be able to tell me something right away?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Sladen. It’s natural to be concerned, especially with a family history of heart issues. After the blood test and EKG, it will take a few days for the results to come back. I’ll review them carefully and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Depending on the results, we might need to do some additional testing, such as an ambulatory blood pressure monitor to see how your blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day. Or, if necessary, we can consult with a cardiologist. But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. We'll start with these initial tests and go from there. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials that we should be aware of before we proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: No, no latex allergies or anything like that. I think I'm good. Okay, so, blood test and stickers first. When can we do them? And where will they be done? Is it here in the office?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, the blood test and EKG can both be done right here in the office. Our phlebotomist, Maria, is very skilled and gentle. She’ll take care of you. And the EKG technician, David, will be right with you afterward. We can do them both right away, if you’re comfortable. It should take about 30-45 minutes total. I'll have Maria come in and draw your blood first, and then David will perform the EKG. Would you like a few minutes to gather your thoughts before we begin?
PATIENT: No, let’s just get it over with, Doctor. The sooner it’s done, the better, right? Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sladen. That's a very good attitude. Let's go. Maria is ready for you. Maria, this is Ms. Sladen. She’s here for a blood test. And after that, David will be taking care of the EKG. I’ll be right nearby if you need anything at all. Just let Maria or David know, or feel free to call out. Don’t hesitate. I’ll check on you after the tests are completed.
