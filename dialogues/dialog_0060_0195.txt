DOCTOR: Right. Well, Janeth, hello. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit silly, really. My daughter, she says I should get a card. From you. A “get well” card. I’m perfectly fine, you see. Not sick at all. But she worries so. Says it would… encourage me. Honestly, the things people come up with.
DOCTOR: A card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a card. Like, one of those with a nice picture on it and… words. Saying I’m doing well, or… something cheerful. She thinks it would lift my spirits. Honestly, I’ve been feeling perfectly capable, perfectly alright. It’s just… her fussing. But she’s very insistent. And she made this appointment, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. So, to be clear, your daughter is concerned about your well-being and has scheduled an appointment for you… for a note saying you’re healthy?
PATIENT: Exactly! You understand. It’s… a bit ridiculous, isn’t it? I mean, look at me. Do I look unwell? I’ve been managing just fine. Cooking, cleaning, everything. It’s not like I’m bedridden or anything. She’s just… overprotective. Always has been. A lovely girl, truly, but… sometimes she goes too far. A card from the doctor. Honestly!
DOCTOR: Well, Janeth, with all due respect, it is rather unusual to have a patient scheduled for an appointment to… validate their health to their daughter. While I appreciate your daughter’s concern, my time is valuable. Are you experiencing any health concerns at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Nothing at all. Perfectly healthy. Just… this whole card business. It's just a waste of your time, really. And mine. She says it’s about… morale. Keeping my spirits up. Honestly, it’s a bit insulting, implying I need a card to feel alright. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. A perfectly good life. I don’t need a doctor’s note to prove that! Is it really necessary to fill out some… silly card?
DOCTOR: Janeth, let me be frank. I am a medical professional. I address medical concerns. I don’t provide documentation for… emotional reassurance. However, since you are here, and I’ve already allocated time for this appointment, I suppose I can ask a few basic questions to ensure there isn’t anything I’m overlooking. Just to be thorough. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, if you must. No, no pain. Not a bit. Maybe a little ache in my knees sometimes, after gardening, but who doesn't have that at my age? It’s just… normal wear and tear. Nothing to worry about. Honestly, I feel… robust. Very capable. I can still climb the stairs perfectly well. And I bake a lovely cake, if you’re interested. But pain? No, Doctor. Not a speck. It’s just… this whole situation is rather undignified, don't you think? A grown woman needing a doctor's note to satisfy her daughter. It’s ridiculous, truly.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Excellent! I eat like a bird, a very healthy bird. I make sure to have my three meals a day. Lots of vegetables, a bit of meat, a little rice. I enjoy cooking, you see, so I make sure to eat well. I even try new recipes sometimes. My daughter says I should watch my cholesterol, but honestly, a little butter never hurt anyone. I'm perfectly fine, Doctor. I assure you. Everything is functioning as it should. I just wish she’d stop fussing! Is this… card going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Janeth, I’m trying to establish a basic medical history here, not critique your diet. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. My weight is… stable. Perfectly stable. Maybe a pound or two here and there, but nothing drastic. You know, like when I make a particularly good cake and indulge a little. But it always balances out. I weigh myself every week, you see, just to keep track. Perfectly normal fluctuations. Honestly, Doctor, I think my daughter is sending me on a wild goose chase. She worries so much about… everything. And now this card. It's really quite… insulting to suggest I need a medical professional to confirm I’m… functioning. I’m perfectly capable of telling you I’m perfectly alright!
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth. Let’s try a different approach. Are you experiencing any difficulty with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Oh, lovely sleep! I sleep like a log. A very sound log. I go to bed around ten, maybe eleven, and I’m out like a light. No tossing and turning, no waking up in the middle of the night. Just… peaceful slumber. I might dream a little, but nothing disturbing. Honestly, I haven’t slept this well in years. My daughter suggested I try chamomile tea, but honestly, I don’t need it. I’m perfectly relaxed, you see. No worries, no anxieties, just… restful sleep. This whole card business is much more disruptive to my sleep than anything else, honestly. Are we getting closer to this… card? I have gardening to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Goodness, no! Not a bit. I can climb the stairs perfectly well, as I mentioned before. And I walk to the market every week, a good ten-minute walk, uphill both ways. I breathe perfectly well, thank you very much. My lungs are in excellent condition. Honestly, Doctor, I think my daughter is imagining things. She reads those health magazines, you see, and gets all worked up about… everything. This whole thing is really quite ridiculous. I’m perfectly capable of telling you I’m perfectly healthy, I don’t need a medical examination! And this… card? What exactly does it say? Will it at least have a pretty picture?
DOCTOR: Janeth, I am going to ask you one more question, and I need a straight answer. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Goodness gracious, Doctor! Really? Is this necessary? I mean, this is… completely inappropriate! What on earth does my bowel… habits have to do with anything? My daughter sends me here for a card, and you’re asking me about… that? This is utterly preposterous! I am perfectly fine, perfectly healthy, and frankly, I’m starting to feel rather insulted. I think I’ve answered enough personal questions. I came here to satisfy my daughter, and now I’m being subjected to… this! Can we please just get this… card over with? Honestly, the audacity! I’m leaving. I’m perfectly capable of telling everyone I’m perfectly fine, thank you very much. .
