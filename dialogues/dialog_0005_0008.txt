DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Good to meet you too, Doctor… Donate, is it? Hmm. Well, it’s my ear. Feels… full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? It’s been like this for a bit now, and it’s a little annoying, to be honest. I'd like to get it sorted if possible. I don't really have time for this, but… well, here I am.
DOCTOR: Donate, yes. And I understand wanting to get things sorted quickly. “A bit” is vague, though. Can you be more specific about how long it's been bothering you?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. That’s not my strong suit, I’m afraid. Let me think… it must be… a few weeks, maybe? Or was it a month? It all blurs together, you see. I’ve been busy with the farm, harvest is coming up, and… honestly, I don’t pay much attention to dates. It just started feeling blocked, and I figured I should probably get it checked out before it got worse.
DOCTOR: Right. A few weeks to a month. Okay. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm… mostly constant, I think. Not a sharp pain, thankfully, just… this fullness. Like when you’re on an airplane, you know? That pressure. It’s… not exactly the same, but similar. It doesn’t really go away completely, even when I rest. It's just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Not really. Maybe a little bit of… ringing sometimes? Very faint. I figured it was just the quiet. I live out in the country, you know. It's usually very peaceful. Honestly, I'm not sure if that’s related. I haven’t noticed anything else, no.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ringing in the ears… tinnitus, as we call it. It can be related, but it also can be its own thing. Have you experienced any dizziness, hearing loss, or drainage from the ear?
PATIENT: Drainage? No, definitely not. No dizziness either. My hearing… well, it feels a little muffled, but I always thought that was just getting older. I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. Look, is this going to be a long process? I really need to get back to the farm.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Let's have a quick look in your ear, just to get a better idea of what we’re dealing with. It won’t take long. Just lean forward a bit.
PATIENT: Fine. Lean forward… yes, alright. Get it over with quickly, please. Honestly, I don't understand why you need to look in there. Can't you just… prescribe something?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. GuerreroloLopez, I’m seeing a fair amount of cerumen – earwax – buildup, and some slight inflammation of the ear canal. It looks like impacted cerumen is the likely cause of your symptoms. That's why I needed to look. Simply prescribing something without knowing the cause wouldn't be responsible medical care.
PATIENT: Cerumen… inflammation… Right. So… is that bad? Is it serious? Will I need… surgery? Honestly, I’m not very good with medical terms. Just tell me in plain English what this means.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not serious, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It’s quite common. Basically, your ear is producing too much wax, and it’s built up and blocking the canal. It’s causing the fullness, and likely the ringing. We don’t need surgery. I can remove it for you here in the office. It’s a quick procedure. It might be a little uncomfortable, but shouldn't be painful. Would you like me to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, if it's not serious… and no surgery… then yes, please. Get it removed. The quicker the better, really. I have a lot to do. And… is there anything I need to do after? Any special instructions?
DOCTOR: Alright. Just lie back on the table here. After I remove the wax, I’ll give you a few drops of ear drops to use for a couple of days, just to help soothe the canal. Avoid getting water in your ear for a few days as well. And if you experience any pain, dizziness, or further hearing loss after the procedure, you need to contact me immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Lie back… yes, alright. Drops and no water… got it. Pain, dizziness… I understand. Honestly, I just want this over with. Let's just get it done, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I think I’ve got most of it out. Let me take another look… Yes, that looks much better. There’s a little bit of inflammation still, but that should subside on its own with the ear drops. I’m going to give you a prescription for those now. I’ll also give you written instructions. Do you have any questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No… no questions. Just… is it all gone? And… will it happen again? Honestly, I'd rather not have to come back here again anytime soon.
DOCTOR: It should be all gone, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. As for whether it will happen again… it’s possible. Some people are just more prone to wax buildup than others. Try to avoid using cotton swabs in your ears – they actually push the wax further in. I recommend over-the-counter earwax removal drops for maintenance, if you find it building up again. Everything is explained in here. Do you understand?
PATIENT: No cotton swabs… got it. Over-the-counter drops… right. Yes, I understand. Honestly, this whole thing has been a bit of a waste of time, but… I suppose it's better than not knowing. Well, thank you, Doctor. I really must be going now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. If you experience any further issues, don’t hesitate to contact the office. Have a… productive harvest. .
PATIENT: Yes, yes, thank you. Productive… if I can even hear myself think. .
