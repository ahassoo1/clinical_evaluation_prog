DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is... is Eaddy? Yes. My... my husband, he find nice place. For old people. Senior... living. He want me check, make sure I okay for go. He worry.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your husband is considering a senior living facility and would like me to provide a general assessment of your health to ensure you are suitable. Very well. Let’s begin with a bit of your medical history, shall we?
PATIENT: History? Oh... I... I don't know much history. I have little headaches sometimes. And my knees... they not so good. But is old age, yes? I no remember much doctor visit. We no have much money for doctor when I young.
DOCTOR: Very well. It’s not uncommon for patients to have incomplete medical records. We will proceed as best we can. Let's focus on the present then. You mentioned headaches and knee discomfort. Can you tell me more about these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm... the headaches… they come and go. Not all the time. More when I tired, maybe? Or if sun too strong. Is not… bad bad headache. Just... feels tight. Like band around head. I take little… what you call it? The white pill. For pain. Help little.
DOCTOR: And this white pill... do you happen to know the name of it?
PATIENT: Name? No. Husband buy it. From the store. Little white pill. For headache. He say good for headache. We buy many times. Is… is like a circle? On the pill. Maybe? I not good with names. Everything is… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to investigate that medication further at some point. For now, let's move on to your knees. You said they are not “so good”. Can you describe the discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort… When I walk… they hurt. Especially if I walk too much. Or if I go up stairs. Is… like a sharp pain. And they… they make noise. Like… crack... you hear? When I bend them. Sometimes they feel… stiff. Hard to move. Is not good for dancing, you know? I like to dance.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long have you been experiencing this knee discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… long time. Many years. Maybe… ten years? Fifteen? I not sure. Is slow. Little by little get worse. Husband, he help me. He strong man. He carry heavy things so I no have to bend so much. Now… is harder. Even with his help.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Abdollahi. Let’s take a look. Palpates both knees, noting crepitus and mild swelling. I’m feeling some crepitus – that’s the cracking sound you mentioned – and a bit of swelling in both knees. Does this cause you pain?
PATIENT: Yes. There. That one. When you push there... is hurt. Not bad bad, but… I feel it. Like a little pinch. The other one… not so much. But it get worse if I stand too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Checks range of motion, noting some limitations and discomfort with flexion. I'm observing some limitation in your range of motion, particularly when bending your knees, and some discomfort with that movement. I’m also going to check your reflexes and strength. Briefly assesses reflexes and strength in both legs. Your reflexes appear normal, and your strength is adequate, but we’ll need to consider imaging to determine the extent of any underlying joint damage.
PATIENT: Imaging? Like… a picture? Of my knees? Is that… expensive? My husband, he work hard. We no have much money for fancy pictures. He just want me safe. That is why he find this place. Senior living. So I no fall. He worry I fall.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Abdollahi, an X-ray would provide a clearer picture of the structure of your knees. It is a standard procedure for assessing knee pain. As for the cost… it’s difficult to say precisely without knowing your insurance coverage. However, we can discuss options if it presents a financial burden. For now, let’s move on to a brief review of your overall health. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Insurance? Yes. I have… the blue card. Private. My son, he pay for it. Is good. He always help. Other… symptoms? I get tired easy. Sometimes I feel… dizzy when I stand up too fast. And I… I forget things. Like names. Like what I eat for breakfast. Is… normal for old people, yes?
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon to experience some memory lapses with age. However, we should document this dizziness and fatigue as well. Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations when you feel tired?
PATIENT: Pal… pal… Like… heart beating fast? No. Not fast. Just… heavy. Like I carry big rock. And no chest pain. I breathe okay. Sometimes I cough little, when cold. But is just cold. Is winter, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any known allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Husband cook good food. I no think I have allergies. Maybe… maybe to dust? Sometimes I sneeze when I clean. But is just sneeze. Little sneeze. Is not… bad allergy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on your description, Ms. Abdollahi, you present with chronic knee pain, some fatigue, occasional dizziness, and mild memory lapses. We will need to rule out other potential causes for these symptoms. I recommend an X-ray of both knees to assess the extent of any joint damage. Additionally, a basic blood panel will help us evaluate your overall health and rule out any underlying deficiencies. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you today?
PATIENT: Tests? Blood? So much… poking? Is okay. If husband think is good. He worry. I want to make him happy. Yes. Schedule tests. The knees… and the blood. But… not too much poking, please?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will schedule both an X-ray and a basic blood panel for you. The blood draw will be a standard procedure, and we will do our best to minimize any discomfort. I will also write a note for a referral to a specialist in orthopedics to evaluate your knee pain more thoroughly after we receive the X-ray results. I will have the receptionist schedule these appointments for you. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: Orthopedics? Is that… a knee doctor? Good. Yes. I want a knee doctor. Is my knees hurt so much. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I think… I think that is all. Just… make sure husband happy. That is most important. He worry too much, you know. But he good man.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will do our best to address your concerns and ensure your husband’s peace of mind. The receptionist will be in touch to schedule those appointments. Please, take this form to the front desk, and have a good day, Ms. Abdollahi.
