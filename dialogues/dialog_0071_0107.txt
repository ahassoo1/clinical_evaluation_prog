DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I’m Dr. Galena. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… my heart. It feels… funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but it happens. My wife, she say I need to come see someone.
DOCTOR: “Funny” is… a good way to put it. Can you tell me more about when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not when I’m doing something hard, like work. Usually when I’m… just sitting. Or maybe when I wake up. Not every time, but… more then when I’m moving, you know? It doesn't last long, maybe a minute. Sometimes less. It just… starts and stops.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it happens mostly at rest or when waking up, and it’s brief – a minute or less. And it doesn’t seem to be brought on by exertion. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it a new thing?
PATIENT: Not that long. Maybe… two months? I didn’t think much about it at first. Just felt… off. But then it happened more, and my wife… she worries. She say I need to get it checked. Before it gets worse. She is always right, I think.
DOCTOR: It's good she encourages you to come in. It's always best to get these things looked at. Two months is good to know. Now, besides the “flapping” feeling, do you experience any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Sometimes I feel a little… dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… light. And maybe a little… short of breath? Not bad, just… like I can’t get a full breath. Does that make sense? It doesn’t always happen with the flapping, though. Sometimes one, sometimes the other, sometimes both. It’s… confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness and shortness of breath sometimes accompany the sensation, but not always. That is helpful to know. And to be clear, when you say shortness of breath, is it a sudden feeling, or does it build up slowly?
PATIENT: Sudden. It just… comes. Not like I’m running and getting tired. Just… poof. For a few seconds. Then it’s gone. Like when the flapping stops, the breath comes back normal. It’s strange. I don’t get chest pain, if that’s what you’re thinking. It’s just… weird feelings.
DOCTOR: No chest pain, that’s good to know. Alright. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve never really been sick. I work hard, eat okay… normal things. The doctor back home, he just give me checkups every year. Always said I was healthy. This… this is new. My wife, she worry about everything, but… she usually right.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you generally have been healthy. And it's good your wife is looking out for you. Okay, any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any. Just… a broken arm when I was a little boy. Fell out of a tree. But that was… a long time ago. Healed good. Nothing else. I don’t like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. That’s helpful. And I understand not liking hospitals. We'll try to keep things as brief and comfortable as possible. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t take pills. I drink tea sometimes, if that counts. My wife makes it. She says it’s good for everything. But no… no medicine from the doctor. Never needed any.
DOCTOR: No medications. Good. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. My wife, she tries to make me eat more vegetables, but… I can eat anything. No problems. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Well… I don’t like cilantro. But that’s not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Cilantro preferences don’t count! Now, just a few questions about your family… does anyone in your family have heart problems, like heart attacks or arrhythmias?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. But he lived to be old. My mother… she had everything. But I don’t remember anything about her heart. We didn’t talk much about it. She died when I was young. My wife, she might know more. Her family is healthy, I think. They all live long lives.
DOCTOR: Alright, some history of high blood pressure in your father, but otherwise limited information. That's okay. Now, tell me a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. Never have. My wife would kill me if I did. She says it’s bad for everything. I drink some tea, like I said. And sometimes… a little bit of juice with dinner. But no smoking. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just sometimes. With dinner. A little bit of wine. Not every night. Maybe two or three times a week. A small glass. Nothing big. My wife, she drinks with me. It’s… relaxing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small amount of wine a few times a week. And finally, tell me about your work. What do you do?
PATIENT: I work with… chemicals. At the factory. I make sure the machines are working, and the… things are mixed right. It’s… okay work. Sometimes long hours. But it pays the bills. I’m a… Chemical Equipment Operator, I think that’s what they call it. It's not hard work, mostly watching and making sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chemical Equipment Operator. Alright, Mr. Puder, thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It shouldn't take too long.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That’s… fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. My wife is waiting for me. But I trust you. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat here on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds… a little rapid, but no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is 92, and regular. Okay, now I'm just going to feel your pulse in a few different places. Pulses are good and strong. Everything seems… within normal limits, but your heart rate is a bit fast and your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Given your description of the palpitations, I think it’s worth running some tests to get a clearer picture. Would you be willing to do an EKG and some blood work?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… okay. If you think it’s important. My wife will be glad. An EKG… is that the thing with the stickers? And blood work… I don’t like needles, but… if it will help. Just… tell me it won't take too long. And not too many stickers, please.
DOCTOR: Yes, an EKG uses stickers – it’s a painless way to measure your heart’s electrical activity. And the blood work will just be a few vials – we’ll try to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. It shouldn't take long, maybe 20-30 minutes total for both. We’ll check your thyroid levels, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. It will help us rule out any underlying causes for your palpitations. The nurse will be in shortly to take you to get those tests done. Do you have any questions for me before she comes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think I understand. Stickers and blood. Not my favorite, but… okay. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… will you tell me what happens if something is wrong? Will I need… surgery? My wife will be very worried.
DOCTOR: That's a very fair question. The vast majority of palpitations are benign – meaning not dangerous. The tests will help us determine the cause. If something is abnormal, we’ll discuss the results thoroughly. Surgery is very unlikely at this stage. We’d likely start with medication or lifestyle changes if needed. We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it, but I don’t want you to worry unnecessarily. The goal right now is to gather information and understand what’s going on. The nurse will be with you shortly. Just try to relax, and she’ll explain everything in detail. Do you have any other questions before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you. I hope it’s nothing bad. I just want to go home to my wife.
