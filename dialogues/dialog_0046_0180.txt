DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. Just... tired. Real tired. And I keep... eating dirt. Not like on purpose, you know? It just... happens. It's stupid. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. It doesn't sound stupid at all, and I appreciate you being honest with me. Fatigue and… the unusual craving you described are certainly things we should investigate. When you say "real tired," could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Describe? Like... I don't want to do anything. Everything feels heavy. Even getting out of bed. It’s been… a while, I guess. Months? I don't really keep track anymore. My husband used to... handle all that. He's gone now. So, yeah. Just tired. And I eat the dirt when I feel extra… empty. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cantoran, that is very helpful. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant amount of fatigue, and it’s understandable that your husband’s passing has had a profound impact. It’s also good you're telling me about the dirt-eating, which is something we need to explore further. Just to clarify, when you say "empty," could you describe that feeling?
PATIENT: Ugh, feelings. Look, it’s like… a hole. Inside. Not a painful hole, just… missing something. Like when you're hungry, but not for food. It's hard to explain. I just feel… weak. And the dirt… it feels good going down, if that makes any sense. I know it's weird. Don't judge me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I absolutely am not judging you. It takes courage to share these things, and I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like you’re experiencing a deep sense of loss and perhaps a craving for something your body is missing. This craving for dirt – sometimes called pica – can be associated with various things, including nutrient deficiencies. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to ask you some questions about your diet and medical history, if that's alright. We'll also need to do a physical exam and some bloodwork. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? Ugh. Look, I don't like needles. And my diet? I eat. What do you want me to say? Mostly stuff from the store. I don't cook much anymore. Honestly, I don't remember the last time I made a proper meal. My husband… he always did the cooking. Just... get on with it. What do you need to know? But no needles if you can help it.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance regarding the bloodwork, Ms. Cantoran, and we’ll try to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. It's important to rule out any underlying deficiencies that could be contributing to your symptoms. Let’s start with a few general questions. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently, such as changes in your appetite, weight loss or gain, any shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches sometimes. But everyone gets headaches. Appetite? Not really. I don't really feel hungry. Weight… maybe lost a little? I don't weigh myself. Clothes feel a little looser, maybe. And… I get cold easily now. Even when it's warm. That's about it, I guess. Really, just tired and cold and craving dirt. Is that all you need? Can we hurry this up? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. That’s helpful. Fatigue, feeling cold, loss of appetite, and possible weight loss along with the dirt craving… these are things we need to investigate. The headaches are good to know as well. Before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Ugh. Past medical? Honestly, I don't remember. Old lady problems, I guess? You know, the usual aches and pains. My husband handled all the doctor stuff. I just… showed up when he told me to. I think I had high blood pressure at one point? Maybe? He gave me pills. I still take them. Brown ones. Does that help? I really can't remember the details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. We'll do our best to piece things together. It's very common for partners to manage medical details, and it's alright that you don't recall specific diagnoses. You mentioned taking brown pills for high blood pressure, which is good to know. Do you know the dosage of the pills, or perhaps the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, medication names? Are you kidding me? Look, they're small, brown pills. I take one every morning, with my coffee. That's all I know. The bottle is... somewhere in the kitchen. I don't really pay attention to those things. He always refilled them. I just take them. Honestly, I have a terrible memory. Can we just get this over with? My head is starting to hurt.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran. We’ll do our best to keep things moving. It’s alright if you don’t remember the medication name; we can try to identify it later. Let's move on to some basic questions about your family history, if that's okay. Has anyone in your family had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. More remembering. Look, my mother died old. Very old. I think she had… arthritis? Or something. Lots of aches and pains. My father… he died young. Heart attack, I think. He smoked. Lots. That's about all I remember. We weren't a close family. Honestly, I barely knew them. Can we please just move on to the… what did you call it? Physical exam? I just want to know what's wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. It sounds like you've had a difficult family history. We’ll make a note of the heart attack and arthritis. Alright, let’s move on to the physical exam, as you requested. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a general assessment of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Hurry. I have things to do, you know. And don't poke around too much. I don't like being touched. Just… get on with it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cantoran. I'll be as efficient and gentle as possible. I will explain each step as I go. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Your heart sounds a little fast, but otherwise regular. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Now I'm going to take your pulse. Your pulse is 88. Finally, I'm going to take your temperature. Your temperature is normal, 98.6. Do you feel cold right now?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I always feel cold, even when it's warm. Like a chill deep inside. It's… unpleasant. And that fast heart? Is that bad? My husband used to say I had a "nervous disposition." Whatever that means. Just tell me what’s wrong. Is it something serious? I really don’t have time for a long illness.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cantoran. Your elevated heart rate and blood pressure, combined with your report of feeling cold and the fatigue, are things we need to investigate further. The "chill deep inside" is also important to note. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary findings from the physical exam, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be related to anemia, a thyroid issue, or even nutritional deficiencies. Additionally, the fatigue and craving for dirt could suggest iron deficiency. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and iron studies. We'll also check your vitamin levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. More bloodwork? I just told you I don’t like needles! But… I guess if you have to. Just… promise me it won’t take long. And no poking around too much. And tell me what it all means when you get the results. I don’t want to sit here guessing. What are we looking for, exactly? Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Cantoran. I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll have a phlebotomist who is very experienced. The blood work will help us determine if you have any underlying deficiencies or imbalances that could be causing your symptoms. Specifically, the complete blood count will check for anemia. The thyroid function tests will see if your thyroid gland is working properly, as that can affect your energy levels and body temperature. And the iron studies will check for iron deficiency, which can cause fatigue and unusual cravings. We're looking for anything outside the normal range, which could point us towards a diagnosis. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously bad, but it will help us understand what's going on and develop a treatment plan. I will personally review the results with you as soon as they are available, explain what they mean in plain language, and discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. And hurry. I have things to do. I don’t want to be stuck here all day. Tell that needle person to be gentle, okay? And don’t leave me waiting forever for the results. Just… get on with it. I’m tired just talking about it. Stop asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cantoran. I will let the phlebotomist know about your concerns, and I will do my best to expedite the process. We'll have the results back within a few days, and I’ll contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I'm going to write up a note for you summarizing our conversation and the tests we're ordering. Do you have any questions for me before I do that?
PATIENT: No. Just… no. I just want to go home. Is there anything I should… avoid? Like, food? Or doing anything? I just want to know if I’m going to die. Is it… serious? Just tell me straight. I don’t need sugar-coating.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your anxiety, and I want to be as honest and straightforward with you as possible. It’s difficult to say definitively whether it’s serious without the blood work results, but based on your symptoms, it's important to rule out underlying medical conditions. For now, there’s no specific food or activity you need to avoid. However, I would recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. I also wouldn't start any new strenuous activities until we have a clearer understanding of what's going on. I want to reassure you that we're taking your concerns seriously, and we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. We’ll review the results together, and discuss the best course of action. I'm going to have the phlebotomist come in to draw your blood. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And tell that person to be gentle. I hate needles. I really do. Just… hurry. I want to go home. .
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sarah. Ms. Cantoran is a little anxious about the blood draw, and has a dislike of needles. Please be as gentle and efficient as possible. .
