DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, that’s right. Kochubey. It's... the surgery. I think it's a check-up before the… the weight loss surgery? Honestly, things are a little fuzzy. My wife mostly handled setting all this up. I just… showed up.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. So, you're scheduled for bariatric surgery… with Dr. Evans, on the 15th. And it is a pre-operative appointment. Your wife did a good job getting things moving, it seems. Fuzzy is… not ideal, but we can sort through it. Let's start with the basics, just to be sure I have everything straight. Can you tell me what prompted you to consider weight loss surgery in the first place?
PATIENT: Well… it's been a long time coming, I guess. Always been a bit bigger, honestly. But it's gotten harder… everything’s gotten harder. Walking, mostly. And… just keeping up with things. My kids are getting older, and I want to… be able to do things with them, you know? It's not just about how I look, though that's a part of it, I guess. It's… feeling better. I don’t really remember what exactly made me decide now was the time, just… it felt right. My wife was worried about my health, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, increased difficulty with ambulation, wanting to be more active with your children, and generally improving your overall health and quality of life. Your wife’s concerns as well. That’s a very reasonable set of motivations. Now, can you tell me a bit more about these difficulties walking?
PATIENT: Uh… it started slowly, I think. Just getting winded easier, needing to stop and rest more. Then it got to the point where my knees would really ache after even a short walk. It's not… constant pain, but it's definitely there, especially at the end of the day. And… sometimes it’s hard to get up from a chair. It's embarrassing, to be honest. I try not to make a big deal of it, but… it’s there. I just figured it was getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, intermittent knee pain, worsening with activity, and some difficulty with rising from a seated position. It could be related to age, but given your interest in bariatric surgery, it’s important to get a clearer picture. Do you have any history of arthritis, or any injuries to your knees?
PATIENT: Arthritis… not that I know of. My mom had something with her hands, always complaining about her joints, but I don’t think it was in her knees. And… injuries… hmm. I twisted my knee playing soccer when I was a kid, a long time ago. I think I had a brace on for a little while, but it healed okay. Never bothered me much after that, until… recently. It’s really hazy, to be honest. I was pretty young.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Well, given your surgery is scheduled soon, we need to make sure everything is as optimized as possible. I'm going to do a quick physical exam of your knees, just to assess range of motion and any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… let me know if it's gonna hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. I’m just going to move your leg around, feel your knees. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. Okay, some crepitus with flexion and extension of both knees – that's not uncommon. Slight tenderness over the medial joint line of the right knee. No obvious effusion, but there is a bit of warmth to both joints. Range of motion is slightly limited, especially with the right knee. Patellar tracking seems normal. Overall, it sounds like you have some underlying osteoarthritis, likely exacerbated by your weight. It’s not severe, but it’s something we need to be aware of going into surgery. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? Just… old age? That's what I figured. No, I don’t think I’ve been diagnosed with anything else. I get a little… tired sometimes, but everyone does, right? And… my blood pressure was a little high at my wife’s doctor’s appointment last year, but they didn’t say anything about it being a big deal. Honestly, I mostly just try to ignore things until they really bother me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… not ideal, Mr. Kochubey. Ignoring things can sometimes make them worse. High blood pressure, even if it was just a single reading, is something we need to address. And fatigue could be related to a number of things. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains. That's it. My wife keeps telling me I should see a doctor more often, but… I just don't like going. It's not that I'm scared, exactly. Just… a waste of time, usually. They tell you to lose weight, and I already know that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, with all due respect, you are undergoing a significant surgical procedure. It’s not a waste of time to ensure you are in the best possible health before surgery. And, frankly, dismissing potential health concerns based on assumptions is… unhelpful. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife always makes fun of me for it. She's very careful about what she eats, but I… I just don’t have any problems. Honestly. I just want to feel better, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Good. Now, regarding your social history… Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she doesn’t approve. I have a beer sometimes with dinner, that’s it. Nothing crazy. And… definitely no drugs. I just work, come home, spend time with my family. That's it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, no recreational drug use. Given your history, and the upcoming surgery, I recommend a pre-operative cardiac evaluation, just to be safe. And, honestly, your blood pressure needs to be monitored more closely. I’m also going to order some routine bloodwork – a complete metabolic panel, CBC, and lipid panel – to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Uh… cardiac evaluation? Bloodwork? That sounds… like a lot. Is it… is it necessary? I just want the surgery, you know? To feel better. Is everything okay? Are there any problems with the surgery?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, the surgery is scheduled, but that doesn’t mean we can ignore potential health concerns. A cardiac evaluation and bloodwork are standard pre-operative procedures, especially given your weight and reported fatigue. They aren't necessarily indicative of a problem, but they will help us ensure you are in the best possible condition for surgery and minimize potential complications. I’m going to order those tests for you. The lab is across the hall. My nurse will provide you with the requisitions. As for your surgery date… we can discuss postponing it if the results are concerning. But let’s not jump to conclusions. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Postponing…? No, no, I don’t want to postpone it. My wife… she’s already planned everything. And… I just want it over with. But… bloodwork and a heart thing…? I guess… I guess I understand. But I don’t like it. It just feels like a lot. Is there anything else? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, I understand your frustration. It is a lot, and it’s not what you wanted to hear. But my priority is your safety. And frankly, proceeding without addressing these concerns would be… irresponsible. There’s one last thing. Given your wife is so involved in your care, and you seem… unsure about things, I’d like to invite her to join us for a follow-up appointment to discuss the test results and surgical plan. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah… yeah, that’s… that’s a good idea. She… she explains things better. And she’ll know what to ask. She’s very organized. Okay. She can come. That… that would be good. Is there anything I need to do before the tests? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Yes. Fasting bloodwork – twelve hours, no food or drink except water. And for the cardiac evaluation, you’ll need to inform the technician of any medications you’ve taken recently. The requisitions have the lab and clinic addresses and phone numbers. My nurse will also provide you with a list of instructions. And, Mr. Kochubey, I want you to understand something. It’s okay to ask questions. It’s okay to express your concerns. And it’s okay to advocate for yourself. Now, I believe that covers everything. Please schedule your tests as soon as possible. My nurse will be in to discuss follow-up scheduling. Do you have any final questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I… I just want to feel better. That’s all. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get the tests done.
