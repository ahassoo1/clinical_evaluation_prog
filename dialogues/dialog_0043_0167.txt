DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot is… hurting. A lot. It has a sore, a bad one, and it won't get better. I have… the sugar sickness, you know? The diabetes. It’s on my foot.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. You're experiencing pain in your foot, and you suspect it's related to your diabetes. Can you tell me a bit more about this sore?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. It started… oh, maybe a month ago? Small, at first. I thought it was just a scrape, you know? From walking barefoot. But it got bigger. And red. Now it feels… deep. And it hurts to walk, even with shoes. It's on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. I try to keep it clean, but… it doesn't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it began about a month ago as a small scrape, has been getting larger and more red, and is now causing you significant pain with ambulation. You mentioned trying to keep it clean. Can you describe how you’ve been cleaning it, and what, if anything, you’ve been using to cover it?
PATIENT: I wash it with soap and water, every day. Just regular soap. And I put a bandage on it. The… the fluffy kind? With the sticky tape. Sometimes I use two bandages if it seems… bad. I haven’t been using anything on the sore itself, just the bandages to keep it covered. Is that wrong? I didn’t know what else to do. My wife… she always took care of things like this, but… she is gone now. It’s just me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to ask questions, Mr. Stoegbauer. You're doing the best you can, and it's good you’re being proactive. Keeping it clean is a very important first step. Now, let’s take a closer look at the sore itself. Would you mind if I examined your foot?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all, Doctor. Please do. I want it fixed, if that is possible. It is… worrying me. I haven't been sleeping well, thinking about it. It just doesn't seem right. Here, you can look. I took my shoe and sock off already.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see the sore here on the plantar surface, near your toes. It appears approximately two centimeters in diameter, with some surrounding redness and a bit of drainage. It is tender to the touch, and I do notice some warmth in the area. Your pulses are present, but slightly diminished in your left foot compared to your right. I’m also going to check your sensation in your foot. This is important, given your diabetes. Could you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Okay. It hurts when you touch it, yes. Not like a sharp pain, but… a dull ache. And yes, I feel it, but not as strong as… like when I touch my hand. It feels… far away, almost. Is that bad? I try to feel things, but sometimes it’s hard to tell. My legs, they sometimes feel… numb, you know? Especially at night. I thought it was just from getting old.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Stoegbauer. The reduced sensation you’re experiencing is a common complication of diabetes, known as neuropathy. It’s important because it can make it difficult to detect injuries like this sore, and it also slows down the healing process. The fact that you can feel it, even if diminished, is good, but it does warrant close attention. Given the size of the sore, the redness, the tenderness, and your history of diabetes and neuropathy, I am concerned about a possible infection. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. We’ll need a wound culture to identify any bacteria present, and a blood test to check for signs of infection in your system. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want it to get better. I don't want to lose my foot. My wife… she always said I needed to take care of it, with the sugar sickness. So yes, tests are good. Whatever you need. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: The tests are relatively straightforward, Mr. Stoegbauer. The wound culture involves gently cleaning the sore and taking a small sample of the drainage with a swab – it shouldn't cause significant pain, perhaps a brief pinch. The blood test will just be a standard needle stick, similar to what you might experience at your annual check-up. I’m going to order those tests right away, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, it’s very important to keep weight off your foot as much as possible. Do you have a cane or walker at home?
PATIENT: A cane, yes. I use it sometimes, when my legs are feeling weak. But I mostly just try to be careful. I don’t want to fall. My wife… she worried about me falling. I try to sit more, when I can. And I try to keep the bandage clean, like you said.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Mr. Stoegbauer. Using the cane when you feel unsteady is a very wise idea. We'll also need to ensure that you have proper footwear. Are you wearing shoes that provide good support and relieve pressure on your foot?
PATIENT: Oh, these are just slippers. Comfortable, you know? But… I guess they don't have much support. My wife… she bought them for me, years ago. I haven't really worn proper shoes since… since she passed. I mostly just stay inside.
DOCTOR: I understand. Comfortable is important, but with your diabetes and this sore, proper footwear is crucial to prevent further injury and promote healing. I’m going to write you a prescription for a pair of diabetic shoes. They’re designed to provide extra cushioning, support, and relieve pressure on your foot. I’ll also give you a referral to a podiatrist – a foot specialist – who can help you with proper foot care and ensure a good fit. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… very good, Doctor. Shoes and a specialist… yes, that would be a big help. I don’t want this to get worse. My wife… she always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: It sounds like your wife was a wonderful advocate for your health, Mr. Stoegbauer. We'll do our best to provide the care you need. While we await the results of the tests, I recommend elevating your foot whenever possible, keeping it clean and dry, and avoiding walking on it unless absolutely necessary. I'm also going to review your current medications to ensure they're not interfering with wound healing. Do you have a list of all the medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I have it right here. Let me see… There's the pills for the sugar sickness, the ones for my heart, and… something for my knees. And I take a vitamin, sometimes. Just a little one, every morning. Here you go.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Stoegbauer. This is very helpful. I see you're taking Metformin and Lisinopril, which is good for managing your diabetes and blood pressure. The medication for your knees is important as well. I'll make a note of everything. To summarize, we’ve ordered a wound culture and blood tests, I'm writing a prescription for diabetic shoes and a referral to a podiatrist, and we’ve reviewed your medications. We’ll follow up as soon as the test results are available, likely within a few days. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. My wife… she would have been very pleased. I just hope this gets better. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Stoegbauer. We'll do everything we can to get you back on your feet. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, or fever. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to go over discharge instructions and schedule your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you today. Take care of yourself, and remember, we’re here to support you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much.
