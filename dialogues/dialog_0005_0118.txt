DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Donato, is it? Yes. It’s about this… certification. One has to keep up with these things, you understand. Though frankly, I’ve been doing this for… a very long time. I believe it’s for my hearing, or perhaps my vision. Something along those lines. It’s all rather… bureaucratic, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Bureaucracy is… a fact of life, unfortunately. So, this certification requires a medical assessment, specifically for hearing or vision?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven’t the foggiest. They sent a… a form. A very official-looking form. It mentioned something about ensuring I can still… perform my duties, as they put it. I suppose it’s one or the other. Or possibly both. It’s all rather hazy, if you must know. I generally leave these things to my… former wife. She handled the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you’re unsure what specifically they want assessed. Let's start with your hearing. Have you noticed any difficulty hearing lately?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Well, that depends on what you mean by “difficulty.” Things aren't as sharp as they once were, naturally. One gets older, you see. And people mumble these days. Absolutely dreadful. It's not so much my hearing, I assure you, as the general decline in… enunciation. But, to answer your question directly... perhaps a little. Especially the higher frequencies, I believe. Though I wouldn't say it's troublesome.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get a basic audiological screening done, just to have a baseline. Then we can move on to your vision, and see if that requires further investigation. Do you have any history of noise exposure – working in a loud environment, things like that?
PATIENT: Noise exposure… Hmm. Well, I did spend a rather… formative period in the Merchant Navy, you see. A lot of engine noise, admittedly. But that was decades ago. And one adapts, doesn’t one? It certainly didn’t seem to impair me at the time. Though, thinking about it… there was that one incident in the boiler room… But it was a minor thing, really. Nothing to concern oneself with, I’m sure. It’s all rather… distant now.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll still proceed with the hearing test. It's standard procedure, especially given your history. Now, can you tell me about any current vision problems?
PATIENT: Current vision problems… Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always had excellent eyesight. Rather fortunate, you see. Though… I do find reading increasingly… taxing. The print seems to get smaller and smaller these days. And the light… it’s never quite right, is it? But I assure you, it's nothing dramatic. I wouldn’t be needing spectacles, if that’s what you’re implying. I’ve managed perfectly well for… well, for a very long time. Perhaps it’s simply a matter of fatigue. Yes, fatigue. That’s likely it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you’re experiencing some difficulty with near vision – reading. That's perfectly normal as people age. It's called presbyopia. We can certainly check that. Now, let's proceed with a quick visual acuity test, just to confirm everything. I'll need you to read the letters on this chart, starting with the top row.
PATIENT: A chart? Really, Doctor? I assure you, this is quite unnecessary. I can see perfectly well. But very well, if you insist. Though I maintain it’s a waste of both our time. Let's get this over with. Though, I must warn you, if you find any… deficiencies, I shall consider it a personal affront.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Oriley. Let’s stop there for a moment. It appears you have some difficulty reading the smaller letters, indicating a likely refractive error and the expected age-related decline in near vision. Your visual acuity is approximately 20/30 in your right eye and 20/25 in your left. Now, let's talk about what this means, and what options we have. It’s very common at your age. We can discuss prescription eyeglasses, or contacts if you prefer.
PATIENT: Eyeglasses? Me? Doctor, are you quite serious? I’ve never needed eyeglasses in my life. And frankly, I find the very suggestion… demeaning. It must be a mistake. Perhaps the lighting in here is inadequate? Or the chart is poorly printed? I assure you, my vision is perfectly acceptable. I manage perfectly well, thank you very much. I simply have no patience for… blurry print. It’s a matter of concentration, not… deficiency. I think I’ve had enough of this examination, actually. Perhaps a second opinion would be… prudent.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, I am a trained medical professional. I am simply presenting you with objective findings from a standard vision test. While I understand your reluctance to accept these results, dismissing them outright is not helpful. However, if you truly prefer, I can provide a referral to an ophthalmologist for a second opinion. But I strongly advise you to consider the possibility that you do have a refractive error and could benefit from corrective lenses. It would improve your quality of life considerably. Before we proceed, do you have any other concerns I can address?
PATIENT: Corrective lenses… Honestly, the very idea. It's… undignified. And I’m perfectly capable of managing perfectly well without them, thank you. A second opinion? Perhaps. Though I doubt another doctor would disagree with my assessment – that this whole process is rather unnecessary. But very well. A referral, if you insist. Though I shall be most displeased if it simply confirms your… findings. And as for other concerns… yes, actually. I find your bedside manner rather… condescending. I expect a certain level of deference, Doctor. After all, I’ve lived a long and productive life. A little respect would be… appreciated. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe that’s all for today. I trust you can arrange the referral promptly?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. I will arrange a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly respected ophthalmologist in the area. Her contact information will be sent to your email address immediately. I understand your concerns regarding my… demeanor, and I apologize if I came across as disrespectful. It was not my intention. I will also include a note detailing the results of today’s examination. Please follow up with Dr. Sharma as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Though, I do hope you will reflect on our conversation and consider a more… empathetic approach to your patients in the future. It makes a significant difference, you see. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have more pressing matters to attend to. Good day.
DOCTOR: Some people… .
