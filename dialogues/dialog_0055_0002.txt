DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that's me. Hmm... what brings me in? Well, it's… going to the bathroom. It's a little hard now, you see? Not like it used to be. Takes a bit of… pushing. That’s what my husband said, anyway. I forget things sometimes, so… he reminded me.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty with bowel movements, you're saying. And your husband has noticed you straining… That’s helpful information, thank you. How long has this been going on, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Oh, straining, yes, that's it! He's a good man, my John. How long… now that’s a tricky one. A while. Not… not just yesterday, that's for sure. Maybe… a few weeks? Months? Everything feels the same these days, you know? I really can't say for certain. It just... got harder.
DOCTOR: A few weeks to months… alright. And would you describe the stool as normal in appearance, or have you noticed any changes in color, consistency, or frequency, besides the difficulty passing it?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Changes… Now you're asking things I don't really look at, you know? It's brown, I think. Usually. I haven't noticed any… anything different, really. Just hard to… get it out. Like a cork, maybe? John usually notices those things more than I do. He always says I'm too busy with my plants.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to recall those specifics. And your husband is observant, it seems. Has there been any blood in the stool, or around the rectal area?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness no! Not that I've seen. John would have said something, wouldn't he? He's very particular about things like that. No, definitely no blood. I’m pretty sure. It hasn’t worried me too much, not yet anyway. Just… uncomfortable. And tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my tummy… Sometimes it feels a little… full. Bloated, yes, that's the word. Like I ate too much. But no pain, not really. And no… throwing up. Never been much of a thrower-upper, thankfully. Nausea? I don’t think so. I get a little dizzy sometimes, but that’s just getting old, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Diziness, alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Oh, just the little white pill for my water. The doctor gave it to me when my feet started swelling. And sometimes a little something for my joints. They ache, you know? But that’s it, I think. Nothing else regularly. John helps me with those, mostly. I forget if I've taken them some days!
DOCTOR: A medication for water retention and something for joint pain… do you recall the names of those medications, or perhaps do you bring a list with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, names! No, I don’t. John keeps track of all that. He has a little book at home. I wouldn’t even know where to start with those names. They're little pills, different colours. The water one is white, I think, and the joint one… maybe yellow? I really don't pay attention, I’m sorry. I just take what he gives me.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Stoffregen. We can certainly find out the names later. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or do you have any significant medical conditions like diabetes, heart problems, or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Oh, goodness. Let me see… When I was a young woman, I had a bad flu. Had to stay in the hospital for a bit. And… when I had my son, of course. But other than that… I don’t think so. No heart problems. No… sugar sickness, is it? John always tells me I eat too much sweet potato. He worries about me, he does.
DOCTOR: A previous flu hospitalization and hospitalization for childbirth… no history of diabetes or heart problems. And has anyone in your family suffered from any serious medical conditions, such as colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother… she had a weak stomach. Always complaining. And my brother, he had some trouble with… with his insides, I think. But I don't really know what it was. Something bad. He passed away a long time ago. John knows more about the family history, I suspect. He's very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: History of digestive issues in the family… Alright. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or engage in regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no to the smoking! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… just a little glass of wine sometimes with dinner. John likes a beer, though. Physical activity… Well, I do a lot of gardening. That’s exercise, isn’t it? Bending and digging and… pulling weeds. It keeps me busy. Not much running around, though!
DOCTOR: Gardening… that's good. Now, Ms. Stoffregen, I'm going to need to conduct a physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your abdomen and then I’ll need to perform a rectal exam. This will help me assess the situation further. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam? Listening to my tummy, that’s alright, I suppose. But… a rectal exam? Oh dear. What does that involve? I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that. Is it… necessary? I trust you, Doctor, but… it sounds a little… invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Stoffregen. A rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating constipation, and it's crucial for ruling out any serious causes, such as polyps or masses. It allows me to assess the tone of your sphincter, check for any tenderness, and look for any signs of blood. It’s a quick procedure, and I will ensure your privacy and comfort throughout. However, without it, it would be difficult to provide you with an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. We can discuss alternative options, but they would likely involve more extensive and potentially more uncomfortable testing, such as a colonoscopy. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A colonoscopy? That sounds… frightening. You mean… they put a camera inside? No, no thank you. If you really think it’s necessary… the other thing, then. But please be quick. And gentle. I'm a bit of a… sensitive lady. And explain everything as you go, alright? I like to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Stoffregen. I will explain each step as I proceed and ensure your comfort as much as possible. Please lie down on your left side, with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I’ll begin by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It might be a little cool on your skin. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Normal bowel sounds… somewhat sluggish, but present. Now, I’ll need you to bend your knees further and I’ll be performing a digital rectal exam. Please relax as much as possible. I will let you know when I’m finished.
