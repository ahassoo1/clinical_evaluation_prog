DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Fazzina, was it? Yes, yes… well, honestly? Just… curiosity, I suppose. My daughter kept saying I should get a check-up. She worries too much, that one. I feel fine, mostly. A little creaky, you know, at my age. But fine. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. It's probably good to just make sure everything's still… working.
DOCTOR: Yes, preventative care is always a good idea. It's good of your daughter to encourage that. “Creaky” is… a common complaint, certainly. So, just to clarify, you’re primarily here for a general check-up because your daughter suggested it, and you feel mostly well, but perhaps a little stiffness with age?
PATIENT: Stiffness is putting it nicely. It's more like… protesting, you know? Every morning, I sound like an old house settling. And honestly, I can't remember the last time I bent over and didn't groan. But it’s nothing a little heat and ignoring it doesn't fix. It's… I don't even know what you do at these things. Is it going to involve poking and prodding? I really don't like being poked and prodded. And needles? Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Protesting" is a good way to put it. And you're right to ask what a check-up involves. We’ll start with some questions about your overall health – things like past illnesses, medications you take, allergies, and family history. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief physical exam. We can definitely avoid anything you're uncomfortable with – no poking and prodding if you don't want it. And we won't even mention needles right now. Just to start, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Significant… that’s a big word. Let me think. My gallbladder, a long time ago. That was… unpleasant. And I broke my wrist when I was younger, trying to learn to ski. Bad idea, that was. Skiing is for young people. Oh, and… I had a hysterectomy. Ages ago. Before your daughter was even born, I think. Everything else… mostly just the usual colds and flu. Nothing serious, I don't think. My late husband, bless him, he was the one who always remembered the details. I was never very good with dates and medical things. Does any of that… matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, all of that matters, thank you for sharing. Gallbladder removal, a broken wrist, and a hysterectomy… those are all important pieces of your medical history. Knowing when these things happened is helpful, but not essential right now. And it's perfectly normal to not remember all the details. We can take our time. Do you currently take any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Oh! I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. I think it’s… amlodipine? Or something like that. My daughter fills the little pillbox for me every week. And I used to take a vitamin D supplement, but… honestly, I think I ran out a while ago and haven’t bothered getting more. She tells me I should, but… it’s just another thing to remember. And I take an aspirin every day, the doctor told me to years ago, for my heart. A baby aspirin. That's about it, I think. Unless you count the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that's not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine for blood pressure, a daily aspirin, and occasional ibuprofen. And you used to take vitamin D. That’s very helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband used to say I had a cast iron stomach. He was a very practical man. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Well, maybe dust. I sneeze a lot when I dust. But that’s not an allergy, is it? I don't get hives or anything. Just… sneezing. And a runny nose. Honestly, I think everyone sneezes when they dust. It's just… dust. Is that what you’re asking about? Proper allergies, like… swelling and trouble breathing? No. Never had any of that.
DOCTOR: No, dust is perfectly normal. You’re right to clarify. We’re looking for reactions like swelling, hives, or difficulty breathing. It sounds like you don’t have any of those. Now, I’m just going to ask a few questions about your family history, if that's alright. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a long story. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And she had arthritis, very bad arthritis in her hands. She couldn’t knit anymore towards the end. My father… he smoked too much. He had… something with his lungs. Emphysema, maybe? It was a long time ago. My brother… he was always healthy, thankfully. A strong man. My daughter… she worries too much about everything, but she’s healthy too. No major illnesses that I know of. Cancer… there was an aunt, on my husband's side, but it was… years ago. Does that… help? It’s all a bit muddled, honestly. I don’t keep track of these things. My husband did.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. High blood pressure and arthritis in your mother, possible emphysema in your father, and a history of cancer on your husband’s side. We'll make a note of all of that. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I’ve never smoked. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and my husband… well, he didn’t approve. He used to say it smelled terrible. He was a very sensible man, my husband. I used to complain about other people's smoke, though. Especially when we were younger and people smoked everywhere. It always made my eyes water. But me? Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I certainly don’t now. I don’t like the smell of it. It’s a dreadful habit. A dreadful habit indeed.
DOCTOR: Good. That's very good to know. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Not every night, mind you. Only when I’m feeling… festive. Or if my daughter is visiting. She likes to share a glass with me. It’s nice. But nothing more than that. I’m not a big drinker. Never have been. I prefer tea, honestly. A nice cup of green tea. Much healthier, you know. And it doesn’t give me a headache. Alcohol… just a little, on special occasions. And only with my daughter. It’s more social, you see.
DOCTOR: Just a glass of wine occasionally with your daughter. That’s good to know. Now, do you exercise regularly, or have any hobbies that keep you active?
PATIENT: Exercise… Well, I wouldn't call it exercise. I walk, sometimes. To the grocery store. And back. That’s about it. I used to garden, when my husband was alive. But my knees aren't what they used to be. And honestly, I don’t have the energy anymore. I like to read. And watch television. And… visit with my daughter. Does that count? She takes me out to lunch sometimes. And we go shopping. But proper exercise? No. Not really. I'm more of a… homebody, I suppose. I prefer the quiet. And a good book. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Reading and spending time with your daughter are wonderful ways to stay active and engaged. Alright, Ms. Calvery. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now, if that's okay. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your reflexes. It won’t take long. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. I suppose so. But no poking and prodding, remember? And be gentle. My skin is… delicate. And I don't like surprises. Just tell me what you're doing before you do it. And please don’t use that cold stethoscope thing. That always makes me shiver. Is that too much to ask? Just… be gentle. And no surprises. And no cold things. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No poking and prodding, gentle touch, no surprises, and a warm stethoscope. I promise. Okay, I’m just listening to your heart now. Take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning, but we’ll make a note of it. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 142/88. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Alright, that’s all for the exam. Nothing to worry about at this point, just some things we’ll keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Oh… a murmur? What does that mean? And elevated? Is that bad? I knew I shouldn't have had that extra glass of wine last week. My daughter is going to be furious. And diminished reflexes… am I… losing my mind? I told you, I feel creaky. But losing my mind is a bit much, isn’t it? You said nothing to worry about, but… a murmur and diminished reflexes don’t sound very good. Are you sure it’s nothing? Maybe I should just stick to tea. And stay in bed. A lot.
DOCTOR: Let's take a deep breath, Ms. Calvery. A murmur simply means there's an extra sound when your heart beats. Many people have them, and they’re not always a cause for concern. We'll just want to monitor it over time. As for your blood pressure, it’s slightly elevated, but that can fluctuate depending on many factors – stress, diet, even the time of day. An extra glass of wine last week likely contributed, but it's not a major issue at this point. We can discuss strategies to help lower it, like dietary changes and regular walks. And diminished reflexes are common as we age. It doesn't mean you're losing your mind! It just means your nervous system is slowing down a little, which is perfectly normal. Think of it like an old engine – it still works, but it might not rev as high as it used to. I want to assure you, everything sounds manageable at this point. I'm not overly concerned. I'd like to order some blood work to get a better picture of your overall health, including a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel. And I'd recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to recheck your blood pressure and discuss the results of the blood work. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work… Oh dear. I hate needles. Absolutely hate them. Can’t you just… tell me what’s wrong without poking me? And a lipid panel? What is a lipid panel? Is that anything serious? And three months? That seems like a long time to wait. What if something is really wrong? And what if I forget to come back? My daughter will have to drag me, I just know it. She's always telling me I need to get things checked. This is all very… stressful. I think I need a cup of tea. And a lie-down. Can I at least promise to try and walk more? And avoid wine? Is that enough? Perhaps that’s all I can manage right now. Tea, walking, and no wine. It’s not much, but it’s a start.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension about needles, Ms. Calvery. And you’re right to ask questions. A lipid panel is a simple blood test that checks your cholesterol levels – it helps us assess your risk for heart disease. It's a routine test, and we can discuss options to make the process as comfortable as possible. And you're right, three months does seem like a long time. But it's generally a good timeframe to see if any lifestyle changes make a difference. We can always schedule sooner if you're concerned. And I'll send a reminder to your daughter as well, if you'd like. Tea, walking, and no wine is a fantastic start! It's more than enough. Focusing on small, achievable goals is the best approach. We'll start with the blood work, and I'll make a note to discuss options to minimize your discomfort. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for three months from today. Before we finish, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: Well… Will the blood work take long? I have a hair appointment on Thursday. And I don’t want to ruin my curls. And… is there anything I need to do before the blood work? Fast or anything? I always forget those things. And what if I get dizzy? I get dizzy easily. And will the results be sent to my daughter? She'll worry herself sick if she sees anything she doesn't understand. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. This is all very… complicated. And tiring. I think I need that cup of tea now. And maybe a little biscuit. It’s a stressful day, you see. A very stressful day indeed.
DOCTOR: That’s all perfectly reasonable to ask, Ms. Calvery. The blood work should only take about 15-20 minutes, and yes, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – meaning no food or drinks other than water. I'll give you a written order with specific instructions. And yes, you may feel a little dizzy, so please let the phlebotomist know, and we can have you sit down for a bit afterwards. And regarding your daughter, we can send her a summary of the results, but we’ll also schedule a time for us to discuss them together, so she doesn't worry unnecessarily. I'll make a note of that. I understand this is a lot to take in. We’ll take things one step at a time. Here’s the order for the blood work, and the appointment card for three months from today. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And yes, a cup of tea and a biscuit sound like a very good idea. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you. This is… a lot of information. I'll have to ask my daughter to read it. She's much better with these things. And I'll try not to forget the fasting. I really will. It’s just… my memory isn't what it used to be. I think that’s all. Unless… is there anything I should be doing to prepare for the blood work? Besides fasting, of course. Should I drink extra water? Or avoid anything else? And… is there a comfortable chair in the waiting room? My knees aren’t very good, you see. I really appreciate you being so patient with me. This whole thing is rather… overwhelming. And tiring. Honestly, I think I just need a nap. And that cup of tea. And maybe a little biscuit. It’s been a long day. A very long day indeed.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Calvery. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. Yes, please drink plenty of water in the days leading up to the blood work – that will make the process easier. And yes, there are comfortable chairs in the waiting room. I'll make a note to let the receptionist know you might need one. Don't worry about a thing. Just focus on getting a good night's sleep and drinking plenty of water. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I'll see you in three months. Take care, Ms. Calvery, and enjoy your tea and biscuit.
