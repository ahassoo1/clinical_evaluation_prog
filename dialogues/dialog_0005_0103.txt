DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It's my back, see? Lower back. Been botherin’ me for… well, a while now. It just aches, mostly. Feels like… old.
DOCTOR: "A while now," you say. That could mean a lot of things. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right, you're right. Sorry. Um… maybe six months, I think? Started slow, just a little stiffness after I’d been sittin’ too long. But it’s gotten worse. Now it hurts even when I’m just… standin’. Not all the time, but a lot. It just feels… weak, like it might give out.
DOCTOR: Weak, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, weak. Like… when I bend over to pick somethin’ up, I gotta be real careful. And sometimes… sometimes there’s a sharp pain, quick like. But that don’t happen every time. Mostly just the ache. My daughter, she says I shouldn't be liftin' things at my age anyway. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this happens when you’re bending, lifting… anything else trigger it?
PATIENT: Well… walkin’ sometimes. Not always, but if I walk too far… especially if it's uphill… then it starts to bother me. And sittin’ for too long, like I said. That’s the worst, I think. Makes it real stiff. Doctor, is it… serious?
DOCTOR: “Serious” is a strong word. At your age, things wear down. It's to be expected. But we'll take a look. Have you ever had any injuries to your back?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I remember anyway. I used to work construction, years and years ago. Heavy liftin’, lots of bendin’, but… never a fall or nothin’. Just… hard work. It just always hurt a little after a long day. This is… different, though. More constant.
DOCTOR: Construction work… alright. Any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. Not at all. My feet get a little cold sometimes, but that's just… old age, I figure. They don’t feel numb, just… chilly. I always wear thick socks.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have you stand up for me. I'm going to take a look at your back, just to see what we're dealing with. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Touch my toes? I don’t know if I can touch my toes anymore, Doctor. Oh… that's not so good. Feels tight. Very tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. I see some muscle spasm here on your left side. Tenderness to palpation along the lumbar spine… and limited range of motion. Not surprising, given what you've told me. Straight leg raise is negative bilaterally… no radiating pain there, thankfully.
PATIENT: Negative? What does that mean, Doctor? Is that… good? And muscle spasm… is that bad? I don’t even know what that feels like. Just achey. Everything just feels achey.
DOCTOR: “Negative” means we didn't find anything seriously wrong with your nerves. Good. Muscle spasm just means your muscles are tight and guarding, trying to protect your back. It's common when you have pain. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything bad is going on… just uncomfortable. Now, have you tried any pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My daughter, she gives me ibuprofen sometimes. Helps a little, but not much. It doesn’t last long, and I don't like takin' pills if I don’t have to. Makes me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: “Funny” how?
PATIENT: Well… kinda dizzy. And my stomach, it gets upset. Just… not a good feelin'. I'd rather just deal with the ache, honestly, than feel like that. It's just… I'm old, Doctor. Maybe it's just my age catchin’ up to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history and the physical exam… it sounds like you're dealing with a simple case of lumbar strain, likely aggravated by your past work and age. We can try some conservative management. I'm going to recommend a course of physical therapy—strengthening exercises, stretching—and I'll prescribe a muscle relaxant—a low dose—to help with the spasm. We'll start with that and see how you respond. If it doesn’t improve within a few weeks, we can discuss further options. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Never had any. Physical therapy… that sounds… good. I can try that. I don't like the idea of pills, but… if it helps, I guess I can try them. What does the therapy involve, exactly? Lots of bendin’ and liftin’? Because my daughter… she worries about that.
DOCTOR: No, not like that. It's controlled movements, stretches to improve your flexibility and strengthen your core muscles. It’s not about pushing yourself to the point of pain. The therapist will tailor a program specifically for you, based on your limitations. We'll start slow, and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. It’s a lot less strenuous than construction work, I assure you. I'm sending the prescription to your pharmacy now, and I'll have my nurse give you a referral for physical therapy before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That sounds… better. Controlled movements. That's good. And the nurse will give me the paper for the therapy? Fine. No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Just… thank you. I appreciate you takin' the time to look at me. It's just nice to know what's goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Follow up with me in four weeks if you aren't seeing any improvement. And try to stay active—gentle walking, stretching—but don't overdo it. My nurse will be in shortly with the referral and discharge instructions. Have a good day, Mr. Vankampen.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you again. You too.
