DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… hard to explain exactly. I just… can’t seem to get everything out when I go to the bathroom. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It's frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. And when you state "everything," could you be more specific, please?
PATIENT: Well, I feel like I have to… push, to get it all out. And even then, it doesn’t feel like everything comes out. Like there’s still… something left in there. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And I have to go back more often because of it, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. So, incomplete evacuation. Increased frequency. No pain, you stated. Have you noticed any changes in the consistency of your stool?
PATIENT: Consistency… hmm. I haven’t really paid attention to that, Doctor. I guess… it looks normal enough. Maybe a little… thinner sometimes? But I don't really know what “normal” looks like, if you understand. I just know it’s harder to… finish. It feels like trying to squeeze the last bit of water from a sponge, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A vague comparison, but noted. And has there been any blood in the stool, or around the rectal area?
PATIENT: Blood… no, not that I’ve seen. I always check, you know, just to be sure. Nothing like that. It's just the… the feeling of not being empty, and having to go so often. It's really started to bother me, Doctor. Especially when I'm out fishing. It's… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Fishing, yes. I see your occupation. And you stated this started approximately a month ago?
PATIENT: About a month, yeah. Maybe a little longer. It started slow, just feeling like I didn’t quite get everything out after going. I thought maybe I ate something bad, you know? But it hasn't gone away. It's… constant now. It worries me a little, honestly. It's not like me to have trouble with things like this.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to some broader questions then. Do you have any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, but that was a long time ago. No diabetes, no heart trouble. I’ve always been pretty healthy, really. Aside from this… problem. And… my wife, she passed away a few years back. But that wasn’t a medical thing, just… sad.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy. Loss of spouse. Noted. Any surgical history other than the appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, sir. Just the appendix. Never had any other operations. And I try to keep myself healthy, you know? Eat good food, get enough sleep… or, I try to get enough sleep. It's hard sometimes, thinking about… well, never mind. Just the appendix. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Family history. Any instances of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or other gastrointestinal issues in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had some trouble with her stomach when she was older, but I don’t know exactly what it was. She didn’t talk much about it. And my grandfather on my wife’s side… he had some sort of… blockage, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t know much about it. We didn't talk about health a lot in my family, Doctor. It was more of a… “tough it out” kind of thing.
DOCTOR: Right. Social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no, Doctor! I don’t do any of those things. Never have. I drink a little tea sometimes, but that’s it. A nice cup of chamomile before bed. That’s all. I’ve always lived a pretty clean life. I need to be sharp for fishing, you know? Can’t be doing any of that… that stuff.
DOCTOR: No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Chamomile tea. And allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I can eat anything, pretty much. Been eating fish all my life, haven’t had any trouble with that! Although… sometimes I get a little itchy after being bitten by mosquitos, but that's not an allergy, is it? Just annoying.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed with a physical examination then. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm not used to a lot of doctoring, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your left side, knees drawn up. I will begin with an abdominal exam, then a digital rectal exam. This is necessary to assess the tone of your sphincter and check for any masses or abnormalities. It may be somewhat uncomfortable, but it should be brief.
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh. Alright. Just… let me know when you're starting, Doctor. It’s been a long time since I’ve… had one of those. I appreciate you telling me what’s going to happen. It makes me feel a little better.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all quadrants. Sphincter tone is normal. No palpable masses detected. Stool is brown, guaiac negative. Examination unremarkable. However, your symptoms warrant further investigation. We need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Unremarkable… that’s good, right? But… further investigation? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm starting to worry a little. I just want to get back to fishing, to be honest. What kind of investigation are we talking about?
DOCTOR: “Unremarkable” simply means I did not find any obvious abnormalities during the exam. It does not rule out everything. Given your age and symptoms, we need to perform a colonoscopy to visualize the entire colon and rule out polyps, inflammation, or other underlying causes. It is the standard of care. I will issue a referral to Dr. Elara Vance, a gastroenterologist. She is very capable. I'll also order a complete blood count and a stool analysis to check for infection or inflammation. Do you have any questions about the referral or the tests?
PATIENT: A… a colonoscopy? That sounds… invasive, Doctor. And expensive, probably. I’m on Medicare, you know. Will it be covered? And… what if they find something? I’m not sure I want to know about… everything that could be wrong. This is a lot to take in. I just came in because I couldn’t empty my bladder completely, and now you’re talking about… all this. It’s overwhelming, to be honest. Is there… anything else we can try first? Before the colonoscopy?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, I understand your concerns. However, a colonoscopy is the most effective way to determine the cause of your symptoms and prevent potentially serious complications. Medicare will cover the procedure, provided it is deemed medically necessary – and given your presentation, it is. As for “trying something else first”, a high-fiber diet and increased fluid intake are always recommended, but they are unlikely to resolve your issue. Further delay could allow a problem to worsen. I will provide you with the referral form. Dr. Vance’s office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Please call them as soon as possible. I also have a pamphlet on colonoscopy preparation. Read it carefully. Do you have any further questions regarding the colonoscopy procedure itself?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… alright. I suppose if you say it's the best thing to do… It just… doesn’t sound pleasant. Preparation, you say? I assume that’s… emptying everything out? Well, I guess I'll call Dr. Vance’s office. Thank you, Doctor. Even though it’s… not what I wanted to hear. I appreciate you explaining everything, as much as I dislike what I’m hearing. Is there anything else I should be doing while I’m waiting for the appointment? Anything to… make things a little more comfortable? Besides drinking tea?
DOCTOR: A high-fiber diet, as previously mentioned. Ensure adequate hydration. And over-the-counter stool softeners can provide some temporary relief. But these are only adjunctive measures. The colonoscopy is paramount. I have other patients waiting. If you have no further questions regarding the colonoscopy, I believe we are finished here. Here is a summary of your visit. Please follow up with Dr. Vance as instructed. .
