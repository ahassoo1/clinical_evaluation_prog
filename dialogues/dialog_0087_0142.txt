DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Lawther. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Thanks for seein' me. It's... well, it's my head. Been gettin' these headaches. Bad ones. And I get all sweaty when they hit, and my heart kinda races. It's been happenin' on and off for… a while now, I guess. Honestly, time kinda blurs.
DOCTOR: I see. Headaches with sweating and a racing heart – that certainly sounds concerning. When you say "a while now," could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that's the tricky part. It feels like... maybe six months? Could be longer. I really can't put my finger on it. Things just kinda… happen. I remember one really bad one around… Christmas, maybe? But before that… hazy. I just know it's been enough to start worryin' me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It's not uncommon for time to feel distorted when dealing with ongoing discomfort. So, these headaches have been occurring for roughly six months, with one particularly memorable episode around Christmas. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Right, yeah. Okay... they start kinda slow, like a pressure buildin' up behind my eyes. Then it just hits. Feels like someone’s squeezin' my whole head in a vise, if that makes sense? It's usually on both sides, not just one spot. And it’s not like a normal headache, you know? It’s… deeper. And like I said, the sweaty thing happens pretty quick after it starts, and my heart just goes thump-thump-thump. It's scary, to be honest. Lasts… maybe an hour or two? Sometimes longer. I usually just gotta lie down in a dark room.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite debilitating, and I understand why it would be frightening. A vise-like pressure, affecting both sides of the head, accompanied by sweating and palpitations… that's helpful information. Do these headaches have any triggers that you've noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggers. That's a good question. I haven't really… kept track, to be honest. I mean, I work in a warehouse, so it's kinda noisy and busy all day. Could be stress? I got divorced a couple years back, so that's always hangin' over my head, I guess. And I don't sleep great. Sometimes I wake up with a headache already startin'. Does that count? I dunno. I really haven’t figured out if anything causes 'em. They just… happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potential triggers could include stress – both from work and the divorce – and possibly disrupted sleep. It's not uncommon for headaches to be linked to those factors. Let's talk about your sleep a bit more. Could you describe a typical night for you?
PATIENT: Uh, sure. Well, I usually get home from work around six, try to make somethin' for dinner. Then I just kinda… zone out. Watch TV, scroll on my phone. I try to be in bed by ten, but I usually toss and turn for a good hour before I actually fall asleep. And I wake up a lot. Sometimes I'll get up to get a glass of water, or just… lie there thinkin'. Definitely don’t get a solid eight hours, that’s for sure. It's usually more like five, maybe six if I'm lucky. And like I said, sometimes I wake up with a headache already startin'. It’s a mess, really.
DOCTOR: That does sound disruptive. Interrupted sleep and waking with headaches are both concerning. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, played baseball, stupid mistake. And I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox and all that. But no serious illnesses, no. And I haven’t really… been to the doctor much since I was a kid, honestly. I'm usually okay, just kinda tough it out. That’s why I’m here now, I guess. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t really “tough it out” anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history, and childhood illnesses only. That’s helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgery. Nope. Just the broken arm, and that was just a cast. They didn't have to cut me or anything. I don’t really like hospitals, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. No surgeries. Now, thinking about your family—are there any members of your family who suffer from headaches or migraines?
PATIENT: Uh… good question. My mom used to get headaches sometimes, but she was always busy, runnin' around with stuff. I think they were just regular headaches, you know? Not like these. My dad… I don’t really remember him complainin’ about headaches. He… he passed away a long time ago. And I don’t really keep in touch with my siblings. So, honestly, I don’t really know. Sorry I can't be more helpful. It’s kinda hazy when I think about them.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize. It’s common to not have a complete family medical history. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Not really. I take some ibuprofen sometimes, when the headache gets really bad, but that’s about it. And it doesn’t always help, honestly. Just kinda takes the edge off, maybe. And I don't take anything regularly. I try to avoid pills if I can. Just don't like feelin' all… foggy.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed for the headaches, but nothing regular. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a neurological exam to check your reflexes, coordination, and vision. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's… fine. Whatever you need to do, Doc. I just wanna figure out what's goin' on. Hopefully it's not somethin' serious. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit up here for me, please. Blood pressure is 130/85, pulse is 88 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Coordination appears intact. Vision is grossly normal. I also check his cranial nerves. No focal neurological deficits noted. Neurological exam is normal, no immediate concerns there. Everything appears structurally intact. I do note some mild tenderness to palpation in your temporal arteries, but it’s not particularly significant at this point.
PATIENT: Temporal arteries? What’s that mean? Is that bad? I don't even know what that is. I just know my head hurts, and I'm tired. Is it somethin' serious, Doc? I've got a warehouse job, I need to be able to work.
DOCTOR: No, it’s alright to be concerned, but let’s not jump to conclusions. The temporal arteries are the arteries on the sides of your head. Some tenderness there can be common with tension headaches, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. Based on what you've told me and the examination, the most likely possibility is tension headaches, possibly with some features of migraine. However, given the frequency and the associated symptoms of sweating and palpitations, I want to rule out other potential causes. To do that, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us check for things like infection, inflammation, and thyroid issues – things that can sometimes cause headaches. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Blood work sounds… good. If it'll help figure it out, yeah. I just wanna know what's wrong, you know? Sweatin' and my heart racin' is scary. Do I gotta be on an empty stomach? And how long does it take to get the results? I've got a shift tomorrow.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, and I agree, those symptoms are unsettling. Yes, for the blood work, you will need to be on an empty stomach—nothing to eat or drink for at least eight hours before the test. The lab is right down the hall, and they should be able to get it done quickly. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them once they are available. In the meantime, I’d like to recommend a few things you can do at home to help manage your symptoms. Have you tried over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen regularly—following the dosage instructions on the label, of course?
PATIENT: Yeah, I said I take ibuprofen sometimes, when it gets really bad. But "sometimes" is kinda all I do. I don't really take it every day or anything. I guess I could try… takin' it more often? If it'll help. And drink more water? My mom always told me to drink more water. Is there anything else? Like, should I be avoidin' somethin'? Certain foods or… anything?
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen as needed, and you’re right, staying hydrated is a good idea. As for things to avoid, it’s often helpful to keep a headache diary to see if you can identify any triggers. Pay attention to things like stress, sleep patterns, and foods or drinks you consume. Some people find that caffeine or alcohol can trigger headaches, but it varies from person to person. Given your history of stress and disrupted sleep, I also recommend exploring some stress-reduction techniques, like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga. Finally, if your headaches become significantly worse, are accompanied by fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. These could be signs of a more serious condition. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense, Doc. Headache diary, less stress, more sleep, watch the caffeine... and go to the ER if it gets really bad. I can do that. I'll try it. I just wanna feel normal again, you know? Thanks for listenin'. When should I come back to talk about the blood work?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lawther. I understand your desire to feel normal again, and we’ll work together to figure this out. My nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you within 48 hours, once the blood work results are available. She'll call you with a time that works for you. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And please, don’t push yourself too hard. Rest when you need to. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I think that’s everything. Just gotta get the blood work done and see what happens. Thanks again, Doc. You’ve been really helpful. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lawther. I’m glad I could help. Get the blood work done when you can, and we’ll talk soon. Have a good day. .
