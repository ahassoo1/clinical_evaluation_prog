DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s August 2nd. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Panjoj, was it? Yes, yes. Well, it's this… needing to go to the little boy's room. A lot. More than I used to, you see. It’s… bothersome, really. Wakes me up at night sometimes. Old age, I suppose. Though I don’t feel that old.
DOCTOR: It’s good to meet you, Mr. Segretto. And no, 74 isn’t old at all! Frequent urination can be a part of aging, but it’s important to figure out why it’s happening. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. To start, can you tell me a little more about this… needing to go?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it's not a painful thing, thankfully. Just… frequent. Like I said, especially at night. I used to sleep through, solid as a rock. Now? Now I'm up and down, up and down. My wife, bless her heart, she doesn’t mind too much, but it’s not good for either of us, is it? I drink… well, I drink a normal amount, I suppose. Not like I’m guzzling water all day, if that's what you're thinking. I have a glass with my meals, maybe a bit of juice in the afternoon. Nothing fancy. Does that… does that make sense? I forget what I'm saying sometimes.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Segretto. It’s perfectly normal to have a little trouble remembering things, and I appreciate you telling me all of this. So, it’s not painful, it's mostly at night, and you don't drink excessive amounts of fluids. Good. Now, besides the nighttime awakenings, do you find yourself needing to go frequently during the day as well?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, during the day too. Not as bad as at night, mind you. But I have to… plan things. You know? If I'm going to the store, I have to know where the… facilities are. And I can't drink a whole cup of coffee like I used to. Used to love a good strong cup. Now, it's just a little sip here and there. My wife makes a lovely herbal tea, so that’s alright. But yes, I'm thinking about it all the time, really. Where's the nearest restroom? Is it clean? This never used to be a concern! It's just… inconvenient, is what it is. A real nuisance.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. It sounds incredibly disruptive to have to constantly think about that, and it’s completely valid to feel frustrated. It’s good you’re being proactive about it. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the urine? Hmm. That’s a good question. I don't… I don't look at it, if you want to know the truth. My wife does the laundry, so she'd be the one to notice. She hasn't said anything, though. It looks… normal, I suppose. Yellow. Like it always is. I haven't seen any blood or anything like that, thank goodness. I don’t pay much attention to these things. Old men don’t, really. We just… deal with it. Is that a silly answer?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not silly at all, Mr. Segretto. It’s very common not to pay close attention to those details. And I appreciate your honesty. It's good to know your wife hasn't noticed anything unusual. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Diabetes… no, I don't think so. The doctor checked me for that years ago, said I was fine. My heart… well, it skips a beat sometimes. Gets a little fluttery. But the doctor said it’s nothing to worry about. Just old age, again. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, that's it. Nothing fancy. Used to be stronger, but… well, things change. My wife handles the pills, makes sure I take them. She’s a good woman, that one. Very organized. I don’t remember the name of the pill, though. Sorry. It's one of those little white ones, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Segretto. We can look that up. It’s good to know you take something for your blood pressure. And it's good your heart is being monitored. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm. Surgeries… let me think. Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. Back in Ukraine, it was… a simpler time. And I had a hernia operation, oh, must be twenty years ago now. Nothing major, really. A couple of days in the hospital, then back to work. And I was in the hospital once for a bad bout of pneumonia. That was a scare, I remember. But I recovered. And… I think that’s it. Nothing else comes to mind. My memory’s not what it used to be, you know. I'm always forgetting things. Don't ask me about dates, I wouldn't have a clue. My wife keeps track of all that. She's the smart one, really.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Segretto. Appendectomy, hernia repair, and pneumonia. We'll make a note of all that. And don't worry about the dates, I’m not going to quiz you! Now, is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – who has had similar problems with frequent urination or any kidney or bladder issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My father… he was a strong man. Never complained about much. My mother… she had a weak stomach, always with the indigestion. I don’t remember her having any trouble with… going to the bathroom, no. My brother, he lives back in Ukraine, haven't seen him in years. I wouldn’t know. My son… well, he’s a busy man, always working. I haven’t talked to him about these things. It’s not the sort of conversation you have, you know? Old men don’t talk about their… plumbing. It's embarrassing, really. So, no, I don’t think so. Not that I know of. But I don’t really ask. It's just… not polite.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Segretto. It’s often not something people discuss. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife wouldn’t allow it. She's very health-conscious, that one. Always telling me to eat my vegetables, get enough sleep. A good woman, really. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. A nice red wine. But nothing excessive. Just a small glass. For my health, you see. It’s good for the heart, they say. A small glass. That's all. Never smoked, though. Never even wanted to. Bad habit, you know? Bad for your lungs.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Segretto. And enjoying a glass of wine is perfectly fine. Now, do you do any regular exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… well, I used to be a farmer, back in Ukraine. That was exercise enough! Hard work, sunup to sundown. But now… now I mostly sit. Read the newspaper, watch a little television. My wife and I take a walk around the block sometimes, if the weather is nice. But it's not much. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And my back… oh, don't even get me started on my back! So, no, not really. I don't do any regular exercise. Just a little walking, if I’m feeling up to it. Mostly, I sit. It’s a quiet life, now. A comfortable life. But not a very active one, I’ll admit.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Segretto. It sounds like you’ve had a very full life, and it’s good you enjoy those walks with your wife when you can. Now, to finish up this part of the conversation, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Allergies… let me think. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always checks when she buys new food, makes sure it doesn’t have anything I’m allergic to. She’s very careful, that one. I remember being stung by a bee when I was a boy, but that was just a little pain. No allergies, though. No. I don’t think so. Unless… unless it’s something minor. But nothing serious. Nothing that requires a doctor’s attention. No allergies. Just a little pain from the bee when I was a boy. That was a long time ago, though. A very long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Segretto. No known allergies. Okay, that’s all the questions I have for now. Thank you for being so open and honest with me. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a simple neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Listen to my heart, check my stomach… I trust your judgment. Just don’t poke too hard, my stomach isn’t what it used to be! And don't take too long, my wife is expecting me home for lunch. She makes a lovely soup. A tomato soup, with little grilled cheese sandwiches. That's my favorite. But yes, go ahead. Do what you need to do. I'm a patient man, I'll sit still. Just be gentle with my stomach, alright? Old men have sensitive stomachs, you know.
DOCTOR: I will be very gentle, Mr. Segretto, I promise. Tomato soup and grilled cheese sounds wonderful. Okay, Mr. Segretto, I’m listening to your heart now. Breathe deeply for me, if you can. Your heart rate is a little fast, but the rhythm is regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, no pain there. A little… tender, maybe. But not pain. Just… sensitive. Like I said, old men have sensitive stomachs. You’re pressing on a lot of memories, I suppose. Years of hard work, years of eating whatever my wife put in front of me. It's just… tender. Not pain. Just… old. You're probably poking on something important, something that kept me going for a long time. Be gentle with it, alright? It's a valuable organ. A very valuable organ. And… is everything alright? Are you seeing something bad? Don't tell me if it's bad, though. I don’t want to know. Just tell me if everything is alright. Please.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Segretto. Everything seems normal so far. Just a little tenderness, as you mentioned. That’s not necessarily concerning, given your history. It's good you’re aware of your body. Your reflexes are normal, and your balance is good. No concerns there either. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Now, I'd like to discuss some possible causes for your frequent urination, and what we can do to figure out what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds alright. Figure it out. Get to the bottom of it. I’m tired of getting up all night, tired of planning my trips around restrooms. What could it be? Is it something serious? Don’t sugarcoat it, Doctor, just tell me the truth. I’m an old man, I’ve lived a long life. I can handle it. But please, don’t make me wait too long. I want to go home and have my soup. And… is it my prostate? My friend told me it could be his prostate. Is it my prostate? Please, just tell me. Is it something bad? I need to know. My wife… she’ll worry.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your concern, and I appreciate your honesty. It’s good you’re asking questions. Your frequent urination could be caused by a number of things. As your friend mentioned, an enlarged prostate is a common cause in men your age. It’s called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH, and it’s not cancer. It simply means your prostate is larger than normal, which can put pressure on your bladder and cause frequent urination, especially at night. However, it could also be caused by other things, like a urinary tract infection, diabetes, or even certain medications. It's important to rule those out as well. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. A urine analysis to check for infection, a blood test to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels, and a Prostate-Specific Antigen test to help assess your prostate. We may also consider a more detailed prostate exam later, if needed. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, alright. Do what you need to do. Urine, blood… whatever it takes. I just want to get to the bottom of it. I trust your judgment, Doctor. You're the expert. But… will the tests be painful? Will they take long? I don't want to be stuck here all day. My wife… she'll worry. And… what if it is my prostate? What does that mean? Is it serious? Do I need surgery? I don't want surgery, Doctor. I'm too old for surgery. Just tell me the truth. Is it serious? Please. And… can I still have my soup? Please tell me I can still have my soup.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your anxiety, and I want to reassure you. The tests are not painful. The urine analysis is simply a sample you provide. The blood test is a quick needle prick, and it doesn't take long at all. If it is an enlarged prostate, it’s often very manageable. Many men live perfectly normal lives with BPH. We can treat it with medication to help reduce the size of the prostate and improve your urinary symptoms. Surgery is usually a last resort, and we would only consider it if medication isn’t effective. And yes, absolutely, you can still have your soup! This won’t interfere with your soup at all. Let’s start with these tests. I’ll write you a lab order now. You can go to the lab downstairs, and they’ll take care of everything. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… tests. Soup is safe. That’s good. Yes, alright. Let’s do the tests. Give me the paper, I’ll go downstairs. But… will it take long? I don’t want to be stuck there all day. My wife… she makes a lovely tomato soup. With little grilled cheese sandwiches. Don’t forget, little grilled cheese sandwiches. And… can I ask one more question? What if it’s… something else? Something bad? Don’t sugarcoat it, Doctor. I want to know. Please. Just tell me the truth. Before I go. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, the tests shouldn't take long, perhaps an hour or so. It's best to go sooner rather than later, so the results come back quickly. I understand your concern about “something else.” While less common, frequent urination can be a symptom of other conditions, like a urinary tract infection, diabetes, or in rare cases, more serious issues. That’s why these tests are important. We need to rule everything out to get an accurate diagnosis. But please try not to worry too much. We’re taking all the necessary steps. We're going to get to the bottom of this, and we'll create a plan to help you feel better. The lab technicians will take good care of you. They can answer any questions you have about the tests themselves. Now, you go ahead and get those tests done. I'll be here when you get back, and we’ll discuss the results. And yes, enjoy your soup with the little grilled cheese sandwiches. It sounds delicious. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… tests. Soup. That’s right. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… patient. With an old man and his… plumbing. I’ll go downstairs now. And… I’ll think about the soup. Little grilled cheese sandwiches. Yes. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. Take your time, and I’ll see you when you get back. And enjoy your soup. .
