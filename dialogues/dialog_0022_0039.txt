DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, I got a letter from the lab, you see. Said my cholesterol was a bit high. That’s what brought me in. Never had any trouble with that before, so I figured I’d best get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good you followed up on the lab results. High cholesterol is something we definitely want to take a look at. Just to get a clearer picture, do you recall when the lab test was done, and did your primary care physician discuss the results with you at all?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It was…oh, about a month ago, I reckon. July, sometime. And no, Doctor, my old doctor, Dr. Olson, he retired last year. Didn't get a chance to talk to him about it before he left. Just the letter came in the mail. That's why I made an appointment here. Is that okay? I hope I did the right thing coming straight to you.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Bohnett. It’s very common for people to seek second opinions or new care after a physician retires. We’re happy to help. A month ago is relatively recent. Let me pull up those lab results. Do you happen to have a copy of the letter with you, or perhaps any previous lab work?
PATIENT: Yes, I do! Always keep important papers close, you know. Here we are. The letter from the lab…and a few old reports, just in case. Though, like I said, never had any trouble with cholesterol before. Hopefully, it’s just a little blip.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. Okay, I see here your total cholesterol was 245, your LDL is 160, HDL is 45, and triglycerides are 180. Those numbers are a bit elevated, as you were told. Before we discuss treatment options, I'd like to get a more complete picture of your health history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. Always been pretty healthy, to be honest. A little arthritis in my knees, getting old, you know? But no heart trouble, no diabetes, blood pressure’s always been good. My wife, bless her soul, always said I was as strong as an ox. She was a good woman, always kept me in line. But no, just the arthritis, really.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Bohnett. It sounds like she was a wonderful woman. And that’s good to hear about your general health. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never needed 'em. Broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but that healed up just fine with a cast. Nothing else. I always tried to be careful, you know? A fella can’t go around breaking bones, especially when you get older. Though, I reckon it’s harder to avoid breaking something these days.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my father, he lived a long life, into his eighties. He was a farmer, strong hands, strong heart. My mother, she passed when I was young, but I don't recall any heart trouble on her side. My sister, she’s still alive, lives in Minneapolis, she’s had a little bit of everything, but no heart problems that I know of. I don’t know, Doctor. I don't really keep close track of medical things with the family, if you understand. We weren’t much for talking about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bohnett. It's very common for families not to discuss medical history. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone, you see, since my wife passed. I keep busy. I do a bit of gardening, mostly vegetables. I like to read, mostly history books. I try to walk a little every day, though the knees don't always cooperate. I used to be a carpenter, built houses for a good forty years. Retired now, of course. I eat…well, I eat fairly healthy, I think. Lots of vegetables from the garden. Not much fast food. And I used to drink a little beer with dinner, but not so much anymore. Doctor, does that help any? It's hard to know what you want to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you have a lot of good habits. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life, Doctor. My father didn't approve, and I reckon I just never got the habit. Always thought it was a foolish thing to do. Bad for your lungs, bad for your heart. No, never smoked a day in my life.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Now, lastly, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve taken a little penicillin here and there over the years for a sore throat, but nothing serious. Never had any reaction to anything. No, I don't have any allergies, Doctor. I’m a pretty simple fella, really. Don’t need much to keep me going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. Thank you for that thorough information. It sounds like you have a lot of good habits, and you’ve been pretty healthy overall. Now, I would like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and check your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Always been a believer in getting checked out when something doesn't feel right. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Then I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. And I'll take a quick look in your ears, eyes, and throat. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not concerning at this point, but it’s good to note. Your lungs are clear and breath sounds are normal. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Ears and eyes look normal, and your throat is clear. Overall, everything seems within normal limits, but we do need to address the slightly elevated blood pressure and cholesterol.
PATIENT: Well, that doesn't sound too bad, does it? A little high here and there…I reckon I get a little nervous at the doctor's office. Always have. My wife used to tease me about it. So, what does this all mean, Doctor? Do I need medicine? I’d rather not take pills if I can help it, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about taking medication, Mr. Bohnett, and we'll definitely explore all options before resorting to that. Your slightly elevated blood pressure and cholesterol do increase your risk of heart disease and stroke, so we need to take them seriously. Given your age and overall health, I recommend starting with lifestyle modifications. That means focusing on a heart-healthy diet—lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, limiting saturated and trans fats, and reducing your sodium intake. Regular exercise is also very important, even just a 30-minute walk most days of the week. I also recommend a repeat cholesterol test in three months to see if these changes make a difference. We'll also monitor your blood pressure at follow-up appointments. If your numbers don't improve with lifestyle changes, we may need to consider medication. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Lifestyle changes. I can do that. I already do a fair bit of gardening, and I do like my vegetables. Less salt, more walking… I reckon I can manage that. Three months to see if it helps, then check again… Yes, that sounds fair. What about the slight murmur you heard? Is that something I should worry about right now? I don't want to be thinking about my heart all the time. It’s already a little scary, this whole thing.
DOCTOR: The murmur is very mild, Mr. Bohnett. It’s likely just age-related changes in the heart valves and isn't causing any symptoms at this time. It doesn’t require any immediate treatment. However, I will continue to listen for it at each follow-up appointment, and if it changes, we may consider an echocardiogram to get a better look at your heart. For now, let’s focus on the lifestyle changes and repeat cholesterol test. I'll also give you a handout with information about a heart-healthy diet and exercise tips. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. That makes me feel a lot better. A mild murmur… I can live with that. And a handout is good, I forget things easily these days, so a written reminder is helpful. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. You’re a good doctor, Doctor Tosca. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man’s worries.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns that come up. We’re here to help you stay healthy. Here’s that handout. And remember, small changes can make a big difference. I’ll see you in three months for your follow-up cholesterol test. Have a good day, Mr. Bohnett, and take care of yourself.
