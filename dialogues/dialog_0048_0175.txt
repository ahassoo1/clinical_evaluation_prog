DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Way, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Michae Way. But please, call me Michae.
DOCTOR: Very well, Michae. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my back. It’s been…painful, for a little while now. Not all the time, but enough to bother me. Mostly when I’m…bending over, or lifting things. It just aches, you know?
DOCTOR: “Aches.” Right. And how long has this “aching” been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…maybe a month ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little twinge here and there. But it's gotten worse over the last week or so. I didn't really pay it much mind at first, honestly. Old age, I figured.
DOCTOR: “Old age.” Of course. And can you describe the pain more specifically?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like when you pull a muscle. It's more of a…dull ache. Like a constant pressure. And it kinda radiates, you know? Goes down my back a little bit. Sometimes it feels stiff too, especially in the mornings. It’s hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: “Radiates.” And does anything relieve the pain, Michae?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. When I sit down and rest for a bit, it gets better. And warm showers help a lot. I usually take a long, hot shower in the morning, and that loosens things up. But it always comes back, you know? Especially if I try to do too much around the house.
DOCTOR: And do you have any…prior medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but I lost some weight and it went down. Doctor said I was good. Other than that, nothing major. I try to stay healthy, you know? Walk a little bit every day, eat my vegetables.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications for this, or anything at all, really?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Tried some over-the-counter pain relievers once, but they didn’t really do much. And honestly, I just figured it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of…back problems?
PATIENT: Hmm…now that you mention it, my mother had some trouble with her back when she got older. Lots of aches and pains. She didn’t go to the doctor much though, just toughed it out. My father was pretty healthy, as far as I know. Didn’t have any major issues.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your back then. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Where's the table at?
DOCTOR: Over there. Just lie face down, if you would. And I’ll need you to point to where it hurts the most.
PATIENT: Alright, like this? It hurts…right here, along my lower back. And a little bit on this side too. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, it kinda aches all over this area.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you feel any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that’s a little tender. Right there, that’s where it hurts the most. Not a sharp pain, just…a dull ache, like I said. And when you press there…it kinda radiates down my leg a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. Can you lift your right leg straight up?
PATIENT: Like this? It's a little stiff, you know? Not as easy as it used to be. I can feel a bit of a pull in my back when I do that. It's not terrible, but it’s definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: And your left leg?
PATIENT: Oh…that’s a bit harder. Yeah, that definitely hurts more. Feels like something’s pulling. I think that’s where most of the pain is coming from. It’s like a sharp twinge when I lift it up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this brief assessment… it sounds like you have a strain. Likely muscular. Given your age and lack of other symptoms, I don’t believe further imaging is necessary at this time.
PATIENT: A strain? Okay…that’s good, I guess. Is it serious? Will it…heal on its own? I just want to be able to get back to my normal routine, you know? I have things to do around the house…and I like to walk.
DOCTOR: It’s not typically serious. Most strains resolve with rest and conservative management. I’ll prescribe you some ibuprofen for the pain and inflammation. I recommend avoiding heavy lifting, bending, and twisting for a week or two. And if it doesn’t improve…or if it gets significantly worse, then you can consider a specialist referral. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen…okay, that’s fine. And rest…yeah, I can do that. A week or two…hopefully that’s all it takes. So, just rest, take the pills, and avoid lifting things. And if it doesn’t get better, I can come back?
DOCTOR: Precisely. And if it's not improving, schedule another appointment. I have other patients waiting. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Right. Next. People and their backs… .
PATIENT: .
