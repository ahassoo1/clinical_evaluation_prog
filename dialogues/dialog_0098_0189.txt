DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome. I’m Dr. Bombara. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning. Rowbottom, yes. Arbie Rowbottom. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, waste of time if you ask me, but… well, there was blood. In the stool. Not a good sign, is it? I read a bit online, and it’s never good. Though, honestly, half of what you find on the internet is nonsense.
DOCTOR: Yes, blood in the stool is certainly something we need to investigate, Mr. Rowbottom. You're right to be concerned, and it's good you came in. It can be a sign of several things, and it’s always best to find out what’s going on. You mentioned you read a bit online… do you recall anything specific that worried you?
PATIENT: Specific? Heavens, no. It was all… cancer this and diverticulitis that. A lot of things I couldn't even pronounce. I mostly just remember it said “see a doctor immediately.” Which is why I’m here, I suppose. Though, I’ve always been a healthy man. Flew planes for forty years, you know. Keeps you sharp. Not like these youngsters with their… screens. This probably isn't anything, just a bit of something I ate. Though, I did have that slightly dodgy looking salmon last week...
DOCTOR: Forty years flying – that is impressive! Staying active is certainly good for your health. And you're right, sometimes it is just something you ate. Still, we need to rule out anything more serious. Let's start with a little more detail about this blood. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it was… oh, about three days ago now. Tuesday, I believe. I went to the… facilities, as it were, and there it was. Not a huge amount, mind you. More of a… streak, really. A reddish streak. And it happened again yesterday, a bit more noticeable, I’d say. I haven’t… checked… this morning. Not keen on repeating the experience, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rowbottom. No need to repeat the experience if you're not comfortable. And it’s good you're paying attention to these changes. Now, has the stool itself been different in any way?
PATIENT: Different? How do you mean? It’s… stool. You know. Brownish. Sometimes a bit… loose, if I've had too much coffee. Nothing out of the ordinary, really. Except for the… colour, of course. It's usually a proper brown, not… streaked. And not… shiny, if you get my meaning. It was a bit… glistening yesterday. Which I didn't like the look of.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful, Mr. Rowbottom. "Glistening" is a good way to describe it. Now, have you been experiencing any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me see… well, I’ve been a bit… tired, I suppose. But I’m eighty-eight, Doctor. I’m always a bit tired. And my stomach’s been a bit… rumblingly, if you follow me. Not painful, just… unsettled. And I haven't had much of an appetite, but honestly, the food these days… not worth the effort, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, a bit of stomach rumbling, and decreased appetite. And you said the rumbling isn't painful. That's good to know. Now, Mr. Rowbottom, I’m going to ask a few questions about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Back in my flying days, I had a bit of trouble with my… vertigo, I suppose. Nothing serious. They cleared me after a few tests. And I had my appendix out when I was a lad. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. Never smoked, hardly ever drank. And I certainly haven’t been near one of those… screens… for long enough to get sick from it.
DOCTOR: Okay, vertigo and appendectomy. And you haven’t smoked or drank much, which is excellent. Do you have any family history of medical conditions – anything like colon cancer, stomach problems, or anything else that runs in the family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he died of a heart attack, I believe. Fairly old age, though. My mother lived to ninety, but she mostly just… faded away. Can’t recall any specific illnesses, to be honest. We weren’t a family for… discussing ailments. Stiff upper lip, you know. And my brother… he was a bit of a rogue, spent most of his life travelling. Don’t know what happened to him, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's helpful, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Heavens, no. I don’t believe in all that… modern medicine. A bit of tea if I’m feeling poorly, that’s all. And maybe a bit of ginger for my stomach, if it’s really acting up. But nothing… prescribed. I prefer to let my body heal itself, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your preference. However, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and then I’d like to do a rectal exam. It's a standard procedure for investigating this type of symptom, and it will help us rule out anything serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… rectal exam? Now hold on just a minute. Look, I appreciate you wanting to get to the bottom of this, but… that’s a bit much, isn’t it? I’ve lived eighty-eight years without anyone poking around there, and I’d like to keep it that way. Surely there’s another way? I mean, you've listened to my chest, haven't you? Isn't that enough?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your discomfort, and I wouldn't suggest anything that wasn’t absolutely necessary. However, a rectal exam is a crucial part of investigating blood in the stool. It allows me to check for any abnormalities, such as polyps or masses, that might be causing the bleeding. It’s a quick procedure, and I’ll do my best to make you comfortable. Without it, it's very difficult to determine the cause and ensure we're not missing anything serious. I would highly recommend it, just to be safe. If we find nothing concerning, we can discuss other options. But skipping this step would be a disservice to your health. Would you reconsider?
PATIENT: Hmph. A disservice to my health, is it? Well, I suppose I haven't got much choice, have I? Fine. But I warn you, I’m not going to be happy. And be quick about it. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Rowbottom. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’m going to ask you to lie on your side, with your knees bent. I'll explain each step as I go. First, I'll listen to your abdomen again with the stethoscope… Now, if you could just lie on your left side…
PATIENT: There. Is that right? My joints aren't what they used to be, you know. And try not to… poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. This may feel a bit of pressure. I’m just going to insert a finger gently… Okay, all done. I didn’t feel any obvious masses or tenderness. There was some stool present, as expected, and a small amount of… dark, melenic stool on my finger. That melenic stool is what I wanted to check for. It indicates that the bleeding is likely coming from higher up in the digestive tract, such as the stomach or small intestine. It's important to investigate this further.
PATIENT: Melenic stool, is it? Higher up in the… what-did-you-say? Stomach or small intestine? That doesn’t sound good, does it? I told you I should have just stayed home and had a cup of tea. So, what now? Am I going to need… surgery? Is it cancer? Don't tell me I've got cancer!
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, please try to stay calm. We don’t have enough information to say anything definitively yet. Melenic stool can indicate bleeding from higher up in the digestive tract, but it doesn't automatically mean it's something serious like cancer. It could be caused by a number of things, such as an ulcer, gastritis, or even certain medications. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to check your hemoglobin levels and see if you're anemic. Then, a stool test to rule out any infections. And most importantly, I’d like to refer you to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy. An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and identify the source of the bleeding. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An… endoscopy? A tube with a camera down my… throat? Good heavens. That sounds awful. Is it painful? Will I have to be… awake for that? And what about all these other tests? Hemoglobin… whatever-it-is… and stool tests… It's all a bit much, isn't it? I suppose I don't have much choice, do I? If you think it's necessary… But I want you to promise me you’ll explain everything every step of the way. And I expect a gentle doctor. None of those… rough ones.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Rowbottom, and I promise to explain everything clearly every step of the way. The endoscopy is usually performed with sedation, so you won't feel any pain. You’ll be monitored closely throughout the procedure. The blood tests are simple and will give us a good indication of your overall health. And I assure you, I will recommend a gentle and experienced gastroenterologist. Here's what I'm going to do. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected gastroenterologist in the area. I'll also give you the necessary paperwork for the blood tests. The endoscopy appointment will be scheduled directly through Dr. Vance's office. In the meantime, I'd like you to avoid any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as these can increase the risk of bleeding. And if you notice any significant changes in your stool, such as increasing amounts of blood, severe abdominal pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I suppose not. Just… try to make sure that Dr. Vance is as gentle as you promised. And no unnecessary poking and prodding, if you please. I’ve had enough of that for one day. I still think a cup of tea would have been a better solution. But… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything, at least. I suppose I’ll go and see this Dr. Vance… and hope for the best. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll be sure to pass on your request for a gentle doctor to Dr. Vance’s office. And please, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, and I wish you all the best.
