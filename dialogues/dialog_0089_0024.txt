DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. I need a letter, actually. Confirming I’m able to fly. It’s for… well, travel insurance, mostly. They need it to approve everything. It’s a bit silly, but here we are.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fit-to-fly letter. I understand. Travel insurance companies often require those. I see here you're 33 years old. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I… lost my husband a little over a year ago. It was sudden. Heart attack. But I'm healthy. I have Medicare, if that helps. No ongoing problems, really. I just want to make sure this letter doesn’t have any issues when I try to book everything.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. Medicare is helpful, yes. And you're right to be thorough with the letter. Just to be absolutely certain, have you been diagnosed with anything in the past – even something minor, like high blood pressure or asthma?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been… pretty robust, honestly. I don’t even take regular medication. I did have a bad flu a couple of winters ago, but that cleared up quickly. I’m just trying to anticipate any problems with the insurance. They’re being… particular.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No regular medications, no chronic conditions... just a flu a couple of years ago. Just to complete the picture, any allergies I should be aware of – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Not to anything I know of, anyway. I eat… pretty much everything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel a bit silly being here. But the insurance company… they said a letter from a doctor was required, and I didn’t want to risk being denied coverage.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s always better to be safe than sorry, especially when travel insurance is involved. They can be very particular. Just so I can write a thorough letter, could you tell me a little about the trip itself?
PATIENT: It's to visit my sister. She moved to Australia last year, and… well, I haven’t seen her since then. It’s a long flight, obviously. About twenty-four hours with the layovers, I think. I’m flying economy, and I’m a bit worried about… deep vein thrombosis, I guess? I’ve read things online, and I don’t want to be stuck on a plane with a blood clot. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. That's a very sensible concern, especially with a long flight like that. Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is something we always consider with prolonged travel. Alright, let's do a quick assessment. Have you had any previous blood clots – in your legs, lungs, anywhere?
PATIENT: No, never. As I said, I’ve been pretty lucky health-wise. No clots, no surgeries… nothing like that. I just… I’m trying to be prepared. My sister keeps telling me I worry too much. She says I’m overthinking everything. But I’d rather be safe than sorry, especially with the distance. Twenty-four hours is a long time to be sitting.
DOCTOR: You’re being proactive, and that’s a good thing. Okay, and how is your general mobility?
PATIENT: Good, I think. I walk a lot. I live in the city, so I walk everywhere. I don't do anything… strenuous, like running marathons, but I'm not inactive. I go to yoga twice a week. Nothing too challenging, mostly stretching and relaxation. I try to keep moving. Is that helpful? I'm trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Regular walking and yoga are excellent. Alright, just one more quick question. Do you have any swelling in your legs or feet at all, even at the end of a normal day?
PATIENT: No, none that I've noticed. Sometimes my feet feel a little tired, but no actual swelling. I do try to put them up when I get home, though. Just… a habit. I don't think it's anything serious. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting your time. I just really need this letter.
DOCTOR: You’re not wasting my time at all. It's important to rule things out, and you're giving me a clear picture. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me - no prior clots, good mobility, no swelling - you are at relatively low risk for DVT. I'm happy to write you a fit-to-fly letter. I will include a recommendation to stay well-hydrated during the flight, and to get up and walk around periodically. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect! Hydrate and walk around. I can definitely do that. Thank you so much, Doctor. I really appreciate it. How long do you think it will take to finish the letter? I have another appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. Here you go. It’s signed and dated. Should be sufficient for the insurance company. It might take me ten minutes to upload it to their portal if you want me to, but it's not essential. Do you need anything else today?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you so much. This is… exactly what I needed. No, I think that’s everything. I don’t think they need it uploaded, just a copy is fine. You’ve been so helpful. Seriously. I really appreciate your time and patience. I was getting so worried about this! .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could help alleviate your worries. Have a wonderful trip to Australia, and please give your sister my best. Travel safely!
