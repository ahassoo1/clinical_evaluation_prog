DOCTOR: Good morning, Clarke. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's these… bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda painful. Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke. Bumps on your shins that are red and painful… and you said a little while now – can you give me a better sense of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… three, four months now? Started small, I didn’t really pay much attention at first. Thought maybe I bumped them on something at work, you know? But they just kept getting bigger and more… noticeable. And sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months. And you initially thought they were from bumping your legs at work?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. I work moving stuff around, freight mostly. Lots of walking and… well, things get in the way sometimes. But like I said, they didn't go away. And they don't look like a normal bruise, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Clarke. Working with freight, it’s easy to get bumps and scrapes. And you’re right, if they don't look like a typical bruise, that's good to know. Let's talk a little more about them. Are they just on your shins, or are they anywhere else?
PATIENT: Mostly just the shins, yeah. I think I saw one little one starting on my ankle a few weeks back, but it went away pretty quick. Nothing else, though. Just the shins are really bothering me. They itch sometimes too, you know? Not all the time, but enough to be annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly on the shins, with a small one on your ankle that resolved. And they itch occasionally. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you noticed anything else associated with these bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really, not that I can think of. I haven’t had a fever or anything. No swelling anywhere else. Just… the bumps. They’re more uncomfortable than anything, really. Makes wearing work boots a bit of a pain. I’ve tried putting some cream on them, just regular stuff for cuts and scrapes, but it doesn’t seem to do much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no swelling, and the regular cream isn’t helping much. Good. Let’s go over some general health questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but I take a little pill for it every day. Otherwise, nothing major. My wife keeps me in line, makes sure I eat right and all that. Medicare is my insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you've been generally healthy. And thank you for letting me know about the high blood pressure and medication. Medicare is helpful information as well. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a kid, I had my tonsils out. That was a long time ago, though. And I broke my arm once when I was playing baseball, but that healed up fine. Nothing since then, really. No hospital stays or anything. I try to stay away from doctors if I can, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. I appreciate you letting me know about the tonsillectomy and broken arm. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… something with her heart, I think. She had to go to the hospital a few times when I was younger. My father, he had diabetes. And my brother… he had problems with his kidneys, I think. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember all the details. It’s a big family, you know? Lots of people.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to know about the family history of heart problems, diabetes, and kidney issues. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. My wife always asks me that before I try anything new. She’s very careful. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, haven’t had a reaction yet. And the doctor hasn’t ever written anything down about allergies. I think I'd remember if I was allergic to something!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Alright, Clarke, let’s talk about your current medications. You mentioned a pill for high blood pressure – can you tell me the name of that medication and how much you take?
PATIENT: Let me see… It’s a little white pill. My wife gets it for me. Um… I think it’s called… Lisinopril? Yeah, Lisinopril. I take… ten milligrams, I think. Every morning with breakfast. She’s really good about keeping track of everything, so I’m pretty sure that’s right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. Thank you for that information. Now, Clarke, would you mind if I take a look at your legs?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, go ahead, Doctor. Please do. I’m happy to show you. It’s been bothering me enough, maybe you can figure out what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke, I see some reddish, slightly raised bumps on your shins. They appear to be a bit tender to the touch. Are they painful when I press on them like this?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit. Not terribly painful, but… yeah, that’s a bit sore. They’re more of a constant ache, really, but pressing on them definitely makes it worse. Like a bruise, almost. But it doesn’t really look like a bruise, does it?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t quite look like a typical bruise. I don’t see any signs of infection at the moment, which is good. They’re not warm to the touch, and your skin doesn’t feel particularly swollen. Do you recall any recent travel or exposure to anything unusual, like new detergents or plants?
PATIENT: No, no travel. I haven’t been anywhere in years. And no, nothing new around the house. My wife does the laundry, she’s very particular about using the same stuff. And I don’t really go near the plants in the garden, she handles all that too. I haven't been hiking or anything, just work and home, mostly. Actually... now that you mention it, I did start using a new soap at work a couple of weeks ago. The old one ran out and they switched to a different brand. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: That's a very important piece of information, Clarke. A new soap at work could certainly be the culprit. It sounds like you might be experiencing contact dermatitis – an allergic reaction or irritation from something touching your skin. To be sure, though, I'd like to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a simple blood test to check your blood sugar and kidney function, just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this figured out. The blood test sounds fine. Hopefully it’s just that soap, you know? My wife is gonna be happy if it’s something simple.
DOCTOR: I understand. It very well could be the soap. The blood test will help us confirm that, and we can also discuss some treatment options. I’ll write you a requisition for the lab. The nurse will explain where to go and how to prepare. In the meantime, I recommend stopping the use of that new soap at work immediately. And, if possible, try to avoid anything that might be irritating your legs, like tight clothing. We can also consider a topical steroid cream to help with the inflammation and itching if it becomes bothersome. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Clarke?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Stopping the soap sounds like a good idea. And I’ll try to wear looser pants at work. Thank you for looking into this for me. I appreciate it. Hopefully, it is just the soap.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clarke. I hope so too. We'll get the lab results back within a few days, and we can discuss a plan from there. The nurse will be in shortly to get you set up for the bloodwork. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your results come back.
