DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some…pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. It’s difficult to explain, but it feels like I need to go constantly, even when I don’t.
DOCTOR: I see. Constant urge to urinate, even when you don’t necessarily feel full. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, roughly two months now. It wasn’t constant at first, just occasional, but it's definitely become more frequent these past few weeks. I can recall the exact date, it was June 8th, after a visit with my sister.
DOCTOR: June 8th, following a visit with your sister. Interesting. And would you describe the pressure as painful, or simply… an insistent need to go?
PATIENT: It's not painful, Doctor. It's more… uncomfortable. Like a fullness, even after I’ve just used the restroom. And it's insistent, as you say. It doesn't hurt, but it’s distracting, and sometimes a little worrying. I find myself going to the bathroom more often "just in case."
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no pain with urination, just a persistent feeling of fullness and the need to go frequently, even after voiding. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: No, nothing that I've been able to recall, Doctor. The color seems normal, and I haven’t noticed any… unusual smells, or blood. It looks like my usual urine, I suppose. I've made a point of checking, actually, since this started.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, Ms. Creagh, let's delve a little deeper. Have you experienced any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting along with this urinary issue?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever, no chills, no nausea, and certainly no vomiting. I've been feeling generally well otherwise. Just this bladder issue, which is… frustrating. I’ve been drinking plenty of water, hoping it would help, but it hasn’t made much of a difference.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, my bowel habits have been normal. No changes there, thankfully. Regular as clockwork, I suppose. I hadn't thought there was any connection, but you asked, so I wanted to be certain. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's always prudent to consider all possibilities, Ms. Creagh. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any urinary tract infections, kidney problems, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. I have Medicare, so I do have regular check-ups, but nothing like that has ever come up. My husband says I worry too much, but it’s difficult not to when something feels… off. I can recall every detail from my last check-up, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Ms. Creagh. We can review your chart later. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Never any surgeries, never been hospitalized. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard. I do have a mild allergy to penicillin, but that's the extent of my medical issues, if you can even call it that. I recall finding out when I was a child, it was a small rash.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications regularly. Just a multivitamin occasionally, but nothing consistent. I prefer to try and get everything I need from my diet. I recall discussing this with my primary care physician last year, she approves.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Creagh, let's discuss your family history. Are there any instances of urinary problems, kidney disease, or bladder cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm...that's a good question, Doctor. Let me think. My mother had some kidney stones when she was older, I recall her mentioning it during a visit. But nothing about bladder cancer, or any other recurring urinary problems. My father was healthy as a horse, if I recall correctly. I can ask my sister, she keeps a more detailed record of our family history. Would that be helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be, Ms. Creagh. And finally, could you briefly describe your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I'm married, and I work as a graphic designer from home, mostly. So, I'm seated for a good portion of the day. I try to stay active with walks when the weather permits. I drink a fair amount of water, as I mentioned, and I eat a reasonably healthy diet. No smoking, no excessive alcohol consumption. I recall my doctor being pleased with my overall habits during my last wellness check. Is there anything specific you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Creagh, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a quick neurological assessment. It's just to rule out any obvious underlying issues. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly acceptable. I understand. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I recall reading that a physical exam is standard practice, so I anticipated this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Creagh… and exhale. Sounds normal. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no tenderness. It feels… normal. A little pressure, perhaps, but that’s likely just from… everything we’ve discussed. It doesn’t hurt, not at all. I recall a similar feeling when I was examined for a stomach bug a few years ago, but this is less intense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. And a quick sensory assessment. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I feel that. Both sensations are normal, I believe. The reflexes feel… standard. I recall my primary care physician performing a similar test during my last check-up. Everything seems as it should, I believe. I just want to get to the bottom of this bladder pressure.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Sensory intact. Alright, Ms. Creagh, based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, my initial suspicion is a lower urinary tract issue, possibly an overactive bladder or interstitial cystitis. However, to rule out any infection or other underlying causes, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture. We'll also do a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. This can help us determine if you are fully emptying your bladder. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly agreeable. Any tests that can help determine the cause are welcome. A urinalysis, a urine culture, and the post-void residual volume test… I understand. Is there anything I should do to prepare for those tests, or any specific instructions I should follow? I recall reading that some tests require you to avoid certain foods or medications, so I want to be certain.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Creagh, nothing specific. Just a standard urine sample, and we'll need you to urinate as you normally would, and then we'll measure the remaining volume. The lab will provide you with instructions for the urine sample collection. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a more definitive plan. This may include lifestyle modifications, medications, or a referral to a urologist if necessary. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes perfect sense. Standard urine sample, measure the residual volume, and then we’ll discuss the results. Lifestyle modifications, medications, or a referral to a urologist if needed. I appreciate the thoroughness. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime, while we await the test results? Should I be limiting my fluid intake, or avoiding certain foods? I recall reading contradictory information online, and I want to be sure I’m not inadvertently making things worse.
DOCTOR: Ms. Creagh, I understand your concern. However, I strongly advise against relying on information found online. For now, continue to drink your normal amount of fluids, about 6-8 glasses a day, unless you experience any discomfort. Avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol, and continue to maintain a healthy diet. Do not attempt any self-treatment, and do not limit your fluid intake without consulting me first. It's important that you continue to urinate as you normally would, and we need a baseline to accurately assess the situation. I know this can be frustrating, but we need to approach this systematically. Does that clarify things?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that clarifies things perfectly. Continue normal fluid intake, avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol, maintain a healthy diet, and do not attempt any self-treatment or limit fluids without your consultation. I appreciate the clear instructions. I apologize for mentioning the online information, I just get anxious when I don't know what's causing something. I recall my mother always saying to be proactive, but I understand your point about seeking professional guidance. I'll await your instructions regarding the tests and look forward to discussing the results. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Creagh. The nurse will be in shortly to collect a urine sample and provide you with instructions for the post-void residual volume test. We will contact you with the results as soon as they are available. Do you have any further questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time and thoroughness. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and for providing me with a clear plan. I'll await the nurse's instructions and the test results. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Ms. Creagh.
