DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay if I call you Doctor Nestingen? My head... back of my head... it hurts. Been hurting for maybe... three days now, I think. Not all the time, but comes and goes. Like a... a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Doctor Nestingen is fine. Three days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Maybe a little longer. Hard to say for sure, you know? Old man, I forget things sometimes. Not everything, but… dates and such. It’s not a sharp pain, more like... pressure. Like someone is squeezing the back of my head.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, memory isn't what it used to be at a certain age. Can you describe when you feel this pressure?
PATIENT: When? Hmm. Not when I’m working, not usually. I work with the trains, you know? Lots of noise, lots to think about. It’s more... when I’m resting. Sitting in my chair, watching the television… or trying to sleep. That’s when it bothers me most. It wakes me up sometimes, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how would you rate the pain on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: One to ten, huh? That’s… hard. I don't know many numbers so well. Maybe… a four? When it’s bad, it feels like… like a heavy weight. Not enough to stop me from doing things, but enough to… bother me. Most of the time it’s… less than that. A two, maybe? Sometimes even one. It changes.
DOCTOR: Changing pain is… typical. Have you noticed anything else accompanying this headache?
PATIENT: Accompanying…? You mean… anything with the headache? Sometimes I feel… a little dizzy. Not falling-down dizzy, just… like the room is moving a bit. And my stomach… not so good. Not throwing up, but… queasy. Like I ate something bad. It happens sometimes when the head hurts, but not always.
DOCTOR: Dizziness and nausea… Interesting. Do you have any history of head injuries?
PATIENT: Head injuries? No, not that I remember. I worked with the trains for… many years. Lots of bumps and shakes, but never… hit my head hard. A few scrapes, maybe, but nothing serious. I always try to be careful. It’s a dangerous job, you know. Always looking around.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Medications…? Nothing. Doctor never gave me anything. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. They make me feel… strange. Just the headache, that's all. And maybe some liniment for my bad back, but that’s just rubbing on the skin. Not swallowing.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to need to perform a brief neurological exam. That is, check your reflexes, balance, and a few other things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want this headache to go away. It’s been… troubling me. I'll do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Please, sit up there. And try to relax. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will try to relax. It’s hard when I worry about things. But I will try. Here I am, sitting. Just tell me what to do. I hope it doesn't take too long, my bones get stiff easy.
DOCTOR: Right leg… good. Left leg… good. A little diminished on the left, but not concerning at this point. Now, follow my penlight with your eyes. Don’t strain yourself. Look left… look right… look up… look down. Good. Pupils are equal and reactive to light, although a bit sluggish. Now, can you squeeze your eyes shut tightly?
PATIENT: Yes, I can squeeze them shut. Tightly. Like this? Is that good? A little hard to squeeze, maybe. My eyelids feel… heavy. Not hurting, just… tired. Like I haven't slept well. The light is… bright.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Please stand up slowly, if you can. And try to stand with your feet together, arms at your sides. Do not move.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Slowly now… I'm standing… a little shaky, but standing. Is this alright? It’s hard to stand still.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're swaying a bit. And your gait… slightly unsteady. Please, sit down. That’s enough for now. Your symptoms, combined with these exam findings… suggest a possible inner ear issue, or perhaps something more concerning. I'm going to order a CT scan of your head. Just to rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan? What… what is that? Is it… painful? I don't like doctors poking around inside me. And… expensive? I don't have much money, you know. I don’t understand what's happening. My head hurts and now you want to… scan it? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: A CT scan is an imaging test. It uses X-rays to create pictures of the inside of your head. It is not invasive—we don’t poke around. You will simply lie on a table while the machine takes the pictures. It is painless, although you need to lie still. As for the cost… I’m aware you are uninsured. We can discuss options with the hospital billing department. Right now, it's important to determine the cause of your symptoms. We need to rule out anything serious—stroke, tumor, bleeding… It’s standard procedure. I'm ordering it regardless. We will schedule it for tomorrow morning. Do you have anyone who can drive you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning…? Drive me… No. My wife… she passed away last year. I live alone. I can take the bus, I suppose. But… a stroke? A tumor? Bleeding…? Is it… is it serious? Do you think it is something bad, Doctor? I feel… dizzy just thinking about it. I wish I hadn't come. Maybe it’s just an old man’s headache.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, you're experiencing symptoms that require investigation. I understand your anxiety, but catastrophizing isn't helpful. It may be nothing, it may be something. That is precisely why we are doing the scan. We'll arrange transportation. Don’t worry about it. I'm writing a referral for the scan and a prescription for some anti-nausea medication to help with the dizziness. Take it as directed. The hospital will contact you to schedule the scan. I will review the results when they are available. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… no other questions, Doctor. Just… thank you. I hope it’s nothing bad. I will… try not to worry. Maybe I should have just stayed home…
DOCTOR: Very well. Get dressed, and I'll have the nurse bring you the prescription. .
