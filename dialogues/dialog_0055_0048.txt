DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I am Dr. EADDY. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s these little spells, I guess you’d call ‘em. My wife, she says I’ve been… not myself. Forgetful, mostly. Though I don’t see it that way. It's more like… things aren't always where I expect them to be.
DOCTOR: "Spells," you say. Right. And how long have these… episodes of misplacement been occurring, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly. A few months, maybe? Longer. It’s not like it’s a daily thing, thankfully. But enough that my wife, Srey, she started to worry. She says I ask the same questions over and over. Honestly, I think she just doesn't listen the first time. But she insisted I come. She’s a good woman, but… she worries too much.
DOCTOR: So, intermittent forgetfulness, several months in duration. And your wife is concerned about repetition of questions. Do you experience any difficulty recalling things yourself, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Difficulty? No, not really. I remember things just fine. Dates, names… everything. It’s just… sometimes I’ll go into the garage to get the hammer, and… well, I’ll be looking at the gardening tools instead, wondering why I even went in there. That sort of thing. It's not like I forget things, it's more like… a momentary lapse. And usually, it comes right back to me. I just… don’t always know why I was doing something. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A momentary lapse in… purpose, you're saying. I see. And has this been accompanied by any other changes, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Changes? Like what sort of changes? I haven't been feeling sick, if that's what you mean. No fever, no cough. Appetite’s normal. Sleep alright, though Srey says I sometimes talk in my sleep. She says it’s nonsense, of course. Can’t understand a word of it. She says I used to be a very quiet sleeper. Honestly, women notice everything. It's a gift, I suppose. A bothersome gift.
DOCTOR: Talking in your sleep, and a change in your usual sleep pattern as reported by your wife. Alright. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Let me think… Well, I had a bad knee a few years back, playing soccer with the grandkids. Needed a little surgery, but that was years ago. And the doctor gave me something for my blood pressure a while back, but it made me feel awful, so I stopped taking it. Srey wasn't happy about that, but I felt much better without it. And… oh, there was a touch of the flu last winter, but everyone gets the flu, right? Nothing serious. I’ve always been a strong man, generally. Don’t get sick easy.
DOCTOR: A prior knee surgery, discontinued medication for blood pressure due to side effects, and a recent bout of influenza. Did you follow up with your primary care physician regarding the blood pressure after discontinuing the medication?
PATIENT: Follow up? No, I didn't. I told Srey I felt fine, so what was the point? Doctors just want to keep you on pills, if you ask me. My brother, he was on blood pressure medicine for years, and it didn't do him a bit of good. Ended up in the hospital anyway. I prefer to take care of myself, thank you very much. A good diet, a bit of exercise… that's all you need. I've been tiling and stone setting for forty years, you know. That’s plenty of exercise. It’s hard work, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: Very well. And could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Just a little fish oil, Srey makes me take it for my joints. Says it's good for memory, too, though I haven’t noticed a difference. And sometimes, if my knee is acting up, I take some ibuprofen. That’s about it. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. They just cloud your thinking, if you ask me. And honestly, what good is medicine if it makes you feel worse than the problem itself?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Fish oil and as-needed ibuprofen. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any instances of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or other memory problems in your family?
PATIENT: Dementia… hmm. Let me think. My mother… she got a little confused towards the end, but that was just old age, I think. She was 92, you know. Everyone gets a little forgetful at that age. And my uncle, on my father's side… he had some trouble remembering things, but he was a heavy drinker, so I always figured that was the cause. No one ever talked about it much. Not a topic Cambodians really discuss, if you want to know the truth. It’s considered… bad luck to dwell on such things.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that information, Mr. Lason. Now, to complete the picture, could you describe your lifestyle?
