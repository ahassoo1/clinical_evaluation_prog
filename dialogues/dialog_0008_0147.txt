DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I’ve been feeling…a lump, I guess you could call it, in my lower abdomen for a little while now. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. Can you tell me how long you’ve been noticing it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Probably… a couple of months, maybe? It wasn’t really noticeable at first, just a slight… fullness. But it's definitely grown a bit bigger recently.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple of months, gradually growing. And where exactly in your lower abdomen are you feeling this lump?
PATIENT: If you don’t mind me being specific… it's kind of in the center, a little bit below my belly button. Not on either side, really, more right in the middle.
DOCTOR: Okay, centered below the belly button. Is it painful at all?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not really painful. It's not comfortable, like a pressure sometimes, but not actual pain. It doesn’t hurt to touch it, either. It just… is there.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just a pressure. Has anything changed recently that you can think of – any new activities, diet changes, or maybe even stress?
PATIENT: That's a thoughtful question, Doctor. Let me think… Nothing major, I don’t think. My work as a choreographer has been pretty demanding lately, lots of long hours practicing for a new piece. And… yes, actually, my mother hasn't been well recently. I’ve been quite stressed about that. But nothing else dramatically different.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased work stress and concern for your mother. And just to clarify, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, appetite, or weight along with this lump?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. My appetite’s been normal, and my weight hasn’t changed at all. Bowel movements… regular, as they always are. I haven't noticed anything unusual there, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. No fever, chills, or… those night sweats you mentioned. I sleep pretty soundly, actually, so I would have noticed if I was sweating a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. No allergies to any medications that I’m aware of. I rarely take anything, to be honest, unless I have a really bad headache.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking anything at all, not even over-the-counter. I try to stay away from those if I can. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, like I said, and that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll need to gently feel your abdomen to get a better understanding of this lump. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amy. I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. …Hmm. I do feel a firm mass, approximately… two centimeters in diameter, centered below your belly button, as you described. It doesn’t seem particularly tender to the touch. There’s no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are normal in all four quadrants. It’s difficult to determine the exact nature of this mass with just palpation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A CT scan and blood work… whatever you think is best. Please go ahead. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab order for the complete blood count is submitted electronically now. I’ll also get the order sent for the CT scan, and the radiology department will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. While we await the results, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, please contact the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your calm and clear explanations. Just… what kind of things could this be? I know you can't say for sure until the tests, but… is it something I should be very worried about?
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Amy. It’s difficult to say definitively without the imaging and blood work, but a mass like this could be several things. It could be a benign cyst, a lipoma – which is a fatty tumor – or, less commonly, something more serious. We need to rule out other possibilities. I want to emphasize that it’s too early to be overly concerned. Many abdominal masses turn out to be benign. However, it's important to investigate to be sure. We are doing the right thing with the CT scan and blood work. Do you have any family history of abdominal cancers or masses that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My mother's side of the family… my grandmother had some problems with her stomach, years ago, but I don’t know exactly what. It was a long time ago, and no one really talked about it much. Nothing else that I'm aware of, no.
DOCTOR: Okay. A history of stomach problems in your grandmother, though vague. That's good to note. Once the CT scan results are available, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I’ll also review your blood work results at that time. We will decide on the next steps based on those findings. For now, focus on managing your stress and monitoring for any changes in your symptoms. Do you have any further questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve really put my mind at ease, and I appreciate your thoroughness and kindness. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get these tests scheduled as quickly as possible and get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
