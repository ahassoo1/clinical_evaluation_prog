DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, Doc, don't bother with the niceties. Just get on with it. It’s this…shaking. My hand, mostly. It’s been happening for a while now, and it’s getting…irritating. Frankly, I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, I understand. Straight to the point. This shaking in your hand… when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I couldn’t tell ya exactly. A while back, I suppose. Maybe…last year? It comes and goes. It’s not like it's constant, thank goodness. Though it is getting worse, like I said. Makes things…difficult. I used to have such a steady hand, you know. Directed some big pictures… used to be. Now? Not so much. And don’t ask me what pictures, I can barely remember what I had for breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started roughly around last year and comes and goes. And you’ve noticed it’s been increasing in severity recently. You mentioned directing pictures – so this is affecting your ability to do that?
PATIENT: Affecting? It stopped it, mostly. I haven't directed anything in…well, a long time. Too embarrassing, really. Trying to look professional when your hand's bouncing around like a hummingbird. It’s not a good look, let me tell ya. I mostly just…sit around now. My wife… she took care of everything. Now it’s just me. Don’t ask about that either, it's a long story. And frankly, I'm not in the mood for stories today.
DOCTOR: I understand. You don't need to share anything you're not comfortable with, Mr. Baide. So, to clarify, the shaking is primarily in your right hand, is that correct?
PATIENT: Right hand, yes. Always the right. Though sometimes I think I feel a little tremor in the left, but it could be my imagination. Getting old, you know? Everything starts to feel a little…off. Honestly, Doc, is this something serious? Don't sugarcoat it. I’ve never been one for coddling. Just tell me what’s wrong. Or what you think is wrong.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Baide. It’s good to know what you expect. It’s difficult to say definitively without a proper examination, but based on what you’ve described – the onset around a year ago, the right hand primarily affected, and the worsening tremor – a few things come to mind. One possibility is essential tremor, which is a common neurological condition. Another could be related to age-related changes. Less commonly, it could be something else, which is why a thorough evaluation is important. To get a better understanding, I'd like to do a quick physical and neurological exam. We'll check your reflexes, coordination, and look for other signs that might help us narrow down the cause. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, exams. Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect me to be cooperative if you start poking and prodding too much. And please, no fancy medical terms. Just tell me what you’re doing, in plain English. I haven’t got a degree in…whatever it is you doctors study. Just…let's get it done. The quicker the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I will explain everything as we go, and we’ll take it at your pace. No need to rush. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs to get a general sense of your overall health. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Relax? Easy for you to say. Just get on with it. Honestly, I haven’t relaxed properly in years. Too much responsibility, you know? Always had to be in control… directing, managing… Now look at me. Fine, here. Poke away. But if it hurts, I'm telling ya. I've got a low tolerance for pain these days.
DOCTOR: Good reflexes there, Mr. Baide. That’s perfectly normal. Now, I'd like you to place your hands out in front of you, palms up, and close your eyes. Just hold them steady for a few moments. I'm looking to see if there's any tremor at rest. Okay, now I’d like you to touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger. We’ll do that a few times. This will help me assess your coordination.
PATIENT: See? Told ya. Awful. Used to be so precise. Could position a camera within millimeters. Now…this. It's humiliating. Honestly, Doc, you don't need to bother with all this fancy testing. It's obvious, isn't it? Something's wrong. Just tell me what it is and what I can do about it. I haven’t got time for a drawn-out diagnosis.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Mr. Baide. It's clear there is a tremor and some difficulty with coordination. Based on the exam, and what you’ve told me, essential tremor is still the most likely possibility. However, to rule out other potential causes – and to get a clearer picture of what’s going on – I’d like to order a few simple blood tests. These will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the tremor. Also, a neurological consult might be beneficial. A neurologist is a specialist in conditions affecting the nervous system, and they can perform more in-depth testing if needed. Would you be open to those options?
PATIENT: Blood tests…fine. Anything to get this over with. Neurologist…ugh. More poking and prodding, I suppose? Look, Doc, I'm 80 years old. I've lived a long life. I don't need a laundry list of diagnoses and treatments. If it's something serious, just tell me. If it's not, tell me that too. I just want to know what I'm dealing with, and if there's anything I can do to…manage it. That's all. No fancy procedures, no unnecessary tests. Keep it simple.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Baide. We'll keep it simple. The blood tests will give us some valuable information, and we can discuss the results together. If they come back normal, and your tremor isn’t significantly impacting your daily life, we may not need to pursue further testing. We can focus on managing the tremor with strategies to help you maintain your independence and quality of life. I'll order the blood tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they can take the samples whenever you’re ready. I’ll also make a referral to a neurologist, but you’re not obligated to see them if you don’t feel it’s necessary. We can discuss the pros and cons when we review the blood test results. Does that sound acceptable?
