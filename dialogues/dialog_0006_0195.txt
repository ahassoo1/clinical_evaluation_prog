DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Micucci, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Gorga. Well, it’s not really a problem, you understand. I just... I was hoping you could write me one of those cards. You know, a “Get Well” card? Or maybe one with a nice encouraging message. For my sister’s husband, Bimal. He’s just being a bit… difficult lately. It’s really more for me, to be honest. To show I’m supportive.
DOCTOR: A…card?
PATIENT: Yes, a card! You know, like you give someone who is sick, or feeling down? A little piece of paper with nice words. It would just... make things feel better. He’s not actually sick, mind you. It's just... a situation. He's making it one, really. But a card from a doctor… well, it carries weight, doesn’t it? People listen more.
DOCTOR: Right. A… motivational card, with a doctor’s signature. I… see. That’s… unusual. I’m a physician, Mrs. Micucci, not… a greeting card writer. I typically address medical concerns. Is there anything medically you’re worried about?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t get all technical with me, Doctor! It’s not like I’m asking for surgery. It’s a card. Honestly, you doctors these days… no bedside manner at all. Look, he’s just very… stubborn. And making poor decisions. It’s causing stress. My stress. A card would show him he needs to think things through. It’s preventative medicine, really! If he feels supported, maybe he won't continue to… well, to be difficult. Do you have a blank card, or not? It’s not a complicated request.
DOCTOR: Preventative… right. Look, I understand you're stressed, and you feel a card might help. But ethically, I’m not comfortable writing a medical document for non-medical purposes. It could… create a misunderstanding. And as you said, he's not actually sick. Perhaps a letter from a friend?
PATIENT: A letter? Oh, please. Bimal doesn't listen to his friends! He thinks he knows everything. That’s the whole problem! You’re a doctor. People respect doctors. It would be different. A little authority… just to steer him right. It doesn't have to say anything about medicine, just… “Think carefully about your choices” or something. It’s not hurting anyone. Honestly, I don’t know why you’re making such a fuss. It’s a small thing. A very small thing. Are you sure you don’t have a spare card somewhere? Maybe with flowers on it?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Micucci, I'm starting to feel… a little uncomfortable. I’m concerned you’re attempting to use my position to influence someone. That’s not appropriate. Perhaps we could discuss strategies for you to cope with the stress, or suggest family counseling?
PATIENT: Family counseling?! Oh, don't be ridiculous. He’s the one who needs help, not me! I'm perfectly calm, thank you very much. You're being very difficult. It’s just a little piece of paper, Doctor Gorga! I wouldn’t ask you to perform a complicated operation! It’s not like I’m asking for a diagnosis for a phantom illness. It’s a gesture. A supportive gesture. Really, what’s the harm? You see people every day with real problems. Surely you can spare a few minutes to write a few encouraging words for a… for a troublesome husband. It’s a simple kindness. And frankly, I'm starting to think you don't care about your patients’ well-being if you won't even do something this small.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Micucci, I think we’ve reached an impasse. I’m not going to write a card. I can offer you resources for stress management, or provide a referral to a counselor, but I won't be creating documentation for a non-medical issue. I’m sorry, but that’s my final answer. Perhaps it’s best if you seek assistance elsewhere. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Fine! Fine, be that way! I knew coming here was a waste of time. A completely unhelpful, insensitive waste of time! You call yourself a doctor? You have no compassion. Absolutely none! I will find someone who understands the importance of a little… encouragement. And I will tell everyone I know what a terrible doctor you are! Don’t expect any referrals from me, that's for certain.
