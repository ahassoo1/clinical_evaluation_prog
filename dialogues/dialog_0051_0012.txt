DOCTOR: Good morning, Velda. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise – a lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires a form filled out by a doctor. Just some basic medical information, you understand. Nothing to worry about, I hope. It's just… paperwork, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly reasonable. Many cruise lines do require that. It's good you're being proactive. So, just to be thorough, even though you say it’s mainly paperwork, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. It will help me fill out the form accurately. Perhaps we could start with any current symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, right, of course. Thoroughness is good. Well, symptoms… let me think. I wouldn’t say I have any, not really. I feel quite well, all things considered. My joints ache a wee bit on damp days – I suppose that comes with getting older, doesn’t it? – and sometimes I get a little breathless going up stairs, but nothing I’d call a problem. I just slow down a bit, that’s all. Is that what you mean by symptoms?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Those are definitely things to note. The joint aches and breathlessness are helpful to know. Let's start with the joint aches. Where specifically are you feeling the aches, and how long have you been experiencing them?
PATIENT: Mostly in my knees and my hips, Doctor. And it’s not constant, you understand. Like I said, it’s worse when the weather is damp. It’s been… oh, goodness, probably ten years now, on and off. It’s never been so bad that I needed to do anything about it, just a little stiffness and discomfort. My mother had similar trouble, so I expect it’s just hereditary. Do you need to know when exactly it started, or just roughly?
DOCTOR: Roughly is fine, Velda. It's good you mention your mother had similar trouble – that is helpful. Ten years, on and off… and you said it’s mainly stiffness and discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Stiffness is the worst of it, really. I just feel a bit creaky in the mornings, and sometimes after sitting for a long time. Discomfort is… well, it’s not pain, not exactly. More like a dull ache, if that makes sense. I can usually walk it off, and a warm bath helps enormously. It doesn't interfere with my daily life, I should add. I still manage my work perfectly well. I’m a window dresser, you see, so I’m on my feet quite a bit.
DOCTOR: A window dresser, that’s interesting. So you're quite active then, despite the stiffness. That's good to know. Now, you also mentioned a little breathlessness going up stairs. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, active as I can be, Doctor. It keeps me young, I like to think! As for the breathlessness… well, it’s not like I’m gasping for air, you understand. It’s just that I need to pause halfway up a flight of stairs to catch my breath. It doesn’t happen every time, just sometimes, especially if I’m carrying something heavy. And I wouldn’t say it’s getting worse, not noticeably, anyway. It’s been… oh, maybe five years or so that I've noticed it. It's never worried me enough to see a doctor before, but I suppose I should mention it, given the cruise and all.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to mention it, Velda. It's good to have a complete picture. Five years, and not getting noticeably worse… That's helpful. Now, let's shift gears a bit. Do you have any current medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Let me see… diagnosed conditions… No, not as such, Doctor. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it came down with diet and exercise, and the doctor said it was fine after that. Nothing else, really. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. I've been lucky, I suppose. Just the usual wee ailments, you know – colds and flu and things like that. I don't take any regular medication, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Good, that's helpful to know. And no allergies to any medications or anything else, as far as you're aware?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I know of. I’ve always been able to take antibiotics and things like that without any trouble. I have a bit of a sensitive nose, perhaps, but that’s not an allergy, just… a delicate constitution, I suppose. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. You can put that down as "none," I think. That would be accurate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, Velda, just to be thorough, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family history… That’s a bit of a long story, Doctor. My mother, as I mentioned, had trouble with her joints, like me. My father was… well, he was a strong man, but he had a heart condition later in life. He passed away when he was seventy-two, I believe. My brother is quite healthy, thankfully. He lives in Canada, and I don’t see him often. I don’t really know much about his medical history, to be honest. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I don’t want to bore you with too much detail.
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful to know, Velda. Just a general idea is fine. Joint trouble in your mother and a heart condition in your father… That gives me a good starting point. Now, just a few more questions, and then perhaps a quick physical exam if you don’t mind. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. No, Doctor, I don’t smoke. Never have. It’s a dreadful habit, I think. I do enjoy a glass of sherry with my dinner sometimes – just one, mind you, a small glass. And no, absolutely not to the other question. I’m a very respectable woman, you see. I’ve never had any interest in such things. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that’s perfectly clear, Velda. Social sherry use only. Now, before we move onto the physical exam, could you tell me your height and weight, if you know them?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. I haven’t been weighed in ages, I suspect. I’m around five foot seven inches tall, I think. And as for weight… well, I’m a bit on the slender side. Perhaps around ten stone? I haven’t been very precise lately, I’m afraid. I used to weigh myself regularly, but I've let it slip. Do you need an exact number, Doctor? I could try to find a scale somewhere.
DOCTOR: No, that’s fine, Velda. An estimate is perfectly acceptable for now. Five foot seven and around ten stone. Thank you. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, and check your joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Go ahead. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. It’s all for a good cause, after all – the cruise! I do hope I’m not taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Velda. It’s my job. Please, if you could just sit here on the table, and we’ll get started. Okay, your heart sounds regular, although a little quiet. Your lungs are clear. And I can feel a little crepitus – that’s a grating sound – in your knees and hips, with some tenderness when I move them. That’s consistent with some mild arthritis. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. Now, let me just take a quick look at your throat and ears. Everything looks good here.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Everything sounds good, anyway. Arthritis, you say? I thought as much. It’s not causing me much trouble, thankfully. Just a bit of stiffness, as I mentioned. Is it something I should be worried about, Doctor? Do I need medication or anything? I do hope it won’t interfere with my cruise! I’ve been planning it for months.
DOCTOR: No, Velda, it doesn’t sound like anything to be overly worried about at this point. It seems to be mild arthritis, likely related to age and heredity. It’s good that it's not interfering with your daily life. At this stage, medication isn't necessary. We can manage it with simple measures: regular, gentle exercise to keep your joints mobile, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if you experience any discomfort. I would advise you to avoid strenuous activity that aggravates your joints. As for your cruise, I don't foresee any issues, provided you’re mindful of your limitations. I’ll note on the form that you have mild arthritis, well-controlled with over-the-counter medication, and recommend gentle exercise. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very reassuring, Doctor. Gentle exercise and over-the-counter pain relievers… that sounds perfectly manageable. I do enjoy a bit of walking, so that’s good. I’ll be sure to pack some ibuprofen, just in case. And I will be mindful of my limitations. I don’t want to overdo it. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. Thank you very much. I feel much better now, knowing what’s going on. Is there anything else I need to do? Or should I just fill out the paperwork and be on my way?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Velda. I'm glad I could help. No, there's nothing else you need to do at this point. I'll print out a brief summary of our discussion for your records, including the note about the mild arthritis and the recommendations. I'll also complete the cruise line form. It may take a moment to finalize. Here you are. This is the summary for your records, and this is the completed cruise line form. Please, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or develop any new concerns, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any final questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you very much, Doctor. This is perfect. Everything seems to be in order. No, I don't think I have any further questions. You've been wonderfully helpful and kind. I appreciate your time and attention. I think that’s everything. Thank you again, and have a lovely day! I’m off to prepare for my cruise, and I can now do so with peace of mind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Velda. It was a pleasure meeting you. Enjoy your cruise! And don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a wonderful time, and safe travels!
