DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is the name. Look, I don't really do small talk, Doc. I’m here for this… exam. Military wants me to take it. Need to get it done, paperwork and all that. Don't see why I need to tell you why I'm here, it’s all on the paper, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You're right, of course, the paperwork does give me some information. It says it’s a required medical examination for the military. And you’re perfectly right to want to be efficient with your time. However, even with the form, it helps me understand your overall health picture, and ensures I don’t miss anything. Just to clarify, are you currently serving, or is this for re-enlistment, or perhaps a prior service check-up?
PATIENT: Serving? Ha! No. Never. This is... well, my boy, he’s gone and joined up. Bright lad, always was. But they want me to be a backup, in case… well, you know. Old man support. Don't see the point myself, but his mother… she gets worried. So, here I am. Never been in the military, never will be if I can help it. Just need this piece of paper so they'll leave me alone.
DOCTOR: I see. So this is to fulfill requirements related to your son’s service. That makes perfect sense. Thank you for clarifying. That's good of you to support him. Alright, well, let's get this exam done then, so we can get you the paperwork you need. We’ll just go through a standard check-up. I’ll ask some questions about your medical history, do a quick physical examination, and then we’ll discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Sounds… efficient. Just get on with it, Doc. Don’t need a long story, just the questions. I haven’t got all day. I’ve got things to do, you know. Workshop doesn’t run itself. And honestly, I’m a bit busy fixing things. Important things, not… paperwork.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your time is valuable. We will be as efficient as possible. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? No. Never. I eat reasonably, don’t drink much, and work hard. Bit of a bad back sometimes, from bending over engines all day, but that’s just… old age, I suppose. Nothing a good stretch can’t fix. And honestly, I don't go to doctors. Waste of time and money, if you ask me. I fix things myself. Even my own teeth, once. Not the most pleasant experience, that was.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for self-reliance, Mr. Hartness. I appreciate you being upfront about that. While a good stretch is helpful for back pain, it’s good to rule out anything more serious. Have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. Never been under the knife. Like I said, I fix things myself. Why would I let someone poke around inside me? That’s… barbaric. I’ve seen what they do. And I’ve got no time for recovery, no time to be laid up. Workshop needs me. So, no. No surgeries. Never. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just wasting time?
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Hartness. I apologize if my questions seem intrusive. I simply want to get a complete picture of your health. Okay, how about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. My father, he lived to a good age. Worked in a steel mill, tough as nails. Died of… old age, I think. Mother, she was alright. Bit frail, always worrying. She died… peacefully, in her sleep. Nothing exciting. My brother, he's still kicking. Runs a farm. Solid as a rock. No fancy illnesses, no nothing. Healthy, hardworking folk, all of us. It’s the modern food and lazy living that’s the problem, if you ask me. Not genetics. Is this really necessary, Doc?
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Hartness. It's good to know your family has a history of good health. Just a few more questions, then we can move on to a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any. Can eat anything, take anything. Like I said, tough as nails. Bit of a sniffle sometimes when the pollen's bad, but that’s just… nature, isn’t it? Not an allergy. I don’t go running for a doctor every time I sneeze. That’s… ridiculous. Honestly, I think people just imagine they’re allergic to things. Are you trying to trick me, Doc?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Hartness. I simply want to be thorough. No allergies then. That's good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. Don’t need ‘em. Can’t stand the thought of pumping chemicals into my body. I eat well, work hard, and get enough sleep. That’s all I need. Maybe a bit of coffee to get me going in the morning, but that’s it. That’s natural, isn't it? And honestly, I’ve read about the side effects of those pills. Horrible. No thank you. Are we finally done with the questions, Doc? I’m starting to feel like I’m being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Hartness, we are. Thank you for your patience. No medications or supplements. That’s good to know. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical examination. Just some basic checks – blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, looking in your ears, and feeling your abdomen. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don’t poke around too much. And be quick about it. I’ve got things to do, you know. Workshop isn’t going to fix itself. And honestly, I don’t like being touched. Just get it done, Doc.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Okay, your blood pressure is 145 over 88. A little bit on the higher side, but we can discuss that later. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out…
PATIENT: Get on with it, Doc. I don’t like having things pressed against my chest. Makes me feel… claustrophobic. And honestly, I don’t understand what you’re listening for. Just tell me if something’s broken, alright? No need for fancy explanations.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. I didn’t hear anything unusual. Now, let’s just take a look in your ears. Please tilt your head slightly. Your ears look clear as well. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Please relax. Your abdomen feels soft and normal. A little bit of tenderness when I press here, but nothing concerning. Is this area usually tender?
PATIENT: Tenderness? Well, I do a lot of bending over engines, Doc. Like I said, workshop isn’t easy work. Probably just a strained muscle. I’ve got a bad back sometimes too, you know. Don’t need you poking around inside me. I fix things myself. And honestly, you’re making me nervous. Just tell me if I’m fit enough for this exam, alright? Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. That concludes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick examination, you appear generally healthy. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and you experienced some tenderness in your abdomen, likely related to your work. But there are no immediately concerning signs. Before I can clear you for this military exam, I would recommend getting a more thorough blood pressure check over a few days, just to make sure it’s not consistently high. And if the abdominal pain worsens or doesn't improve, please do come back so we can investigate further. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: More checks? Honestly, Doc, it’s a waste of time and money. I don't like doctors, you know that. But… fine. I’ll try to get my blood pressure checked. But only to get this over with. I don’t want to come back here. So… am I fit enough for this exam? Can I just get the paper now? I need to get back to the workshop. This has been a complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Considering your overall presentation and your stated health history, I will sign this form stating that you are medically cleared for this examination, with the caveat that you follow up with a blood pressure check. Here you go. Please note that this clearance is provisional, pending your blood pressure check. I understand your time is valuable, and I apologize for any inconvenience. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… glad it’s over. Waste of a morning, if you ask me. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Mr. Hartness. And please do take care of yourself. .
