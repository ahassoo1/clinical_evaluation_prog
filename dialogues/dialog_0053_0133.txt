DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just Melvenia is fine, please. Well, I need some papers signed, really. It’s for some health forms… I think they need a notary, or something verified, to make sure they’re right. I don’t really understand all the fuss, but they said I needed to come here.
DOCTOR: Right. Forms. And who exactly said you needed to come here specifically, Melvenia?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was the people at the Senior Center. They’re helping me with some benefits, and they said these forms needed to be official. They mentioned a doctor needing to sign off on them, and someone suggested Dr. Pitmon. Is that… is that okay? I just want to get this done quickly, if we can.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, I suppose. It’s… unconventional, to be perfectly honest. Usually, these forms relate to some sort of medical condition we're addressing. What benefits are you applying for, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… it’s for help with some of the bills, mostly. The heating bill gets so high in the winter, and my pension just doesn’t stretch as far as it used to. It’s just assistance, you know? Nothing fancy. They said having a doctor verify I’m… well, that I’m still here and able to fill things out properly was part of the process. Is it a problem?
DOCTOR: Not a problem, precisely. It’s just… inefficient. I’m a doctor, Melvenia, not a notary public. Still, if it requires a signature to confirm your basic capacity… Alright. Let’s start with this: do you have any trouble with your memory?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. A little forgetfulness, like everyone my age, I suppose. I might misplace my glasses or forget what I had for breakfast, but nothing serious. I can still balance my checkbook, and I remember my grandchildren’s birthdays, thankfully. That would be awful, wouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not what it used to be, naturally. I wear glasses, as I said, and sometimes things are a bit blurry even with them on. I get by. It hasn't stopped me from doing my crossword puzzles, thankfully! Though sometimes I need a little help from my daughter.
DOCTOR: Right. And any difficulties with… say, understanding things when people speak?
PATIENT: No, not really. My hearing isn't perfect, but I can usually understand what people are saying. Sometimes I need them to speak up a bit, especially if there's noise, but it’s manageable. Are you asking if I’m confused easily? Because I’m not. I just want to get these papers signed, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's do a quick little assessment, just to be thorough, Melvenia. I need to document this, you understand. Could you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s… August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? It's easy to lose track of the days sometimes, you know? Yes, August 2nd. I'm pretty sure.
DOCTOR: And what city are we in?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you have me thinking. It's… a small town. I haven't lived in a big city in years. Is that one of those trick questions? It’s… near the mountains, I think. Rural, that’s what they call it. I really don’t keep up with the geography much anymore. Honestly, I just go to the grocery store and the Senior Center. I… I don't want to make a fool of myself.
DOCTOR: Melvenia, with all due respect, it seems we’re… struggling a bit with basic orientation. While I’m happy to sign these forms, I strongly recommend a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. I wouldn’t want to simply rubber-stamp this without being certain of your capacity. It's a matter of ethical responsibility. We could start with a referral to a neurologist. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Oh. A neurologist? Is… is something wrong? I just wanted someone to sign a paper. I feel so foolish… and now a neurologist? I… I don't know. I just want to get this assistance… I don't want to be a bother. Maybe… maybe I'll just go home and ask my daughter. She's good with things like this. I… .
