DOCTOR: Hi Albino, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back. It’s been…troubling me. Lower back, mostly. Feels kinda weak, you know? And aches a lot. It’s been going on for a while now, not just today.
DOCTOR: Okay, your lower back. Aching and feeling weak, and it's been going on for a while. Can you tell me a bit more about that ache?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not a sharp pain, not like when I fell off the ladder last year – that was quick! This is… dull. Constant. Worse when I bend over, or try to lift things. Even just sitting for too long makes it worse. It's like… old bones complaining, you know? I’m an old man, after all. 77 years old.
DOCTOR: Dull, constant ache, worse with bending, lifting, and prolonged sitting… yes, I understand. And you said it’s been going on for a while – could you give me a rough estimate of how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started… maybe six months ago? Not bad at first, just a little stiffness in the mornings. But it’s slowly gotten worse. Maybe two, three months ago it really started bothering me. Enough that I had to be careful. I don't know exactly. Time gets away from you, you know?
DOCTOR: It absolutely does. Six months total, getting progressively worse over the last two to three months. Okay. And when you say "careful", what does that look like?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t climb ladders anymore, that's for sure! And I can’t lift my grandkids like I used to. They're getting too big anyway. I try not to bend over too much when I'm gardening, which is hard, 'cause I like my garden. I take it slow. Real slow. And I try not to sit for too long. It’s a lot of getting up and walking around. It’s making things hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, avoiding ladders, limiting lifting, being cautious with gardening, and taking frequent breaks from sitting. That gives me a good picture. Now, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your back pain right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… Right now? It's… maybe a 4. Not horrible, but it's there. It’s always a little something. Like a… a weight on my back. Some days it’s a 6, especially after I try to do too much. But today, it’s more like a 4.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 4 currently, but fluctuates up to a 6 with activity. And do you notice anything that makes it feel better?
PATIENT: Well, when I lie down, that helps. Especially on my side with a pillow between my knees. And heat. A warm bath, or a heating pad on my back. That feels real good. Doesn’t make it go away, but it takes the edge off. Helps me sleep, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down, especially on your side with a pillow, and heat are helpful. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. My feet…sometimes they feel a little cold, but I always have cold feet! That’s just old age, I think. No numbness or tingling, though. And my legs feel okay. I can walk alright, though I don't go as fast as I used to. Everything’s slowing down, Doctor. Everything.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No numbness, tingling, or weakness. Just some cold feet, which is common. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I used to have high blood pressure, but I don’t take medicine for it anymore. Doctor told me I could stop a few years back. Everything was fine at the last check-up. Other than that… no, not really. Just old age! I take a multivitamin every day, if that counts.
DOCTOR: Okay, you used to have high blood pressure but it’s now managed without medication, and you take a daily multivitamin. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was…a long time ago! And I broke my wrist when I was younger, fell off a horse. But other than that… no. No big surgeries, no hospital stays. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years. And the COVID, when that was going around. But I didn’t need to go to the hospital for that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, broken wrist, and had COVID. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, no other medications. Just the multivitamin. Sometimes I take something for heartburn, if I eat something spicy. But that's just when I need it, not every day. I try to avoid spicy food now, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just a multivitamin, and occasional heartburn medication. And finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with any food or medicine. I eat everything! Well, I don't eat bugs, but that's just common sense, right? No, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's great to know. No known allergies. Alright, Albino, thank you for sharing all that information with me. It gives me a good understanding of your history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to check your back and legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could lie down on your stomach on the exam table for me, that would be perfect. I’ll start by feeling along your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Then I’ll check your range of motion and reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's alright. Go ahead, Doctor. Take your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just feeling along your spine now. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right… about here. When you press… a little bit. It’s not sharp, just… uncomfortable. And maybe a little here too, on the left. Not as bad, though. It’s been aching there all day, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some tenderness there, as you mentioned. Now, I'm going to ask you to gently bend forward as far as you comfortably can. Just go as far as you can without pushing yourself. Let me know when you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… not so good. It’s tight. Real tight. I can't go very far. It feels like something’s blocking me. Not a sharp pain, just… a stiff ache. I can't go much further, Doctor. I'm afraid I'll pull something.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. No need to push yourself. I see you have some limited range of motion. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs. If you could just relax your legs, I’ll tap a small hammer on your knees and ankles. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. My knees aren't what they used to be, but go ahead. I used to be a good soccer player, you know! But that was a long time ago. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, your reflexes are a little bit diminished, but they're symmetrical, which is good. And finally, I’m going to do a quick straight leg raise test. If you could just lie flat on your back, I’ll gently lift each leg, one at a time. Let me know if you feel any pain down your leg when I lift it.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Go ahead, Doctor. Lift it slowly, please. This old body doesn’t bend easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm lifting your right leg now. Do you feel any pain down your leg?
PATIENT: No, not down my leg. It feels a little bit…tight in my back, that’s all. Just a mild ache. Not sharp, not anything too bad. Like I was saying, it's always a little ache there. But not shooting down my leg, no. It’s the same ache I always feel.
DOCTOR: Alright, and now your left leg. Any pain radiating down the leg?
PATIENT: No, no pain down the leg with this one either. Just the same… tightness in my back. It feels a little better on this side, maybe. Hard to tell, though. Like I said, my back is always a little sore. Is that bad, Doctor? Are things bad?
DOCTOR: Alright, Albino. I’ve completed the exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings of the physical exam, it sounds like you are experiencing lower back pain, likely due to muscle strain or age-related wear and tear. There doesn’t appear to be any nerve compression causing pain to radiate down your legs, which is good. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common with age, and doesn't cause immediate concern. It's not necessarily "bad", but it's something we need to address to improve your comfort and quality of life. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that makes sense. So… not anything serious? Just old bones complaining? I was worried it might be something bad. Muscle strain… I can live with that. What can we do about it, Doctor? How do we make it better? I want to keep gardening, you know? And playing with my grandkids.
DOCTOR: That’s a great goal, Albino, and it’s certainly achievable. While it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause, muscle strain and age-related changes are the most likely culprits. Here's what I recommend. First, we'll start with conservative management: 1. Heat and Ice: Alternate between applying heat and ice to your lower back. Heat for 20 minutes, then ice for 20 minutes, several times a day. 2. Gentle Exercise: Start with gentle exercises to strengthen your back and core muscles. I can give you a handout with some simple exercises to try. 3. Pain Relief: Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce inflammation and pain. Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle. 4. Posture and Body Mechanics: Be mindful of your posture and use proper body mechanics when lifting and bending. 5. Physical Therapy: If your pain doesn’t improve after a few weeks, I recommend physical therapy to help strengthen your back muscles and improve your range of motion. We'll start with these measures and see how you respond. We can also discuss a referral to a physical therapist if you’d like. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Heat and ice, exercise, painkillers… I can do that. I used to go to physical therapy for my knee a few years back, that helped. A handout with exercises would be great, thank you. And if it doesn't get better, we can talk about that other thing. What about my bones? Should I be taking something for my bones? I'm an old man, after all. Maybe something to make them stronger?
DOCTOR: That’s a great question, Albino. Let me check your records to see if you’ve had a bone density scan recently. It's important to rule out osteoporosis, which is a condition where your bones become weak and brittle. Okay, it looks like you haven’t had a bone density scan. Given your age, I recommend getting one to assess your bone health. We can order that today. In the meantime, making sure you’re getting enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet is important. I can give you a handout on calcium and vitamin D-rich foods. If you're not getting enough through diet, we can discuss a vitamin D supplement. Would you like me to order the bone density scan and provide you with that handout?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Order the scan and give me the handout. Can’t hurt to be careful, right? And thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I feel better already, just knowing what's going on. Now, about those exercises… what are we talking about? Lifting weights? I don't want to pull a muscle!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Albino. That's exactly right - it’s always best to be cautious. As for the exercises, nothing too strenuous! We'll start with gentle core strengthening and back stretches. Think of things like pelvic tilts, knee-to-chest stretches, and gentle back extensions. We’ll avoid anything that causes pain. Here’s a handout with detailed instructions and pictures. I recommend starting slowly and gradually increasing the intensity as you get stronger. If you experience any pain, stop immediately. It’s best to start with just a few repetitions each day and gradually increase the number as you get more comfortable. I’ll also write you a prescription for a multivitamin with vitamin D. Do you have any questions about the exercises or the handout?
PATIENT: No, no, I think I understand. Gentle stretches, start slow… It's like my mother used to say, 'slow and steady wins the race!' I can do that. I'll take it easy. And thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I think that’s all for now. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Albino. It was my pleasure. The only other thing is to schedule a follow-up appointment in about four to six weeks to see how you're doing and discuss the results of your bone density scan. Would you like me to schedule that for you now?
