DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been getting in my side, mostly. And… these water infections keep coming back. It’s been going on for a while now, and it's starting to wear me down a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain in your side and recurrent water infections. That does sound frustrating. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. First, regarding the pain in your side – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, mostly on my right side, just below my ribs. Sometimes it radiates around to my back a little. And it feels worse after I eat, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache on the right side, below the ribs, radiating to the back, and worse after eating… that gives me some initial clues. To clarify, when you say it comes and goes, how often would you estimate you experience this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s not every day, thankfully. Maybe… three or four times a week, on average? Some weeks it’s more, some weeks less. It's hard to keep track, honestly. It just seems to be… unpredictable. And the severity varies too, sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times it’s quite uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly three or four times a week, varying in severity and somewhat unpredictable. Thank you for clarifying. Now, let’s talk about these water infections. How often are you getting them, and when was your most recent one?
PATIENT: Oh, the water infections… they’ve been a real bother. I’d say… maybe once every month or six weeks, on average. The last one… let me think… it was just about two weeks ago, I believe. I had to go to the urgent care for that one, they gave me some antibiotics. But they seem to keep coming back, even with the medicine.
DOCTOR: Once every month or six weeks, despite antibiotic treatment… that’s certainly concerning. We need to investigate why these infections are recurring. I see here from your urgent care visits that you’ve been treated for urinary tract infections several times in the past few months. Do you recall any specific symptoms you experience with these infections – burning with urination, frequent urge to go, cloudy or bloody urine, fever, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s usually a burning sensation when I go to the toilet, and I feel like I need to go all the time, even if there's nothing there. Sometimes my urine is cloudy, and once or twice I've noticed a little bit of blood. I haven’t had a fever, thankfully. It’s just… very uncomfortable and disruptive. It makes me tired, too. And worried, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination, frequent urge, cloudy urine, occasional blood, and fatigue. That paints a clearer picture. Now, let’s move on to some more general questions to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was diagnosed with something… polycystic kidney disease, I think they called it. A long time ago now, maybe twenty years or so. I don’t see a specialist for it regularly, they just told me to monitor my blood pressure and see my regular doctor. To be honest, I haven’t thought about it much until this pain and these infections started. Does that make sense? It's been a long time and I thought it wasn't bothering me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Polycystic kidney disease is important information, especially given your current symptoms. It's good you’ve been monitoring your blood pressure, but we may need to revisit that and potentially get a more thorough evaluation of your kidney function. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don’t believe I’ve ever had any surgeries. I was in the hospital once, many years ago, when I broke my arm as a young man, but that was just an overnight stay. Nothing major, certainly. Otherwise, I’ve been fairly healthy, all things considered. Apart from this kidney business, of course, and now these infections.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, just a broken arm many years ago. That's good to know. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe, and my father… he had some sort of heart trouble, I think. Nothing specific, I’m afraid. My siblings are all fairly healthy, as far as I know. None of them have had kidney problems, as far as I'm aware, but we don't see each other very often these days. It's been a while since we've talked about medical things. Does that help, Doctor? I'm not very good at remembering these details.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. High blood pressure and heart trouble in your parents are worth noting. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’m retired now, so I don’t do much physical work. I enjoy gardening when the weather is nice, and I like to read. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, but I do enjoy a sweet treat now and then. I don’t exercise regularly, I’m afraid. It’s just… getting older, you know? It's harder to get motivated. Is there anything specific you’d like to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture. And no, nothing specific at the moment. Just trying to get a full understanding. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a small tablet for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And sometimes I take paracetamol for aches and pains, but not regularly. That’s it, I think. I’ll have to double-check with my wife just to be sure, but that should be everything. She’s the one who keeps track of these things, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional paracetamol. Thank you. And that’s perfectly fine about checking with your wife – it’s always good to be sure. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. I've never had any reactions to any medications, as far as I can recall. And I don't have any known allergies to food or anything else, thankfully. I’m fairly lucky in that regard. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know. No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Espinueva, thank you for answering all of those questions. I think I have a good understanding of your medical history and current situation. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I trust your judgment, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. I’m just checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. I do notice some tenderness on your right side, just below your ribs. It's not severe, but it's definitely present. Your blood pressure is 145/90, which is slightly elevated. Okay, Mr. Espinueva. Those are my initial findings. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, I suspect the recurrent urinary tract infections and the right-sided pain may be related to your polycystic kidney disease, and potentially complicated by the slightly elevated blood pressure. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood tests to assess your kidney function, check for infection, and evaluate your overall health. I also want to order a urine sample to confirm the infection and rule out any other problems. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Blood tests and a urine sample… absolutely, I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I just want to get to the bottom of this and feel better. And I understand the need to rule out other possibilities. Please, go ahead with the tests. I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests and urine sample now. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will be able to assist you with collecting the urine sample. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or worsening pain, please contact the clinic immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, and I feel much more reassured knowing we're taking steps to investigate this. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kind manner. I'll go and get the tests done now. Thank you very much for your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. The nurse will be right with you to assist with the urine sample and explain the blood test process. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
