DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about my…well, my business. Been a mechanic for fifty years, you know. Fifty! And I take my ibuprofen. A lot of it. Knees, back, you name it. Anyway, things are coming out…dark. Black, mostly. It’s not normal, is it? And I haven't got time for this, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hatchard. Fifty years is a long time to be a mechanic – that’s quite a commitment. And I appreciate your frankness. You’re concerned about dark stool, and you use ibuprofen frequently for knee and back pain, correct?
PATIENT: Correct. And don't bother asking about how much ibuprofen. It's enough to keep a normal person down for a week. Look, I’m not here to discuss my life choices. I just want to know if I’m bleeding internally or something. Is that what dark stool means? Because I have a truck to fix.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Hatchard, I'm not here to judge your life choices. My concern is your health. Dark stool can indicate bleeding in the digestive tract, which is why it's important we investigate this. However, it can also be caused by certain foods or medications. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the stool more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Ugh. It's…black. Like tar, almost. Not shiny tar, more…dull. And it smells…well, it smells like…iron, I guess? Not a pleasant smell. It's not watery, it's…solid, but not…firm. Does that make sense? And it started…oh, maybe a week ago? I didn’t think much of it at first, honestly. Thought I maybe ate something funny.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Ms. Hatchard. “Tar-like”, dull black, with an iron-like smell…and you've noticed this for about a week. It's good you’re bringing this to my attention now. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this change in stool?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Besides being generally tired, which, let me tell you, comes with the territory of being my age and doing what I do? No. No dizziness. No stomach pain, not really. Maybe a little heartburn now and then, but that’s just the coffee. And I haven't thrown up. Definitely haven't thrown up. I’m not one for making a fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay. No dizziness, no stomach pain, occasional heartburn, no vomiting… and no change in your energy levels besides the usual fatigue. You mentioned using ibuprofen frequently. Approximately how many milligrams would you say you take in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Are you trying to interrogate me? Look, I don't count pills, alright? It’s…enough to keep me working. Maybe six? Eight? I take two with breakfast, two with lunch, and then another couple if I’ve had a particularly rough day wrenching on something. It's not a precise science. I take them as needed. And honestly, it’s none of your business how much.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. However, the amount of ibuprofen you're taking is relevant to your symptoms. High doses of ibuprofen can, unfortunately, cause gastrointestinal bleeding, which can explain the dark stool. I need to gather as much information as possible to ensure I can provide you with the best care. To proceed, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, focusing on your abdomen, and then order a stool test to check for the presence of blood. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have a deadline, you know. A perfectly good engine waiting for me. And I suppose if it's blood, I need to know. But if this takes long, I’m charging you for lost business. Don't think I won’t. Now, poke and prod. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I will be as efficient as possible. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now…and I'm gently pressing on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at all. Do you feel any tenderness anywhere?
PATIENT: Not particularly. It feels…like an abdomen. I've had three kids, you know. I know what discomfort feels like. It's a little tender right…here. Not painful, just…sensitive. And don't make a face, I know I'm not exactly a spring chicken. It’s probably just gas. Honestly, I ate a bad sausage yesterday.
DOCTOR: Okay. Mild tenderness in the lower right quadrant. I'm also noting no rebound tenderness or guarding, which is reassuring. I'm also listening for any bruits. No bruits detected. Now, to confirm what might be going on, I'm going to order a stool test – a fecal occult blood test, or FOBT – to check for blood in your stool. It's a simple test; you'll just need to collect a small sample. The lab will contact you with the results, usually within a few days. Given your history of ibuprofen use and the reported tenderness, I also recommend a complete blood count to assess your red blood cell levels and look for any signs of anemia. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever tests you need. Just get them done. And can you please hurry? I’m losing daylight. And tell the lab to call me directly. I don’t have time to play phone tag with receptionists. My number is 555-123-4567. Now, where do I get this…sample container?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I’ve noted your contact information. The lab will call you directly with the results. I'm printing the lab requisition forms now. Here are the forms for the stool test and the CBC. The instructions for collecting the stool sample are included. Please try to collect the sample as soon as possible, and the lab will need it within three days. For the CBC, you can go to any lab that accepts your Medicare insurance. Do you have any questions about the collection process or where to go for the blood test?
PATIENT: No. Just tell me where to go for the blood test. And make it quick. Honestly, I've wasted enough time here already. Is there a lab in this building? I don't want to drive all over town.
DOCTOR: Yes, fortunately, there is a lab located on the third floor of this building. Take the elevators to the third floor, and turn left. The reception desk is just past the double doors. They'll need your Medicare card and the requisition form I provided. Here’s a map to help you find it. And to reiterate, Ms. Hatchard, please contact your primary care physician with the results of these tests, as I am only consulting. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Honestly, I’m ready to get out of here and back to work. Thank you…I guess. And please don't bother calling me unless it’s an emergency. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your time is valuable. I’ll be sure to document everything thoroughly. If you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or noticeable blood in your stool – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I wish you all the best with your work.
