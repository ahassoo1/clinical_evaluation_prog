DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Brando. Yes, well… something about a check-up? For… work. They said I needed to get something signed off on. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Been a lot of things lately. Something to do with… acting, I think? Or maybe performing. It’s the media people, I believe. They arranged this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. A check-up for work, arranged by the media people. That’s perfectly alright, we can certainly do that. It sounds like a bit of a confusing situation, so we’ll take our time and get everything sorted. To start, could you tell me a little more about the type of work you do?
PATIENT: Work… right. Oh dear. Well, I… I’ve done a bit of everything, really. Mostly… front of house stuff. You know, at theaters and… places. Ushering, taking tickets, helping people find their seats. Sometimes I’d show folks to the lobby. I’ve been doing that… a long time. It’s mostly standing, I suppose. And smiling. A lot of smiling. I don’t… perform perform, if that makes sense. Not on stage, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, so primarily front of house work – ushering, ticket taking, assisting patrons. Mostly standing and a good deal of smiling. That’s helpful to know, Brando. And you’re correct to clarify you don’t perform on stage. Now, is this check-up specifically because of the physical demands of this work, or is it a routine requirement from the media people?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I couldn’t tell you. They just said I needed to come in. Something about… clearances. I think it’s just… standard procedure. It’s a new agency, you see. They’re very thorough. I don’t feel any different, if that matters. I’ve been doing this work for decades. My feet get tired, naturally, but… that’s just old age, isn’t it? I haven't had any… accidents or anything. Not recently, anyway. It’s all… a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. It sounds like this is primarily a procedural check-up for the new agency, and you’re not experiencing any specific complaints or changes in your health. That’s good to know. To be thorough, though, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… That’s… a tough one. I’ve seen doctors, of course. Over the years. But… I don’t really remember being told I had anything specific. My ex-wife handled most of that. She was very organized. I think… I had my tonsils out when I was a boy? And… a bad back once, years ago. But it healed. Mostly. I’m… not a regular visitor to the hospital, if that helps. I try to stay healthy. Mostly. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is that alright? Should I have brought something with me?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Brando. It’s very common for details to be a bit hazy, and it’s helpful to know your memory isn’t what it used to be. We’ll take things slowly. Tonsils out as a child and a previous back issue are good to know. And it's perfectly fine that you don't have records readily available. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. Never been one for fancy foods, so I haven’t had much opportunity to be allergic to anything. I did have a bit of a reaction to some sort of cream once, years ago. A rash, I think. But I don’t remember what it was in. My ex-wife… she’d always ask about that sort of thing. Honestly, Doctor, I'm fairly certain I don’t have any serious allergies. Nothing that’s ever required a trip to the emergency room, anyway. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Brando. It sounds like a minor rash in the past, but no known severe allergies. We'll proceed with that in mind. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I believe in a healthy diet… mostly. And getting enough rest. Though that’s harder these days. I used to take something for my back, years ago, but I stopped when it healed. Now… nothing. Just a cup of tea in the morning. And sometimes a little something to help me sleep, if I’m really restless. But it’s just… herbal, I think. My ex-wife bought it. She was very good at looking after these things. I really haven’t taken anything regularly in… a very long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. No regular medications or supplements. Just occasional herbal tea for sleep. That’s good to know. To get a clearer picture of your overall health, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than your tonsils and back?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Oh dear. Let me see. Not that I recall, no. I had a bit of a scare once, a bad flu, but I managed that at home. And… a broken wrist when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But that was just a quick visit to the emergency room, not a full hospital stay. My ex-wife… she always handled the details. She’d remind me if I was forgetting something. Honestly, Doctor, I've been fairly lucky, health-wise. I haven't had any serious illnesses or surgeries. Knock on wood. I try to stay active, you see. All that ushering keeps me on my feet.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. It sounds like a broken wrist in childhood and a bout of the flu, but no significant hospitalizations or surgeries. That’s very good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Family… That's a difficult one. I wasn't very close to my parents, honestly. My mother passed away when I was young. And my father… well, he wasn’t much for talking about health. I think… he had high blood pressure, maybe? But I’m not sure. And my siblings… I haven’t seen them in years. We lost touch. I really don’t know much about their medical histories. My ex-wife… she knew everyone’s business, but I didn’t pay much attention. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. It’s all a bit… hazy. I’m afraid my family history isn’t very clear.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Brando. It’s common for family history to be unclear, especially if you weren’t close to your family. We can proceed without detailed information for now. To get a better sense of your current health, would you mind if I asked a few questions about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Oh. Yes, of course. Though I don’t lead a very exciting one. Ask away, Doctor. I mostly just… go to work, come home, watch a bit of television. It’s quiet. Peaceful. Not much to tell, really. But go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. Let's start with smoking. Have you ever smoked cigarettes or used any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. Not even tried. My ex-wife… she wouldn't have allowed it. She was very health-conscious. I always thought it smelled awful. And it seemed… silly. I've always preferred fresh air. No, I’ve never been a smoker. Thank goodness for that, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Brando. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Well, I used to have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. My ex-wife and I, mostly on special occasions. But I haven’t had a drink in… oh, goodness, years. Not since the divorce. It just didn’t seem… appealing anymore. I prefer tea, you see. And I don’t really enjoy the taste. So, no. Not really a drinker. A social glass now and then, a long time ago. But nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. Minimal alcohol consumption in the past. Now, let’s talk about exercise. You mentioned your work keeps you on your feet, but do you do any other forms of exercise or physical activity regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise… Oh, dear. Besides the ushering? No, not really. I used to enjoy walking, years ago, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. And… well, frankly, I’m usually too tired after work. I mostly just… relax. Watch television. Read a bit. It’s not very exciting, I know. But I don’t have much energy for strenuous activity these days. So, no. No regular exercise, unfortunately. I wish I did, but… it’s just not something I prioritize.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. No regular exercise. Now, one last question about your lifestyle. How would you describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: My diet… Hmm. It’s… simple. I mostly eat… well, whatever’s easiest. Canned soup, sandwiches, a bit of fruit. I try to eat my vegetables, but I don’t always have the energy to cook. I don’t really enjoy cooking, to be honest. My ex-wife did all the cooking. It’s not very healthy, I suppose. But I try to eat enough to get by. Nothing fancy, Doctor. Just… basic food. I don't have a sweet tooth, thankfully. And I drink a lot of tea. Perhaps too much tea.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. A simple diet and high tea consumption. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or unusual symptoms at the moment?
PATIENT: Pain… Well, my feet ache a bit at the end of the day, naturally. From all the standing. And my back sometimes twinges, if I bend over too quickly. But that’s just… old age, I suppose. Nothing serious. I don’t have any sharp pains, if that makes sense. And no… no unusual symptoms. No fever, no cough, no dizziness. Just… general tiredness. And a bit of stiffness in the mornings. But that’s just… getting old, Doctor. I’m afraid I’m not much to look at, physically. But I function, you see. I get by.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. Aching feet and occasional back discomfort. That’s helpful to know. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. This will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a brief examination of your joints and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… Yes, alright. I suppose so. As long as it’s not too… invasive. I haven’t had one in years. Just… be gentle, Doctor, please. My old bones aren’t what they used to be. And… if it becomes too uncomfortable, please just let me know. I’m not very good with… poking and prodding. But yes, alright. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Brando. We’ll take things slowly and gently. I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. And please, do tell me immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. It might be a bit tight… haven’t moved it much today. And… is that cuff going to be tight? My ex-wife always said I had good circulation… but she also said a lot of things. Just… be careful, alright? I don’t want to fall over.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. Just relaxing your arm, if you could. This will just take a moment. It may feel a bit snug, but it shouldn’t be painful. I'm just inflating the cuff now... and there we go. Okay, your blood pressure is 145 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It’s been a while since I’ve had to… concentrate on breathing. My chest feels a little tight, actually. Is that normal? My ex-wife always said I had a weak chest… but she also said a lot of things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. Yes, just breathe normally for me. I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, and your heart sounds a little… distant. It's not alarming, but it's something we'll want to investigate further. Your breathing is a little shallow, which could explain the tightness you're feeling. Now, let's just take a quick look at your joints. Can you bend your knees for me, if you’re able?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… not very comfortable. They’re a bit stiff, you see. Haven’t used them much lately. My ex-wife always said I had weak joints… but she also said a lot of things. Is that alright? Are they supposed to creak like that?
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. Yes, some creaking is normal, especially with age. I'm noticing some mild swelling and limited range of motion in both knees. It’s not severe, but it’s consistent with some mild osteoarthritis. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. A little bit. Not sharp, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s worse when it’s cold, actually. And after I’ve been standing for a long time. My ex-wife always said I should wear a brace… but she also said a lot of things. Is that bad, Doctor? Are my knees… broken?
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. No, your knees aren’t broken. The discomfort you’re feeling is consistent with mild osteoarthritis, which is a common condition as we age. It’s caused by wear and tear on the cartilage in your joints. It's not an emergency, but it's something we should address to manage your pain and improve your mobility. Now, let’s just check your reflexes. Can you sit comfortably?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Comfortable enough. Though my back is a little stiff… My ex-wife always said I had a bad posture… but she also said a lot of things. What are you going to do with the reflexes, Doctor? Are you going to hit my knees with something?
DOCTOR: No, Brando, no hitting! I’m just going to use a small rubber hammer to gently tap your tendons and check your reflexes. It’s a quick and painless test. And… there we go. A little bit diminished, but still present. Similar on this side. Again, a little diminished, but still present. This is also consistent with your age and some mild nerve compression. Alright, Brando, that completes the physical exam. Now, I’d like to order some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a better understanding of your overall health and the cause of the wheezing in your lungs. Do you have any allergies to contrast dyes or iodine?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t think so. I haven’t had any… fancy medical procedures. Just the tonsils, years ago. And… nothing else. I’m fairly certain I don’t have any allergies. My ex-wife would have told me, if I did. She knew everything. But… a chest X-ray? Is that… dangerous? Is something wrong with my chest? Is it the wheezing? I don’t like the sound of this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. No, a chest X-ray is very safe. It uses a very small amount of radiation, and the benefits of finding out what's causing the wheezing far outweigh the risks. It’s a standard procedure, and it won’t cause any discomfort. We just want to rule out anything serious, like pneumonia or fluid buildup in your lungs. It's understandable to be nervous, but we're just being thorough. We'll review the results together as soon as they're available. Now, do you have any insurance coverage for these tests?
PATIENT: Insurance… No, I don’t. Not anymore. It’s… complicated. After the divorce… things got a bit messy. I haven’t been able to afford it since. I’m afraid I’m not much of a financial burden, Doctor. But I appreciate you asking. I just… hope it’s not too expensive. I’m on a fixed income, you see. My ex-wife always said I was terrible with money… but she also said a lot of things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. That’s alright. We’ll discuss the costs with you upfront, and we can explore options for financial assistance or a payment plan if needed. We don’t want cost to be a barrier to your care. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I suspect you may have mild osteoarthritis in your knees and possibly some mild bronchitis causing the wheezing in your lungs. The blood work will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions, and the chest X-ray will give us a clearer picture of your lungs. Now, before you leave, I’m going to give you a prescription for a bronchodilator inhaler to help with the wheezing. It’s a simple medication that you’ll use a few times a day as needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… bronchodilator inhaler? Yes, alright. If you think it will help. I haven’t used an inhaler before. Is it… complicated? Do I need to do anything special? My ex-wife always said I had weak lungs… but she also said a lot of things. I just… hope it doesn’t make me feel strange. I get a bit anxious as it is. Is it safe?
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. It’s very simple. You just press down on the canister while taking a deep breath. It delivers medication directly to your lungs to help open up your airways. It’s very safe, and most people experience no side effects. Some people may feel a slight increase in heart rate or a little bit of nervousness, but that’s usually temporary. Here, let me show you. You hold it like this, shake it well, and then… press down while taking a deep breath. Why don’t you try it now?
PATIENT: Ooh… that didn’t feel very good. It made me cough even more. And… I feel a little bit dizzy. Is that normal? Perhaps I’m not doing it right. My ex-wife always said I had a sensitive chest… but she also said a lot of things. I think… I think I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. That’s alright. It’s common to cough when you first use an inhaler. It’s just your lungs adjusting to the medication. And a little bit of dizziness is also not uncommon. Let’s take it slow. It’s possible you’re not getting enough medication into your lungs. We need to make sure you’re using the correct technique. We can practice it again, or I can have the nurse demonstrate it for you. Before we do that, though, let's review the plan. We’ve ordered blood work and a chest X-ray. I'm giving you this inhaler to help with the wheezing. We'll review the results as soon as they’re available and discuss any further treatment options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… alright. That sounds… manageable. Blood work, chest X-ray, inhaler. It’s just… a lot to take in. And I’m a bit worried about the results, to be honest. My ex-wife always said I had a weak constitution… but she also said a lot of things. I suppose I should just try to relax and take it one step at a time. Is there anything else I need to know? Anything I should be doing or avoiding? I just… want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. You’re doing great. And you’re right to ask. For now, just try to get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, and avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any worsening symptoms – like severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever – please go to the emergency room immediately. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to review the results and discuss any further treatment options. The nurse will give you some instructions on how to schedule that appointment. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll take good care of you, Brando. It's going to be alright. Now, is there anything I can do for you before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m alright. Just… a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. And maybe a little bit anxious. But I appreciate your kindness, Doctor. And your patience. You’ve been very helpful. I suppose I should just try to get home and rest. And… try not to worry too much. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brando. Please, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. We'll be in touch soon. .
