DOCTOR: Good morning, Antoine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s rather… unpleasant, actually. It’s in my mouth. I don’t typically bother doctors with… these things, but my wife insisted. It’s a white coating, you see. Quite bothersome. I’d prefer to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like something's going on in your mouth that's causing a white coating, and it's uncomfortable. No need to apologize for coming in; that’s what I’m here for. We’ll try to figure out what’s going on as quickly as we can. To start, can you tell me a little more about this white coating?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… everywhere, frankly. On my tongue, inside my cheeks. It doesn’t hurt, precisely, but it's… there. Like a film. And it makes it difficult to taste anything properly. I’ve been rinsing with water, but it doesn’t seem to help. Honestly, I assumed it was just something I needed to ignore and it would go away on its own. Is it… contagious? My wife would be most upset if she caught something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s all over your tongue and the inside of your cheeks, doesn't cause pain but affects your taste, and water rinses don’t help. And you're understandably concerned about it being contagious. Let's address the contagious part first. It's unlikely to be contagious, but it's good you're thinking about that. Most causes of a white coating in the mouth aren’t easily spread. However, there are some that are, so we need to figure out what we're dealing with. Now, about how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Perhaps a week? Maybe a little longer. It started subtly, I barely noticed it at first. I eat regularly, you understand, good food, mostly. It just… gradually worsened. I suppose I should have come sooner, but I really don’t care for doctors, if I'm honest. Too much fuss over nothing, usually.
DOCTOR: A week or so, starting gradually… Okay. And you said you eat regularly, good food. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you been experiencing any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, not really. Appetite is… normal. I enjoy my meals. Swallowing is… fine. No issues there, thankfully. It's just the… unpleasantness of the coating, and the loss of taste. Makes a good steak rather pointless, doesn’t it? I’ve not been feeling ill otherwise, if that's relevant. No fever, no chills. Just… this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, no chills, normal appetite, and no difficulty swallowing - just the white coating and loss of taste. That's good information. Let’s do a quick exam of your mouth. I'll need to take a look at your tongue and the inside of your cheeks. Just open wide for me, please.
PATIENT: Very well. Get it over with quickly, please. Honestly, I don't enjoy having things poked at.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. I see the coating you’re talking about. It’s pretty widespread, as you described. I don't see anything alarming at first glance—no deep ulcers or anything like that—but it's definitely there. The redness is minimal. It looks most consistent with oral thrush, also known as oral candidiasis. It's a fungal infection, often caused by an overgrowth of Candida yeast. It’s more common in people with weakened immune systems, but can happen for other reasons too, like antibiotic use or sometimes just imbalances in the mouth. Have you recently taken any antibiotics?
PATIENT: Antibiotics? No, not recently. Years ago, perhaps, for a chest infection, but nothing in the last… oh, at least five years, I should think. My health is generally quite good, as I said. I eat well, exercise moderately. This is rather… unexpected. I assumed it was something I’d picked up from a restaurant, perhaps. Poor hygiene practices on their part. It's certainly not my fault.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent antibiotics. And you mentioned you eat well and exercise, which is excellent. It’s good to know you're generally healthy. So, it seems less likely to be related to medication. Since it’s not antibiotic-related and you haven’t been ill, we need to consider other possible causes, or rule out anything more serious. Although oral thrush is the most likely based on the appearance, we should confirm it. I’m going to take a quick swab of the coating to send to the lab for a test. It's a very simple procedure—just a gentle scrape. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Must you? Is it absolutely necessary? I truly dislike having things poked and prodded. Still, if you insist it's necessary, I suppose… get it over with quickly, please. And tell me, Doctor, what sort of treatment would be involved if it is this… thrush? Hopefully nothing too unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, all done. That was quick, right?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, thankfully brief. Now, the treatment? Do tell. I’ve commitments this afternoon, you see, and I’d like to have a clear understanding of what's involved before I leave. And will this be… expensive? I don't hold with unnecessary medical bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, treatment for oral thrush usually involves an antifungal medication. The most common is a mouthwash called nystatin. You swish it around in your mouth for a few minutes several times a day, then spit it out. It doesn't usually have many side effects - sometimes a slight metallic taste or upset stomach. It’s a relatively inexpensive medication, thankfully. In some cases, if the thrush is widespread or severe, we might need to prescribe an oral antifungal pill, like fluconazole, but based on what I'm seeing, the mouthwash should be sufficient. The lab results will confirm the diagnosis, and then we'll finalize the treatment plan. It’s typically a one-to-two-week course of treatment. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication in the past. Although my wife insists I’m allergic to dust, but that’s just her fussiness. So, a mouthwash… several times a day for a fortnight. It doesn’t sound terrible, I suppose. And it's inexpensive, you say? Very well. I suppose that's… acceptable. Are there any dietary restrictions I should be aware of? Perhaps avoiding sugary foods?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear you have no known allergies. And yes, avoiding sugary foods is a good idea while you’re being treated. The yeast thrives on sugar, so minimizing your intake can help the medication work more effectively. Also, avoid yeasty foods like bread and beer if possible, but that's less crucial. I’m going to write you a prescription for the nystatin mouthwash. It's usually taken four times a day after meals. I’ll also give you a handout with detailed instructions on how to use it properly. We’ll get the lab results back in a few days, and I'll give you a call to discuss them. If you don’t notice any improvement after a week of using the mouthwash, or if your symptoms worsen, please give the office a call right away. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers it. Mouthwash four times a day, avoid sugar, call if it worsens. Yes, I think I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have appointments to attend to. I trust the bill will be reasonable?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Antoine. I’ll make sure the billing department is aware of your concern about cost. As I mentioned, the nystatin is generally very affordable. Here you go. If you have any questions once you get home, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I hope you start feeling better soon. .
PATIENT: Very well. Good day to you too, Doctor. .
