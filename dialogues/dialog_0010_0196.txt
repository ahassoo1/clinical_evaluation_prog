DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Licano. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just…tired. Really tired. Been that way for…a while now, I guess. I don’t really keep track of things these days. It’s just…everything feels like a lot of effort.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Tired” can mean a lot of different things. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More…how? Like, I’m not sleepy, not exactly. It’s more like…drained. Everything takes so much energy. Even getting out of bed. And it doesn’t get better, even after I rest. Honestly, I just feel…blah. Is that helpful? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Licano. It sounds very frustrating. "Blah" is a perfectly good description, actually. It helps me understand. When did you first start noticing this feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's…a hard question. It feels like it crept up on me slowly. Maybe…six months ago? A year? It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. My husband, God rest his soul, he passed away a little over a year ago…and things haven’t really been the same since. I just thought it was…grief. But it hasn’t gotten any better.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Ms. Licano. Grief can certainly cause prolonged fatigue and a feeling of being drained. But it's important to rule out other possibilities as well. Besides the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes in how you've been feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It was…a shock. Other changes…hmm. I…I get headaches sometimes. Not terrible, just…there. And my memory is awful. Worse than it used to be, anyway. I forget things constantly. Like…what was I saying? Oh, right. Memory. And…I don’t really enjoy things anymore. Everything feels…flat.
DOCTOR: Okay. Headaches, memory issues, and a loss of enjoyment – those are all things we should explore further. Are the headaches constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go. Mostly in the afternoons, I think. Not like…splitting headaches, just a dull ache. Sometimes I take something for them, sometimes I just…ignore them. They don't really interfere with things…much. Everything interferes with things these days, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say your memory is worse, can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Ugh. Specific…let me think. Just yesterday, I went to the grocery store and completely forgot what I went for. I stood there for ten minutes, trying to remember, and just…blank. And I forget names a lot. People I’ve known for years. It’s embarrassing. And…I keep repeating myself, I think. Do I? Oh dear. I'm probably not making any sense.
DOCTOR: You're making perfect sense, Ms. Licano. It sounds like you’re experiencing some significant cognitive changes. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on a pill for it. I think it’s under control now. And…arthritis in my hands. It flares up sometimes. That’s about it, I think. Oh! And I had the flu last winter. A bad one. But I recovered.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications for your high blood pressure or arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes. For the blood pressure, I take…lisinopril, I think it’s called? A little white pill. And for the arthritis, sometimes I take ibuprofen when it’s really bad. But I try not to, because it upsets my stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve always been pretty lucky, I guess. Although…I can’t remember the last time I tried anything new.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… My mother had…diabetes, I think. And my father had heart trouble. He died when he was quite young. And…my sister had…something with her nerves, I think. But I don't really remember the details. It was a long time ago. We weren't very close.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I mostly stay at home. I used to enjoy gardening, but I don’t have the energy anymore. I watch a lot of television. I don’t really see many people. I eat…whatever’s easy. Frozen dinners, mostly. I don’t drink or smoke. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Licano. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment. It'll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds…fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Licano. Everything seems within normal limits, but as I mentioned, your blood pressure is a bit high, and your reflexes are a little slow, and there is slight coordination difficulty. These findings, combined with your fatigue, memory issues, and other symptoms, suggest we need to do some further investigation. I’d like to order some blood work to check for things like thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, and diabetes. I also recommend a brain scan - a CT scan or MRI - to rule out any structural issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds like…a lot. A brain scan? Is something seriously wrong? I… I don’t know. I just want to feel normal again. But…if you think it’s necessary, I guess so. Blood work is fine. But the scan…it sounds scary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Licano. It does sound like a lot, and I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn't think it was important. The scan isn’t necessarily an indication that something is seriously wrong, but it’s a valuable tool to help us understand what’s going on and rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. We need to investigate this thoroughly. It’s far better to know what we’re dealing with, so we can develop the best treatment plan for you. It’s a precautionary step. We can discuss the risks and benefits of the scan in more detail, and you can always decline if you’re not comfortable. But based on everything you’ve told me, I strongly recommend it. Let’s start with the blood work, and then we can schedule the scan for next week. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood work first, then…think about the scan. Yes. That sounds…better. Next week. Okay. I suppose I don’t have much of a choice, if you think it’s necessary. Will the blood work take long? I really do have that appointment later.
DOCTOR: The blood work will only take a few minutes, Ms. Licano. We'll draw a few vials and send them to the lab. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood now. In the meantime, I'll write you a prescription for the blood work and schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and the scan. I will also give you some information sheets about the blood work and the MRI so you can review it. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all. Just…please let me know if anything is seriously wrong. Don’t sugarcoat it. I’d rather know the truth, even if it’s bad.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano. I promise I will be honest with you, every step of the way. I will explain everything clearly and answer all of your questions. We will face this together. Let me call the nurse now to get the blood work started. It’s just routine, and we'll take it one step at a time. Just try to relax, okay?
PATIENT: Alright. I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor.
