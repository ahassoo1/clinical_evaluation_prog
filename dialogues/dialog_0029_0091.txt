DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, lately I does be feeling really thirsty, all the time. And hungry! Even after I eat a good plate of food, I still feel like I need more. It’s just… a lot, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling thirsty and hungry constantly, even after eating… that's definitely something we need to look into. How long have you been experiencing this increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It start maybe… two, three months now? Not suddenly, you know. It just get worse and worse. At first, I just thought it was the heat. But it still bad even when it not so hot outside.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three months, gradually worsening. And it hasn't improved with cooler weather. Have you noticed any other changes along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Other changes? Let me think… I does go to the bathroom more often, yes. To pee. And… sometimes I feel a little tired, but I does work hard, so I thought it was just that. Nothing too bad, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, increased urination and some fatigue along with the thirst and hunger. Do you happen to know approximately how much fluid you're drinking in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard question to answer, Doctor. I does drink when I feel thirsty, you know? A big glass of water with lunch, maybe two small bottles of soft drink during the day… and some juice with dinner. I not keeping track, sorry. It’s… a lot, I suppose. More than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, more than usual fluid intake. And are you experiencing any blurry vision, any unexplained weight loss, or any skin changes like itching or frequent infections?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not really. My eyesight not the best anyway, you know? I always need my glasses. Weight loss? No, I don’t think so. Maybe a little, but I not sure. And no, no itching or anything like that. I does get little skin rashes sometimes, but that’s just from the sun, I think. I work outside, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. No blurry vision, no significant weight loss, no frequent infections, and the skin rashes you attribute to sun exposure. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… My mother, she had high blood pressure, yes. But me? I never been to the doctor much, you know? I always feel alright. I does get a little achy sometimes, but that’s just from the work. I don’t think I have anything serious. No, I don’t have anything the doctor ever tell me about, if that makes sense. No diabetes or kidney problems or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medical conditions, but a family history of high blood pressure. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. And I never been in the hospital, thank goodness. Just the usual colds and flu, you know? Nothing serious enough to need a hospital. I always try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, Doctor. I don't take anything. Not even for headaches. I does just drink some bush tea if I feel bad, you know? My grandmother teach me lots of remedies. No pills or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't smoke. Never have. And I don't drink alcohol either. Not even a little rum punch. And no, I don't use any of those other things. I does work hard, you know? I need to be clear-headed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, just one last thing regarding your history. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I does get little itchy sometimes after I eat shellfish, yes. Not every time, but sometimes. And… I does get a rash if I touch certain plants, but that’s just poison ivy, you know? Nothing too serious. No allergies to any pills or anything like that, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright, a possible shellfish allergy and sensitivity to poison ivy. Okay, Ms. Zicarelli, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam. It will just take a few minutes. Then, I’d like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel better, you know? I ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let's take your blood pressure. …150 over 90. That's a little elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Sensation is intact. Okay, Ms. Zicarelli, everything seems within normal limits, aside from the elevated blood pressure. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a fasting glucose test. These tests will help us to rule out any underlying conditions that could be causing your symptoms. I'll also order a urinalysis to check for any signs of infection or kidney problems. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Lots of tests! Is my blood pressure bad, Doctor? Is that why it's high? And what is a comprehensive metabolic panel? I don't understand all these words, you know. I just want to know if I'm sick or not. And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Zicarelli. It is a lot of information. Your blood pressure is a little higher than we'd like, yes. It doesn't necessarily mean you're seriously ill, but it's something we need to monitor. It could be due to stress, diet, or other factors. The tests will help us determine the cause. A comprehensive metabolic panel is a blood test that gives us information about your kidney and liver function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar levels. It's a general check-up to see how your body is functioning. The results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back from the lab. Once we have them, we'll schedule another appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend that you try to reduce your salt intake, drink plenty of water, and get regular exercise. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Reduce salt? I does cook with salt, yes. It makes the food taste good! And exercise… well, I does work hard all day. Is that not enough exercise? And what kind of food should I eat? I don't want to change everything, you know? I like my food.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Zicarelli. It's not about changing everything overnight. We're just making small adjustments. Your work is physical activity, but it's a different type of exercise than what's best for your heart health. Things like walking, swimming, or even gardening can be very beneficial. As for your diet, try to focus on fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and fried foods. And yes, reducing the amount of salt you use in cooking is important. You can use other spices and herbs to add flavor instead. We can talk about specific meal ideas at your follow-up appointment if you'd like. For now, let's just focus on trying to drink more water and being mindful of your salt intake. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… manageable. More water, less salt. I can try. But I still don't understand why I'm so thirsty and hungry all the time. Is it because of my blood pressure? Or something else? I just want to know what's wrong with me, you know? And when will I get the results? Two, three days? That seems like a long time to wait.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Zicarelli. It is frustrating to wait for results. The thirst and hunger could be related to your blood pressure, but it's also important to rule out other possibilities, such as diabetes. That's why we're doing the blood tests. The lab usually takes 2-3 business days to process the results, but it can sometimes take a little longer depending on their workload. I'll call you as soon as they come back. If you don't hear from me within 5 business days, please don't hesitate to call the office to check on the status. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as blurred vision, frequent urination, or unexplained weight loss, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. I just hope everything is alright. I ready to go now, yes? I thank you for your time. And I will try to drink more water and use less salt.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Zicarelli. I understand your concern, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. I’ll have the lab order sent over electronically. And remember, if anything changes, don't hesitate to call. Here's a printed summary of our discussion and the lab tests we've ordered. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. You have a good day too.
