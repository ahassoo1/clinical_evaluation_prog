DOCTOR: Hello Sherrell, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, hello Doctor. It is… good to meet you as well. Well, it is… difficult to explain. The words… they do not come so easy now. It is frustrating, you understand? I find myself… searching. For the right thing to say. It has been happening for… some time now, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Sherrell. It’s alright to take your time. We all have trouble finding the right words sometimes. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with… expressing yourself, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… correct. Expressing myself. It is not just… forgetting a name, you see. It is… the feeling of the word is there, but the word itself… it escapes me. Like a… a slippery fish. And it is… worrying, of course. My wife… she always said I had a gift for words. Now… now it feels like it is fading.
DOCTOR: That sounds very concerning, Sherrell, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s good that you’re noticing this and that your wife has pointed it out as well. So, it’s not just occasional forgetfulness, but a feeling that the words themselves are…difficult to retrieve?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Difficult to retrieve… that is a good way to put it. It is… like reaching into a dark room, trying to find something you know is there, but you cannot quite grasp it. And it happens… with all sorts of words. Simple words, sometimes. Not just the complicated ones. It is… unsettling. I do not know if that makes sense? I worry I am not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Sherrell. You’re explaining it very well, don’t worry. It sounds frustrating and concerning, as you said. So, this difficulty with retrieving words… how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… a difficult question. It comes and goes, you see? I think… perhaps six months? Maybe longer. It started slowly, just a little hesitation here and there. Now… it is more frequent. It is hard to say exactly. My memory… is not what it used to be. My wife… she noticed it before I did, I think. She always had a very good memory.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or so, gradual onset. It’s helpful that your wife has noticed it too. And you said it’s affecting simple words as well?
PATIENT: Yes, simple words. Just yesterday, I was trying to tell my neighbor about… the flowers. The red ones in my garden. And I could see the flowers, I could feel the word… but I could not say “red”. It was… “crimson”, I think I said. Or maybe “scarlet”. Something like that. It felt… ridiculous. He looked at me very strangely. It is… embarrassing, you understand? A grown man… stumbling over such simple things.
DOCTOR: I completely understand how frustrating and embarrassing that must be, Sherrell. It's not easy when our words don't come as easily as they used to. So, to clarify, it’s not just finding the word, but sometimes using a similar, but incorrect word instead?
PATIENT: Yes! Incorrect… or… roundabout. I try to explain around the word. Describe it, maybe. Instead of just saying it. It takes… much longer to say anything. And sometimes… sometimes I just give up. I change the subject. It is… not a good feeling. I used to enjoy a good conversation. Now… I dread it, a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Sherrell. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your daily life and your enjoyment of things you used to enjoy. Now, aside from the difficulty with words, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me see. I have been… a little more tired lately, perhaps. Not terribly so, but… more easily fatigued. And sometimes… I feel a little… confused. Not all the time, just… fleeting moments. Like… losing my train of thought mid-sentence. Or forgetting why I walked into a room. Small things, really. But… they are happening more often. My wife… she used to help me with these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and some fleeting moments of confusion – forgetting why you entered a room, losing your train of thought. And your wife has noticed these things as well?
PATIENT: Yes, she did. She was… very observant. She always said I was too scattered, needed someone to keep me grounded. Now… Now it is just… me. And these little things… they worry me. I do not… I do not want to become a burden. Or… forget everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sherrell, and it's good that you're sharing them with me. It sounds like these changes are causing you a lot of anxiety, and that's completely understandable. Now, have you had any changes in your vision or hearing recently?
PATIENT: Vision… or hearing? Let me see… I do wear glasses, you know. For reading. They are… old, perhaps. I have not had them checked in… a long time. I suppose my vision is a little blurry sometimes. Especially at night. And my hearing… well, I am getting older. Everything sounds a little muffled, perhaps. But I have not noticed any sudden changes. Just… the usual signs of getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision, especially at night, and some expected hearing loss with age. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Let me see. I had… high blood pressure, a few years ago. The doctor put me on medication. I stopped taking it, a while back. I was feeling… better. Perhaps that was a mistake. And… I had a touch of arthritis in my hands, years ago. It flares up sometimes, especially in cold weather. Otherwise… I am generally quite healthy, I think. For my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure, and arthritis. And you stopped taking the medication for the high blood pressure. Do you remember what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… a difficult question. The name… it escapes me. A small white pill, I think. I took it every morning. My wife… she handled most of the medication. She kept track of everything. I just… took the pills. I am sorry, I wish I could remember the name. It is… frustrating. I feel like my memory is… slipping away.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Sherrell. Don't worry about it. Many people find it difficult to remember medication names. We can look it up in your records if you've had prescriptions filled here before. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Yes, I had my appendix removed when I was young. Many years ago. And… I had a knee replacement about ten years ago. It went well, but it still bothers me sometimes, especially in cold weather. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything else, I think. Just… the usual doctor’s visits.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a knee replacement. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I have never had a reaction to any medication, that I am aware of. I am not allergic to any foods, that I know of. I can eat… everything. Well, almost everything. My wife… she always said I was a very adventurous eater.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. No, not really. I take a little ibuprofen sometimes, for my arthritis. But that is all. And… a multivitamin, occasionally. But I have been forgetting to take it lately. My wife… she always made sure I took my vitamins.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally and a multivitamin. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had dementia, I think. Towards the end of her life. It was… very sad. And my father… he had heart problems. He died when he was quite young. Otherwise… I don’t really know. My family… we weren’t very close. We didn’t talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of dementia in your mother and heart problems in your father. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. I am retired now. I used to work in… compensation, I think. It was… a long time ago. Now I spend most of my time at home. I enjoy gardening, when the weather is good. And… reading. I used to read a lot. But lately… I have been finding it difficult to concentrate. I don't really exercise much. I prefer to take things easy. My wife… she always encouraged me to be more active.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, enjoy gardening and reading. Now, do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. But I have stopped lately. It didn't seem to… agree with me. Smoke… no, I never smoked. And… recreational drugs? No, never. My wife… she wouldn’t have approved.
DOCTOR: Okay, no alcohol, smoking, or recreational drugs. Now Sherrell, I’ve asked you a lot of questions, and I appreciate your patience. Given your symptoms – the difficulty with word retrieval, fatigue, moments of confusion, and family history – I think it’s important to do some further evaluation. Would you be willing to let me perform a brief physical exam and order some blood tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it will help… I am willing to do whatever is necessary. I just want to… understand what is happening. And… to get my life back, if possible. I do not want to… become a burden.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sherrell. We’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll start with a quick check of your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes, coordination, and memory. It won’t be uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… it won’t be painful, will it? I do not… enjoy pain.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t be painful at all, Sherrell. Just some simple checks. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90, but that could be due to anxiety. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination seems good. Your short-term memory seems a little… impaired. I asked you to repeat three words a few minutes ago, and you only remembered one. It’s a subtle difference, but something we need to investigate further. I am going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. I will also order a Vitamin B12 and Folate level. These tests will help us get a more complete picture of your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. So many tests. I just want to know… what is happening to me. And… if there is anything I can do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Sherrell. It’s a lot, but it’s better to be thorough. The tests will give us a clearer picture, and we can go from there. In the meantime, I want you to focus on getting enough rest, eating a healthy diet, and staying hydrated. I'm going to write down a few resources for you, including some support groups for people experiencing memory issues. And I will give you a list of potential causes for your symptoms, but please do not self-diagnose. We need to wait for the test results before we can draw any conclusions. Here's the lab order. They will call you to schedule an appointment. It’s best to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks… that sounds… alright. Fasting for 12 hours… I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. It is… comforting to know that you are taking this seriously. And… I appreciate the resources. I just hope… it is nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. It’s my job to take your concerns seriously. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll figure out what's going on. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms – such as difficulty speaking, weakness on one side of your body, or severe headache – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you again. For your kindness. And… for listening. I will… see you in two weeks.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I’ll see you in two weeks.
