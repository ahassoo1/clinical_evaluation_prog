DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s…it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It feels like there’s always some left in there. It’s been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Difficulty emptying your bladder completely, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Completely. I don’t… I don’t get it all out, every time. It's… uncomfortable, you know? And I have to go back more often because of it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can certainly understand how that would be uncomfortable. And frequent trips to the bathroom can be disruptive. Could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? It was gradual, not all at once. At first, it wasn’t so bad. I thought it was just getting older, you know? But it’s gotten worse lately. I didn’t think much of it at first, but now it bothers me quite a bit.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, a gradual onset… that’s helpful. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, sometimes I feel like I have to strain a little to start. Not always, but sometimes. And… sometimes a little dribbling after I think I’m done. Not a lot, just… a little. I don't know if that counts.
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely counts, Mr. Hilber. Straining and post-void dribbling are important things to mention. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. It doesn’t hurt at all. That's good, right? It’s just… frustrating. It feels like something is blocking it, but it doesn't hurt. Just… stuck.
DOCTOR: That's good that you're not experiencing any pain. It does sound frustrating. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with pills. I take those every day. And… I had a surgery on my knee a few years back. Other than that, not much. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're currently taking medication for high blood pressure and you had knee surgery previously. Do you remember when you had the knee surgery, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was about five years ago, maybe six. It was right after my wife… passed away. It was a difficult time, so I don’t remember dates very well then. It was in the winter, I think. A bad winter, lots of snow.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s perfectly alright. Approximately five or six years ago. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: No, just the pills for the blood pressure. And sometimes a little something for my arthritis when it flares up, but that’s just as needed. Not every day. Just when my knees or hands are really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had problems with their bladder or prostate?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had some trouble going to the bathroom when he got older. Not like me, exactly, but he had to go very often. He didn’t talk about it much. And… my brother, he had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, I think. But I don’t know the details. They didn't really share those things back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some bladder issues with your father and kidney problems with your brother. That’s helpful to know. And just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I live alone now, since my wife passed. I mostly stay home, read a lot. I like to watch the news. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. I used to go fishing a lot more, but it’s harder to get out now. I don't drink much alcohol, and I don’t smoke.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Hilber. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. We'll just check your abdomen and do a quick neurological check, and then I'll need to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. It's important to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh. Well… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? I mean, I’m not in any pain, like you said.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It’s not the most comfortable exam, but it’s a very important part of evaluating your symptoms. It allows me to feel the size and texture of your prostate gland, which can give us clues about what’s causing the difficulty with urination. It's a quick exam, and I will explain everything as I go and make sure you are as comfortable as possible. We can discuss alternatives if you are truly uncomfortable, but a rectal exam provides valuable information that other tests may not. Would you like me to explain the procedure in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Well… if it’s important, I guess. I don’t like the sound of it, but… you said it’s important. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then… yes, please explain it a little more. And… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I will be as gentle as possible. The exam involves inserting a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel the prostate. It should take only a minute or two. You will be lying on your side with your knees bent. We are primarily assessing the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate. It may cause a brief feeling of pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. I'll explain each step as I go. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that explains it. Just… be quick, please. And let me know when you’re starting. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hilber. I will certainly let you know exactly when we are starting and will be as quick as possible. I’ll give you a moment to get positioned on your side. Then, I’ll excuse myself to prepare and will return shortly. Please let me know if you change your mind or have any questions before I return.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
