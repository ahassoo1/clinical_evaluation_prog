DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, thank you, Doctor. It’s… paperwork, mostly. Something about time off? My wife, she handles most of these things, you see. I think it has to do with… well, I’m not quite sure what it has to do with, exactly. Something about needing forms signed? For… work. Or maybe it’s the church. Honestly, it all gets a bit mixed up these days. She said I needed to come see you about it, though. FMLA, maybe? Does that ring a bell?
DOCTOR: FMLA… yes, Family Medical Leave. Look, sir, with all due respect, it's a little hard for me to help when I don’t know why you need it. Is someone sick?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Right, right. Someone sick… That’s… a good question. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Let me think. My brother, I believe… he’s not been well. Something with his… lungs, I think? Though, maybe it was his heart. Or was it his wife? Oh dear, it’s so confusing. She mentioned something about needing to take some time off to help him and his family. That must be it. It’s something like that, anyway. I mostly just… do what I’m told these days, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, your brother is ill, and your wife believes you need FMLA to take time off to assist him. Do you need time off, sir, or is your wife needing it?
PATIENT: Oh! That’s… a very good question, Doctor. I think… she needs the time off. Yes, that’s it. She does most of the traveling, you see. And the… the looking after. I mostly just… support her. So, it’s her who needs the forms, I believe. I just came because she said I had to. A bit of a mess, isn't it? I feel bad, always forgetting things.
DOCTOR: Sir, with all due respect, I need to understand why your wife needs leave. Is your brother hospitalized?
PATIENT: Oh! Hospitalized… I… think so. Yes, I believe he is. She said something about… a lot of machines beeping. And… tubes. Yes, tubes were definitely involved. It was… a very upsetting phone call. I don’t remember the name of the hospital, though. Somewhere… far away? She handles all the arrangements, you see. I mostly just… listen and try to be supportive. It was… a bad cough, I think, that led to everything. Though, now that I say it, maybe it was pneumonia? Oh dear, I'm just making things worse, aren't I?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s try this another way. Do you know what is wrong with your brother?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. What’s wrong… She said something about… his lungs not working properly. And… a blockage? Or was it something with the… the air sacs? I really wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. She explained it all on the phone, but… it just didn’t stick. She uses such… technical words, you see. And I get so flustered when she’s upset. It was something… serious, though. That much I do know. She said it needed… immediate attention. That’s why she’s taking time off, to be with him and his family. I just… feel bad that I can’t remember the details. Is there a way she can just… explain it to you directly? Maybe that would be easier?
DOCTOR: Sir, I'm trying to help, but I need information. I can’t fill out paperwork based on “something about lungs” and “technical words.” Do you have any of his medical records?
PATIENT: Oh, medical records… Well, now, that’s a good idea! She did mention something about paperwork… a folder, I think? She keeps everything so organized. Let me see… I usually don't carry things, you see. She handles all that. I think… she might have left it in the car? Or maybe it’s on the kitchen table? Oh dear. This is just awful, isn't it? I'm so sorry, Doctor. I really am. I wish I could be more useful. Perhaps… if you called my wife? Her name is Leilani. She'll have everything you need, I'm sure. She’s very good with these things.
DOCTOR: Sir, I appreciate you coming in, but I can’t proceed without some information about your brother’s condition. I'm not comfortable signing paperwork without knowing what we’re signing for. It’s a legal and ethical obligation. I suggest you have your wife contact me with the details, or bring the medical records to the next appointment. Until then, I can't assist you with the FMLA request. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I see. Yes, of course. That makes perfect sense. I just… I wanted to help. But I seem to be more trouble than I’m worth. No, Doctor, I don’t think there’s anything else. Just… thank you for trying. And… please, tell my wife, Leilani, to call you. She’ll have everything you need. I… I’ll just… go.
