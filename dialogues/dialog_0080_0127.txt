DOCTOR: Hi Gedalya, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Rosanova. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they seem to be dropping. It’s been happening gradually, over the last few months, but it’s starting to bother me, and frankly, it’s a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually weakening and drooping eyelids over the last few months… that is good to get checked out. Just to be clear, when you say “weaker,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's… not like I can’t do things, if that makes sense. But everything takes more effort. Like, climbing stairs—I used to do that without thinking, now I find myself pausing halfway up. And I get tired much easier. Even holding things for a long time, like… reading a book, can be exhausting. It’s not a sudden collapse, just… everything feels heavier, and requires more… focus, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, so more effort for everyday tasks, fatigue with prolonged activity, and a general feeling of heaviness. And this has been building up over months. Do you notice it’s worse at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I think it is worse in the evening. By the end of the day, it’s noticeably harder to keep my eyes open, and the weakness feels more pronounced. In the morning, it's better, but it definitely declines as the day goes on. I hadn't really connected that before, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not that I can immediately recall, no. No fever, no dizziness… My appetite is normal, I believe. I haven't lost or gained any weight, at least not intentionally. Oh! Actually… I have noticed my speech feels a little… slurred sometimes. But only when I'm really tired, or if I’ve been talking for a long time. It’s hard to explain—it’s not constant.
DOCTOR: Slurred speech occasionally when fatigued is definitely something we need to explore. Now, let's get a bit more background. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses—chickenpox, measles—but nothing major. No chronic conditions, no surgeries… I don’t take any regular medications, either. I've had a few minor injuries over the years—a sprained ankle, that sort of thing—but nothing that required ongoing treatment. Oh, I was divorced about a year ago. If that's relevant?
DOCTOR: It's good to know you've been generally healthy. And thank you for mentioning the divorce—stressful life events can absolutely impact health. No need to go into detail, but I appreciate you being open. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions, especially anything that affects muscles or nerves?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I wasn’t particularly close to my father. I don’t recall him ever having any serious illnesses, but I wouldn't know for sure. He was… not one for sharing. As for other relatives—grandparents, aunts, uncles—I didn’t know them very well. We weren't a close family. I'm afraid I don't have much information to offer on that front, Doctor. It’s a bit of a gap in my knowledge, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't have that information. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods without issue, and I haven’t ever had a problem with insect bites or pollen, or anything like that. I’m quite lucky in that regard, I think. No allergies to speak of, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, just one last question about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol—maybe a glass of wine at Christmas. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I lead a fairly quiet life, to be honest. Mostly work and… trying to relax when I can. I believe that covers it, Doctor. I'm ready whenever you are for the examination.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Thank you for being so thorough. Let’s do a quick exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gedalya. I’m noting some mild ptosis—that’s the drooping of your eyelids—on both sides, but it’s more pronounced on your left side. Your strength is 5/5 in all extremities, but I notice some slight fatigue with prolonged grip. Your reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. Your cranial nerves seem intact, but I’m going to repeat the facial nerve assessment a few times. And I noticed a very slight tremor in your hands when you held your arms outstretched. It’s subtle, but worth noting. Does anything feel different while I’m doing this?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not particularly. It’s all fairly standard, I suppose. The only thing I notice is… a bit of discomfort when you press around my eyes. It’s not painful, exactly, just… tender. And when I held my arms outstretched, I did feel a bit of a wobble, but I put that down to being tired. It’s difficult to say, really. I’m not used to these kinds of examinations.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness around the eyes and a wobble with outstretched arms are helpful observations. Thank you. Based on what you've told me, and what I’ve found in the exam, your symptoms—the weakness, the eyelid drooping, the occasional slurred speech, the tremor—are raising a few possibilities. It’s still early to say definitively, but we need to rule out some neurological conditions. Given your age and symptoms, Myasthenia Gravis is one possibility, and we should also investigate other causes of neuromuscular weakness. To start, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will check for antibodies associated with Myasthenia Gravis, and also rule out other potential causes. We should also perform an Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Study to assess the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That… sounds quite serious, Doctor. Myasthenia Gravis? I’ve never heard of it. Blood tests and… an EMG? What does that involve? I have to admit, I'm a little worried now. I was hoping it would be something simpler. If you think it’s necessary, I suppose I’m willing to do whatever it takes to find out what’s going on, but could you explain a bit more about these tests? What will they tell us?
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Gedalya, and it’s good you’re asking questions. Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune condition that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles, causing weakness and fatigue. It is treatable, though, and many people live full and active lives with it. We’re just gathering information at this point. As for the tests: the blood tests are relatively straightforward—a simple sample taken from your arm. The EMG involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It can be a little uncomfortable, but shouldn’t be overly painful. It helps us see how well your muscles are responding to nerve signals. The Nerve Conduction Study uses small electrodes on your skin to measure how quickly nerve signals are traveling. Both tests will help us determine if your muscles are responding normally to nerve signals, and if there are any signs of an autoimmune process. It’s a good first step to understand what’s going on. Would you like me to go over the potential risks of each test in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. Potential risks… that sounds important. I’m… not particularly good with needles, if I'm honest. And I’m always a bit anxious about anything involving electricity, even something small. It’s probably irrational, but… Could you tell me what the worst-case scenarios are for each test? And roughly how long they each take?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's talk about the risks. For the blood tests, the most common risk is minor bruising or discomfort at the injection site. It’s extremely rare to have any serious complications. The test itself takes only a few minutes. The EMG and Nerve Conduction Study have slightly more potential risks, though they’re still relatively low. With the EMG, there's a small risk of bleeding, infection, or muscle soreness at the insertion site. You might experience some temporary discomfort or twitching during the test. There’s a very small risk of nerve damage, but it's extremely rare. The Nerve Conduction Study might cause some mild tingling or discomfort during the stimulation, but it’s not painful. It doesn’t involve any needles. The entire EMG and Nerve Conduction Study usually takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on the number of muscles and nerves we need to assess. We’ll do our best to make you comfortable throughout the process, and you can stop at any time if you’re feeling too uncomfortable. Before we proceed, I want to be sure you’re aware of all the information, and you feel comfortable with these tests. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… less terrifying than I initially thought, I suppose. The possibility of nerve damage is still worrying, but you say it’s very rare. And the fact that I can stop at any time is reassuring. Before we book the tests… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Should I be resting more? Avoiding certain foods? Is there anything that might exacerbate the symptoms? And… what if it is Myasthenia Gravis? What's the typical course of treatment? I'm just trying to prepare myself, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible question, Gedalya. While we await the test results, there are a few things you can do. Resting when you feel fatigued is definitely helpful. Avoiding strenuous activity is also a good idea. There are no specific foods you need to avoid. As for exacerbating factors, certain medications can worsen symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis, but we won't worry about that until we have a diagnosis. If it is Myasthenia Gravis, treatment typically involves medication to improve nerve-muscle communication. The most common medications are cholinesterase inhibitors and immunosuppressants. In some cases, we may also consider thymectomy – surgical removal of the thymus gland. The goal of treatment is to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. It’s a manageable condition, and many people live full and active lives with it. I understand you’re anxious, and that’s perfectly normal. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Would you like me to schedule the blood tests and EMG/Nerve Conduction Study for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Let’s get it over with. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better. Just… please let me know when and where, and I’ll be there. And thank you, Doctor Rosanova. I appreciate your patience and… reassurance. It helps more than you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gedalya. I’ve scheduled the blood tests for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM at the lab just down the street, 14 Oak Street. You don’t need an appointment, just check in at the front desk. And I’ve scheduled the EMG and Nerve Conduction Study for Friday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Neurology department, located in the main hospital building, room 312. You will need to check in at the Neurology reception desk. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they are available, and I’ll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. 8:00 AM tomorrow, and 2:00 PM Friday. I’ve made a note of it. Thank you again, Doctor Rosanova. I appreciate your help. I'll see you then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Gedalya. You’re very welcome. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. I'll see you Friday. Take care.
