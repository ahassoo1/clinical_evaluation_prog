DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you. I’m here because, well, I’ve heard things. About this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it for my arthritis. Says it’ll do wonders. Frankly, I think it’s a bit… much. But I suppose I should look into it, just to humor her. So, here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're being open to learning more, and it’s very thoughtful of you to consider what your daughter suggests. Medical marijuana is becoming a more common topic, and it's helpful to have all the information before making a decision. To start, can you tell me a bit more about your arthritis?
PATIENT: Well, it’s in my hands, mostly. And my knees. It flares up, you know? Especially when the weather changes. Dampness is the worst. Makes everything ache something awful. It’s been going on for years. Decades, really. I've tried creams, you know, the ones you rub on. And pills, of course. They help, a little. But they make me drowsy. Terribly drowsy. That’s why I'm even considering… this. It's just… I’ve always been a very… sensible woman. And this all feels a bit… unconventional.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation. It is a change from traditional treatments. And it’s good you’ve already tried some other options. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for quite some time. When you say the pills help “a little,” can you describe what “a little” means?
PATIENT: Well… they take the edge off, I suppose. The throbbing isn’t quite as bad. I can still garden, but not for as long. And I have to stop and rest frequently. Before the pills, I wouldn’t even attempt to dig in the dirt on a humid day. Now, I can manage maybe an hour. An hour and a half, if I’m lucky. But then I’m just… wiped out. Need a good long nap. And even then, my hands still feel stiff and swollen. It's not a cure, you understand. Just… a small improvement. A compromise, really.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful to know. It sounds like you've found some relief with medication, but there's definitely room for improvement, and the side effects are bothersome. Let's talk a bit more about the arthritis itself. Is it just in your hands and knees, or do you experience pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, just the hands and knees, thankfully. Though sometimes my elbows get a bit achy, but that’s infrequent. Not worth mentioning, really. It’s the hands and knees that bother me the most. Makes it hard to do… well, everything, really. Cooking, cleaning, even getting dressed. I used to be such a… capable woman. Now, I have to ask my husband for help with the simplest things. It’s… humiliating. He’s very understanding, mind you. But still. It’s not how I envisioned my retirement, certainly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your quality of life, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling frustrated. It's difficult to lose independence, and it’s good you have a supportive husband. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been remarkably healthy, all things considered. A bit of arthritis, of course. And the occasional cold. But nothing serious. My blood pressure is usually quite good, and I’ve never been told I have diabetes. My husband keeps a close eye on my diet, you see. He’s a retired chef, so he’s rather particular about what I eat. Lots of fruits and vegetables. Very little sugar. He’s a good man. Really, I’ve always taken good care of myself. This arthritis is just… an unfortunate development.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. It sounds like you’ve lived a very healthy life, and that’s a great foundation. Knowing you haven't had any other major medical conditions is very helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been… averse to them. Too risky, I think. And frankly, I don’t trust doctors as much as I used to. They’re always rushing around, and they don’t take the time to explain things properly. It’s all… very impersonal. My mother always said, “Best to leave well enough alone.” And I’ve always tried to follow her advice. She was a very sensible woman, my mother. Knew a thing or two about life.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. It’s perfectly reasonable to be cautious about surgery, and it’s good you’ve always prioritized your health. I can assure you I’ll take my time and explain everything thoroughly. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has arthritis, or any other autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Well… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had something in her hands. Very similar to what I have, now that I think about it. She couldn’t knit anymore, poor woman. And my aunt, she had lupus, I believe. A terrible illness. But other than that… not really. My father’s side of the family was… robust. Strong, healthy people. Farmers, mostly. They worked hard, but they didn’t seem to get sick much. It’s hard to say, really. We weren’t a very close family. Didn’t keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. A family history of arthritis, even on one side, is relevant. And knowing about your aunt's lupus is good information as well, even though it’s not the same condition. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I only have a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. My husband insists it's good for the heart. A very small glass, mind you. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I was raised with certain… standards. Very respectable standards. I wouldn’t dream of it. It’s just… not done. Really, I lead a very… quiet life. A very proper life.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It sounds like you maintain a very healthy lifestyle. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My husband always checks before giving me any new medication, of course. He’s very cautious. And I always read the labels carefully. We’re both very… diligent, you see. Really, I don’t have any… sensitivities. I eat everything, within reason. Though I do find cilantro tastes like soap. But that’s just a matter of preference, not an allergy. It’s a dreadful herb, frankly. But no, no allergies. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ellan. That was very thorough. So, to summarize, you’re a 74-year-old Dominican woman with a history of arthritis in your hands and knees that’s been present for decades. You've tried creams and pills with limited relief and bothersome side effects. You have no other medical conditions, no surgeries, a family history of arthritis, and no allergies. You lead a very healthy lifestyle. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on with your hands and knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Though I doubt it will reveal anything I don’t already know. They ache, Doctor. They ache terribly. But if you feel it’s necessary, by all means, proceed. I’ve always been a patient woman. Just… please be gentle. They're quite sensitive, you see. And I do dislike being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’ll start with your hands. Please relax your hands flat on the table, palms up. Okay, I see some mild swelling in your knuckles and wrists. There's also some tenderness when I press here and here. And your range of motion is a bit limited, particularly in your fingers. It doesn't appear to be any redness or warmth. Now, your knees. There's some crepitus—a grinding sensation—when I bend them, which is common with arthritis. And there's some tenderness along the joint line. Again, no significant redness or warmth. Your range of motion is also a bit limited. These findings are consistent with osteoarthritis, which is the most common type of arthritis. It involves the breakdown of cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. It is quite common, particularly as we age. What I’m seeing seems to be mostly mild to moderate severity. Now, let’s discuss some treatment options. Do you have any preferences as to how you’d like to proceed?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… what I expected, I suppose. It’s just… disheartening to hear it confirmed. As for treatment… I’m not keen on more pills, if I’m honest. They make me feel… sluggish. And I certainly don’t want any injections. I've heard terrible things about them. My daughter suggested… well, she suggested this medical marijuana. She says it can help with the pain and inflammation without the side effects. I confess, I’m still skeptical. But I suppose I’m willing to consider it, if there are no other options. What exactly does it involve? And is it… legal? I wouldn’t want to get into any trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. It’s good you’re thinking critically about the options. And you’re right to ask about legality. Medical marijuana laws vary by state, and it's important to be informed. Here in [Clinic Location], medical marijuana is legal for certain qualifying conditions, and osteoarthritis is one of them. Now, regarding how it works, marijuana contains compounds called cannabinoids, like THC and CBD. THC is the psychoactive component, meaning it can cause a “high,” but CBD does not. For arthritis, we typically recommend products with a higher CBD content and a low THC content to minimize any psychoactive effects. It can be administered in several ways—oil tinctures, capsules, edibles, or topical creams. It works by interacting with the body’s endocannabinoid system, which plays a role in pain regulation, inflammation, and mood. It can be effective for some people in managing arthritis pain and improving quality of life. However, it’s not a cure, and it doesn't work for everyone. There are also potential side effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, and changes in appetite. It can also interact with other medications you're taking, so it’s important to be cautious and discuss it with your doctor. Now, before we proceed with medical marijuana, I'd like to discuss some other options as well. Physical therapy can be very helpful in strengthening the muscles around your joints and improving range of motion. We can also consider over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, although these don’t address the underlying inflammation. We can also discuss topical creams like diclofenac. Would you like to discuss these options in more detail, or are you leaning towards trying medical marijuana?
PATIENT: Well… physical therapy sounds… exhausting. And I’ve always been rather averse to pain medication, as I’ve mentioned. The idea of a cream… that doesn’t sound too dreadful, actually. But I confess, I’m still intrigued by this medical marijuana. If it can alleviate the pain without making me feel… out of sorts, it might be worth a try. But I have to admit, I’m nervous. I’ve never… experimented with anything like that before. What would it feel like? And how do I even obtain it? And what if it… doesn't work? I don’t want to waste my time and money on something that’s not going to help. And, frankly, I’m a bit worried about what my husband would think. He’s a very… traditional man.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ellan. It’s perfectly normal to be nervous about trying something new, especially when it comes to medical marijuana. Let’s address your concerns one by one. Regarding how it feels, with a low-THC product, the effects are typically very mild. You might feel a sense of relaxation or calmness, but you shouldn’t experience any significant psychoactive effects—no euphoria, paranoia, or altered perception. Some people do experience mild drowsiness or dry mouth, but these side effects are usually manageable. As for obtaining it, you would need to obtain a medical marijuana card from a certified physician—which I can help you with. Once you have the card, you can purchase medical marijuana from a licensed dispensary. Regarding it not working, there's no guarantee it will alleviate your pain, but we can start with a low dose and gradually increase it until you find the optimal dosage. If it doesn't work after a reasonable trial period, we can explore other options. And finally, regarding your husband, I understand your concerns. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with him about your decision. I can provide you with information about medical marijuana to help him understand it better. Now, if you're comfortable, we can proceed with the application for a medical marijuana card. It involves a medical evaluation and some paperwork, but I can assist you with the process. Would you like to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, I suppose… yes, let’s proceed. It’s just… a lot to take in. But if you believe it might help, and you’re willing to guide me through the process, I’m willing to give it a try. Just… please be patient with me. I’m not very tech-savvy, and I’m still rather skeptical about the whole thing. But I suppose I owe it to myself to explore all my options. And, frankly, the pain is becoming unbearable. So, let’s get started. What paperwork do I need to fill out? And where do I even begin?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear you're willing to try it. And don't worry, I'll be with you every step of the way. We’ll take it slow, and I'll explain everything as we go. First, let me give you this application form. It asks for your basic information, medical history, and a list of any medications you're currently taking. Just fill it out to the best of your ability. If you're unsure about anything, just ask me. Once you've completed the form, we'll review it together and I’ll complete a medical evaluation. Then, I'll submit the application to the state registry. It usually takes a few weeks to receive your medical marijuana card in the mail. In the meantime, I can provide you with some information about licensed dispensaries in the area and the different types of medical marijuana products available. We can also discuss the potential risks and benefits in more detail. Don’t hesitate to ask me any questions you have along the way. We’re in this together. Take your time with the form. No need to rush. And please, let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. Take your time. I'll be right here if you need anything. .
