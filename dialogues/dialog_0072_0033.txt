DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're with Burdette Clinic today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Yes, well, frankly, I haven’t the time for this. It’s… my vision. And my hearing, I suppose. They’ve both been… rather troublesome lately. It just came on so suddenly, it’s quite unsettling. I’m a very busy woman, you see. A surgeon. Was a surgeon, perhaps. It’s all a bit… blurred.
DOCTOR: A surgeon, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Pediatric. Was. It’s…difficult to explain. And truthfully, I’d rather not delve into it. Is this going to be a long process? Because I have appointments. Important ones.
DOCTOR: We’ll try to be efficient, Ms. Julie. However, a proper assessment requires some detail. “Sudden” is relative. Can you quantify when you first noticed changes in your vision and hearing?
PATIENT: Quantify? Really? It was… a few days ago, I suppose. Perhaps a week? Honestly, doctor, I don't keep a meticulous log of my declining senses. It simply is. Everything seems muffled, and…dim. Like looking through a dirty window. Is that helpful? I do expect a swift resolution to this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Muffled hearing and dim vision, onset within the last week. Do you experience this in both ears, or is it one-sided?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven't been testing which ear it is! It’s… both, I presume. If one ear was perfectly fine, I hardly think I'd be here, now would I? It’s a general… unpleasantness. Really, doctor, are we going to get anywhere with this endless questioning, or shall I simply go and seek a second opinion? I have a reputation to uphold, you understand.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand you're busy. However, I need to gather enough information to determine the cause of these symptoms. A general unpleasantness could stem from many things, and without knowing more, I can’t provide appropriate care. Has there been any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Oh, goodness, probably. I live in the city, you know. There’s always some sort of noise. I hardly catalogue every sound. Honestly, it all feels rather… futile. Is this necessary? Perhaps a simple scan, or something? Anything to expedite this process. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: A scan may be necessary, but first, I need to perform a basic neurological exam. It will help me determine if there's an underlying issue. It involves a few simple tests - checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A neurological exam? Good heavens. Are you suggesting…something is wrong with my brain? I assure you, doctor, my intellect is perfectly sound. However, if it will conclude this…ordeal, then very well. But please, be quick about it. I haven't time for lengthy procedures.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard precaution, Ms. Julie. Just to rule out any potential causes. Alright, if you could sit up straight for me. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Can you relax your arms at your sides?
PATIENT: Relax? Honestly, doctor. I’m a surgeon, not a…a rag doll. But very well. Proceed. And please, don't prod.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the other side. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, can you close your eyes, and I'll test your coordination?
PATIENT: Very well. But do be gentle. I have important hands, you understand. And please, hurry. I’m quite uncomfortable with my eyes closed. It’s… disconcerting. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Follow my finger with your eyes closed. Now touch your nose. Good. And now my finger. Coordination appears slightly off. Slight dysmetria observed. Now, I’d like to test your balance. Can you stand and walk a straight line for me?
PATIENT: Walk a straight line? Honestly, doctor, are you quite sure this is necessary? I'm a woman of a certain age! But very well. Do be quick about it. This is rather undignified. Honestly, the things one endures for… for what, exactly? There. Finished. Now, what does all this…prodding and walking mean? I expect a concise explanation.
DOCTOR: Your gait is slightly unsteady, and I observed some mild dysmetria, as I mentioned. Combined with your diminished reflexes and slight coordination difficulties, these findings suggest a possible neurological issue. It's too early to say definitively, but we need to investigate further. I’d like to order an MRI of the brain. This will help us determine if there’s a structural problem causing your symptoms.
PATIENT: An MRI? Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. I have a perfectly good brain, thank you very much. This is preposterous! Are you implying I'm…losing my faculties? I assure you, doctor, my mind is as sharp as ever. I will not be subjected to such a…invasive procedure. I think I shall seek a second opinion. A competent second opinion. This has been a complete waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, please. An MRI isn't about questioning your intellect; it's a diagnostic tool. It’s a non-invasive imaging scan. We’re simply trying to identify the cause of your symptoms. However, I respect your decision. Given your reluctance to proceed with further testing, I can offer a referral to an otolaryngologist to evaluate your hearing and a general ophthalmologist for your vision. Would that be acceptable?
