DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I’m Londell, please. And I reckon I'm here for a men's health check-up, you could say. Just want to make sure everything’s still tickin’ along alright, you know? I turned 69 this year and figured it was time to get things looked at properly. Not feelin' bad or nothin', just preventative, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Alright, Londell. Preventative is excellent. Sixty-nine is a good time for a check-up. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a little more about what specifically you'd like me to check?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I suppose energy levels, for one. Not that I'm tired, exactly, but I don't bounce around like I used to. And… well, everything else that comes with gettin’ older, I guess. You know, makin’ sure things are workin’ as they should. My memory’s still pretty good, thankfully – I can remember things from when I was a boy – but I want to make sure that stays that way, too. Is that too vague? I ain't a doctor, so I don’t know where to start.
DOCTOR: No, not too vague at all, Londell. That’s perfectly reasonable. Energy levels, cognitive function… those are good things to address. We’ll cover a lot of ground today. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… No diabetes, thankfully. My father had that, so I've always been careful with sweets. High blood pressure… the doctor told me a few years back it was a little high, but I changed my diet and started walkin’ more. Seems to have come down, but I don't remember taking any medicine for it long-term. Heart problems… nope, never been diagnosed with anythin’ like that. I've always been pretty active, workin' with my hands, etching and engravin'. Keeps me movin’, you know? I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was decades ago. I healed up just fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. That's helpful. Pneumonia is… a long time ago is good. And you managed to control your blood pressure with lifestyle changes, excellent. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a young man, maybe 18 or so. That was… oh, goodness, sixty years ago now! And… I had a hernia operation a few years back, maybe ten years ago. It was botherin’ me for a while, so I had it fixed. Other than that, nothin’ major. I’ve always been lucky, I reckon. Mostly just bumps and bruises from workin' with tools.
DOCTOR: Appendix and hernia… okay. That’s all we need for surgeries for now. Now, let's talk about family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 92, and she was pretty healthy right up to the end. She had a little arthritis in her hands, but that’s about it. My father, like I said, had diabetes, and he died fairly young from complications. My brother… he had heart problems, had a bypass surgery about fifteen years ago. He’s doin’ alright now, but it worried me a bit, you know? And… my grandmother on my mother’s side, she had cancer, but I don’t remember what kind, exactly. That was a long time ago, and folks didn’t talk about things like that much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your father, heart disease in your brother, cancer in your grandmother… That’s helpful information. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean exactly? I ain’t one for gossip, if that’s what you’re askin’.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all! I mean, do you smoke or use tobacco?
PATIENT: Oh! No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife, bless her soul, she tried it once or twice when she was younger, but she didn’t care for it. And I’ve always stayed away from it. Never seemed worth the risk, and I’ve always been around wood fires enough, so I got my share of smoke.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I used to have a beer with supper sometimes, and maybe a glass of wine on special occasions. But I haven't really been drinkin' much lately. Not that I don't drink, just haven't had the urge, you know? Mostly, I drink water. Keeps me healthy, I figure.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I got stung by a bee once when I was a kid, but that’s about it. No allergies to any medicines that I know of. My wife used to be allergic to penicillin, but that’s her problem, not mine. I've never had any trouble with anythin' I've eaten, either. I eat just about anything, long as it's cooked properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. That’s a good start, Londell. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Sounds just fine. Go right ahead. I ain't afraid of a little listenin' and lookin'. Hopefully, everything’s tickin' along like it should.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Ears are normal, some cerumen present. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Overall, everything sounds relatively normal, but that blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Alright, that's good to know. A little high blood pressure, huh? Like I said, I changed my diet a while back, but maybe I need to be stricter with myself. What do you think, Doc? Should I cut back on salt? I love my garden, and I use a fair bit of it in my cookin'. And I reckon I could stand to walk a little more, too.
DOCTOR: Cutting back on salt and increasing walking would be a good starting point, yes. We can also discuss some medication options if lifestyle changes aren’t enough. But let’s hold off on that for now. I want to run some blood work to get a better baseline of your overall health. That’ll give us a clearer picture of cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds sensible. Blood work's never hurt nobody. Give me a better idea of what's goin' on inside, I reckon. I’m happy to get whatever tests you think are needed. Just tell me what I need to do. I can usually get to the lab down the street alright.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. I’ll also include a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test since you're 69. It’s a standard screening for prostate health. Here's the requisition form. You can take this to the lab at any time. They’ll need a fasting sample, so don’t eat or drink anything after midnight tonight. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, sir, that sounds clear enough. No eatin' after midnight. I can handle that. I usually have a light supper anyways, so it shouldn't be too much of a hardship. Just makin’ sure I understand… all these tests are to get a general idea of how things are workin’ inside?
DOCTOR: Exactly. They'll give us a baseline, help us look for any potential issues, and guide our next steps. Once we have the results back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, focus on those lifestyle changes - reducing salt intake and increasing your activity level. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, sir, I reckon that about covers it. You've been mighty helpful, Doc. Thank you for takin' the time to listen to an old man and check me over. I appreciate it. I’ll get that blood work done first thing tomorrow mornin’.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Londell. It’s my pleasure. Remember, preventative care is key. If anything changes or you develop any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a brochure on healthy eating and exercise. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you again, Doctor. I will. You have a good day, too.
