DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I came in to ask about getting tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been… thinking about, and I’d like to get it done if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: HIV testing. Right. And what has prompted this request, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it's not… a specific incident, if that makes sense. Just… peace of mind, really. My husband and I, we haven’t been… as careful as we should have been over the years, and I’d just like to know, you see? Better safe than sorry, I always say. It’s been a long time, but… it’s weighing on my mind.
DOCTOR: “Peace of mind.” A rather vague justification, wouldn't you agree?
PATIENT: Perhaps it is, Doctor. I apologize if it isn’t… precise enough. It’s simply… a worry that’s been with me for a while. I don't have any symptoms, and haven't felt unwell, but with everything going on, I thought it best to be proactive. Is that… acceptable?
DOCTOR: Acceptable is not the operative word, Ms. Shaub. Prudent, perhaps. Very well. Before we proceed with unnecessary testing – and let us be clear, it is unnecessary without a specific risk factor – let me establish a baseline. Have you ever had a sexually transmitted infection diagnosed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. Not in my life. I’ve always been… careful, as I said. But… life happens, doesn’t it? And years go by, and sometimes… one isn’t as diligent as one should be. I suppose that’s what brought me here. It’s just… better to know, wouldn’t you say?
DOCTOR: A commendable sentiment, if somewhat belated. Now, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My husband and I… we are. We’ve been married for forty years, you see. It’s… a regular part of our life, if you understand me. Though, as I mentioned, we haven’t always been as… cautious as we should have been. It’s difficult to explain. Forty years is a long time. Habits… they form.
DOCTOR: Forty years of… potential exposure. Remarkable. And has your husband ever been tested for HIV or any other sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: That… that’s a difficult question, Doctor. We haven’t… discussed it, not explicitly. It’s not something we’ve openly talked about, to be honest. We’ve always trusted each other. But… I suppose I should have asked him, shouldn’t I? This is all rather… embarrassing, isn't it? I feel like I'm admitting a great failing.
DOCTOR: A failing of communication, certainly. And a potentially significant one, Ms. Shaub. Before we proceed further, I must ask: Do you engage in any intravenous drug use?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, are you questioning my character? I have never, and would never, engage in such behavior. I am a churchgoing woman, a wife of forty years, and I find that question rather… offensive. I came here for peace of mind, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Offensive is a strong word, Ms. Shaub. Thoroughness is merely a component of good medical practice. Nevertheless, let us move on. Have you ever received a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, Doctor, I have. A long time ago, after a rather difficult childbirth with my daughter, nearly forty years ago. It was… necessary, I believe. A lot of blood loss, the doctors said. But it was so long ago… Is that relevant? It feels as though you are searching for any reason not to test me.
DOCTOR: Everything is relevant, Ms. Shaub. Now, let’s proceed with a physical examination. I need to assess your overall health. Please lie down on the examination table. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though, I must confess, I’m starting to feel rather… anxious. I simply wanted a test for peace of mind, but this is… becoming quite stressful. Is this a standard procedure?
DOCTOR: Standard is a relative term, Ms. Shaub. Now, please remove your clothing from the waist up and put on a gown. I will begin with auscultation of the heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh. I… I wasn't expecting this. I simply thought it would be a blood test. I am rather… private, Doctor. Is there absolutely no other way to proceed? Perhaps we could just start with the blood work? I’m feeling quite exposed and vulnerable already.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shaub, a proper medical assessment requires a thorough examination. This is not a request; it is a necessity. I assure you, this is entirely professional. We need to establish a baseline, assess for any visible signs of infection, and evaluate your lymph nodes. Now, please, if you would be so kind. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please, be quick. This is… deeply uncomfortable. And please, avoid looking directly at me. I would greatly appreciate that.
DOCTOR: “Take a deep breath… and exhale. Another deep breath… Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I need to examine your throat.” “Open wide…”
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem… very focused. Is there something wrong? I can barely breathe, and this is… terribly invasive.
DOCTOR: “Throat appears unremarkable. No visible lesions or inflammation. Palate is normal. Now, I will need to check your blood pressure and pulse.” “Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140 over 90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Not alarming, but warrants monitoring.” “Any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh! That's… a little uncomfortable, Doctor. No, no specific pain, but it's… sensitive. I do have a bit of indigestion sometimes, but nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, this whole examination is making me quite anxious. Is there any reason to be concerned? You’re not saying anything, and it’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: “Indigestion. Likely related to stress. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. No masses or organomegaly detected. Now, let’s discuss laboratory testing.” “We will order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an HIV antibody test. It is standard procedure. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies. But… are you sure this is all necessary? I came for a simple HIV test, and now it’s… all of this. I feel like I'm being treated like a… a specimen. And honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure I want to proceed any further. Perhaps I should just leave and get a second opinion. .
DOCTOR: “As you wish, Ms. Shaub. However, I strongly advise against making rash decisions based on… emotional discomfort. Very well. I will write you a referral to another physician. I trust you will find one who accommodates your… sensitivities.” “Here is the referral. The lab order for the HIV test is included. You may schedule the appointment at your convenience. I have other patients waiting. Good day.” .
