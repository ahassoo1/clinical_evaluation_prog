DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s my hands. They shake. Been happening for a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Time… it slips away, you know? Just… they tremble. Makes things difficult. I used to work with… pipes. Water stuff. Not anymore, though. Too shaky.
DOCTOR: Right. Tremors in your hands. And you said this has been going on for a while…difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started. And it’s interfering with your ability to do…manual work, specifically pipefitting. Do you notice the tremors at rest, meaning when your hands are simply lying in your lap, or only when you're trying to do something with them?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… think it's worse when I try to do things. Like… holding a cup. Or trying to button my shirt. It's… frustrating. When I’m just sitting, it’s… less noticeable. Though, sometimes… I feel it, even then. A little quiver, maybe. It’s hard to say for sure. I don’t really look at my hands when I’m resting. Why would I?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, predominantly with action, but you do occasionally feel a subtle tremor even at rest. And you mentioned it's been interfering with daily activities… besides the pipefitting, what other things are proving difficult?
PATIENT: Well… eating, sometimes. Soup is… a disaster. And writing. Used to write letters to my daughter, but… it's just too messy now. Everything shakes. It's little things, really. Don’t want to bother you with it. I manage. Mostly.
DOCTOR: These things are bothersome, even if they seem small. And it's important to address them. Now, have you noticed anything else accompanying the tremors?
PATIENT: Accompanying…? Like… what do you mean? Other things? Hmm… I… well, I get tired. More tired than I used to. But I’m an old man. Old men get tired, right? I don't know… maybe a little bit of stiffness sometimes. In my fingers. But honestly, it could just be the weather. This city… always changing.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and some stiffness in the fingers… understandable, given your age. However, it’s important to document everything. Have you noticed any changes in your balance, or have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Falls…? No, no falls. Not recently. I'm… careful. Though, I do feel a little unsteady sometimes. Like… a wobble. Not enough to fall, just… a feeling. Like I might. I hold onto things, you know? Furniture, walls… Just in case. But no falls. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Occasional unsteadiness, reports holding onto furniture for support.” Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh, dear. That’s… a long time ago. Let me think… I had… a bad knee, years ago. Playing soccer. Had surgery. And… I think I had high blood pressure, once. The doctor put me on pills. I stopped taking them. Didn't like how they made me feel. Honestly, I forget a lot of it. It was a long time ago. I wasn't good at remembering doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. History of knee surgery and previously diagnosed hypertension, off medication. And you say you don’t recall much else. Do you know if you’ve ever had any major surgeries besides the knee?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Maybe… a tonsillectomy when I was a kid. But that was… ages ago. Before the war, even. No, no major surgeries that I can remember. Nothing else. Really. I’m… pretty sure. Look, I wasn't a sick man. Mostly healthy, all my life. Until… well, until this hand thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had arthritis, I think. Badly. In her hands and knees. Couldn’t do much towards the end. My father… he was a strong man. Lived a long life. Heart gave out, eventually. No… I don’t remember anyone else with shaking. No one with tremors, like me. Though, that doesn’t mean anything, does it?
DOCTOR: It's helpful information. Now, let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no pills. Like I said, I don't like them. Not taking anything. Vitamins either. Don't believe in all that stuff. Just… try to eat good. Though, with the shaking, cooking is getting harder… and I end up eating less, to be honest. Mostly just bread and soup. It’s easy.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any. I can eat anything. Though… I don’t eat much anymore, like I said. Just… not hungry, I guess. It’s the shaking… makes everything so tiring. Everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your reflexes, coordination, and strength, and have a look at your hands. It won't take long. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, go ahead. Get it over with. I got things to do. Though… I warn you, my hands are probably shaking by now. Just thinking about it makes them worse, I think. But go ahead. Just… be quick, if you could.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please extend your arms, palms up. I'll be testing your reflexes first. Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within acceptable limits for your age. Tremor is present at rest and significantly exacerbated with action. Degree of tremor is moderate, impacting fine motor skills. Coordination is somewhat impaired. Strength appears adequate, but further assessment is needed. Alright. Based on my examination, and your reported history, it appears you're experiencing a tremor. It's difficult to determine the exact cause without further investigation. It could be related to age, essential tremor, or other underlying conditions. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any potential medical causes. And I'm going to suggest a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… a neurologist… oh, dear. More appointments. Look, Doctor, is it… bad? Is something seriously wrong? I just want it to stop shaking. That’s all. Can’t you just… give me something for it? A pill? Anything? I don't want a bunch of tests and doctors… just want my hands to be steady.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns. However, it is irresponsible – and frankly, unethical – to prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. The cause of your tremor needs to be determined before any treatment can be considered. There are various potential causes, some of which are more serious than others. The blood work will help rule out certain medical conditions, such as thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. A neurologist is the specialist best equipped to assess the tremor and provide a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. I am recommending these tests not to cause you inconvenience, but to ensure your well-being. Ignoring the problem will not make it go away, and attempting to self-treat could be harmful. The tests are necessary. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Anya Petrova, a highly respected neurologist in the city. She’s excellent. Do you have any questions about the referral or the tests?
PATIENT: Dr. Petrova… fine. Whatever. Just… how long will this take? And will the tests… hurt? I hate needles. Always have. Look, I’m an old man, Doctor. I don't have a lot of time left. I just want to be comfortable. If it's going to be months of appointments and… and prodding, I don't know if I can deal with it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns about time and discomfort. The blood work will be relatively quick—a standard procedure, and the discomfort is minimal. It's a small prick, truly. As for Dr. Petrova, her schedule is typically booked, but her office will work with you to find the earliest possible appointment. We’ll ensure it's expedited as much as possible. I will also provide you with a list of resources to help manage the tremor while you wait for your appointment. There are some simple exercises and adaptive tools that may help improve your daily functioning. Here is the referral to Dr. Petrova, and a list of recommended resources. I also want to emphasize the importance of following up with Dr. Petrova as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… tell Dr. Petrova I’m an old man, okay? And that I just want my hands to stop shaking. That’s all. I don’t want a lot of fancy tests or complicated treatments… just something to make it stop. Thank you, Doctor. I… I suppose. .
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome. .
