DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's... it’s a bit different than a usual doctor's visit, I suppose. I’ve been thinking a lot lately, and I’ve been reading about mindfulness and meditation. I’m interested in learning more about it, and I thought maybe you could point me in the right direction, or tell me if it might be helpful for someone like me. I work… well, it's a stressful job sometimes, fixing signals and switches out on the tracks, and I find myself getting quite wound up.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness and meditation... I see. While I appreciate you being proactive about your well-being, Ms. Sugino, this isn't quite the typical scope of a medical consultation. I’m a physician, not a… life coach, if you will. However, I suppose we can briefly discuss it in the context of stress management, if you’d like. But I need to understand why you're coming to me about this. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms—anxiety, trouble sleeping, perhaps—that are leading you to consider these techniques?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, you're right. I didn’t mean to put you on the spot. It’s just… well, everything feels connected, doesn't it? If I'm less stressed, maybe my blood pressure is better, maybe I sleep better. It is about managing things, I guess. Specific symptoms… hmm. I wouldn’t say trouble sleeping, but I do lie awake sometimes, replaying things that happened during the day. Little things, mostly – did I check that connection properly? Could I have done something faster? And yes, a bit of anxiety, especially before a big project, or if there’s been a near miss on the tracks. It’s not debilitating, but it’s… there. I just thought, maybe a doctor might have some good resources for learning to calm things down. I apologize if that was a bit unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some difficulty with sleep, ruminating on work events, and mild anxiety related to your job. It’s not uncommon for people in high-stress professions to experience these things, Ms. Sugino. Let's get a better picture of what’s going on. First, how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not new, not at all. It comes and goes, really. But probably… consistently for the last five or six years? It seems to get worse when we're short-staffed, or if there's a lot of track work happening – more pressure to get everything done quickly and safely. Before that, it was just occasional. I used to be able to just… shake it off, you know? Now it lingers a bit more. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s like the little worries stick around longer.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Sugino. And it sounds like these symptoms are, at least partially, tied to your work environment. Now, you mentioned difficulty sleeping—are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly falling asleep, I think. I'll lie in bed, and my mind just races. Like a replay of the day, but not a relaxing movie! Just… everything I did, everything I should have done, things I worry about for the next day. Once I am asleep, I usually stay asleep. It’s just… getting there is the problem. And sometimes, if I wake up in the middle of the night, it takes me a while to get back to sleep. It's not every night, but often enough to be… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, intermittent difficulty falling asleep, some waking during the night, associated with racing thoughts. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but that was it, and I recovered just fine. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy, I think. I get a check-up every year, and my bloodwork is always good. My mother had some arthritis when she got older, but nothing major. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can, even if it’s just a long walk. I’m covered by Medicare, so I take advantage of the preventative screenings they offer. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. No major medical history, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, otherwise healthy. You mentioned your mother's arthritis… did anyone else in your family have any significant medical conditions—heart disease, stroke, anxiety, depression?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My father… he had a heart attack when he was quite young, in his early sixties. And my sister, she's always been a bit… nervous, I guess. She’s been seeing someone for anxiety for years now. Not severe, but she worries a lot. Other than that, not really. My grandmother was very healthy, lived to be ninety-five, and my grandfather was a strong, active man all his life. It’s funny, I’m probably the most anxious one in the family.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of heart disease in your father, anxiety in your sister. Now, Ms. Sugino, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, herbal supplements—anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, that's it. I’ve never been much for herbal supplements, either. I prefer to try to handle things on my own, if I can. I’ve always been a bit… independent, I suppose. I even do most of the repairs around my little house myself. But I’m realizing maybe I need a bit of help with this… mental stuff.
DOCTOR: Independent… I see. Very well. Now, to clarify, you mentioned you work on the tracks…is this a physically demanding job?
PATIENT: Oh, very much so. It’s not lifting heavy things all day, but it requires a lot of bending, kneeling, and working in awkward positions. It’s also… hot and cold, depending on the season. And noisy! Lots of machinery, trains going by. It keeps you on your toes, that’s for sure. And you have to be very, very focused. A mistake could be… serious. That's probably a big part of the stress, honestly. Knowing the responsibility is on you to keep things safe. It’s not glamorous work, I’ll tell you that much. But it's important work.
DOCTOR: Physically demanding, hot/cold environment, high responsibility… Alright. And finally, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I've never had a reaction to any medicine I've ever taken. I think I’m pretty lucky in that regard. Honestly, I’m a pretty straightforward case, I think. Just a bit… overwound. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Doctor. It’s nice to be able to talk to someone about it, even if it's not a typical doctor's visit.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino. I have a reasonable picture now. No major medical history, family history of heart disease and anxiety, physically demanding job with high responsibility, no allergies. You're experiencing intermittent difficulty falling asleep, racing thoughts, and some anxiety, tied to your work. Now, I’m going to be frank. While I understand you’re seeking guidance on mindfulness and meditation, and I’m not going to dismiss your concerns, I believe it would be prudent to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I’d like to order some basic bloodwork—a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level—just to make sure everything is functioning normally. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds very sensible. I understand completely. I just want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything. I'd be happy to get the bloodwork done. It's good to be thorough. I’m also open to any suggestions you might have, even if it’s just pointing me to some reliable resources for learning about mindfulness and meditation. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to feel a little more… calm, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will write you a requisition for the bloodwork. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re expecting you. Once we have the results—which should be back in a few days—we can discuss them, and then I can offer some more specific recommendations. In the meantime, I will be honest with you. I don’t routinely counsel patients on meditation techniques. However, I can provide you with some information on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia – it’s often very effective, and can address the racing thoughts you’re experiencing. It's a more evidence-based approach, frankly. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very helpful. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy... I’ve heard of that, I think. Anything that might help me quiet my mind at night would be wonderful. And I appreciate your honesty. I understand you’re a doctor, not a… meditation guru. Information on CBT sounds perfect. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better already, just knowing we’re taking steps to figure things out. Where should I go for the bloodwork?
DOCTOR: The lab is just at the end of the hall, on the left. The receptionist will get you checked in. They'll draw a few vials of blood, and it shouldn't take long. Once you’re finished, you can come back, and we’ll discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good for now. Just a little nervous about the blood draw, always. But I’ll manage. Thank you again for listening, Doctor Kur. I appreciate your time and your honest advice. I’ll head to the lab now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s see what the bloodwork reveals. Don’t hesitate to let the phlebotomist know if you have any concerns during the draw. And please, schedule a follow-up appointment with my office for next week, once the results are in. .
PATIENT: .
