DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, uh, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, it's my stomach. Been, well, bleeding a bit. Not a good bit, if you know what I mean. More like... concerning. Been happenin' for a few days now. Don't really know what to make of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re experiencing some bleeding from your stomach, and it's been going on for a few days. You described it as concerning, rather than a large amount, is that correct?
PATIENT: Right. "Concerning" is a good word. It's not like... a fountain, you know? More like… spotting. Dark stuff. And it makes me feel weak, honestly. Like I need to sit down a lot. Not that it's stopped me from doing things, but… it's there. It’s definitely there. And it's not getting better.
DOCTOR: Alright, dark spotting, and it’s causing you to feel weak. That's definitely something we need to investigate. You said it's not improving, so it hasn’t gone away after a few days?
PATIENT: No, it hasn’t. A few days, like I said. Tried… I dunno, drinking more water? Seemed to make no difference. Look, I'm not one for fussin' over every little ache, but this...this feels different. It's not just a stomach bug, is it? I've had those. This is… heavier. And the color. That’s what worries me, honestly. It's not… normal.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned about the color and the fact that it isn’t resolving. It’s good you're not dismissing it. Let's get some more information. First, can you describe the stool itself?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Gotta talk about that now? Fine. Look, it’s… black. Like, really dark black. Not just a little dark, tar black. And kinda… sticky. Not normal at all, doc. I haven’t eaten anything that would make it look like that, I promise you. I mostly eat rice and… well, it doesn’t matter what else. It's black. And it smells… different too. More metallic, maybe? I don’t know, I’m not a chemist. But it's definitely not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, black, tarry stools are very important information, thank you for being so detailed. The metallic smell is also concerning. This suggests there may be bleeding higher up in the digestive tract. Now, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain alongside this?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. So it is something serious. Good. Glad someone’s listenin'. Okay, nausea, yeah, a little. Not constant, more like… waves. Comes and goes. No vomiting, thankfully. And the pain... it's not sharp, it’s more like… a dull ache. Right here, in the middle. Comes and goes with the nausea, usually. It's not crippling, but… it's there, remindin' me somethin’s wrong. Definitely somethin's wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull, intermittent abdominal pain accompanying the nausea and black stools. Let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as ulcers, gastritis, or anything related to your stomach or intestines?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I'm a simple man. I haven't exactly spent a lot of time in hospitals. I had the flu a couple times, broke my arm when I was a kid. Nothing serious. No ulcers, no… gastritis, whatever that is. Never had any tests done on my stomach, nothin' like that. I mostly just ignore things until they go away... which, usually, they do. But this… this ain't goin' away. And my wife… well, she's gone now, and she always kept track of this stuff. I don't. So, no, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright if you haven't had a lot of medical experience. We'll figure this out. And I apologize for asking about your history, I just need to gather as much information as possible. Have you taken any medications recently – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me think. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that's it. Doctor gave it to me a couple years ago. And… sometimes, when my knees act up, I take some ibuprofen. The over-the-counter stuff. But I haven't taken any of that in… well, maybe a week or so. Nothing else. No fancy pills, no herbal remedies, nothin'. I don’t really believe in all that stuff, honestly. Just the blood pressure pill, and maybe some ibuprofen every now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything, take any medicine. Always been lucky like that, I guess. My wife, she was allergic to everything. Pollen, cats, peanuts… you name it. But me? No. Never had a problem. So, no allergies. Thankfully. One less thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Look, doc, are you tryin' to build a case against me or somethin'? I'm a simple man! I used to smoke, a long time ago. Quit about twenty years ago when my wife got sick. Alcohol? I’ll have a beer with dinner sometimes. Maybe a couple on the weekend. Nothing crazy. And recreational drugs? Don’t even think about it. I don’t need that trouble. So, no. Used to smoke, but quit. A couple beers now and then. That's it. I'm a law-abidin' citizen, doc. Just a man with a bleedin’ stomach.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seemed intrusive. I assure you, I'm only trying to get a complete picture of your health. Now, a final question about your family history. Are there any instances of stomach cancer, ulcers, or bleeding disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. Another thing my wife kept track of. Okay, let me think. My father… he had some stomach problems. Vague stuff. Doctors poked and prodded, but never really figured it out. Said something about inflammation, but he mostly just complained about indigestion. No cancer, as far as I know. My mother… she died young, heart problems. No history of bleedin’ disorders, either. Honestly, doc, we weren't a particularly healthy bunch. Everyone just… faded away eventually. So, nothin’ specific that I can think of. Just… general unwellness. It’s not much help, is it?
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's alright. Any information is helpful. Now, if you’ll excuse me for a moment, I’m going to perform a physical exam. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and gently pressing on it to feel for any tenderness. I’ll also need to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds… although they are a bit sluggish. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Poke away, doc. Just… be gentle, okay? I’m not a young man anymore. Ooh, yeah, right there. That's… a little tender. Not excruciating, but… yeah. Definitely somethin’ there. Feels kinda… achy, more than sharp. And… … it kinda radiates around a bit, if that makes sense. Not a lot, just… a general discomfort. Not like a stab, more like… a dull thump. But yeah, that spot right there is… not happy.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the upper abdomen, radiating discomfort. That’s consistent with what you’ve been describing. I'm also noting your skin appears slightly pale, which could be indicative of some blood loss. Given your symptoms – black, tarry stools, weakness, abdominal tenderness – and the results of the physical exam, I'm concerned about the possibility of a gastrointestinal bleed. To determine the source and severity of the bleeding, we need to order some tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count to check your hemoglobin levels, as well as a stool test to confirm the presence of blood. I’ll also order an upper endoscopy, which involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and identify any source of bleeding. Do you have any questions about the tests I’m ordering?
PATIENT: Endoscopy, huh? Sounds… unpleasant. You’re stickin’ a camera down my throat? Really? Look, doc, I'm not thrilled about any of this. But… if you think it's necessary, fine. I trust your judgment. But… is it gonna be painful? And… how long is it gonna take? And… will I be awake for it? I don’t do well with things goin’ down my throat. Honestly, just the thought of it… Ugh. So yeah, lots of questions. Is it gonna knock me out? Because I’d prefer that. A lot. And what if you don't find anything? Then I've been poked and prodded for nothin'?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gentz. It’s perfectly natural to be anxious about an endoscopy. Let me address your questions. Yes, it involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. We will spray your throat with a local anesthetic to minimize discomfort. Most patients tolerate the procedure well, but you may feel some pressure or a slight urge to swallow. We will also give you a sedative to help you relax and make you more comfortable, so you won’t be fully awake during the procedure. You likely won't remember much of it. It typically takes about 15-30 minutes. As for finding something, even if we don't identify a clear source of bleeding, the endoscopy can still provide valuable information and help rule out certain conditions. And, if we do find a source, we can often treat it during the procedure – for example, by stopping bleeding or taking a biopsy. Do you have any other concerns about the endoscopy?
PATIENT: Sedative… okay, that’s good. That's much better. Not being awake is a definite plus. And you can treat it during the procedure? Stop the bleedin' right then and there? That sounds… hopeful. Biopsy… what does that even mean? You’re gonna… take a piece of my stomach? Just the thought of it makes me queasy. And… … how long will I be here? I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things. And will I be able to eat afterward? Or will I be stuck with a liquid diet for a week? Ugh. Honestly, doc, I'm a simple man. I like my rice and beans. I don’t want any fancy diets. So, how long will I be here? And will I be able to eat afterward? Those are the important questions.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those important questions, Mr. Gentz. The procedure itself will take about 15-30 minutes, but you'll need to be here for a couple of hours beforehand for preparation and afterwards for monitoring. We need to ensure the sedative wears off safely. As for eating, you'll likely be restricted to liquids for the first few hours after the endoscopy, but you should be able to resume a normal diet relatively quickly – usually within 24 hours, unless we find something that requires a more restricted diet. If we take a biopsy, there may be a slight chance of minor discomfort or bloating, but it’s usually manageable. We will have a nurse explain the pre-procedure instructions to you in detail, including fasting requirements and medication adjustments. Do you have anyone who can accompany you to the procedure?
PATIENT: Twenty-four hours… okay, I can manage that. Rice and beans are worth waitin’ for. And… no, I don’t have anyone. My wife… she's gone, like I said. Always did everything for me. Now… it’s just me. I can get a taxi home, though. I’m perfectly capable. Just… I’m not good with all this medical stuff. It’s a bit overwhelming, honestly. So, just… me. I’ll get a taxi. And I guess I’ll just… wait. And try not to think about a camera goin’ down my throat. Ugh. Is there… anything I should bring? Besides my stomach, I mean. Just… any advice? To make it easier? Because honestly, doc, I’m a bit scared.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. It’s perfectly normal to feel scared. You are not alone in feeling this way. And you don’t need to worry about a thing. The nurses will take excellent care of you. To prepare for the procedure, please don't eat or drink anything for at least six hours beforehand, as instructed by the nurse. You can take your regular medications, unless otherwise directed. I recommend bringing a comfortable pair of clothes and a book or magazine to help you pass the time. Also, please bring a list of all your medications, as well as any allergies you may have. And most importantly, please don’t hesitate to ask any questions you may have, no matter how small. The nurses and I are here to support you every step of the way. We’ll schedule the endoscopy for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. The nurse will call you shortly to confirm the appointment and provide detailed instructions. Do you have any final questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… 9:00 AM. Okay. I guess I can manage that. No, I don’t think so. You’ve… covered everything, actually. Just… thank you, doc. For… explainin’ everything. And for… not laughin’ at me. It’s just… a lot to take in. I'll… see you tomorrow, then. At 9:00 AM. And… thank you again. For everything. I’ll try not to think about the camera. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Gentz. It was my pleasure. Remember, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. The nurses are available 24/7. We’ll take good care of you. Have a good evening, and I'll see you tomorrow at 9:00 AM. .
