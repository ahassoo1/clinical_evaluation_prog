DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I'm Dr. Todoroovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my back. Lower back, mostly. Been botherin’ me for… well, a little while now. It feels kinda achy, you know? Not sharp, just… old. Like somethin’ is wearin’ out.
DOCTOR: “Old,” huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, old. Like… I used to be able to lift things, help my daughter with her garden… now, bendin’ over is a whole thing. And it hurts more when I stand for too long. Not all the time, but… often enough to be annoying.
DOCTOR: Annoying is…understandable. And how long has it been going on, this “annoying” ache?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started maybe six months ago? Not bad at first, just a little stiff. But it’s gotten worse slow and steady. I didn’t think much of it at first, just figured I was gettin’ old! But now it's… hard to ignore.
DOCTOR: Six months… okay. And are there any particular things that specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, standin' for a long time. And… bendin’ over is a killer. Also, twistin’. If I try to reach somethin’ on the side, I gotta be real careful. It's mostly when I move, not when I’m just sittin’ still. But even sittin' for too long isn't good. It gets stiff then too.
DOCTOR: So, movement exacerbates it, and prolonged stillness also causes discomfort. Any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. It stays right in my lower back. No shootin’ pain, no numb spots, nothin’ like that. Just… achey. It's a good thing it hasn't gone down my legs, I don't want that! My sister, she had problems with her legs… not a good time for her.
DOCTOR: Good. We want to avoid that, certainly. Now, have you tried anything to alleviate the pain yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… the usual. I tried some of those creams, the ones you rub on. Didn't do much. And I try to stretch a little, but I’m scared to overdo it, you know? Don’t wanna make it worse! My daughter, she got me one of those heating pads. That feels good for a bit, but it doesn't last.
DOCTOR: Creams and a heating pad… right. Have you had any injuries to your back in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Not that I remember, anyway. I used to do a lot of work… heavy liftin’ when I was younger, workin’ construction. But no specific injury, not like a fall or a twist. Just… wear and tear, I guess. Been a long time, lots of work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, are there any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Well, my blood pressure's a little high, the doctor told me. I take a little pill for that. And… honestly, I’m not insured, so I don’t go to the doctor much. Just when somethin’ really bothers me. That's why I waited so long with this back thing.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure… medication. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. If you don't mind. Can you stand up for me, and I'll see how you move?
PATIENT: Sure, that's fine. Just tell me if I'm doin' somethin' wrong. There we go. A little creaky, but I’m up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. Can you gently bend forward, trying to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh… whoa. That’s about as far as I can go, Doctor. It’s tight. Really tight. I don't want to push it.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion with forward flexion. Noticeable discomfort. Palpating lumbar spine… tenderness to palpation at L4-L5. Muscles are quite tight, guarding present. Neurological exam… strength appears intact in lower extremities, reflexes normal. Alright, Mr. Vankampen. It appears you have some muscle spasm and limited range of motion in your lower back, likely contributing to your pain. It sounds like a musculoskeletal issue, probably some sort of strain or sprain. Given your history, and the fact that this has been going on for six months, it's not something that's likely to resolve on its own.
PATIENT: Six months, huh? That's what I figured. So… what do I do? More creams? I don't wanna just keep sufferin'. And… is it somethin’ serious? I worry about breakin’ somethin’.
DOCTOR: Creams won't cut it, Mr. Vankampen. You need a more structured approach. While I don’t believe it’s a fracture at this point, prolonged discomfort like this necessitates imaging to rule out any underlying pathology. Given your lack of insurance, however, that presents a challenge. We could start with some physical therapy—strengthening and stretching exercises—but that will be out of pocket. Alternatively, I can refer you to a specialist who may be able to work with you on a payment plan. I'm hesitant to prescribe anything stronger at this stage without further investigation. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Payment plan… that might be doable. I don't want to spend a lot of money I don’t have, but… six months is a long time to hurt. Physical therapy sounds good, but… can I even do it? I don't wanna make it worse before it gets better. Is the specialist… a back doctor? Like… they know about backs? And how much does all this cost? I need to be careful.
DOCTOR: Yes, the specialist is a spine specialist – they specialize in backs, Mr. Vankampen. And I understand your concern about cost; I can give you a referral to a clinic that offers a sliding scale for patients without insurance. As for physical therapy, they will assess your current capabilities and create a program tailored to your limitations. It's not about pushing through pain; it's about gentle, progressive strengthening and stretching. Let’s start with the referral. I’ll write it now. And frankly, it’s a good idea to get some imaging done – just to be certain. I’ll also give you a handout with some simple stretches you can do at home, very gently. But don't overdo it, and stop if you feel any sharp pain. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. That sounds… better, I guess. A sliding scale would be good. And gentle stretches, I can do that. No pushin’ it. What kind of imaging? Is it somethin’ scary? And… will the specialist want all sorts of tests and stuff? I just want to get my back fixed, not… spend all my time at the doctor.
DOCTOR: The most likely imaging would be an X-ray, Mr. Vankampen. It’s not scary; it’s just a picture of your bones. It will help rule out any fractures or structural issues. The specialist will assess your condition and determine if any further tests are necessary. But, frankly, they're likely to start with a physical exam and review of your history—similar to what we’ve already done. I’m going to be realistic, you will need to attend appointments and actively participate in your care. It's not a quick fix, but it’s possible to improve your condition. Here’s the referral. Call their office to schedule an appointment. And please, try those gentle stretches. I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt, but remember, I cannot wave a magic wand. Do you have any other questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that's it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time. I'll call 'em tomorrow. And I'll try the stretches, gently. Stop if it hurts… I got it. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Get some rest, Mr. Vankampen.
