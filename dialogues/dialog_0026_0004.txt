DOCTOR: Good morning, Teah. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's just a check-up really. Routine immunizations, like my husband always reminds me to get. He's very good about that sort of thing. I think it's time for a tetanus shot, if I remember right.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful that your husband is so proactive about your health! Routine care is very important. Let me just pull up your record here… Ah, yes. I see your last tetanus booster was… hmm. It seems my records are a little vague on the exact date, unfortunately. Do you have a general recollection of when you last had one?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You're right, it has been a while. I’m terrible with dates, honestly. Let me think… I want to say… maybe five or six years ago? Possibly when my grandson was born? We were all getting whooping cough shots then, and I figured I should update mine at the same time. But like I said, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is it really that important to know the exact date?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Teah, don't worry about it. Memories can be tricky. Knowing approximately when you last had a tetanus shot is helpful, but it’s not the end of the world if we don't have the exact date. It just helps us determine if you're due for a booster. According to these notes, you did receive a Tdap booster – that's tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – around May of 2019, when your grandson was born. So it seems you’re likely due for another tetanus booster soon. To be absolutely sure, and to get a complete picture of your health, could you tell me a bit about any other medical conditions you have or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, that's right, I do remember that one! That grandson of mine… keeps me on my toes, that one does. Let me think about medical stuff… Well, I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago now. No trouble with that since. And, um… I get a little arthritis in my hands sometimes, especially in the cold. It’s just a bit of stiffness, nothing major. Other than that, I'm pretty healthy, knock on wood. I’ve always been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Teah. Gallbladder removal ten years ago, and some arthritis in your hands. Is the arthritis causing you much trouble day to day?
PATIENT: Not really, thankfully. It’s mostly just a bit of ache in the mornings, and when the weather gets really cold and damp. I try to keep busy, gardening mostly, and that seems to help keep things moving. I've never really bothered with any medication for it. Just try to manage it with warm hands and moving around. It’s not worth taking pills if I can avoid it, you know?
DOCTOR: That sounds very sensible, Teah. Staying active is a wonderful way to manage arthritis, and it’s good you’ve found something that works for you. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s easy. Practically nothing! Just a daily multivitamin, that’s it. And occasionally some ibuprofen if I get a bad headache, but that’s maybe twice a year. I really try to avoid taking anything if I don’t absolutely need it. I believe in letting my body heal itself as much as possible. My grandmother always used to say, “Too much medicine is worse than not enough,” and I’ve always lived by that.
DOCTOR: That's a good philosophy, Teah. And it sounds like you’re doing a good job of prioritizing your health naturally. Now, are there any allergies I should be aware of – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of! I've never had a reaction to anything. My husband always asks the same thing, and I always tell him the same thing. He worries a lot. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. No trouble with penicillin or anything like that, thank goodness. I think I'm pretty lucky, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Teah. No known allergies. That simplifies things nicely. Now, I’d like to just do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I don’t mind at all. I haven’t had a proper check-up in a while, so it’s probably a good idea. Just let me know if anything seems…off, okay? I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Teah. I will. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 132/88. A little elevated, but not significantly concerning. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Ears look clear as well. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Everything sounds and looks good so far, Teah. Are you experiencing any pain anywhere at the moment?
PATIENT: No pain at all, thank you for asking. Maybe a little stiffness in my fingers, like I said, but that's just the arthritis acting up. Nothing to worry about. I'm just glad everything else seems to be alright. It's a relief, honestly. It's easy to worry about things when you get to be my age, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Teah. It’s good to check in and make sure everything is as it should be. So, given your history, and the fact that everything sounds good today, I recommend we go ahead and administer a Tdap booster. It's been over five years since your last one, and it's important to keep your immunity up to date. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good to me, Doctor. I trust your judgment. As long as there aren't any nasty side effects, I’m happy to get it done and over with. Are there any I should be looking out for? I don’t want to be laid up for days, you know? I've got a garden to tend!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Teah. The most common side effects are mild – some soreness at the injection site, and maybe a little fatigue or a low-grade fever. These usually resolve within a day or two. It’s very rare to have a severe reaction, but I’ll give you a leaflet with more detailed information about potential side effects, and what to do if you experience any concerning symptoms. We’ll also keep you here for about fifteen minutes after the injection, just to monitor you. Does that sound reassuring?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Fifteen minutes is nothing. And the leaflet is a good idea, always good to be prepared. So, where do we do it? I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat with needles, if you don't mind me saying. Don't judge!
DOCTOR: Not at all, Teah. Many people feel a little anxious about needles. I won’t judge you at all! We’ll just have you sit here, and I’ll administer the injection in your upper arm. I'll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. Just relax your arm, and try to take a few deep breaths. It will be over before you know it. There you go, all done. Just keep that bandage on for a few minutes, and avoid strenuous activity with that arm for the rest of the day. As I said, we’ll keep you here for about fifteen minutes to monitor you. Just let me know if you feel anything unusual.
PATIENT: Okay. That wasn’t so bad, actually. A little pinch, that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being so gentle. Now, I just sit here and… wait? Is there anything I should do while I wait? Try to distract myself? You wouldn't happen to have a magazine about gardening, would you?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teah. It was my pleasure. Unfortunately, I don't have any gardening magazines at the moment, but you are welcome to browse on your phone or just relax. We have some general health information pamphlets if you’d like to take a look at those. Otherwise, just sit comfortably and let me know if you feel anything out of the ordinary. We’ll be here monitoring you for the next ten minutes or so. Your blood pressure is still slightly elevated, but stable. Everything else looks good.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s fine. I think I’ll just sit here and… breathe, like you said. I can always use a few extra deep breaths. It's nice and quiet in here, at least. And it’s good to know you’re keeping an eye on things. It makes me feel better, knowing that. I’m a bit of a worrier, you see. It comes with the territory, I suppose. Getting older and all.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be a worrier, Teah. It means you’re caring and attentive to your health. And that's a very good thing. We’ve got a few minutes left to wait, and I can see you're doing very well. Everything looks good so far. Is there anything I can get you while we wait?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I'm quite alright, really. Just happy to be getting this done. I feel a little silly sometimes, worrying about everything, but I can't help it. My husband always tells me I need to relax, but it’s easier said than done, you know? He’s good at relaxing, though. Maybe I'll take up gardening, that might help.
DOCTOR: Gardening is a wonderful way to relax and de-stress, Teah. It combines physical activity with spending time in nature, which is very beneficial for both physical and mental health. Alright, Teah, it's been fifteen minutes. Everything looks great. You’re all set! Here’s that leaflet with information about potential side effects, and a bandage to keep over the injection site. Do you have any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your patience and kindness. You made me feel very comfortable, especially considering I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat with needles! I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything and answer all my questions. It really does make a difference. I think I'll head home now and take it easy. Maybe do a little gardening, if the weather cooperates.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. It was my pleasure taking care of you today. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns later on. Just remember to rest, stay hydrated, and listen to your body. Have a wonderful day, Teah, and enjoy your gardening! .
