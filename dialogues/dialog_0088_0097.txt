DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes. Well, my husband… he’s been reading about these… forms. Advance Directives, I believe they’re called? And POLSTs. He thinks we should have them “just in case.” Honestly, I find it a bit morbid, but he’s quite insistent. I suppose it's best to be prepared, but I haven't the faintest idea where to begin.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is a bit daunting to think about, but it’s actually very responsible of both of you to be considering this. It's good to have these conversations before a crisis. Essentially, these documents help ensure your wishes are known if you're unable to speak for yourself. So, to start, are you currently feeling unwell, or is this purely preventative planning?
PATIENT: Preventative, of course! Do I look unwell? Honestly, Doctor, I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I simply wish to have these… papers completed so my husband doesn’t continue to fret. It's a rather silly thing to worry over, if you ask me. But he insists on all this…“what if” nonsense.
DOCTOR: Alright, preventative then, good. I understand your husband is being cautious. We can certainly go through the process. Let's start with a quick overview of your medical history, just to have everything documented. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. I had a touch of bronchitis a few years ago, but that cleared up quickly. And… my blood pressure is sometimes a little high when I'm stressed, which, as you can imagine, is frequently. My husband is always reminding me to relax. Otherwise, no. I'm perfectly healthy, thank you. I do try to eat well, mostly. Though Moroccan cuisine is rather rich, you know. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Okay, bronchitis a few years ago, occasional high blood pressure with stress. And you mentioned a healthy diet, generally. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see... no, I don't believe so. Nothing major, certainly. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I suppose. Ages ago, when things were much simpler. And… a rather unpleasant bout of food poisoning in Marrakech, but that hardly counts as hospitalization. I recovered quite quickly, thank you very much. Is this really necessary, Doctor? All these questions about… minor ailments?
DOCTOR: We just want to have a complete picture, Marija. It’s standard procedure. Okay, so tonsillectomy as a child, and food poisoning. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no. I prefer to rely on natural remedies, thank you. A little mint tea here, a bit of honey and lemon there. My grandmother had all the best cures. No need for all those…chemicals. Honestly, I find most medications do more harm than good. My husband tries to get me to take something for my nerves, but I refuse. So, no. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. And you have no known allergies to any medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really, Doctor. I'm Moroccan! We practically live on spices. I assure you, I'm not allergic to anything. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to dust, but who isn't? It’s a desert climate, after all. But nothing serious. Absolutely nothing that requires an EpiPen or any such nonsense. Are we getting anywhere with these… inquiries, Doctor? My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're going back generations? Honestly, Doctor. My family is…large. And scattered across North Africa and Europe. I barely know half of them, let alone their medical records. My mother lived to a good age, I believe. And my father… well, he had a strong constitution. Everyone on both sides lived long, full lives. That's all I know. A lot of healthy living, I suppose. And good genes. Is that sufficient? It's hardly relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright, family history largely unknown, but generally healthy. Okay. And just a couple more quick questions before we move on. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I should think not! Do I look like the sort of person who would partake in such… vulgar habits? I maintain a very respectable lifestyle. My husband would be appalled. Absolutely not. Never have, never will. Are we finally getting to the forms, Doctor? This has been a rather lengthy interrogation, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Okay. Before we discuss the Advance Directives and POLST, I would like to quickly check your vital signs. Just a basic blood pressure reading and pulse. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Must we? I thought we already established my blood pressure is occasionally a little elevated when I'm stressed. And frankly, this entire process is causing me a great deal of stress. But… Very well. But please be quick about it. And try not to be too rough, I have rather delicate veins.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, as you mentioned - 150 over 90. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, before we delve into the paperwork, I want to be upfront. Your blood pressure reading is higher than optimal. While it may be due to stress from this visit, it’s something we should monitor and potentially address. Have you ever been formally diagnosed with hypertension?
PATIENT: Oh, that? It comes and goes. A little excitement, a little worry… it’s perfectly normal. My mother had the same thing. She just drank a lot of chamomile tea. No need for all those… medications and tests. Honestly, Doctor, I’m perfectly fine. I assure you. Can we please get on with the forms now? I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon, and I don't want to be late. I really don't see the point of dwelling on a temporary fluctuation in my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, let’s talk about Advance Directives. Essentially, these are legal documents that allow you to make your wishes known regarding your medical care if you become unable to speak for yourself. There are two main parts: a Living Will and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare. Do you have any idea what those involve?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the faintest idea. My husband did all the research. He’s the one who insisted on this whole… undertaking. He mentioned something about choosing someone to make decisions for me, and outlining what treatments I would or wouldn’t want. But frankly, it all sounded rather morbid and… unpleasant. Is it absolutely necessary to go into all the gruesome details? I prefer to think about pleasant things, if you don't mind. Luncheons, holidays… not end-of-life scenarios.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Marija. It is difficult to think about. But it's about ensuring your wishes are respected. The Living Will outlines what medical treatments you would or wouldn’t want in certain situations, like if you’re in a coma or have a terminal illness. The Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare designates someone—your husband, for example—to make those decisions for you if you’re unable to. We don't have to get into gruesome details. It’s more about broad preferences. For example, would you want life-sustaining treatments like a ventilator or feeding tube if there's no reasonable hope of recovery?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not! The thought of being hooked up to machines… it’s dreadful. I want to live a full and independent life, not be kept alive artificially. I want to be allowed to pass away peacefully, if my time comes. That’s what my mother would have wanted, and that’s what I want. But honestly, I don't want to think about it anymore. It’s all very upsetting. Can’t we just write something simple? “No life support, please”? That should be sufficient, shouldn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s a good starting point, Marija. However, it’s a bit more complex than that. We need to consider different scenarios. For example, what if you have a serious illness but could potentially recover with treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor, you are making this far too complicated. I just want it understood that I do not want to be kept alive artificially, under any circumstances. If there’s no hope of a full recovery, then just let nature take its course. I don’t want to be a burden on my family, or subjected to endless treatments that will only prolong my suffering. Is that clear enough? Can we please get this written down now? I have a luncheon to attend, and I’m starting to lose my appetite just thinking about all this dreadful nonsense.
DOCTOR: Okay, Marija. I understand your wishes. However, to ensure your directive is legally sound and truly reflects your preferences, I strongly recommend we complete the standard form. It allows for more specific instructions and avoids potential ambiguity. I can walk you through each section. It includes questions about artificial nutrition, hydration, resuscitation, and pain management. It will take about 20-30 minutes. I will document your specific request for “no life support” in the notes, but completing the full form provides greater legal protection and clarity. Would you be willing to go through it with me?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Twenty to thirty minutes? Are you serious? I haven't the time, nor the inclination, to spend that long filling out endless paperwork about… death! Honestly, Doctor, this is preposterous. Just write down "No life support, under any circumstances" and I will sign it. That should be sufficient. I'm a reasonable woman, and I trust you to understand my wishes. I really don't see the point of all this bureaucratic nonsense. Are you going to write it down, or must I find another doctor who is more accommodating?
DOCTOR: Marija, I understand your frustration, and I want to respect your wishes. However, I am ethically obligated to ensure your directive is comprehensive and legally sound. Simply stating "No life support" is not sufficient and may not be upheld in a medical emergency. It leaves too much room for interpretation and could lead to conflict. Furthermore, it does not address the Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare – designating someone to make medical decisions on your behalf. I am concerned that if we proceed this way, your wishes may not be fully honored. I cannot, in good conscience, simply write down “No life support” without a more thorough discussion and completion of the standard form. I recommend you discuss this with your husband and consider consulting with an attorney specializing in estate planning. I can provide you with a list of local resources. Perhaps he can assist with completing the forms. I am happy to reschedule this appointment to allow for more time. However, I will not simply write down “No life support” and sign it, as it does not meet my professional obligations. .
PATIENT: Honestly! This is outrageous! I have never encountered such obstinacy in my life. I came here seeking a simple service, and you are refusing to accommodate me. Fine. You refuse to assist me. I will find another doctor who is more willing to respect my wishes. .
