DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun, good to see you. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I requested a general wellness check, if you will. Just wanting to see how things are holding up, you understand. At my age, one likes to be…proactive. Though I feel quite well, thankfully.
DOCTOR: “Proactive,” right. Well, that’s…good. Most people don’t think about that until something is wrong. Still, a wellness check is…fine. We’ll get through it. Now, when was the last time you actually saw a doctor for anything more than a quick sniffle?
PATIENT: Oh, you’d be surprised, Doctor. I’ve always been a rather…sturdy fellow. Let me think…it would have been, oh, approximately five years ago. A minor issue with my shoulder, lifting some materials at the site. Nothing serious, really. A bit of physical therapy and I was right as rain. But a thorough check-up…it’s been a while, I admit. My wife, Elena, she’s been urging me, of course. Women always know best.
DOCTOR: Five years, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. Though, to be precise, it was the 14th of March, 2020. A Tuesday, I recall distinctly, as Elena and I had planned a small dinner with the Garcias that evening. They had just returned from a trip to…Barbados, I believe. A lovely couple. But yes, the shoulder. A slight rotator cuff strain, if I remember the physical therapist’s explanation correctly.
DOCTOR: Right. Barbados. Well, let’s focus on you for a moment, Mr. Mombrun. Any current aches, pains, or…discomfort anywhere?
PATIENT: Hmm. Nothing significant, Doctor. A bit of stiffness in my knees after a long day at the construction site, naturally. But that's simply the nature of the work, you understand. I’m not a young man anymore. And occasionally, a slight twinge in my lower back, but nothing that a good night’s sleep and perhaps a warm bath won't resolve. No persistent pain, if that’s what you’re asking. I assure you, I’m quite capable, still. I was lifting beams just last week.
DOCTOR: Beams, right. And how about…shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… Now that you mention it, perhaps a little more exertion than usual when climbing the stairs at home. But I attributed that to the humidity, Doctor. It's been quite oppressive lately. And, well, perhaps a slight…heaviness in my chest on occasion. But it passes quickly. I haven't given it much thought, truthfully. Is it something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: “Haven’t given it much thought.” Of course. Let’s just run through a few things, alright?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your expertise implicitly. Please, proceed. I want to ensure Elena doesn't have cause for worry. She tends to…overthink things, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Elena would never allow it, you see. She’s very particular about maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Fresh air and good food, that’s her motto. And I’ve always been rather fond of my lungs, you understand. Important for a man who spends his days…well, breathing in dust, admittedly. But no smoking, never have. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, but that's hardly a vice.
DOCTOR: Right. Alcohol, how much per week?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me consider. Perhaps…two or three glasses of red wine with dinner, on Fridays and Saturdays. Occasionally, a small glass with Elena on a special occasion. Nothing excessive, Doctor, I assure you. Certainly not enough to…cause any concern. I'm a practical man, you see. Moderation in all things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to any food, medication, or…anything, really. Elena always checks the labels carefully, of course. She’s quite diligent. I remember once, many years ago, a small rash after touching a particular flower…a bougainvillea, I believe. But that was a fleeting thing. Nothing serious. I’ve always considered myself…a rather robust constitution, you see. But no, no known allergies.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Ah, a good question, Doctor. Let me see… Currently, I take a small dose of lisinopril, 10 milligrams, for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it about a year ago. And occasionally, an ibuprofen tablet for aches and pains after a particularly strenuous day at the site. But that’s purely as needed, you understand. And a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. Elena insists. That's all, Doctor. Just those few. Nothing…complex, I hope.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. As you wish. Please, proceed. I am quite comfortable. Elena always tells me I have the constitution of an ox, so I doubt you’ll find anything amiss. Though, naturally, I trust your professional judgment implicitly. Please do not hesitate to let me know if you require any further information.
DOCTOR: Breathe deeply, Mr. Mombrun…and again…Hmm. A bit…distant. Now, lungs…Take a deep breath…and exhale…Again…There’s some…wheezing. Not alarming, but present. Blood pressure is…148 over 92. A bit elevated. Now, ears… Normal. Throat… A little redness, but nothing significant. Palpates patient's pulse. </stage>Pulse is regular but strong. I'm going to have you stand up slowly now.
PATIENT: As you wish, Doctor. I am standing. Do you require any further assessment in this position? Perhaps a check of my reflexes? Elena always says I have remarkably quick reflexes for a man of my age. Though, I confess, that may be a slight exaggeration on her part. She’s a very…optimistic woman, you understand. Is my blood pressure significantly elevated, Doctor? I do occasionally partake in a robust espresso in the morning, perhaps that is the cause?
DOCTOR: A little swelling in your ankles. And yes, your blood pressure is elevated. The espresso could be a factor, but it's something we need to investigate further. Now, I want to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an EKG. Just to get a baseline and see what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and an EKG… Yes, Doctor, that sounds…prudent. Thoroughness is always appreciated. I trust your judgment implicitly. Swelling in my ankles, you say? I hadn't noticed. Perhaps it’s the heat. It has been quite oppressive lately. When can I expect the results, Doctor? And will I need to refrain from any particular activities while we await them? Elena is rather protective, you understand. She tends to worry.
DOCTOR: The lab should have the results within 48 hours. I'd advise against any strenuous activity until we’ve had a chance to review them. No heavy lifting, no…marathon runs. Just take it easy. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. Understood?
PATIENT: Forty-eight hours…no strenuous activity…and immediate attention to any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Yes, Doctor, perfectly understood. I shall adhere to your instructions meticulously. Elena will be relieved to hear that. She has a tendency to…overprepare for any eventuality, you understand. I shall inform her of your recommendations immediately. Is there anything else I should be aware of at this time, Doctor? Any dietary restrictions or…preparations I should undertake?
DOCTOR: Just try to reduce your salt intake. And drink plenty of water. Otherwise, just…wait for the results. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them. We'll discuss the findings and formulate a plan then. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Reduce salt intake…and increase water consumption… Yes, Doctor, perfectly reasonable. Elena will be pleased to hear that, as well. She’s quite fond of preparing healthy meals. No, Doctor, at this moment, I believe that is all. I trust your expertise implicitly, and I shall await the results with…calm anticipation. Thank you for your thorough assessment and your clear instructions. I appreciate your time and your professional guidance. Please, do not hesitate to contact me if any further information is required.
DOCTOR: Alright. You'll receive a call from the nurse to schedule the follow-up. Have a good day, Mr. Mombrun.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. You as well. And thank you again for your attention. Elena and I wish you a pleasant day as well.
