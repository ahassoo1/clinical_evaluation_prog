DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin. It’s just… not right. There are patches, you see. Discoloration. It’s quite bothersome, really. Not what one expects at my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, “not right” and “discoloration.” Can you tell me a little more about these patches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? They’re… uneven. Not all the same shade, certainly. Some are a bit lighter than the rest of my skin, others are… almost brownish. And they’ve popped up over the last few months, really. I hadn't noticed them at first, of course. One doesn’t spend all day scrutinizing one’s own epidermis. But now… now they’re quite visible. Especially in this light. And they’re not symmetrical, which is… unsettling. I read online that asymmetry is… a concern. Though I doubt everything one finds online is accurate.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be cautious about information online. Asymmetry can be a concern, but it’s not the only thing that matters. “Popped up over the last few months,” you said. Have they changed in size, shape, or color since you first noticed them?
PATIENT: Yes, they absolutely have. The one on my left hand… it was barely noticeable, a tiny speck, really. Now it’s… well, it’s the size of a dime, I’d say. And the color is… deeper. More brown than it was. The one on my neck hasn’t changed much in size, but it’s gotten… rougher. I can feel it when I’m getting dressed. It’s rather unpleasant. Honestly, it’s just… not a flattering development. I maintain a very careful skincare routine, you understand. This is quite… unexpected.
DOCTOR: Okay, so change in size and texture, particularly on your hand and neck. And you said you have a careful skincare routine. Can you tell me a little about that?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. I start with a gentle cleanser, of course. Nothing harsh. Then a vitamin C serum – very important for brightening, you know. Followed by a hyaluronic acid moisturizer. And always sunscreen. SPF 50, minimum. Even on cloudy days. I also exfoliate twice a week with a mild chemical peel. And I’ve been using a retinol cream for… oh, about six months now. Though perhaps that’s the culprit? I read something about retinol causing sensitivity. Though I haven’t experienced sensitivity exactly, just… these patches. It’s very frustrating, honestly. I take such good care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, a thorough routine. That’s good. And you’re right to wonder about the retinol. It can cause irritation, though usually it’s redness or peeling. Let’s move on to a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I have my annual check-ups, of course. And I’m up-to-date on all my vaccinations. My husband, Dimitri, is always reminding me to schedule things. He’s a bit of a worrier, you see. I do take a daily multivitamin, and a supplement for my joints. Just preventative maintenance, really. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, but that’s it. I really do prioritize my health. It’s just… this skin thing is a bit alarming, given my efforts.
DOCTOR: Okay, very healthy lifestyle, good. No known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even for a tonsillectomy as a child. I’ve been remarkably fortunate, really. A few minor illnesses, of course – the usual colds and flu – but nothing serious. I do have allergies – mostly seasonal, pollen and dust – but they’re easily managed with over-the-counter medication. And I had a rather nasty bout of chickenpox as a child, but that was decades ago. Honestly, I can’t recall a single instance of being hospitalized. Dimitri always jokes that I’m a medical marvel. Though I don’t feel like one at the moment. These patches are rather… unmarvelous.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major medical history, no surgeries. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of skin cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had a mole removed from her back, I believe. But I don’t recall it being described as… serious. Just a mole. And my uncle, Dimitri’s brother, had some sort of skin issue on his face years ago, but it was treated with topical creams, I think. Nothing requiring surgery. Honestly, neither of them were particularly forthcoming about their health. They weren’t ones for discussing such things. It’s quite possible there’s something more to the story, but I simply don’t know. It’s not a topic that was ever discussed openly in our families. Does that help at all? Or is it too vague? I hate being unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s helpful to know what you do know. Okay, possible history of mole removal and some skin issue in the family. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the supplements we already discussed?
PATIENT: No, nothing prescribed by a doctor. Just the multivitamin and the joint supplement. Occasionally, I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s infrequent. And I use a topical cream for my eczema when I have a flare-up, but that’s only as needed. It’s a mild hydrocortisone cream, over-the-counter. Honestly, that’s all. Dimitri keeps a very detailed list of my medications, just in case, but it’s usually quite short. He's very cautious. Almost excessively so, at times. But one can’t fault him for being concerned. He worries about everything. And, frankly, these patches are a bit concerning, so perhaps he’s justified this time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, I’d like to take a look at these patches. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Please, do. I’m rather eager to get to the bottom of this. I’ve been trying not to obsess over them, but it’s difficult. They’re quite noticeable, you see. Especially in this light. And I must admit, I’ve been… imagining the worst. So, please, have a look. Perhaps you can reassure me that it’s nothing serious. Or, at least, tell me what we need to do next. I trust your expertise, Doctor. Just please be gentle. My skin is rather sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m just going to examine the areas you’ve mentioned, and then I’ll feel for any enlarged lymph nodes. Okay. The patch on your hand is about 8 millimeters in diameter, slightly raised, and has irregular borders. The color is a mix of light brown and tan. On your neck, this one is roughly 10 millimeters, slightly rough to the touch, and also irregular. I don’t see any obvious signs of inflammation. Your lymph nodes don’t feel enlarged, which is good. I do want to document that the borders are irregular on both, and the texture is different than the surrounding skin. Now, to be thorough, I'd like to take a closer look with a dermatoscope, if you don't mind. It's a handheld magnifying device that allows me to see structures beneath the skin surface. It doesn't hurt at all.
PATIENT: A dermatoscope, you say? That sounds… thorough. And you said irregular borders are a concern? Oh dear. I suppose it’s better to be cautious. Very well, please proceed. I trust your judgement, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, I’m happy to comply. Though I must admit, the thought of anything… concerning… is rather unsettling. Is it likely to be something serious? I hate to ask, but I’d rather be prepared. And what does “irregular” mean, exactly? Does it look… dangerous? I apologize for being so anxious. It’s just… my skin is rather important to me.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, Ms. Bartock. It’s good that you’re taking this seriously. “Irregular” simply means the borders aren’t perfectly smooth and well-defined. Perfectly normal moles have consistent, even edges. Irregular borders, along with changes in size, shape, or color, can be signs that we need to investigate further. However, that doesn't automatically mean it is something serious. Many benign skin conditions can also have irregular borders. Alright. The dermatoscope reveals some atypical vascular patterns in both lesions, particularly on the neck. There's also some pigment network disruption. These findings warrant a biopsy to get a definitive diagnosis. It’s a simple procedure; we’ll numb the area with a local anesthetic and remove a small sample of skin tissue for examination under a microscope. It will take about a week to get the results. Do you have any questions about the biopsy procedure?
PATIENT: A biopsy… you’re saying you need to remove a piece of my skin? Oh dear. That sounds… invasive. And “atypical vascular patterns” and “pigment network disruption” don’t sound very reassuring. Is it… painful? Will it leave a scar? And a week to get the results? That sounds like an eternity. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite panicked. Is it definitely necessary? Could it be… something less serious? Perhaps just a reaction to the retinol? Or a fungal infection? I read online that fungal infections can cause skin discoloration. Perhaps it’s just a matter of applying an antifungal cream? I know I shouldn't rely on the internet, but… could we explore other options before resorting to a biopsy? I really hate the thought of having a piece of my skin removed. It feels… drastic.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Bartock. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious about a biopsy. Let me assure you, it's a relatively quick and minimally invasive procedure. We only remove a small sample – typically a few millimeters in diameter – and the area will be numbed beforehand, so you shouldn’t feel any pain during the procedure. As for whether it’s absolutely necessary, based on what I’ve seen with the dermatoscope – the atypical vascular patterns and pigment network disruption – I believe it’s the most responsible course of action. These findings are not typical of a simple retinol reaction or fungal infection. While those are possibilities, they are less likely given the visual characteristics of these lesions. We need a definitive diagnosis to rule out other, more serious conditions like melanoma. We could try a topical antifungal cream as a trial, but it won’t provide a conclusive answer, and delaying a proper diagnosis could be detrimental. The biopsy is the only way to determine with certainty what we’re dealing with. It’s a precautionary measure, but one I strongly recommend. The biopsy will be sent to a pathologist, a doctor specializing in analyzing tissue samples, who will provide us with a detailed report. Would you like me to explain the biopsy procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Alright. If you truly believe it’s necessary… then I suppose I have no choice. But please, explain everything very carefully. What exactly will happen? Will it bleed? Will I need stitches? And what if… what if it is something serious? Will I need surgery? Or… other treatments? I know I’m asking a lot of questions, but I need to be prepared. And please, be honest with me. I don’t want any surprises. And… how much will it cost? I have Medicare, of course, but I still worry about out-of-pocket expenses. I just… I need to know everything. And please, make sure it's done as gently as possible. My skin is very sensitive. And… could I bring Dimitri with me? He gets anxious when I have medical procedures, and I think it would help to have him there for support.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bartock. I understand your concerns, and I’ll explain everything as thoroughly as possible. The biopsy procedure itself is quite straightforward. First, I’ll clean the area with an antiseptic solution. Then, I’ll inject a local anesthetic – typically lidocaine – to numb the skin. You might feel a brief stinging sensation with the injection, but after that, you shouldn't feel any pain. Once the area is numb, I’ll use a small instrument – a punch biopsy tool or a scalpel – to remove a small sample of skin tissue, about 3-4 millimeters in diameter. There will be some minor bleeding, which I’ll immediately stop with pressure. Depending on the size of the sample and the location of the lesion, we might need one or two stitches to close the wound. I’ll apply a sterile bandage to protect the area, and you’ll need to keep it clean and dry for a few days. As for the possibility of it being something serious, we won’t know until we receive the pathology report. If the biopsy reveals cancerous cells, we’ll discuss the appropriate treatment options, which could include surgical excision, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, depending on the type and stage of the cancer. But let’s not jump to conclusions; the vast majority of skin lesions are benign. Regarding the cost, the biopsy is generally covered by Medicare, but there might be some out-of-pocket expenses for co-pays and deductibles. I can have our billing department provide you with a more accurate estimate. And yes, absolutely, you can bring Dimitri with you. Having a support person present is perfectly fine, and I encourage it. He’s welcome to stay with you throughout the procedure. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that does help, thank you. Knowing what to expect makes it a little less frightening. And the fact that you said most lesions are benign… that's reassuring. So, let me just clarify: I’ll feel a slight sting with the injection, then nothing at all? And the area will be numbed afterwards? And a small bandage? That sounds… manageable. And you’ll let me know as soon as you have the results? A week, you said? I’ll be anxiously waiting, of course. I suppose I should schedule a follow-up appointment for then? And, just one last question: Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the procedure? Any medications I should avoid? Or anything I should wear? And… should I apply any special creams or lotions to the area beforehand? Or leave it completely clean? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with my questions. I really appreciate it. Perhaps Dimitri and I can schedule this for next week, then? Let’s aim for… Tuesday, if possible?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bartock. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. Yes, you’ll feel a slight sting with the injection, but it’s very brief. Then the area will be completely numbed. We’ll apply a small bandage to protect the wound, and I’ll give you instructions on how to care for it. Yes, we’ll let you know as soon as we have the results – about a week, as I said. Scheduling a follow-up appointment for then is a good idea, so we can discuss the results and plan accordingly. As for preparation, there’s not much you need to do. Just avoid applying any lotions, creams, or makeup to the area on the day of the procedure. Wear comfortable clothing that allows easy access to the lesion. And if you’re taking any blood thinners – like aspirin or warfarin – please let me know, as they can increase the risk of bleeding. Tuesday next week works perfectly. Let’s schedule it for… 10:00 AM?
PATIENT: 10:00 AM sounds ideal. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you again for your patience. I feel… a little less frightened now. Dimitri will be relieved to hear it. I suppose this is it, then? Until Tuesday? I’ll see you then. And I’ll be sure to let my husband know to come with me. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Bartock, until Tuesday then. I look forward to seeing you and Dimitri. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. .
