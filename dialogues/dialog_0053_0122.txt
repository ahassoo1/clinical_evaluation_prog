DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pitmon. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, but I have been noticing…lapses. With my memory. It is concerning, as you can imagine, with my profession. I manage many properties, many people. Things must be remembered. And lately…they are not always. It started, I think, maybe six months ago? Perhaps a little longer.
DOCTOR: Six months, alright. "Lapses," you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Specific… It is not… forgetting everything. It is… small things. Like, I will go to a property to collect rent, and I forget the name of the tenant. Or I will schedule a meeting, write it down carefully, and then… simply not recall when it is. I do remember the important things, mostly. Finances, large projects…but these small details… they are becoming… troublesome. And I am…hypertensive. My doctor, before… he always monitored it.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, yes, I see that here. And you said this started about six months ago?
PATIENT: Approximately, yes. It is difficult to pinpoint the exact date. But around then, I believe. It has been…gradual. A slow…fading. It does not happen every day, but… frequently enough to cause worry. I also… sometimes repeat myself, I think. My assistant has mentioned it. I do not always notice when I do. It is… most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Right. So, not a sudden onset, more of a gradual decline in recall. And your assistant has noted some repetition. Have you noticed any difficulty with other things?
PATIENT: Other things…? Let me think. No, not… speaking, or understanding. I can still manage all my duties, though it requires more…concentration. And I have not…lost my way, or confused people. It is truly just these…small fragments of information. Names, dates, appointments…things that should be easily recalled. It is frustrating, Doctor. I pride myself on my organization and my ability to remember things. It is… very unlike me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? No, not that I have noticed. I sleep well, eat reasonably. I do not have headaches, or dizziness. No…vision changes. Just…this. This forgetting. And, as I said, I have high blood pressure. It is…controlled, mostly. I take medication. But I have not felt unwell, if that makes sense. Just… less sharp, perhaps. Not myself, as it were.
DOCTOR: Let’s review your current medications. What are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. I take… Lisinopril, twenty milligrams, once daily. And… Hydrochlorothiazide, twenty-five milligrams, also once daily. I have been on this combination for… oh, perhaps five years now? The doctor before, he adjusted the dosage a few times to get it right. I have not seen a doctor regularly since… his passing, unfortunately. It has been nearly two years.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide for five years. And you haven't had any recent blood work done to check your kidney function or electrolytes?
PATIENT: No, I have not. I…should have, I know. It is…difficult to find a doctor I trust. And, to be honest, I have been… busy. The properties require constant attention. I do not like to… bother people with routine things. I feel I should be able to manage myself. But this memory… it is concerning enough that I felt I must come.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's good you came in. Before we jump to any conclusions, we need to rule out some basic things. Sometimes, medication side effects can contribute to memory problems, and it's been a while since your kidney function was checked. We'll need some blood work. Also, given your concerns, I’d like to do a brief cognitive assessment, just to get a baseline. Nothing to worry about, just a few simple tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood work and… a cognitive assessment. I understand. Anything to determine the cause. I will gladly cooperate. I just… I hope it is not something serious. I rely on my mind, as you can appreciate.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we'll do the cognitive assessment, and I'll order the blood work. It’s a standard procedure. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Very well. I am ready when you are, Doctor. Thank you for your attention. It is…a relief to be taking this seriously, finally. Perhaps it is nothing. One can always hope.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. 148 over 82… a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear, heart sounds are normal. Any history of shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no history of either. I experience no shortness of breath, and I have never had chest pain. Though… I do get fatigued easily. But I attribute that to my age, and the demands of my work. I walk a great deal, inspecting properties. It is… strenuous, at times. Do you find these numbers…concerning?
DOCTOR: The blood pressure is a little high, but manageable. The fatigue is something to keep in mind. Now, let's do a quick cognitive assessment. It will just involve a few simple questions, and a short memory test. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… It is… August second. Yes, August second. The year… 2025. Is that correct? I… believe so. It is August second, 2025. I apologize. I usually… know these things without thinking.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's alright. Sometimes it takes a moment. Now, I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am ready. Please, say the words. I will do my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: table, penny, blue. Repeat those back to me when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Table… penny… blue. Yes. Those are… table, penny, blue. Did I say them correctly? I… feel a little foolish, repeating simple words. I am usually very… precise.
DOCTOR: You repeated them correctly. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. What city are we in?
PATIENT: What city…? Oh… That is… a good question. I… believe we are in… I know I was told… It is… a large city. With many buildings… I apologize, Doctor. I should know this. It is… on the tip of my tongue. I travel extensively, perhaps that is why I am… momentarily confused.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s alright. We’re in an urban area, that much is clear. Let’s try something else. Can you spell “world” backwards?
PATIENT: Spell “world” backwards…? D-l-r-o-w… No. That is not correct. W-o-r-l-d… backwards… I… I am having difficulty with this, Doctor. My mind feels… sluggish. I apologize. I usually… excel at these sorts of tasks. Is this… concerning?
DOCTOR: Alright. That's enough for now. It seems we have enough to go on. We'll send these bloodwork results to a neurologist for further evaluation. It's likely just age-related changes, but it's best to rule out anything more serious. I’ll order the tests now. And I’ll prescribe you a medication to help with your blood pressure, a slightly different dosage to see if it makes a difference.
PATIENT: A neurologist…? A neurologist… Is it… that serious, Doctor? You believe it could be… something more than just age? I… I am quite concerned now. I simply thought it was… stress. And perhaps, a bit of forgetfulness. What do you suspect, exactly? A different dosage… I understand. But the neurologist… please, tell me your thoughts. I am a practical woman, Doctor. I would like to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Alvara, I'm not trying to alarm you. It's standard procedure to rule out everything. There are many possible causes for memory lapses, and a neurologist is best equipped to determine the exact cause. It could be a vitamin deficiency, a minor stroke, early signs of cognitive decline… or simply age-related changes. We need to investigate. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially when dealing with your mind. I’ll get the bloodwork order and the prescription for you now. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A minor stroke… you mentioned a stroke. That… is quite frightening. I have never experienced any numbness, or difficulty speaking. My father… he had a stroke. It was… devastating. What tests will the neurologist perform? And… how long will it take to get the results? I would like to be prepared, Doctor. And… what if it is something serious? Will I still be able to manage my properties? That is… my livelihood.
DOCTOR: The neurologist will likely order an MRI of your brain to look for any signs of stroke or other abnormalities. They may also perform some cognitive tests – more in-depth than what I did – to assess your memory and thinking skills. As for how long it will take, that depends on their availability and the complexity of the tests. It could be a few weeks, possibly longer. As for managing your properties… that depends on the diagnosis. If it’s a minor issue, you’ll likely be fine. But if it’s something more serious, you may need to consider assistance. Let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll get the results, and then we’ll discuss your options. For now, let’s focus on getting the bloodwork done. I’ll have the orders printed for you now.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Bloodwork it is. I… understand. Thank you for your… honesty. I suppose I must prepare for the worst. I appreciate you ordering the tests, even if the prospect is… frightening. I will await the orders. Thank you again, Doctor. .
