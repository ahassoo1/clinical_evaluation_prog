DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Errin Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's about this…this thing I've been doing. It’s embarrassing, really. I just feel so tired all the time, and then…well, then I crave dirt. Not like a little bit, either. Real dirt. Clay, mostly. It’s ridiculous. And I don't need a long chat about it, if you don't mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss these things, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I appreciate you being so open with me. It’s certainly not ridiculous to seek medical attention for something that’s concerning you, and I assure you, I won’t dismiss your experience. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: It's just…constant. Like a weight. I used to be able to get up and do things, you know? Garden, clean, visit friends. Now? I just want to sit. And even then, I'm dragging. It doesn't matter how much sleep I get, it doesn’t help. It's been going on for months, maybe six or seven? I honestly lost track. It’s just…getting worse. And then the dirt started. Honestly, I thought I was losing my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant fatigue for six to seven months, progressively worsening, and accompanied by…a craving for dirt. Thank you for sharing that. To clarify, when you say craving, are you experiencing any physical discomfort if you don't consume dirt, or is it more of a strong urge?
PATIENT: Discomfort? No, not exactly. It's not like a headache or anything. It’s…an emptiness. A feeling like something is missing. And the dirt…it makes it go away. Just for a little while. It's not enjoyable, not exactly. It's just…relieving. And frankly, it’s disgusting, so I don’t do it when people are around. I don’t want anyone to think I’ve completely lost it. Is that making any sense? I’m not good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Hardenburgh. You’re explaining it very well. So, a craving driven by a feeling of emptiness that is temporarily relieved by consuming dirt. This is certainly unusual, and we need to explore some possible causes. To get a broader picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, not much to tell. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. A few colds, the usual aches and pains of getting old, but nothing serious. I haven’t been to a doctor in…oh, goodness, probably ten years? Maybe more. I don’t like doctors. They always want to poke and prod and give you pills. I prefer to just…deal with things. I've always been fairly independent. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, no allergies that I know of. I eat… reasonably well, I suppose. Mostly vegetables from my garden. That is, when I have the energy to garden. Is that enough? I really don’t see what any of this has to do with eating dirt.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Hardenburgh. Knowing you've been generally healthy and haven't seen a doctor in a while is important. And I understand your reluctance; we'll only do what's necessary. While it may seem unrelated, sometimes deficiencies or underlying medical conditions can manifest in unusual ways, which is why we explore all possibilities. To help me understand further, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t take anything. Pills are the devil, I tell you. I believe in letting my body heal itself. I might have a little bit of ginger tea sometimes for my stomach, but that’s it. And even that is rare. I don’t trust those fancy supplements people are always talking about. Just a waste of money, if you ask me. I get everything I need from my garden, or at least I used to. Before this…this tiredness started. Honestly, I feel like I’m explaining myself too much. Can’t we just figure out why I’m craving dirt? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: You are not explaining yourself too much at all, Ms. Hardenburgh. I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. It’s important to rule things out, and knowing you don’t take any medications or supplements is helpful. Given your symptoms – the fatigue and the craving for dirt, which we call geophagy – and the fact that you haven’t seen a doctor in some time, I’d like to do a few basic blood tests. These will help us check for things like iron deficiency, vitamin levels, and other potential imbalances that could be contributing to how you’re feeling. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Honestly. I knew it. Poke and prod. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don’t expect anything. I’m telling you, it’s probably just stress. I've been a little bit worried about my nephew lately. He's…a bit of a mess. But really, I doubt it's anything serious. Just do the tests and tell me it's nothing. And hurry up, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. We'll get this done as quickly and comfortably as possible. It will just be a standard blood draw. Before we proceed, and just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, I’ve been a little bit breathless lately, just walking up the stairs. And my hands feel cold all the time, even when it's warm. Oh, and I’ve been…a little bit forgetful, I suppose. But who isn’t forgetful at my age? It’s probably just old age. Honestly, I don’t think any of this is connected. It’s just…things. Old age things. Can we please just get on with it? I’m getting impatient.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathlessness with exertion, cold hands, and some forgetfulness. Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Hardenburgh. These are all important details. Before we proceed with the blood draw, I'd like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I told you, I don’t like doctors. It's always something. Poke, prod, listen… Honestly, I should have just stayed home and eaten some dirt. It would have been more productive. But alright. Do what you need to do. Just…be gentle. My veins aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I understand your reluctance, and I'll work quickly and efficiently. Your blood pressure is a little bit elevated, 145/90. And I'm hearing a slightly rapid heartbeat, and a little bit of congestion in your lungs. Nothing alarming at this point, but it’s good to be aware of it. Now, let's get the blood draw done. We'll need to collect a few vials. Please relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Hurry up, please. This is dreadful. I hate needles. And don't poke me too much. I bruise easily. Honestly, I don’t understand why you need so much blood. It’s just a few vials, right? Not the whole thing. You doctors always exaggerate. Just…get it over with. And be careful!
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Hardenburgh. I will be as quick and efficient as possible. We only need a few small vials, and I'll use a small gauge needle to minimize discomfort. Just a little pinch…and we’re almost done. Please try to relax your arm. This will help me get the samples quickly and accurately. Alright, we’re all finished. Please keep pressure on this site for a few minutes to prevent bruising. I'll put a bandage on it for you. These samples will be sent to the lab for analysis. It usually takes a few days to get the results. I will call you as soon as they are available to discuss them with you. In the meantime, if you experience any excessive bleeding or pain at the site, please don't hesitate to call the clinic.
PATIENT: Finally. That was dreadful. Honestly, I feel faint. Alright. Just call me when you have the results. And don’t bother me with anything unnecessary. If it’s serious, you’ll call. If it’s not, I don’t want to hear about it. I have things to do, you know. And please, don’t expect me to come back for another visit unless it’s absolutely necessary. I’ve had quite enough of doctors for one day. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hardenburgh. We'll only contact you with the results, and we'll respect your time and wishes. I'll make a note on your chart to only contact you with important findings. Please take it easy today, and if you feel faint or unwell, please don't hesitate to call. Here's a bandage for your arm, and some gauze in case of any bleeding. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good day, Ms. Hardenburgh.
