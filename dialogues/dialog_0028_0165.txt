DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Brege, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Clide. Look, Doc, I got things to do today, so if we could just get this sorted out, that'd be great. This fever keeps comin' back, and it's a pain.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we all have things to do. A recurring fever… alright. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… let me think. It started… probably around, oh, late March, early April? It’ll go away for a week or two, then BAM, it’s back. Happens every month or so, give or take. I can't really pinpoint it, I just know when it's comin' back. Feels like the flu, but not as bad, ya know? No cough, just… hot. And tired.
DOCTOR: Right. And when you say “hot,” what temperature are we talking about?
PATIENT: Temperature… honestly? I don't keep track. I don't have one of those fancy thermometers. I just feel warm, then kinda shaky, then really hot, then… well, you get the idea. I usually just take some Tylenol and lie down until it passes. Maybe 101, 102 when it’s really bad? But I'm guessin' here, Doc. It ain’t like I’m writin' it down or somethin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the fever and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Now that you mention it, my joints ache a little when the fever hits. Mostly my knees and wrists. Not terrible, but enough to know somethin's off. And I've been sweatier than usual, even when I don't have a fever. Like, I change my shirt twice a day sometimes, which is new. Otherwise, I feel...normal. Old, but normal. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Sweaty… joints… Yes, alright. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Nah, I eat pretty much the same as always. Maybe a little less when I’m feelin’ sick, but nothin’ major. My wife, Elena, she's always tellin' me to eat more anyway. She worries. I like to eat, Doc. Good Puerto Rican food, you know? I ain't losin' my appetite for that. Though, I do drink more water when the fever’s around, gotta stay hydrated, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, hydration is important. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven’t left the state in, oh, must be ten years. Just go to church, the grocery store, visit the grandkids… nothin’ exciting. Elena does all the travelin', goes to see her sister in Florida a couple times a year. Me? I'm a homebody. Don’t have the patience for airports, you know? Plus, the grandkids keep me busy enough. This fever's just...a nuisance. It's not like I went to the jungle or somethin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Just the Tylenol when the fever gets bad, like I said. And a little something for my blood pressure, a small pill, but that’s it. The doctor gave it to me a few years back, said it was just a precaution. I don't really pay attention to the name, Elena handles the refills. I’m not much of a pill person, to be honest. Try to stay away from 'em as much as possible. This fever's got me worried, but I don't want to start takin' a whole bunch of stuff I don't need.
DOCTOR: Right. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of stuff over the years, never had a reaction. My wife always asks when the doctor prescribes somethin', but I've never had to tell ‘em anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. She’s the one with all the allergies, poor thing. Has to carry an EpiPen everywhere. But me? Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better sense of things. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Just gettin’ old, Doc, that’s all. Standin’ up ain’t as easy as it used to be. There. How’s that? Not bad for 65, huh? Though I ache a little in my knees today… must be the weather.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and another… Okay. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let me check your lymph nodes. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Nope, don’t feel anything special there. Just skin, I guess. I don't usually notice much, Doc. I'm not a doctor! Is somethin' wrong? You're lookin' kinda serious all of a sudden. Just tell me straight, okay? I ain’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is soft. Now, let me check your temperature, just to get a baseline. 99.8. Mildly elevated. And your blood pressure is… 142 over 88. Slightly high, but consistent with your medication.
PATIENT: Okay. So… what does all that mean, Doc? Is it somethin' serious? I'm gettin' a little worried now. My wife is gonna kill me if I come home sick again. She wants me to help her with the garden this weekend, and I promised the grandkids a trip to the park… Tell me straight, Doc. Don’t beat around the bush. Is it somethin' I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, it’s difficult to say definitively. The recurring fever, fatigue, and joint aches could be a number of things. Viral infection is possible, but the persistence suggests we need to investigate further. Your blood pressure is something to keep an eye on as well. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – to rule out anything serious. It’s probably nothing, but it’s best to be sure.
PATIENT: Blood work… Okay. Fine. When do I gotta do that? And how long's that gonna take? I really don't wanna spend all day in a doctor's office. And can I still help Elena with the garden this weekend? She's gonna be mad if I don’t. Look, Doc, I appreciate you lookin’ into it, but I gotta get back to life. Tell me what I need to do, and let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: The lab is down the hall, first door on the right. It should take less than an hour. Avoid strenuous activity until we have the results. I wouldn’t recommend heavy gardening, just to be safe. Once the results are in – approximately 48-72 hours – my nurse will call you with the results, and we can schedule a follow-up if needed. Here’s the lab requisition. And frankly, Mr. Brege, I'm quite busy, so please refrain from calling my office directly unless instructed by my nurse. Do you have any other questions?
