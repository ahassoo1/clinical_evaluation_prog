DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mrs. Shaub. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be quite frank, I asked to come in for an HIV test. I just… I wanted to get checked, you know? It's been on my mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Shaub. That's a very sensible thing to do. It's always best to be proactive about your health. And you’re right to get it checked if it’s been on your mind. Before we proceed with the test, could you tell me a little bit about why you decided to get tested now?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my husband and I… we’ve been together a long time, of course. But recently, a… a friend of a friend mentioned something. It just made me think. And honestly, I haven’t been tested in… well, a very long time. It’s just a good time to be sure, I suppose. There’s no particular reason beyond that, really. I just want peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mrs. Shaub. Sometimes a little nudge is all it takes to prompt us to take care of things. Peace of mind is a perfectly good reason. To help me understand a bit better, and just to be thorough, have either you or your husband had any… recent changes in partners, or any concerns about potential exposures?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. We’ve been… faithful to each other, always. No changes in partners at all. And no concerns, thankfully. As I said, it’s not anything specific. It’s more… preventative. I just feel better knowing, you know? It's difficult to explain, really. Just a sense of… wanting to be certain. And with my age, one always wants to be careful, doesn't one?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to think that way, Mrs. Shaub. Being proactive is always best, and it’s wise to consider all factors with age. Now, just to cover all the bases, have you ever received a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question… Let me see. I… I don't believe so. Not that I recall, anyway. I had a rather difficult childbirth with my daughter, many years ago, but I don't think they needed to give me a transfusion. It was a long time ago, Doctor. And my memory isn't what it used to be. But I'm fairly certain I haven’t. Why do you ask?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mrs. Shaub. It's just standard procedure, a precaution to make sure we have a complete picture. Transfusions used to carry some risk, although that’s much less common now. Now, regarding your general health… do you have any medical conditions that you’re currently being treated for, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. I'm quite healthy for my age, I believe. I watch what I eat, and I try to stay active. A bit of gardening keeps me busy. My blood pressure is usually fine when they check it at the pharmacy, and I haven't been diagnosed with diabetes, no. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose! Though my knees do bother me sometimes… but I wouldn't call that a medical condition, would I?
DOCTOR: Gardening is excellent exercise! And aches and pains certainly come with age - I understand completely. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. And I assure you, my husband and I have been… very careful throughout our marriage. That’s… that’s always been important to us. It's a little… personal to discuss, I must admit, but no. Never any STIs, to my knowledge. I apologize if that sounds… blunt.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mrs. Shaub. It's perfectly alright. You have no need to apologize. It’s important to be open, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It simply helps me get a clearer understanding of your overall health. Now, before we proceed with the test, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, I take a multivitamin, of course. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. Just the over-the-counter kind, nothing prescribed. And occasionally, a bit of ginger tea for my stomach. That’s it, really. No regular medications, Doctor. Just those few things as needed. I try to avoid pills whenever possible.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mrs. Shaub. Multivitamins and ibuprofen are very common. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything without issue. My husband always jokes I have a cast iron stomach. I’ve never had a problem with any medication either. No allergies, as far as I know. It's fortunate, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That is fortunate, Mrs. Shaub. Alright, so, no known allergies, no regular medications, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Now, we can proceed with the HIV test. It involves a simple blood draw. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly comfortable. I’ve had blood draws before, so I’m not afraid. I just… I just want to get it done and have peace of mind, you know? Let’s go ahead with it, please. The sooner it’s over, the better. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mrs. Shaub. That's the spirit. Alright, let me just quickly wash my hands, and then we'll get the blood draw done. It'll only take a few minutes. Now, if you could just relax your arm for me…
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Shaub, you might feel a small pinch. Just try to relax your arm… Alright, Mrs. Shaub, all done. Just keep pressure on this site for a few minutes, and try to avoid lifting anything heavy with that arm for the rest of the day. The results should be back in about a week. We'll call you as soon as they're available. Do you have a preferred phone number?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That wasn’t too bad. Yes, my number is 555-123-4567. Please do call me as soon as you have the results. I’m anxious to hear back, naturally. And thank you again for being so thorough and kind. It really puts me at ease. Is there anything else I need to do, or be aware of?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Shaub. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Just keep that bandage on for a few hours, and avoid strenuous activity with that arm. If you experience any excessive bleeding, swelling, or signs of infection, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Other than that, just try to rest and take it easy. Here are those instructions, just in case. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mrs. Shaub?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve answered everything I’ve been wondering about. I truly appreciate your patience and kindness. It means a lot to me. I’ll just… wait for the phone call then. Thank you again for everything. Have a good day, Doctor Smetak.
DOCTOR: You too, Mrs. Shaub. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. We'll be in touch soon. .
