DOCTOR: Good morning, Yamir. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Just... fitness check. For... referee. I need paper say I okay. Want to be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A fitness-for-duty exam for refereeing. I understand wanting to keep this efficient. To start, can you tell me a little more about the requirements?
PATIENT: Requirements? Uh... they just want check heart... and maybe I run a little. Not so much. Just... not old man run. They want make sure I can keep up. I don't know details. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Yamir. We can certainly do a basic cardiovascular assessment and a brief physical ability check. To get a better picture, let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Uh... not really. I had... flu, many times. And... back pain. Sometimes. From work. Lifting things. But no doctor say anything bad. Wife... she took care of me. She knew what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no formally diagnosed medical conditions. And the back pain is related to lifting at work, managed by your wife. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgery. No hospital. Never. Just… regular check up. When wife… when she was still here.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm... my father... he had high blood pressure. Took pills. And my mother... she had... I don't remember exactly. Something with her stomach. She passed away long time ago. No cancer, I think. Wife's family... healthy people.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension in your father and a stomach issue in your mother. And your wife's family was generally healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. No problem. I take… sometimes, pain killer for back. Ibuprofen. But only when really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just ibuprofen for back pain when needed. And you mentioned you eat a normal diet. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No smoke. No drugs. Maybe… sometimes I drink beer. With friends. Not much. One or two. Not every week.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional beer consumption. That's helpful to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and we'll do a very brief assessment of your range of motion. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Quick is good. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please have a seat here. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, if you could just stand up for me, we’ll do a quick check of your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ugh… Not so good. Back pain a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited forward flexion with some discomfort. Can you try twisting to each side?
PATIENT: A little… painful. Not much. But… tight. Like old machine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the exam, you have some limited range of motion and discomfort in your lower back. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your blood pressure is within normal limits. I'm a bit concerned about your back pain, especially with the limited range of motion. To be thorough, I’d like to order some basic blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel, just to rule out any underlying inflammation or other issues. And an X-ray of your lower back would be helpful to assess the bony structures. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… X-ray… More time. I just need paper for referee. Is X-ray really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the time commitment, Yamir. And I appreciate you wanting to expedite this process. However, given the limitations in your range of motion and your reported pain, I feel it’s important to rule out any structural issues with your back, like a slipped disc or arthritis. The X-ray will provide valuable information. If you’re hesitant about the X-ray, we could proceed without it, and I can write a note stating that you've had a basic physical exam with normal heart and lung sounds and within-normal blood pressure. However, I would strongly recommend the X-ray to ensure there isn’t anything more serious going on. It’s better to be safe and have a complete picture before clearing you for strenuous activity. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Ugh… okay, fine. X-ray. But… can we do it quickly? I have things to do. And… can you just tell me if I can referee or not, after? No more tests. Please?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Yamir. I understand your frustration and desire to get this resolved quickly. We'll schedule the X-ray as soon as possible. I’ll order it now, and the technician will contact you to arrange a time. Once we have the results, I will review them and let you know if you are cleared to referee. I’ll do my best to expedite the process. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that exacerbates your back pain. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Just… do it quickly. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll have my assistant schedule the X-ray for you before you leave. They’ll also give you some instructions on how to prepare. Thank you for coming in today, Yamir. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
