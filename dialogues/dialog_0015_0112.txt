DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit awkward to talk about, truthfully. I’ve been having to go to the restroom quite often lately. More than usual, certainly. It’s been… a few weeks, I think? It’s hard to say exactly. I don’t really keep track.
DOCTOR: “Quite often” is rather vague, Ms. MacVittie. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, you’re right. I apologize. Let me see… I’d say, on average, every hour or two during the day. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but rarely going more than three hours without needing to go. It’s… disruptive, to say the least. And I don’t recall this being a problem before. I really don’t.
DOCTOR: And is it… a normal amount when you do go, or is it a smaller quantity, more frequent small trips?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It’s… normal, I believe. The amount is normal, if that makes sense. It’s just how often I’m needing to go is the issue. Not little trips, thankfully. Full… regular amounts, you know? It’s just… inconvenient. And a little worrying, because I can’t quite place when it started. My memory isn’t what it used to be, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: "Not what it used to be," Ms. MacVittie. Right. Well, let’s try to gather some more information. Have you noticed any burning or pain with urination?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning, not anything like that. It's… just the frequency. It feels… normal while I’m actually going, if that makes sense. Like there isn’t anything wrong during, it’s just the constant need to go. It’s unsettling, more than painful.
DOCTOR: And any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. That’s a tricky one. I haven’t… deliberately been looking, I suppose. It looks normal, as far as I can tell. The usual color, no blood or anything alarming. But honestly, I can’t say I’ve paid close attention. I feel rather silly trying to recall the specifics of my… urine. Is that a normal question? I apologize, Doctor, I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: It's a necessary question, Ms. MacVittie. It helps rule out potential issues. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain accompanying this increased urination?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or abdominal pain. Everything else feels… normal, truthfully. That’s what’s so frustrating about this! I feel fine, except for needing to go to the restroom constantly. It's quite disruptive, particularly when I'm out and about. I'm a concierge, you see, and that can involve quite a bit of walking. It’s… difficult to explain. It's just… unsettling. I really haven't felt sick otherwise.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to some other questions then. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications at all. Not regularly, anyway. I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. And I rarely even get headaches. No supplements, no vitamins… nothing like that. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly. I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of, either. I really try to avoid anything that might cause a reaction.
DOCTOR: And have there been any recent changes in your diet or fluid intake?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really, I don’t think so. I’ve been trying to drink more water lately, actually, because it's been so warm. But that's the only change. I haven’t started drinking anything new or anything like that. I still drink my usual tea in the mornings, and… well, that’s about it. I haven’t changed my eating habits, not significantly. I eat a lot of fish, I suppose, being Portuguese. But that's been the same for years. Honestly, I’m at a loss. Everything feels… normal, except for this.
DOCTOR: Ms. MacVittie, you said you've been trying to drink more water. How much more water are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh dear. You’re right to ask. I… I hadn't thought about it, really. I suppose I've been drinking… significantly more. Before, I might have had a glass or two a day. Now? I’ve been trying to finish a whole water bottle – a large one, about a liter – by lunchtime. And another in the afternoon. I just read somewhere that it’s good for you, and I thought it might help. Could that… could that be it? Oh, I feel rather foolish now. I hadn't even considered that. I apologize, Doctor. It's all rather muddled in my head.
DOCTOR: A liter in the afternoon and a liter before lunch?
PATIENT: Yes. Oh dear. That does sound… excessive, doesn’t it? I just thought… well, I thought more water was always better. I read something about flushing out toxins, and… well, I suppose I got carried away. It's embarrassing to admit. I really didn't think it could be the cause of all this. Could simply drinking too much water cause me to go to the restroom so often? I feel terribly silly now. And rather dehydrated, to be honest, with all this… going. I apologize, Doctor. I’m clearly not very good at this. Is there anything else I should be telling you? Perhaps I should just… stop drinking so much water?
DOCTOR: Ms. MacVittie, you are drinking an excessive amount of water. While hydration is important, overconsumption can lead to frequent urination. This is likely the primary cause of your symptoms. It’s not a medical condition, but a behavioral adjustment you need to make. I recommend reducing your water intake to a more reasonable level – perhaps 1.5 to 2 liters total per day. We can discuss a more specific plan if you find it difficult to reduce on your own. However, I don't believe further testing is necessary at this time. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, goodness. That… that makes a lot of sense, actually. I feel rather foolish, to be honest. I was trying to be healthy, and I completely overdid it. Reducing my intake… yes, I can do that. 1.5 to 2 liters… that seems much more reasonable. Yes, I understand perfectly. So… it’s not anything serious? Just a matter of drinking less water? That’s… tremendously reassuring. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. I apologize for wasting your time with all this… needless worry. I feel much better knowing it’s something I can control. And yes, perhaps a more specific plan would be helpful, if you don’t mind. I clearly have trouble with moderation.
DOCTOR: It was not a waste of time. It’s my job to assess and advise. We’ll start with a goal of no more than 2 liters per day, and monitor your symptoms for the next week. If you’re still experiencing frequent urination, we can reassess. I’ll write a note for you outlining this plan. Avoid caffeinated beverages, as they can also contribute to increased urination. And ensure adequate electrolyte intake, especially if you reduce your water consumption significantly. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been wonderfully clear. 2 liters a day, avoid caffeine, and watch my electrolytes… yes, I can do that. Thank you again, Doctor Trestrail. You’ve put my mind at ease. I feel quite foolish, but also… relieved. It’s good to know it’s something so simple. I'll be sure to follow your advice. And thank you for your patience. Truly. I think… I think that’s all. Is there anything I need to do before I leave? Any forms to fill out?
DOCTOR: No, no forms. I’ll have the nurse print out the plan for you. Just remember to be mindful of your fluid intake. And Ms. MacVittie, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any other concerning symptoms – fever, pain, changes in urine color – contact the office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. No more than two liters, avoid caffeine, watch my electrolytes, and contact the office if anything worsens. I will. Thank you again for everything. You've been incredibly helpful. Have a good day, Doctor Trestrail.
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. MacVittie.
