DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Lahn, you say? Yes, yes. Clinic is… clean. I just… moved here. From… somewhere. Old doctor… not so good. Medicare, you know? Just need to… check things. Old man things. Not much to it, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. New to the area, switching doctors, and just wanting a general check-up. That's perfectly fine, Mr. Szmyd. "Old man things" can mean a lot of different things, so let’s try to narrow it down a bit. Could you tell me a little more specifically what's been bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering? Hmm. Nothing really bothering. Just… feeling it. You know? Like… things slowing down. And the back. Always the back. Used to be able to… lift things. Big things! For the theater. Now? Forget about it. Not a big deal. It’s just… old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some general slowing down and back pain, especially noticing it compared to what you used to be able to do. The theater, you said?
PATIENT: Yes! Makeup. For the theater. Big shows. Used to travel… everywhere. Now… mostly just sit. Remember? I think I remember. It was a long time ago. Fancy costumes, you know? And the faces… beautiful faces. I made them beautifuler.
DOCTOR: That sounds wonderful, Mr. Szmyd. It's good you have those memories. So, the back pain... is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Mostly when I… move. Or try to. Bending… bad. Lifting… worse. Sitting is okay. For a while. Then it… aches. Not a sharp ache, you understand? More of a… dull thing. Like a… a tired muscle. It’s always been there, a little. Just… more now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's an ache that comes and goes, worse with bending and lifting, and a bit more noticeable lately. Do you notice anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Better? Hmm. Sitting. Usually. And… lying down. Quiet. No moving. That’s good. And… sometimes. Sometimes the wife… ex-wife… used to rub it. Not anymore, of course. Long time ago. Doesn't matter now. Still, used to help. A little.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting and lying down help, and you mentioned rubbing it used to provide some relief. Now, besides the back pain and the general slowing down, are you experiencing any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… the knees. A little creaky. Like… old doors. Not bad pain. Just… when I go up stairs. Or down. Makes a noise. And… the hands. A little stiff in the mornings. Used to be quick. Very quick. Now? Not so much. Old man things, I tell you. All old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some creaking in the knees, especially with stairs, and stiffness in the hands in the mornings. Now, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? Tingling? Hmm. Maybe. Sometimes. In the fingers. Not all the time. When it’s… cold. Or when I… hold something for too long. Like… a brush. For the makeup. It gets… funny. Hard to feel. Doesn't last long. Just… goes away. I forget about it. Old man things.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent numbness in your fingers, especially when it's cold or when holding something for a while. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Chronic… what? High… what? Look, I went to a doctor, yes. A long time ago. For… things. But they just gave me pills. Little white pills. And told me to… sit less. And… eat better. I don’t remember what for. And I forgot to ask what the pills were for. Old man things, you know? I don't keep track of these things. Not anymore. Just took the pills. They didn't do much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It's common to forget those details over time. We can try to figure some things out. Do you remember any of the names of those pills?
PATIENT: Pills? Little… white. Small. Round. That's all I remember. Maybe… one had a line on it? Very faint line. No… I think it was just white. And small. Useless pills, really. Don't worry about the pills. They didn't do anything. I just… stopped taking them. A long time ago. No use bothering with things you don't remember. Old man things, you know? Everything fades.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll make a note of that. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Hmm. Once. A long time ago. When I was… young. Stupid accident. Fell off a ladder. For the theater, of course. Big show. Had to fix a light. Broke my… arm, I think. They put it in a… cast. White cast. Very itchy. Didn't like the hospital. Smelled funny. And the food… terrible. That’s all I remember. One time. A long time ago. Old man things. Everything gets blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm from a fall when you were younger, requiring a cast. Do you remember approximately when that happened?
PATIENT: When? Oh, dear. Before… the wife. Ex-wife, you know? Definitely before her. A long time. Maybe… the seventies? Or… the eighties? I don't keep track of years. Everything just… happened. Long time ago. Very long time. Old man things. The years… they all blend together. Don’t bother with the years. It doesn’t matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately the seventies or eighties. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Family? Mother… she… she was sick. A long time ago. Something with the… breathing. Had to stay in bed a lot. Always coughing. They took her to the… hospital, yes. And… she didn't come back. Father… strong man. Always working. Never sick. As far as I know. No… nothing runs in the family. Not that I remember. Old man things. Lost touch with everyone, you know? It was a long time ago. Doesn't matter now.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had breathing problems and passed away, and your father was generally healthy. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never! Never smoked in my life. Disgusting habit. Always smelled terrible. And… bad for the complexion. Can’t stand it. No, never smoked. And I don’t like being around people who do. Makes my eyes water. Old man things, you know? Sensitive eyes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes. A little glass of wine. With dinner. Very small glass. Nothing fancy. Red wine. For the… the stomach, you know? And… sometimes a little vodka. With friends. Long time ago. Nothing much. Don’t drink much anymore. Old man things. Not good for the… everything. Makes me sleepy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not anymore. Like I said, stopped taking the pills. Long time ago. No vitamins. No… nothing. Don't believe in them. Just… sit and rest. That's what I do. Old man things, you know? Everything aches. Pills won’t help. Don’t bother with pills. They are useless.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints and range of motion. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. I suppose. If you must. But be gentle. Everything aches, you know? Old man things. Don't want to break anything. Very delicate. Hurry up, though. Don't have all day. Old man things, you know. Gets tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? Is that bad? Everything is bad, you know. Old man things. Lungs are… old. Used to be strong. For the theater. Now? Not so much. Careful with that… listening thing. Makes me nervous. Old man things. Everything hurts.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. And I can hear some slight crackling in your lungs when you breathe, which could be from a little congestion. Now, I'd like to check your joints, if that’s alright. I'll gently move your arms and legs to see your range of motion. Can you please try to bend your arms for me?
PATIENT: Bend? Oh, dear. That's going to hurt. Everything hurts. See? Limited. Very limited. Used to be able to lift… big things. For the theater. Now? Forget about it. Old man things. Don't push it. Delicate. Very delicate. Hurts, you know? Everything hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There is some stiffness and limited range of motion in both your shoulders and elbows, and it seems to cause you discomfort. Now let's check your knees. Can you try bending each knee for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Knees? Oh, dear Lord. That's going to be worse. Everything hurts. There! Hear that? Like an old door. That's what I mean. Everything creaks. Used to be able to… run. For the theater. Now? Forget about it. Hurts, you know? Everything hurts. Old man things. Don't push it. Very delicate. I'll fall, you know? Very delicate.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There’s definitely some creaking and limited range of motion in your knees, and I can see you’re in discomfort. That’s enough for now, Mr. Szmyd. You're right, we don't want to push anything and risk causing you more pain. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing age-related joint stiffness and some early signs of arthritis, likely osteoarthritis. The crackling sound in your lungs could be a sign of mild congestion, possibly related to a recent cold or allergies. The elevated blood pressure is something we will also want to keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Arthritis? Arthritis? What does that mean? Is that… bad? Everything is bad, you know. Old man things. I'll fall, you know? Everything is falling apart. And what about the blood pressure? Is that falling apart too? Everything is falling apart. What are we going to do? Just… sit and wait to fall apart?
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, it’s understandable to be worried. Arthritis simply means inflammation in your joints, which can cause pain and stiffness. It's very common as we age, and while there's no cure, there are many things we can do to manage the pain and slow down the progression. And your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that's also manageable with lifestyle changes, and potentially medication if needed. It doesn't mean you're falling apart! It just means we need to be proactive about your health. I’d like to order a few simple blood tests to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. We can also get some X-rays of your knees and hips to see the extent of the arthritis. Then, we can discuss a treatment plan. This might include physical therapy to strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and lifestyle changes like maintaining a healthy weight and staying active. We can also talk about strategies for fall prevention. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Oh, dear. Everything is falling apart. And now you want to poke and prod more? Fine. Do whatever you must. But don't expect much. Old man things, you know? Everything is tired. Fall prevention? What's the point? I'll fall anyway. Everything falls eventually. But… what about the pain? Can you do something about the pain? That's all I want. Just… less pain. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Szmyd, that's not too much to ask at all. Reducing your pain is our primary goal. The tests will just help us understand the best way to do that. I'll write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever to start with. It’s not a strong medication, but it might take the edge off while we wait for the test results. We can also discuss other options, like topical creams or injections, if needed. I'm also going to give you a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in arthritis. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion, which will also help reduce your pain. And I'll give you some information on fall prevention strategies. We’ll start with these steps and see how you feel. We can always adjust the treatment plan as needed. Remember, you're not alone in this. We’ll work together to manage your pain and improve your quality of life. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions? Oh, dear. More things to remember. Physical… what? And injections? No, no injections. Don’t like needles. Everything hurts enough. Will it take long? The physical… therapy? I don’t have much energy. Old man things, you know? Gets tiring. And the pain… will it really get better? That’s all I want. Just… less pain. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, injections aren’t mandatory at all. We can explore other options if you’re uncomfortable with them. And physical therapy doesn’t have to be strenuous. It will start with gentle exercises designed to improve your strength and flexibility. The therapist will work with you to create a plan that’s comfortable for your energy level. As for whether the pain will get better, it’s hard to say definitively. But many people with arthritis experience significant pain relief with treatment. It may not disappear completely, but we can certainly work to manage it and improve your quality of life. I'm going to schedule you a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the test results and see how you're doing. In the meantime, try to stay as active as you can, even if it’s just a gentle walk each day. And remember, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s a number for the clinic. And please, take things one step at a time. We’ll get through this together. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: One step at a time… Easier said than done. Everything is falling apart, you know? But… thank you. For trying. I suppose that’s all. Just… less pain. That’s all I want. Thank you. I’ll… see you in two weeks. If I’m still… here.
DOCTOR: You take care, Mr. Szmyd. And don’t hesitate to call if you need anything before then. We'll see you in two weeks, and we’ll work together to make things a little easier. .
PATIENT: .
